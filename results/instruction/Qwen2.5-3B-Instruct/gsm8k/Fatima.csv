"First, let's determine how many eggs Janet has left after eating and baking.

Janet starts with 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and bakes 4 eggs. So, the number of eggs left for the farmers' market is:

\[ 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 \]

Janet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg. Therefore, the total amount she makes every day is:

\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

18"
"To solve this, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber required and then add it to the amount of blue fiber.

Given:
- The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.
- The robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber.

First, calculate the amount of white fiber:
- White fiber = 2 bolts (blue fiber) / 2 = 1 bolt.

Now, add the blue and white fiber together to find the total:
- Total bolts = 2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts.

Therefore, the total number of bolts required is 3."
"First, let's calculate the increase in the value of the house due to the repairs. The original value of the house is $80,000. The repairs increased the value by 150%. To find the increase in value, we calculate 150% of $80,000:

\[ \text{Increase in value} = 80,000 \times \frac{150}{100} = 80,000 \times 1.5 = 120,000 \]

So, the total value of the house after the repairs is:

\[ \text{Total value after repairs} = 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Josh spent $50,000 on repairs, and the house was originally worth $80,000. Therefore, the total cost for Josh to buy and repair the house is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value of the house after repairs:

\[ \text{Profit} = 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 70,000 \]"
"James runs 3 sprints each day, and each sprint is 60 meters. Therefore, in one day, he runs:

\[ 3 \text{ sprints/day} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 180 \text{ meters/day} \]

Since he runs 3 times a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:

\[ 180 \text{ meters/day} \times 3 \text{ days/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 540."
"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she gives her flock in the morning and afternoon.

Wendi gives her flock 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. Therefore, the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
\[ 15 + 25 = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Since Wendi has a flock of 20 chickens and she feeds each chicken three cups of feed per day, the total amount of feed needed for the entire flock is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed in the final meal, we subtract the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total amount of feed needed for the day:
\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Thus, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:
\[ 20 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"
"To calculate the total cost for 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure. The first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.

For every set of two glasses, the cost is $5 + $3 = $8.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can divide the total number of glasses by 2 to find out how many sets of two glasses there are: 16 / 2 = 8 sets.

Now, we multiply the cost of one set by the number of sets: 8 sets * $8/set = $64.

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Seattle's Sheep**: We are given that Seattle has 20 sheep.
   \[
   \text{Sheep in Seattle} = 20
   \]

2. **Charleston's Sheep**: Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   \[
   \text{Sheep in Charleston} = 4 \times \text{Sheep in Seattle} = 4 \times 20 = 80
   \]

3. **Toulouse's Sheep**: Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   \[
   \text{Sheep in Toulouse} = 2 \times \text{Sheep in Charleston} = 2 \times 80 = 160
   \]

4. **Total Sheep**: To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we add the number of sheep in each city.
   \[
   \text{Total Sheep} = \text{Sheep in Seattle} + \text{Sheep in Charleston} + \text{Sheep in Toulouse} = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260
   \]

Therefore, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is 260."
"To determine the total time Carla spends downloading the 200 GB file, we need to break down the process into parts and calculate the time for each part.

1. **First 40% of the download:**
   - The file size is 200 GB.
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 0.40 \times 200 = 80 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) minutes.

2. **Windows update installation:**
   - This takes 20 minutes.

3. **Restarting the download:**
   - After the update, Carla has to start the download from the beginning.
   - The remaining 60% of the file is \( 0.60 \times 200 = 120 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 120 GB is \( \frac{120}{2} = 60 \) minutes.

Now, we sum up the time for each part:
- Time for the first 40% download: 40 minutes
- Time for the Windows update installation: 20 minutes
- Time for the restart and download of the remaining 60%: 60 minutes

Total time = \( 40 + 20 + 60 = 120 \) minutes.

The final numerical answer is 120 minutes."
"First, let's calculate the distance John traveled during the initial 3 hours at 60 mph:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during this time.

Then, he drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph:
\[ \text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]

After that, he drives for the remaining time at 80 mph. The total time spent driving is 4 hours, and he already spent 3.5 hours (3 hours + 0.5 hours), so the remaining time is:
\[ 4 \, \text{hours} - 3.5 \, \text{hours} = 0.5 \, \text{hours} \]

The distance covered during the last 0.5 hours at 80 mph is:
\[ \text{Distance} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 40 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, let's add up all the distances:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 180 \, \text{miles} + 15 \, \text{miles} + 40 \, \text{miles} = 235 \, \text{miles} \]

Since John started 180 miles away from home, the distance he is from home at the end of those 4 hours is:
\[ \text{Distance from home} = 235 \, \text{miles} - 180 \, \text{miles} = 55 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 55 \]"
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break it down into regular hours and overtime hours.

Eliza's regular rate is $10 per hour. For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
\[ 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \]

For the overtime hours, she works 5 hours over the regular 40 hours. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate:
\[ 1.2 \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$12/\text{hour} \]

Her earnings for the overtime hours are:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

Adding the earnings from regular hours and overtime hours gives her total earnings for the week:
\[ \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \]

So, Eliza's earnings for this week are:
\[ \$460 \]"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, let's calculate the number of downloads for each month:

1. **First Month:** The program had 60 downloads.
2. **Second Month:** The number of downloads was three times the first month, so:
   \[
   60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ downloads}
   \]
3. **Third Month:** The number of downloads was reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we calculate:
   \[
   180 \times 0.30 = 54 \text{ downloads}
   \]
   Therefore, the number of downloads in the third month is:
   \[
   180 - 54 = 126 \text{ downloads}
   \]

Now, to find the total number of downloads over the three months, we sum the downloads from each month:
\[
60 + 180 + 126 = 366
\]

The total number of downloads over the three months is **366**."

- Mini cupcakes: 2 dozen at $80 per dozen
  \[
  2 \times 80 = 160
  \]
- Mini cheesecakes: 6 dozen at $55 per dozen
  \[
  6 \times 55 = 330
  \]

Now, let's add up the total cost:
\[
204 + 160 + 330 = 694
\]

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money from the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point at which the profit becomes positive.

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:
- Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons.
- Each lemon is sold for $1.5.
- Therefore, the annual revenue from lemons is \(7 \times 1.5 = 10.5\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the annual cost of watering and feeding the tree:
- The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.

Now, we can find the net profit each year by subtracting the annual cost from the annual revenue:
- Net profit per year = Annual revenue - Annual cost
- Net profit per year = \(10.5 - 3 = 7.5\) dollars.

Carlos initially invests $90 to plant the tree. We need to determine how many years it will take for the net profit to cover this initial investment.

Let \(n\) be the number of years it takes to start earning money. The total profit after \(n\) years is:
- Total profit after \(n\) years = Net profit per year \(\times n\)
- Total profit after \(n\) years = \(7.5n\)

We need the total profit to be at least equal to the initial investment:
- \(7.5n \geq 90\)

Solving for \(n\):
- \(n \geq \frac{90}{7.5}\)
- \(n \geq 12\)

Therefore, it will take at least 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree. The final numerical answer is:

12"
"Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had as \( x \).

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \).

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \).

3. She then sold half of what was left at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \). The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \).

We know that after these sales, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

Let's solve this equation step by step.

First, simplify the expression inside the parentheses:

\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \left( \frac{x}{3} - 1 \right) = \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{x}{3} + 1 = \frac{x}{3} - 1 \]

So the equation becomes:

\[ \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5 \]

Add 1 to both sides:

\[ \frac{x}{3} = 6 \]

Multiply both sides by 3:

\[ x = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners. Let's verify this by going through the steps:

1. She sold \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) vacuum cleaners at the green house, leaving her with \( 18 - 6 = 12 \) vacuum cleaners.
2. She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, leaving her with \( 12 - 2 = 10 \) vacuum cleaners.
3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) vacuum cleaners, leaving her with \( 10 - 5 = 5 \) vacuum cleaners.

The calculations confirm that Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners. Therefore, the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we have:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after those who enrolled in contemporary dance are accounted for:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Now, 25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

The rest of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance. To find out how many students that is, we subtract the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance from the remaining students:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of students in hip-hop dance}}{\text{Total number of students}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.60 \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the entire students that enrolled in hip-hop dance is 60%."
"To determine which purchase plan will maximize the profit, we need to calculate the future value of each item based on the expected market growth and then compare the profit from each.

For the jewelry:
- Current value: $5,000
- Expected growth: 2.5%

The future value of the jewelry can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Future Value of Jewelry} = \text{Current Value} \times (1 + \text{Growth Rate}) \]
\[ \text{Future Value of Jewelry} = 5000 \times (1 + 0.025) \]
\[ \text{Future Value of Jewelry} = 5000 \times 1.025 \]
\[ \text{Future Value of Jewelry} = 5125 \]

For the electronic gadgets:
- Current value: $8,000
- Expected growth: 1.2%

The future value of the electronic gadgets can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Future Value of Gadgets} = \text{Current Value} \times (1 + \text{Growth Rate}) \]
\[ \text{Future Value of Gadgets} = 8000 \times (1 + 0.012) \]
\[ \text{Future Value of Gadgets} = 8000 \times 1.012 \]
\[ \text{Future Value of Gadgets} = 8096 \]

Now, we calculate the profit for each option:
- Profit from jewelry: \( \text{Future Value of Jewelry} - \text{Current Value} \)
\[ \text{Profit from Jewelry} = 5125 - 5000 = 125 \]

- Profit from electronic gadgets: \( \text{Future Value of Gadgets} - \text{Current Value} \)
\[ \text{Profit from Gadgets} = 8096 - 8000 = 96 \]

Comparing the profits:
- Profit from jewelry: $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets: $96

The merchant would maximize profit by choosing to purchase the jewelry, which would yield a profit of $125."
"To determine the total distance covered by each train over the two days, we need to add the distances traveled in both directions.

1. The first day, the train travels 80 miles west.
2. The second day, the train travels 150 miles north.

The total distance covered by each train is the sum of these two distances:
\[ 80 \text{ miles} + 150 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles} \]

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles."
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from both teaching and coaching separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her annual earnings from teaching:
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual teaching hours = 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year
Annual teaching earnings = 1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her annual earnings from coaching:
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual coaching hours = 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year
Annual coaching earnings = 750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year

Now, we sum up her annual earnings from both teaching and coaching:
Annual salary = Annual teaching earnings + Annual coaching earnings
Annual salary = $35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

The final numerical answer is $57,500."
"To determine how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs Claire uses per day.
2. Calculate the number of eggs Claire uses per week.
3. Calculate the number of eggs Claire uses in 4 weeks.
4. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.

Step 1: Claire uses 3 eggs per day.

Step 2: There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Step 3: For 4 weeks:
\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Step 4: There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so:
\[ \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozen} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 7 \]"
"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time Marissa wants to spend hiking.
2. Determine the total distance she needs to cover.
3. Calculate the remaining distance.
4. Determine the required speed for the remaining distance.

First, let's calculate the total time Marissa wants to spend hiking. She wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour over the entire 12-mile trail. Therefore, the total time she wants to spend hiking is:

\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that Marissa has already spent 1 hour walking the first 4 miles and another 1 hour walking the next 2 miles. So, the time she has already spent is:

\[ 1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

This means she has:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

left to complete the hike. The remaining distance is:

\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 4 \text{ miles} - 2 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the required speed for the remaining 6 miles, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles at a speed of 6 miles per hour. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"First, let's determine the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the amount of water in the orange drink is:

\[ \text{Water in orange drink} = 10 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ liters} \]

Next, let's determine the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is:

\[ \text{Water in pineapple drink} = 15 \times \frac{3}{5} = 9 \text{ liters} \]

After pouring the orange drink, we spill one liter, so we have:

\[ 10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters of orange drink} \]

The total amount of water in the remaining mixture is the sum of the water from the orange drink and the pineapple drink:

\[ \text{Total water} = \frac{20}{3} + 9 = \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3} \text{ liters} \]

The total volume of the mixture is:

\[ 9 + 15 = 24 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the fraction of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture is:

\[ \text{Fraction of water} = \frac{\frac{47}{3}}{24} = \frac{47}{3 \times 24} = \frac{47}{72} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \frac{47}{72} \]"
"To determine how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Raymond's current age.
2. Calculate the age of Raymond when his son was born.
3. Determine how many years ago Raymond's son was born.

First, we know that Samantha is currently 31 years old and Raymond is 6 years older than Samantha. Therefore, Raymond's current age is:
\[ 31 + 6 = 37 \]

Raymond had a son when he was 23 years old. To find out how many years ago his son was born, we subtract Raymond's age when his son was born from his current age:
\[ 37 - 23 = 14 \]

So, Raymond's son was born 14 years ago. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 14 \]"
"To determine the total number of DVDs Billy sold on Tuesday, we can break down the sales by customer group:

"To find the original price of the book, we can set up the equation based on the information given. If the book was bought for $19.50 with a 25% discount, this means Kyle paid 75% of the original price (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \). According to the problem, 75% of \( P \) is $19.50. We can write this as:

\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we need to solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's calculate the value of \( P \).
```python
# Calculation
original_price = 19.50 / 0.75
original_price
```
```output
RuntimeError
```
It seems there was an error in the execution environment. Let me perform the calculation manually:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was \( \$26 \).

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered except for the boxes of pizza.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
The cost of 4 apples is \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Adding these together gives:
\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\] dollars.

Marie paid a total of $50. If we subtract the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples from the total amount paid, we can find out how much she spent on the boxes of pizza:
\[50 - 33 = 17\] dollars.

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, we can determine the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered by dividing the amount spent on pizza by the cost per box:
\[17 \div 8.50 = 2\] boxes.

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza. The final numerical answer is:
\[2\]"
"To find out how much Mishka spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of each type of clothing item and then sum them up.

For the shorts:
3 pairs * $16.50 per pair = $59.50

For the pants:
3 pairs * $22.50 per pair = $67.50

For the shoes:
3 pairs * $42 per pair = $126.00

Now, we add the costs together:
$59.50 + $67.50 + $126.00 = $253.00

So, Mishka spent $253.00 on all the clothing items."
"To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of servings she will consume and then the total cost based on the price per carton.

First, calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days:
\[ \text{Total servings} = 60 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ serving/day} = 60 \text{ servings} \]

Next, determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need. Since each carton contains 15 servings:
\[ \text{Number of cartons} = \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

Now, calculate the total cost for 4 cartons of ice cream:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 4 \text{ cartons} \times \$4.00/\text{carton} = \$16.00 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$16.00 \]"
"Henry's second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip is 60 miles, the distance to the end of the trip is 60 miles. Therefore, the distance to his second stop is 60 - 15 = 45 miles from the start. He first stopped after 20 miles. To find out how many miles he traveled between his first and second stops, we subtract the distance of his first stop from the distance of his second stop: 45 - 20 = 25 miles.

"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

The cost of the first pair of high heels is $33. The cost of the second pair of high heels is twice the cost of the first pair, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ B = 99 + 5 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = 104 \]

So, the cost of the boots is \( 104 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen based on the given ratio and total age.

Given:
- The ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11.
- The total age of Darrell and Allen is 162.

Let's denote Darrell's age as \(7x\) and Allen's age as \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The sum of their ages is:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]
\[18x = 162\]
\[x = \frac{162}{18}\]
\[x = 9\]

Now, we can find their current ages:
- Darrell's age: \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\)
- Allen's age: \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\)

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is:
\[109\]"
"To find the average guess, we first need to determine each friend's guess and then calculate the average.

1. The first friend's guess is 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half the first friend's guess:
   \[
   \text{Second friend's guess} = \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60
   \]
3. The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess:
   \[
   \text{Third friend's guess} = 80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100
   \]

Now, we calculate the average of these guesses:

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these as equations:
\[ G + S = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins \( S \) is 40, we can find the number of gold coins \( G \):
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins."

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John makes from selling his lego sets. He has 13 lego sets and sells each for $15.

\[ \text{Total money from lego sets} = 13 \times 15 = 195 \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money John spends on the video games. He buys 8 video games for $20 each.

\[ \text{Total money spent on video games} = 8 \times 20 = 160 \]

Now, we can determine how much money John has left after buying the video games. We know he has $5 left after these purchases.

\[ \text{Money left} = 195 - 160 = 35 \]

Since the problem states that John has $5 left, we can verify that the calculation is consistent with the given information.

Finally, since John did not sell any lego sets after buying the video games, he still has all 13 lego sets.

\[ \text{Number of lego sets John still has} = 13 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To find John's speed, we need to determine the total distance he runs and the total time he spends running.

John runs 60 miles a week over 3 days. The first day he runs 3 hours, and the other two days he runs half as much time as the first day, which is 1.5 hours each day.

So, the total time he runs in a week is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

The total distance he runs in a week is 60 miles.

To find his speed, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana skips at a speed of 3 miles per hour.
   - The skipping speed is half of her running speed.
   - Therefore, her running speed is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) miles per hour.

2. **Determine the time spent running and walking:**
   - Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking.
   - The total time is 6 hours.
   - Time spent running = \(\frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2\) hours.
   - Time spent walking = \(\frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4\) hours.

3. **Calculate the distance traveled while running and walking:**
   - Distance traveled while running = Running speed \(\times\) Time spent running = \(6 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles}\).
   - Distance traveled while walking = Walking speed \(\times\) Time spent walking. We need to find the walking speed first.
   - Walking speed is four times the walking speed, and we know the running speed is six miles per hour.
   - Therefore, the walking speed is \(\frac{6}{4} = 1.5\) miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled while walking = \(1.5 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles}\).

4. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = Distance traveled while running + Distance traveled while walking = \(12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles}\).

The final numerical answer is 18 miles."

"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to calculate how many calories are left in your daily calorie target.

Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories. Therefore, the remaining calories you can consume are:
\[ 2000 - 1800 = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Each serving of chips contains 250 calories. To find out how many servings you can consume with the remaining 200 calories, we divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories/serving}} = 0.8 \text{ servings} \]

Since each serving is 300 grams, we can find out how many grams of chips you can eat by multiplying the number of servings by the grams per serving:
\[ 0.8 \text{ servings} \times 300 \text{ grams/serving} = 240 \text{ grams} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of articles written on each day.
2. Calculate the total number of hours spent writing articles over the three days.

**Step 1: Determine the number of articles written on each day.**

- **Monday:** Meredith wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday:** She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. So, the number of articles on Tuesday is:
  \[
  5 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 5 \right) = 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ articles}
  \]
- **Wednesday:** She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, the number of articles on Wednesday is:
  \[

The total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days is 104 hours."
"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package that Candice purchased, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of Post-it notes Candice used at work.
2. Calculate the total number of Post-it notes she had before and after the purchase.
3. Subtract the number of Post-it notes she had before the purchase from the total number of Post-it notes she had after the purchase to find out how many she bought.

First, Candice used 220 Post-it notes at work. She had 23 Post-it notes remaining after this. Therefore, the total number of Post-it notes she had before the purchase was:

\[ 220 + 23 = 243 \]

Initially, she had 80 Post-it notes in her purse. Let \( x \) be the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased. After purchasing the package, she had 243 Post-it notes. So, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 80 + x = 243 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 243 - 80 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

Therefore, the number of Post-it notes in the package that she purchased is 163."
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Given that each blue tie costs $40 and he spent a total of $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of each red tie. Since red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, the cost of each red tie is:

\[ \text{Cost per red tie} = \text{Cost per blue tie} + 0.5 \times \text{Cost per blue tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60 \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

Finally, the total amount John spent on ties is the sum of the cost of the blue ties and the cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total spent on ties} = \text{Total spent on blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

Next, we need to determine how many 6-inch pieces can be cut from the 48-inch wire. We do this by dividing the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"First, let's calculate the total number of units in the building. The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units. Therefore, the total number of units is:

\[ 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units/floor} = 120 \text{ units} \]

Next, we need to find out how many units are occupied. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is:

\[ 120 \text{ units} \times \frac{3}{4} = 90 \text{ units} \]

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

\[ 120 \text{ units} - 90 \text{ units} = 30 \text{ units} \]

So, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"First, we need to determine how many dozens of eggs Lloyd gets from his farm per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs produced per day by 12:

Next, we calculate how much Lloyd makes per day by selling the eggs at $2 per dozen:

\[ \text{Daily earnings} = 21 \text{ dozen} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much Lloyd makes in a week, we multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in a week (7 days):

\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 42 \text{ dollars/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 294 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

Since the distance \(D\) is not provided, we cannot determine the exact time it takes for Tom to get back."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, and he removes 30 comic books.

\[ \text{Total weight of comic books} = 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. So, the remaining weight that needs to be removed is:

\[ \text{Remaining weight to be removed} = 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

- Total revenue on Thursday: \(\$360 + \$160 = \$520\)

**Friday:**
- Revenue from car tires: \(12 \text{ tires} \times \$40 \text{ per tire} = \$480\)
- Revenue from truck tires: \(0 \text{ tires} \times \$60 \text{ per tire} = \$0\)
- Total revenue on Friday: \(\$480 + \$0 = \$480\)

Now, we compare the total revenues:
- Thursday's revenue: \$520
- Friday's revenue: \$480

The difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday is:
\[ \$520 - \$480 = \$40 \]

The day with higher revenue is Thursday, and the difference in revenue is \$40. Therefore, the mechanic earned \$40 more on Thursday.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the brooch before insurance:

Cost of material = $500
Cost of construction = $800

Total cost before insurance = Cost of material + Cost of construction
Total cost before insurance = $500 + $800
Total cost before insurance = $1300

Next, we calculate the cost of insurance, which is 10% of the total cost before insurance:

Cost of insurance = 10% of Total cost before insurance
Cost of insurance = 0.10 * $1300
Cost of insurance = $130

Finally, we add the cost of insurance to the total cost before insurance to find the final amount Janet paid:

Total amount paid = Total cost before insurance + Cost of insurance
Total amount paid = $1300 + $130
Total amount paid = $1430

So, the final numerical answer is $1430."
"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of work, we need to consider the two different phases of her pension calculation:

1. For the first 20 years, she receives a fixed annual pension of $50,000.
2. After 20 years, she starts receiving 5% of the value of her pension each year.

First, we calculate the value of her pension after 20 years of work. Since she receives $50,000 annually, after 20 years, the total value of her pension is:
\[ 50,000 \times 20 = 1,000,000 \]

After 20 years, her pension changes to 5% of this value. So, the annual pension after 20 years is:
\[ 0.05 \times 1,000,000 = 50,000 \]

Since Marcy quits after 30 years, she will receive the 5% of the value pension for the next 10 years. Therefore, her annual pension after 30 years will remain the same as it was after 20 years, which is $50,000.

Thus, the annual pension Marcy will receive after 30 years is:
\[ 50,000 \]

Final numerical answer:

"To calculate the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payment into two halves of the year and then sum them up.

First, let's determine the monthly payment for the first half of the year. Since the streaming service charges $140 per month, the total for the first half of the year (6 months) is:
\[ 140 \times 6 = 840 \]

Next, we need to calculate the monthly payment for the second half of the year. The company charges 10% less than the initial amount, so the new monthly payment is:
\[ 140 - (140 \times 0.10) = 140 - 14 = 126 \]
The total for the second half of the year (6 months) is:
\[ 126 \times 6 = 756 \]

Now, we sum the payments from both halves of the year to get the total amount paid by the end of the year:
\[ 840 + 756 = 1596 \]

Therefore, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is:

First, calculate the amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days:
\[ 1 \text{ cup/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to determine how many days are left in the first year after the first 180 days. Since there are 365 days in a year:
\[ 365 \text{ days} - 180 \text{ days} = 185 \text{ days} \]

Now, calculate the amount of dog food needed for the remaining 185 days:
\[ 2 \text{ cups/day} \times 185 \text{ days} = 370 \text{ cups} \]

Add the amounts of dog food needed for the first 180 days and the remaining 185 days to find the total amount of dog food used in the first year:
\[ 180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups} \]

Finally, determine how many bags of dog food are needed. Since each bag contains 110 cups:

"To determine the final cost of the grooming after the discount, we first need to calculate the amount of the discount and then subtract it from the original cost.

The original cost of the grooming is $100. The discount is 30%, which means John pays 70% of the original cost (since 100% - 30% = 70%).

To find 70% of $100, we can use the formula:
\[ \text{Discounted Cost} = \text{Original Cost} \times (1 - \text{Discount Rate}) \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ \text{Discounted Cost} = 100 \times (1 - 0.30) \]
\[ \text{Discounted Cost} = 100 \times 0.70 \]
\[ \text{Discounted Cost} = 70 \]

So, the final cost of the grooming is $70."

"Let's denote the number of games they lost as \( L \) and the number of games they won as \( W \). According to the problem, the team won 8 more games than they lost, so we can write the equation:

\[ W = L + 8 \]

We also know that the total number of games played is 22, so:

\[ W + L = 22 \]

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ 2L = 14 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the number of games they lost, we can find the number of games they won by substituting \( L \) back into the first equation:

\[ W = 7 + 8 \]

So:

\[ W = 15 \]

The number of games they won is 15."

"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Sylvie's initial salary, which is $600.
2. Calculate the increase in her salary after 5 years of service, which is 10% of her initial salary.
3. Add the increase to her initial salary to get her new salary after 5 years.
4. Since the company policy only applies to those who have stayed for 5 years, Sylvie's salary will not increase further after the first 5 years.

Let's calculate the increase in her salary:
\[ \text{Increase} = 10\% \times 600 = 0.10 \times 600 = 60 \]

Now, add this increase to her initial salary:
\[ \text{New Salary} = 600 + 60 = 660 \]

Since Sylvie has already stayed for 5 years and the policy only applies to those who have stayed for 5 years, her salary will remain at $660 for the next three years.

"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the volume of tomatoes before cooking:**
   - Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces.
   - The tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked.
   - Therefore, before cooking, the volume of tomatoes was twice the volume of the sauce.
   - Volume of tomatoes before cooking = 32 ounces * 2 = 64 ounces.

2. **Determine the number of tomatoes:**
   - Each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes.
   - To find out how many 16-ounce cans are needed to make 64 ounces of tomatoes, we divide the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of one can.
   - Number of 16-ounce cans = 64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans.
   - Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes is:
   - Total number of tomatoes = 4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes.

"To determine how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to break down his water consumption by weekdays and weekends.

John drinks water with each meal on weekdays (Monday to Friday):
- Breakfast
- Lunch
- Dinner
- Before bed

That's 4 glasses of water per day on weekdays.

So, for 5 weekdays:
\[ 4 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ glasses} \]

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he drinks a soda with dinner instead of water:
- Dinner

That's 1 glass of water per day on weekends.

So, for 2 weekend days:
\[ 1 \text{ glass/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 2 \text{ glasses} \]

Adding the glasses of water from weekdays and weekends:
\[ 20 \text{ glasses} + 2 \text{ glasses} = 22 \text{ glasses} \]

Therefore, the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is 22."
"To determine how many minutes it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance the fog bank needs to cover.
2. Determine the rate at which the fog bank covers the city.
3. Calculate the total time required to cover the entire city.

First, the total distance the fog bank needs to cover is the length of the city, which is 42 miles.

Next, we know that the fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. Therefore, the rate of coverage is:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{3 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

To find out how long it will take to cover 42 miles, we use the rate:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{\frac{3 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} = 42 \times \frac{10}{3} = 140 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the fog bank will take 140 minutes to cover the whole city.

The final numerical answer is:
140"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total number of pieces**: 1000

2. **Pieces placed by Poppy**: A quarter of the total pieces.
   \[
   \text{Pieces placed by Poppy} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250
   \]

3. **Remaining pieces after Poppy**: Subtract the pieces placed by Poppy from the total.
   \[
   \text{Remaining pieces} = 1000 - 250 = 750
   \]

4. **Pieces placed by Poppy's mom**: A third of the remaining pieces.
   \[
   \text{Pieces placed by mom} = \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250
   \]

5. **Remaining pieces after mom**: Subtract the pieces placed by mom from the remaining pieces after Poppy.
   \[
   \text{Remaining pieces} = 750 - 250 = 500
   \]

So, the number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed is 500."

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner volume of one box and then multiply it by 3.

The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, the inner dimensions of each box are:
- Length: 5 inches - 2 * 1 inch = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - 2 * 1 inch = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - 1 inch = 3 inches

The inner volume of one box is:
\[ \text{Inner Volume of one box} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} = 3 \times 4 \times 3 = 36 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume is:
\[ \text{Total Inner Volume} = 3 \times 36 = 108 \text{ cubic inches} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 108 \]"
"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, let's break down the hours he spent watching TV each day:

- Monday and Tuesday: 1 hour each day, so 2 hours in total.
- Thursday: 1 hour for a 1-hour episode and 0.5 hours (30 minutes) for a 30-minute episode, so 1.5 hours in total.
- Friday: 2 hours for two 1-hour episodes.

Now, let's calculate the total hours watched from Monday to Friday:
\[ 2 \text{ (Monday and Tuesday)} + 1.5 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Friday)} = 5.5 \text{ hours} \]

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. So, the hours he watched on Wednesday can be calculated as:
\[ 7 \text{ hours (total)} - 5.5 \text{ hours (Monday to Friday)} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \]

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is:
\[ \frac{1.5 \text{ hours}}{0.5 \text{ hours/episode}} = 3 \text{ episodes} \]

Therefore, the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday is 3."
"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry meant to bake as \( x \). According to the problem, he actually baked twice as many as he meant to, which is \( 2x \). However, he ended up baking 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the actual number of cookies he baked is \( 2x = x + 15 \).

After baking, he drops 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x - 5 \). We know that after dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2x - 5 = 110 \]

To find \( x \), we first solve for \( 2x \) by adding 5 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 2x = 115 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{115}{2} = 57.5 \]

Since the number of cookies must be a whole number, and the problem context suggests a realistic scenario where the number of cookies is a whole number, we can conclude that the number of cookies Henry meant to bake last year is 57.5, but typically in such problems, we would expect a whole number. Given the context, we can infer that the problem might have a slight inconsistency, but based on the given information, the answer is:

\[ \text{Cookies baked last year} = 57.5 \]

However, if we are to provide a whole number answer, we might need to re-evaluate the problem constraints. For the sake of the given problem, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 57.5 \]"

Next, we find the total number of fruit roll-ups they both ate together:
- Total: \(42 + 48 = 90\) roll-ups

To find the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate, we divide the total by the number of people (which is 2):
- Average: \(\frac{90}{2} = 45\) roll-ups

The final numerical answer is 45."
"First, let's determine the speed at which Julia rows the boat. It takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Therefore, her speed is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet per second} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes her to row the entire 64 seconds distance to the shore:

\[ \text{Time to row 64 seconds} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds per 20 feet}} = 4 \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. To find out how much water the boat took on during the entire 80 feet row, we can set up a proportion:

\[ \text{Water taken on} = \left( \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 80 \text{ feet} = \frac{2 \times 80}{10} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

So, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore."

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the leftover lumber Sasha has:

- Ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards at $10 each: \(10 \times 10 = $100\)
- Five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at $16 each: \(5 \times 16 = $80\)

The total cost of the leftover lumber is \(100 + 80 = $180\).

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the leftover lumber:

- Ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards at $15 each (assuming the price has increased by 50% from $10 to $15): \(10 \times 15 = $150\)
- Five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at $24 each (assuming the price has increased by 50% from $16 to $24): \(5 \times 24 = $120\)

The total revenue from selling the leftover lumber is \(150 + 120 = $270\).

Finally, the profit Sasha makes is the total revenue minus the total cost:

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost = $270 - $180 = $90.

So, the final numerical answer is $90."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the ratio and the total amount used. The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total number of parts in the ratio is 7 + 13 = 20 parts.

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water. To find out how many teaspoons of sugar she used, we can set up a proportion based on the ratio. The number of teaspoons of sugar used is the ratio part for sugar (7 parts) divided by the total parts (20 parts) times the total amount used (120 teaspoons).

Let's calculate the number of teaspoons of sugar used:

\[
\text{Number of teaspoons of sugar} = \left(\frac{7}{20}\right) \times 120
\]

Now, let's perform the calculation:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Adrien's initial salary:**
   Adrien's initial salary was $40,000.

2. **Determine Lylah's initial salary:**
   Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. Let Lylah's initial salary be \( L \). Therefore, we have:
   \[
   40,000 = L + 0.3L = 1.3L
   \]
   Solving for \( L \):
   \[
   L = \frac{40,000}{1.3} = 30,769.23 \text{ (approximately)}
   \]

3. **Determine Adrien's salary four years later:**
   Adrien's salary increased by 40% from his initial salary. Therefore, his new salary is:
   \[
   40,000 \times 1.40 = 56,000

"To find out how many hours Sadie slept in total throughout the week, we need to calculate the hours she slept each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: Sadie slept 8 hours.
2. **Tuesday**: She slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.
3. **Wednesday**: She also slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.
4. **Thursday**: She slept 1 hour more than she did on Tuesday, so she slept \(6 + 1 = 7\) hours.
5. **Friday**: She slept 1 hour more than she did on Wednesday, so she slept \(6 + 1 = 7\) hours.
6. **Saturday**: She slept 1 hour more than she did on Thursday, so she slept \(7 + 1 = 8\) hours.

Given:
- Each pepper costs $15.
- A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs.
- An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs.

First, let's calculate the cost of a watermelon:
\[ \text{Cost of a watermelon} = 3 \times \text{Cost of a pepper} = 3 \times 15 = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of an orange:

"First, let's calculate the total number of hours the hospital sees patients in a day. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can divide the total minutes per day by 60 to get the number of hours.

\[ \text{Total hours per day} = \frac{500 \text{ patients/day} \times 24 \text{ minutes/patient}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = \frac{12000 \text{ minutes/day}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 200 \text{ hours/day} \]

Next, we calculate the revenue generated by the hospital from the doctors' fees. The doctors charge $150 per hour.

\[ \text{Revenue from doctors} = 200 \text{ hours/day} \times \$150/\text{hour} = \$30000/\text{day} \]

Then, we calculate the revenue generated from the patients. The hospital charges $200 per hour.

\[ \text{Revenue from patients} = 200 \text{ hours/day} \times \$200/\text{hour} = \$40000/\text{day} \]

Finally, we calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost to find the profit. Since the cost is not specified, we assume it is zero for this calculation.

\[ \text{Total revenue} = \$30000 + \$40000 = \$70000/\text{day} \]

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Cost} = \$70000 - \$0 = \$70000/\text{day} \]

The final numerical answer is:

- Mark took 6 hours to complete the test.
- He completed 5 questions per hour.
- Therefore, the number of questions he completed on the second test is \(6 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ questions/hour} = 30 \text{ questions}\).

Now, let's calculate the number of questions he left incomplete for each test.

For the first test:
- The test had 75 questions.
- He completed 40 questions.
- Therefore, the number of questions he left incomplete is \(75 - 40 = 35 \text{ questions}\).

For the second test:
- The test had 100 questions.
- He completed 30 questions.
- Therefore, the number of questions he left incomplete is \(100 - 30 = 70 \text{ questions}\).

Finally, to find the total number of questions he left incomplete, we add the incomplete questions from both tests:
- Incomplete questions from the first test: 35
- Incomplete questions from the second test: 70
- Total incomplete questions: \(35 + 70 = 105\).

The final numerical answer is:
105"
"Let's denote the number of blue gumballs as \( B \) and the number of pink gumballs as \( P \).

According to the problem, we have:
\[ P = 4B + 22 \]

Given that there are 12 blue gumballs:
\[ B = 12 \]

Now, substitute \( B \) into the equation to find \( P \):
\[ P = 4(12) + 22 \]
\[ P = 48 + 22 \]
\[ P = 70 \]

So, the number of pink gumballs is 70."
"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine how many semi-automatic cars there are. We know there are 20 cars in total, 12 of which are automatic and 4 are manual. The rest are semi-automatic.

The number of semi-automatic cars is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = \text{Total cars} - \text{Automatic cars} - \text{Manual cars} \]
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 \]

Next, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total cars}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of the cars that are semi-automatic is 20%."
"Let's denote the number of queens as \( Q \), the number of baby bees as \( B \), and the number of worker bees as \( W \).

According to the problem:
1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so \( W = 2B \).
2. There are twice as many baby bees as queens, so \( B = 2Q \).

The total number of bees is 700, so:
\[ W + B + Q = 700 \]

Substituting \( W = 2B \) and \( B = 2Q \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 2B + B + Q = 700 \]
\[ 3B + Q = 700 \]

Since \( B = 2Q \), we can substitute \( B \) with \( 2Q \) in the equation:
\[ 3(2Q) + Q = 700 \]
\[ 6Q + Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now, we can find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]
\[ W = 2B = 2 \times 200 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is 400."
"Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day. In one week, he would play video games for 2 hours/day * 7 days/week = 14 hours. If he earns $10 an hour at his part-time job, then in one week he would earn 14 hours * $10/hour = $140. 

The final numerical answer is $140."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of nonfood items before tax:

- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

Total cost of nonfood items = $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $15

Next, we calculate the tax on the nonfood items. The tax rate is 10%, so the tax amount is:

Tax amount = 10% of $15 = 0.10 * $15 = $1.50

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of nonfood items to get the final cost:

Final cost = Total cost of nonfood items + Tax amount = $15 + $1.50 = $16.50

The final numerical answer is $16.50."
"First, let's calculate the total number of clients Kim will have:
- Current clients: 3
- Potential clients: 5
- Total clients: 3 + 5 = 8

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the bleach and cloths for all clients:
- Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and each bottle costs $2, so the cost for bleach per client is 2 * $2 = $4.
- Each client needs 1 pack of cloths and each pack costs $5, so the cost for cloths per client is $5.
- Total cost per client: $4 (bleach) + $5 (cloths) = $9.
- Total cost for all clients: 8 clients * $9 per client = $72.

Kim's total income each week is $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:
- Profit = Total income - Total expenses = $92 - $72 = $20.

Therefore, the profit Lucas will make each week is $20."
"To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of harvests John can have in a year.
2. Determine the total number of pineapples harvested based on the number of harvests.

First, since John harvests his pineapples every 3 months, we need to find out how many 3-month periods there are in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so:

\[ \text{Number of harvests in a year} = \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests} \]

Next, we know that John has 100 pineapples per hectare and he has 10 hectares of pineapple field. Therefore, the total number of pineapples per harvest is:

\[ \text{Total pineapples per harvest} = 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} \times 10 \text{ hectares} = 1000 \text{ pineapples} \]

Since John can harvest 1000 pineapples per harvest and he can do this 4 times in a year, the total number of pineapples he can harvest in a year is:

\[ \text{Total pineapples in a year} = 1000 \text{ pineapples/harvest} \times 4 \text{ harvests} = 4000 \text{ pineapples} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 4000 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of pieces in each lego set:

1. The first lego set has 500 pieces.
2. The second lego set has 3 times more pieces than the first one, which means it has \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) pieces.
3. The third lego set has \(\frac{1}{4}\) the number of pieces as the first one, which means it has \(\frac{1}{4} \times 500 = 125\) pieces.

Now, let's add up all the pieces Johnny has to pick up:

\[500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125\]

So, the total number of lego pieces Johnny picks up is 2125."
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of 30 bees return to the hive, which is 15 bees.
3. In the following 6 hours, twice as many bees as those that left in the first 6 hours return, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.

Now, let's calculate the total number of bees that have returned to the hive by the end of the first 12 hours:

- Bees that left in the first 6 hours: 30
- Bees that returned in the next 6 hours: 15
- Bees that returned in the following 6 hours: 60

Total bees that returned by the end of the first 12 hours = 30 + 15 + 60 = 105 bees.

Now, let's consider the last 6 hours of the day. According to the information, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the next 6 hours. The number of bees that left before the last 6 hours is 30.

Therefore, in the last 6 hours, 30 bees return to the hive.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets and then add the change she received.

The cost of an adult ticket is $12 and the cost of a child ticket is $10. Therefore, the total cost for 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket is:
\[ 12 + 10 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

Brittany's mom received $8 in change. This means the amount of money she gave the cashier is the total cost plus the change:
\[ 22 + 8 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier is:
\[ 30 \text{ dollars} \]"
"To find out how many Facebook friends James has, we first need to determine how many friends Dorothy has. We know that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find the number of Dorothy's friends:

\[ \text{Number of Charlie's friends} = 3 \times \text{Number of Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ 12 = 3 \times \text{Number of Dorothy's friends} \]

To find the number of Dorothy's friends, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ \text{Number of Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can determine how many friends James has. We know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Number of James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Number of Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ \text{Number of James's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

So, James has 16 Facebook friends. The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to convert the distance from miles to feet because the speeds are given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance in feet:
\[ 3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet} \]

Tim's distance in feet:
\[ 2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each to reach home.

Time for Steve to reach home:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

Time for Tim to reach home:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

The winner is Steve, who takes 36 minutes to reach home. The loser is Tim, who takes 40 minutes to reach home. The difference in their waiting time at home is:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the winner (Steve) will be waiting at their house for 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race. The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total amount Shawnda made, we need to determine the cost of inflating the tires for each type of vehicle and then sum these costs.

1. For the bicycles: Each bicycle has 2 tires, and each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. Since 5 people came with bicycles, the total cost for the bicycles is:
   \[
   5 \text{ bicycles} \times 2 \text{ tires/bicycle} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 5 \times 2 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 250 \text{ cents}
   \]
   Converting cents to dollars:
   \[
   250 \text{ cents} = 2.50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. For the tricycles: Each tricycle has 3 tires, and each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. Since 3 people came with tricycles, the total cost for the tricycles is:
   \[
   3 \text{ tricycles} \times 3 \text{ tires/tricycle} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 3 \times 3 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 225 \text{ cents}
   \]
   Converting cents to dollars:
   \[
   225 \text{ cents} = 2.25 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. For the unicycle: A unicycle has 1 tire, and each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. Since 1 person came with a unicycle, the total cost for the unicycle is:
   \[
   1 \text{ unicycle} \times 1 \text{ tire/unicycle} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 1 \times 1 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 25 \text{ cents}
   \]
   Converting cents to dollars:
   \[
   25 \text{ cents} = 0.25 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum the amounts from each type of vehicle:

"Let's work backwards from the final number of fries to find out how many were in the pack initially.

1. After the raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries, five fries were left. This means that the five fries represent one third of the fries that were left before the raccoon stole them. Therefore, before the raccoon, there were \(5 \times 3 = 15\) fries.
2. The three pigeons each ate three fries, so they ate a total of \(3 \times 3 = 9\) fries. This means that before the pigeons ate, there were \(15 + 9 = 24\) fries.
3. Dave ate 14 fries, and the seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \(14 / 2 = 7\) fries. This means that before the seagull ate, there were \(24 + 14 + 7 = 45\) fries.
4. The large pack of fries initially had 45 fries.

The final numerical answer is 45."
"To calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly class schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has three 1-hour classes each day. So, the total number of hours he spends on these days is:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ classes/day} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes each day. So, the total number of hours he spends on these days is:
\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ classes/day} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Adding the hours from both sets of days gives the total number of hours he spends on classes each week:
\[ 9 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours/week} \]

Since there are 16 weeks in the semester, the total number of hours he spends attending classes in one semester is:
\[ 17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's convert all the lengths to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll use inches for this problem.

Each roll is 4 inches long, and Bill bakes 300 rolls:
\[ 300 \text{ rolls} \times 4 \text{ inches/roll} = 1200 \text{ inches} \]

Each croissant is 6 inches long, and Bill bakes 120 croissants:
\[ 120 \text{ croissants} \times 6 \text{ inches/croissant} = 720 \text{ inches} \]

Each baguette is 2 feet long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is:
\[ 2 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 24 \text{ inches} \]
Bill bakes 60 baguettes:
\[ 60 \text{ baguettes} \times 24 \text{ inches/baguette} = 1440 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we add up all the lengths in inches:
\[ 1200 \text{ inches} + 720 \text{ inches} + 1440 \text{ inches} = 3360 \text{ inches} \]

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[ \frac{3360 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 280 \text{ feet} \]

So, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is 280 feet."
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order to last for 2 months, we first need to calculate the total number of bananas required by each type of ape per month and then multiply by 2.

- Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
- Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
- Baboons need 100 bananas per month.

First, we calculate the total number of bananas needed per month for all the apes:
\[ 200 \text{ (monkeys)} + 400 \text{ (gorillas)} + 100 \text{ (baboons)} = 700 \text{ bananas per month} \]

Since the zookeeper needs to order enough bananas to last for 2 months, we multiply the monthly total by 2:
\[ 700 \text{ bananas per month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 1400 \text{ bananas} \]

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"To determine how far Blake and Kelly each run, we need to calculate the total distance each of them covers.

First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs:
- Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field.
- Each round trip is 200 yards (100 yards out and 100 yards back).
- Therefore, the total distance Blake runs is \(15 \times 200 = 3000\) yards.

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs:
- Kelly runs back and forth once to the 40-yard line and back, which is a total of 80 yards.
- She does this 34 times.
- Therefore, the total distance Kelly runs is \(34 \times 80 = 2720\) yards.

Now, we compare the distances:
- Blake runs 3000 yards.
- Kelly runs 2720 yards.

The difference in the distance they run is:
\[ 3000 - 2720 = 280 \text{ yards} \]

The winner runs 280 yards farther than the loser. Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the number of each type of fish caught by Locsin:

- Starfish: Anakin caught 10 starfish, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.
- Sea horses: Anakin caught 6 sea horses, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
- Clownfish: Anakin caught 3 clownfish, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's add up the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin:

- Starfish: 10 (Anakin) + 5 (Locsin) = 15 starfish.
- Sea horses: 6 (Anakin) + 3 (Locsin) = 9 sea horses.
- Clownfish: 3 (Anakin) + 5 (Locsin) = 8 clownfish.

Finally, the total number of fish they caught is the sum of the starfish, sea horses, and clownfish:

15 (starfish) + 9 (sea horses) + 8 (clownfish) = 32 fish.

So, the final numerical answer is 32."
"To find the final cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase step by step.

The original price of a bag of marbles is $20. The price increases by 20% every two months. Since 36 months is equivalent to 18 periods of two months, we will apply the 20% increase 18 times.

Let's denote the original price as \( P_0 = 20 \).

The price after the first two months, \( P_1 \), is:
\[ P_1 = P_0 \times (1 + 0.20) = 20 \times 1.20 = 24 \]

The price after the next two months, \( P_2 \), is:
\[ P_2 = P_1 \times 1.20 = 24 \times 1.20 = 28.80 \]

We can see that the price after each two-month period can be calculated as:
\[ P_n = P_0 \times (1.20)^n \]
where \( n \) is the number of two-month periods.

For 36 months, \( n = 18 \):
\[ P_{18} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \]

Now, we need to calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \):
\[ (1.20)^{18} \approx 10.488 \]

Therefore, the price after 36 months is:
\[ P_{18} = 20 \times 10.488 = 209.76 \]

So, the final cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is approximately $209.76."
"First, let's determine the cost of one red car. According to the information given, one red car costs $4.

Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and an action figure costs $5, the cost of 3 action figures is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]
Therefore, the doll costs $15.

Now, we know the cost of one red car is $4, and the doll costs $15. We need to find the total cost of all the toys:
- Red cars: 5 cars at $4 each = \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \)
- Action figures: 3 figures at $5 each = \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \)
- Doll: $15

Adding these together gives the total cost of all the toys:
\[ 20 + 15 + 15 = 50 \]

So, the total value of all the toys is $50."

Elvira's total budget is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost of the accessories from her budget:

Money left for clothing = €1500 - €509 = €991

So, the final numerical answer is €991."
"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit to make 15 Spanish flans, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs required.

Each Spanish flan requires 3 eggs. Therefore, for 15 flans, the total number of eggs needed is:
\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Sandra receives a basket of 9 eggs every time she babysits. To find out how many times she needs to babysit to get 45 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session:
\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysitting sessions} \]

Thus, Sandra has to babysit 5 times to make 15 Spanish flans."
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write:
\[ S = 2B \]

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write:
\[ (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \]

Substituting \( S = 2B \) into the equation, we get:
\[ (B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28 \]
\[ 3B + 4 = 28 \]

Now, we solve for \( B \):
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Since \( S = 2B \), we substitute \( B = 8 \) into the equation:
\[ S = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 16 \]"
"If Ethel has $8, then twice the money Ethel has is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars. Jimmy has $2 more than this amount, so Jimmy has \(16 + 2 = 18\) dollars.

"To calculate the total miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to consider his daily walking distance and the fact that he walks 10 miles on weekends.

From Monday to Friday, he walks 20 miles each day. So, for 5 days, he walks:
\[ 20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles} \]

On Saturday and Sunday, he walks 10 miles each day. So, for 2 days, he walks:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Adding the miles from the weekdays and the weekend days together:
\[ 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total number of miles Pancho walks in a week is 120 miles."
"First, let's determine the cost of each item:
- The cost of the hat is $25.
- The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat, so it is \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.
- The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket. The average is calculated as \(\frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50\) dollars.

Now, let's find the total cost of one uniform by adding the cost of the hat, the jacket, and the pants:
- Total cost = Cost of the hat + Cost of the jacket + Cost of the pants
- Total cost = $25 + $75 + $50 = $150

So, the total cost of each uniform is $150."
"To find the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to calculate the legs from each group of creatures separately and then sum them up.

For the spiders:
\[ 80 \text{ spiders} \times 8 \text{ legs per spider} = 640 \text{ legs} \]

For the insects:
\[ 90 \text{ insects} \times 6 \text{ legs per insect} = 540 \text{ legs} \]

For the rare mutant invertebrates:
\[ 3 \text{ invertebrates} \times 10 \text{ legs per invertebrate} = 30 \text{ legs} \]

Now, we add the legs from all the groups together:
\[ 640 \text{ legs} + 540 \text{ legs} + 30 \text{ legs} = 1210 \text{ legs} \]

So, the total number of legs Jake sees is:
\[ 1210 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

1. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, we can calculate the total age of the four birds:

- Sally Two: 19 years
- Granny Red: 16 years
- Sally Four: 8 years
- Sally Thirtytwo: 8 years

Total age = \(19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 51\) years.

The final numerical answer is 51."
"First, let's calculate the amount Jessica needs to pay each month if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum.

For the student loans:
Minimum payment = $300
50% more than minimum = $300 * 0.50 = $150
Total payment = $300 + $150 = $450

For the credit card:
Minimum payment = $200
50% more than minimum = $200 * 0.50 = $100
Total payment = $200 + $100 = $300

For the mortgage:
Minimum payment = $500
50% more than minimum = $500 * 0.50 = $250
Total payment = $500 + $250 = $750

Now, let's add up the monthly payments:
Total monthly payment = $450 + $300 + $750 = $1500

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the total monthly payment by 12:
Total annual payment = $1500 * 12 = $18000

The final numerical answer is $18000."
"To determine how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel and cut each potato and then multiply by the total number of potatoes.

First, let's calculate the time to peel and cut one potato:
- Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
- Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

Convert the time to peel one potato to seconds for easier calculation:
- 1.5 minutes = 1.5 * 60 seconds = 90 seconds

Now, add the time to peel and cut one potato:
- Total time for one potato = 90 seconds (peeling) + 5 seconds (cutting) = 95 seconds

Next, calculate the total time for 60 potatoes:
- Total time = 95 seconds/potato * 60 potatoes = 5700 seconds

Finally, convert the total time from seconds to minutes:
- 5700 seconds = 5700 / 60 minutes = 95 minutes

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes."
"First, let's calculate the total revenue from selling lemonade. They sell 20 glasses per gallon at $0.50 per glass, so the revenue per gallon is:
\[ 20 \text{ glasses/gallon} \times \$0.50/\text{glass} = \$10/\text{gallon} \]

Given that their profit is $25, we can express the profit as the total revenue minus the total cost. Let's denote the number of gallons they made as \( x \). The total revenue is then:
\[ \$10 \times x \]

The total cost is the cost of lemons plus the cost of sugar. The cost of lemons is $3 per gallon and the cost of sugar is $2 per gallon, so the total cost is:
\[ (\$3 + \$2) \times x = \$5 \times x \]

The profit is given by:
\[ \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = \$25 \]
\[ \$10x - \$5x = \$25 \]
\[ \$5x = \$25 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, they made 5 gallons of lemonade. The cost of lemons for 5 gallons is:
\[ \$3 \times 5 = \$15 \]

Therefore, the amount they spent on lemons is:
\[ \$15 \]"
"To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we first need to determine the number of Chinese participants. Given that there are 240 Asians in total and 80 of them are Japanese, the number of Chinese participants is:

\[ 240 - 80 = 160 \]

We know that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. Therefore, the number of girls on the Chinese team can be found by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants:

\[ 160 - 60 = 100 \]

So, the number of girls on the Chinese team is 100."
"First, let's calculate how much Zaid spends on rent, car fuel, and the remaining amount after these expenses.

Zaid's salary is 6000$ per month.

Rent: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \) dollars.
Car fuel: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \) dollars.

Total spent on rent and car fuel: \( 1500 + 2000 = 3500 \) dollars.

Remaining amount after rent and car fuel: \( 6000 - 3500 = 2500 \) dollars.

Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity:
Donation to charity: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \) dollars.

Remaining amount after donation to charity: \( 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \) dollars.

Zaid gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$:
Total given to daughter and wife: \( 200 + 700 = 900 \) dollars.

Remaining amount after giving to daughter and wife: \( 1250 - 900 = 350 \) dollars.

So, the final amount of money Zaid will still have is 350 dollars."
"First, let's determine the number of crabs each person has:

Bo has 40 crabs.

Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ crabs} \]

Rani has ten more crabs than Monic, so Rani has:
\[ 36 + 10 = 46 \text{ crabs} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of crabs the three have together:

"To find the number of votes the loser got, we first need to determine the number of votes the winner received. The winner got \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total votes.

Given that the total number of votes cast is 80, we can calculate the number of votes the winner received as follows:

\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80
\]

\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = 60
\]

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser received is the total number of votes minus the number of votes the winner received:

\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60
\]

\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 20
\]

So, the number of votes the loser got is 20."
"Let's denote the number of white carnations Sandra ordered as \( w \).

From the information given:
1. The number of red roses ordered is four times the number of white carnations, so the number of red roses is \( 4w \).
2. The number of pink calla lilies ordered is 200, and this is five times the number of white carnations, so \( 200 = 5w \).

First, we need to find the value of \( w \) from the equation \( 200 = 5w \):
\[ w = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Now that we know \( w = 40 \), we can find the number of red roses:
\[ \text{Number of red roses} = 4w = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

The final numerical answer is:
160"
"To find Jean's age, let's break down the information given:

1. Jan's current age is 30.
2. Two years ago, Mark's age was 5 years less than half of Jan's age at that time.

First, calculate Jan's age two years ago:
\[ \text{Jan's age two years ago} = 30 - 2 = 28 \]

Next, calculate half of Jan's age two years ago:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 28 = 14 \]

According to the information given, two years ago Mark's age was 5 years less than this value:
\[ \text{Mark's age two years ago} = 14 - 5 = 9 \]

Now, calculate Mark's current age:
\[ \text{Mark's current age} = 9 + 2 = 11 \]

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, Jean's current age is:
\[ \text{Jean's current age} = 11 + 2 = 13 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total time for the faster team to complete the race. Since each member of the faster team runs their leg in 55 seconds, the total time for the race is:

\[ 55 \text{ seconds/runner} \times 4 \text{ runners} = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time for the slower team to complete the race. The first runner takes 60 seconds, the second runner takes 57 seconds (3 seconds faster than the first), the third runner takes 54 seconds (3 seconds faster than the second), and the fourth runner takes 51 seconds (3 seconds faster than the third). The total time for the race is:

\[ 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, to find out how many seconds the faster team will win by, we subtract the total time of the faster team from the total time of the slower team:

\[ 222 \text{ seconds} - 220 \text{ seconds} = 2 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then compare them.

First, let's determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

\[ P(\text{number greater than 3}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Next, let's determine the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:

\[ P(\text{even on first roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll, given that the first roll was even, is also:

\[ P(\text{even on second roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of both events happening (rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll) is the product of the individual probabilities:

\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25 \]

Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by calculating the difference in probabilities and then converting that difference to a percentage:

\[ \text{Difference in probabilities} = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 \]

To express this difference as a percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage difference} = 0.25 \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, it is 25% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 25 \]"
"If Jenna's mother picked 20 apples, and Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother, then Jenna picked 20 / 2 = 10 apples. Together, they picked 20 + 10 = 30 apples. 

The final numerical answer is 30."
"Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as \( r \).

From the information given:
- There are 3 cages of rats, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is \( 3r \times 6 = 18r \).
- There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \).
- There are 20 pieces of straw distributed among the rabbits.

The total number of pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents is the sum of the pieces of straw given to the rats, the hamsters, and the rabbits. According to the problem, this total is 160 pieces of straw. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 18r + 50 + 20 = 160 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 18r + 70 = 160 \]
\[ 18r = 160 - 70 \]
\[ 18r = 90 \]
\[ r = \frac{90}{18} \]
\[ r = 5 \]

So, the number of rats in each cage is 5.

The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the amount Mandy should give Benedict after 3 months, we need to consider the interest accrued over that period.

The initial amount Mandy owes is $100, and the monthly interest rate is 2%. The interest for the first month is:
\[ 100 \times 0.02 = 2 \]

So, after the first month, the total amount Mandy owes is:
\[ 100 + 2 = 102 \]

For the second month, the interest is again 2% of $102:
\[ 102 \times 0.02 = 2.04 \]

So, after the second month, the total amount Mandy owes is:
\[ 102 + 2.04 = 104.04 \]

For the third month, the interest is again 2% of $104.04:
\[ 104.04 \times 0.02 = 2.0808 \]

So, after the third month, the total amount Mandy owes is:
\[ 104.04 + 2.0808 = 106.1208 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the amount Mandy should give Benedict is:
\[ 106.12 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of bags of wheat as \( n \).

The cost per bag includes the purchase price and the transportation cost:
\[ \text{Cost per bag} = \$20 + \$2 = \$22 \]

The selling price per bag is:
\[ \text{Selling price per bag} = \$30 \]

The profit per bag is:
\[ \text{Profit per bag} = \text{Selling price per bag} - \text{Cost per bag} = \$30 - \$22 = \$8 \]

The total profit is given as $400. Therefore, the total profit can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Total profit} = \text{Profit per bag} \times n = \$8 \times n \]

Given that the total profit is $400, we can set up the equation:
\[ 8n = 400 \]

Solving for \( n \):
\[ n = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 50 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food:

The cost of the tickets is $20.25.

The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, so:
\[ \text{Cost of food} = \$20.25 - \$4.50 = \$15.75 \]

Next, we add the cost of the tickets and the cost of the food to find the total cost of the tickets and food:
\[ \text{Total cost of tickets and food} = \$20.25 + \$15.75 = \$36.00 \]

Now, we add the cost of the rides. They went on 2 different rides, each costing $33:
\[ \text{Total cost of rides} = 2 \times \$33 = \$66.00 \]

The total cost for all expenses is the sum of the cost of tickets and food and the cost of the rides:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$36.00 + \$66.00 = \$102.00 \]

Since they agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:
\[ \text{Cost per person} = \frac{\$102.00}{3} = \$34.00 \]

So, each of them paid:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"John collects peaches for 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, he collects peaches for a total of 3 * 60 = 180 minutes. Given that he collects 2 peaches per minute, the total number of peaches he collects is 180 * 2 = 360 peaches.

"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ten ducks need per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of insects needed per day for one duck.
2. Multiply the daily amount needed for one duck by the number of ducks in the flock.

First, we know that the total amount of insects needed per week for one duck is 3.5 pounds. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find the daily amount needed for one duck by dividing 3.5 pounds by 7 days:

\[ \text{Daily amount for one duck} = \frac{3.5 \text{ pounds}}{7 \text{ days}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how much insects the entire flock of ten ducks needs per day. We do this by multiplying the daily amount needed for one duck by the number of ducks:

\[ \text{Daily amount for ten ducks} = 0.5 \text{ pounds/day} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

So, the total amount of insects needed per day for the flock of ten ducks is 5 pounds."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the net increase in trees each year.
2. Determine the number of trees after 10 years, considering the net increase.
3. Account for the 30% of trees that die after 10 years.

**Step 1: Net increase in trees each year**
Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year.
Net increase = 10 - 2 = 8 trees per year.

**Step 2: Number of trees after 10 years**
Starting with 50 trees, the number of trees after 10 years, considering the net increase, is:
\[ 50 + 8 \times 10 = 50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees} \]

**Step 3: Trees that die after 10 years**
30% of the trees die after 10 years.
Number of trees that die = 30% of 130 = 0.30 * 130 = 39 trees.

**Step 4: Number of trees left after the 30% die**
\[ 130 - 39 = 91 \text{ trees} \]

So, the final number of trees Tom has left after 10 years is 91."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of pink flamingos:** 18
2. **On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos and painted them white:**
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \)
   - So, 6 pink flamingos were taken back and painted white.
   - The number of pink flamingos left is \( 18 - 6 = 12 \)
   - The number of white flamingos added is 6.
3. **On Sunday morning, another 18 pink flamingos were added:**
   - The total number of pink flamingos now is \( 12 + 18 = 30 \)
   - The number of white flamingos remains 6.

Now, we need to find out how many more pink flamingos there are than white flamingos:
- Number of pink flamingos: 30

"First, let's determine the cost of a pen. Since a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined, we add the cost of a pencil and an eraser:

Cost of a pencil = $1.20
Cost of an eraser = $0.30

Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser
Cost of a pen = $1.20 + $0.30
Cost of a pen = $1.50

Now, to find out how much 8 pens will cost, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8:

Cost of 8 pens = Cost of one pen × 8
Cost of 8 pens = $1.50 × 8
Cost of 8 pens = $12.00

Therefore, the final numerical answer is $12.00."
"To determine how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we first need to calculate the total amount of carrots that will be distributed to the 40 restaurants.

Each restaurant receives 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. Therefore, the total amount of carrots distributed is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds/restaurant} \times 40 \text{ restaurants} = 80 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of carrots available is 200 pounds. To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we subtract the total amount distributed from the total amount available:

"To find the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now, we need to calculate the number of cards she collected each month and then sum them up.

1. **First Month:**
   Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards. After a month, she collected three times that number.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60
   \]
   So, she collected 60 cards in the first month.

2. **Second Month:**
   In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]
   So, she collected 40 cards in the second month.

3. **Third Month:**
   In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months.
   \[
   2 \times (60 + 40) = 2 \times 100 = 200

"First, let's determine how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher. Since he edits an equal number of sentences each week for both publishers and he edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B.

Next, we know that Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, the amount Mark earns from Publisher A is:
\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays Mark:
\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10 \text{ cents/sentence} \]
Therefore, the amount Mark earns from Publisher B is:
\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we add the earnings from both publishers:
\[ 2500 \text{ cents} + 5000 \text{ cents} = 7500 \text{ cents} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total amount of money John made that year, we need to consider both the monetary reward from the award and the raise in his salary.

First, let's calculate the raise in his salary:
- John's current weekly salary is $2000.
- The raise is 5% of his current salary.

\[ \text{Raise} = 2000 \times 0.05 = 100 \]

So, his new weekly salary after the raise is:
\[ \text{New weekly salary} = 2000 + 100 = 2100 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money he makes in a year from his new weekly salary:
- There are 52 weeks in a year.

\[ \text{Total yearly salary from raise} = 2100 \times 52 = 109200 \]

Now, we add the one-time monetary reward from the award:
\[ \text{Total yearly earnings} = 109200 + 5000 = 114200 \]

So, the total amount of money John made that year is:

"To find the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the sum of the first five test scores.
2. Determine the total sum of the six test scores needed to achieve an average of 93.
3. Find the score required on the sixth test by subtracting the sum of the first five test scores from the total sum needed.

First, let's calculate the sum of the first five test scores:
\[ 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 440 \]

Next, we need to find the total sum of the six test scores that would give an average of 93:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total Sum of Six Tests}}{6} = 93 \]
\[ \text{Total Sum of Six Tests} = 93 \times 6 = 558 \]

Now, we can find the score required on the sixth test by subtracting the sum of the first five test scores from the total sum needed:
\[ \text{Score Needed on Sixth Test} = 558 - 440 = 118 \]

Therefore, Brinley needs a score of 118 on her sixth test to get an average of 93.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 118 \]"
"To calculate the total kilometers Micheal rode, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first four weeks and the next three weeks.

**First four weeks:**
- Micheal rode at least 5 times a week.
- Each time he rode, he covered 25 kilometers.
- Therefore, in one week, he rode \(5 \times 25 = 125\) kilometers.
- Over four weeks, he rode \(4 \times 125 = 500\) kilometers.

**Next three weeks:**
- Micheal decided to ride 2 times a week.
- Each time he rode, he covered 60 kilometers.
- Therefore, in one week, he rode \(2 \times 60 = 120\) kilometers.
- Over three weeks, he rode \(3 \times 120 = 360\) kilometers.

**Total kilometers:**
- Adding the kilometers from both periods, we get \(500 + 360 = 860\) kilometers.

The total number of kilometers Micheal rode is 860 kilometers."
"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we first need to determine the weight of each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams and each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs:

\[ \text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{40 \text{ grams}}{2} = 20 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then sum them up. The total weight of the chocolate bars is:

\[ \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 \text{ grams} = 1000 \text{ grams} \]

The total weight of the candied apples is:

\[ \text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20 \text{ grams} = 1600 \text{ grams} \]

Adding these together gives the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:

\[ \text{Total weight of Joe's bag of candy} = 1000 \text{ grams} + 1600 \text{ grams} = 2600 \text{ grams} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2600 \]"
"On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.
On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes.
On Wednesday, she bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

To find the total number of cakes she bought after all three days, we add the cakes bought each day:

The final numerical answer is 76."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates:

Half a dozen plates = 6 plates
Cost per plate = $6000
Total cost for half a dozen plates = 6 * $6000 = $36000

Now, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates, which is $36000. So, the cost of twenty dozen cups is:

Cost of twenty dozen cups = $36000 - $1200 = $34800

Now, we need to find the cost of each cup. Since there are twenty dozen cups, we need to calculate the cost of one dozen cups and then one cup.

Twenty dozen cups = 20 * 12 = 240 cups

Cost of each cup = $34800 / 240 = $145

So, the total cost of buying each cup is $145."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate how much money Sara earns from babysitting:
- She earns $5 each time she babysits, and she babysits 4 times, so she earns \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars from babysitting.

Now, let's calculate how much money Sara earns from mowing the lawn:
- She earns $4 each time she mows the lawn.

Sara already has $10 saved. To find out how much more money she needs to earn, we subtract the amount she already has from the total cost of the items:
- The total cost is $70, and she already has $10, so she needs \(70 - 10 = 60\) dollars more.

Let's denote the number of times Sara needs to mow the lawn as \(x\). Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, the total amount she earns from mowing the lawn is \(4x\). We need this amount to be at least $60:
\[4x \geq 60\]

To find \(x\), we solve the inequality:
\[x \geq \frac{60}{4} = 15\]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn at least 15 times to afford the jacket and shoes. The final numerical answer is:
\[15\]"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \). According to the problem, the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day. Additionally, it is given that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which can be expressed as:

\[ w = r + 2 \]

The total number of eggs collected each day can be expressed as:

\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation:

\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify and solve for \( r \):

\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens. To verify, we can calculate the number of white chickens and the total eggs collected:

\[ w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \]
\[ 3r + 5w = 3(4) + 5(6) = 12 + 30 = 42 \]

The calculations confirm that the solution is correct. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park, as that is the distance he walks. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park are 1.5 miles by 6 miles, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (1.5 + 6) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the distance (15 miles) and speed (3 miles/hour) into the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{15}{3} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park."
"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of customers on the second day.
2. Calculate the total number of customers over the three days.
3. Find the number of customers on the third day by subtracting the total number of customers on the first and second days from the total number of customers over the three days.

First, we know that on the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than on the first day. Therefore, the number of customers on the second day is:
\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \]

Next, we know the total number of customers over the three days is 500. To find the number of customers on the third day, we subtract the number of customers on the first and second days from the total number of customers over the three days:
\[ 500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250 \]

So, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is:

"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons.

From the information given, we know that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Since the pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons. According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
Simplifying this equation, we get:
\[ B + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ B = 2S + 16 \]

Now, we know that the current amount of water in the big pool is four times the current amount of water in the small pool. So, we can write the equation:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have two equations:
1. \( B = 2S + 16 \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

We can set these two equations equal to each other since they both equal \( B \):
\[ 2S + 16 = 4S \]
Solving for \( S \), we get:
\[ 16 = 2S \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool currently has 8 gallons of water. Let's verify this by finding the amount of water in the big pool. If \( S = 8 \), then:
\[ B = 4S = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( 8 + 16 = 24 \) gallons and the big pool had \( 32 + 16 = 48 \) gallons. Indeed, 48 is twice 24, which confirms our solution is correct.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to make her purchase, we first need to calculate the total cost of the pair of shoes and the matching belt.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

So, the total cost of the purchase is $352.00. Lori earns $8.00 per hour at her part-time job. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44.00 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She promised to return the original $2000 plus an additional 10% of that amount.

The additional amount is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she promised to return is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Janeth is paying $165 per month for 12 months. The total amount she will pay over 12 months is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she promised to return to find her remaining balance:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance by the end of 12 months will be:
\[ 220 \]"

"To find the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years, we first need to determine their current ages.

Given:
- Harriet's current age is 21 years.
- Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age.
- Harriet is half the age of Zack.

First, calculate Adrian's current age:
\[ \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years} \]

Next, calculate Zack's current age:
\[ \text{Harriet's age} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Zack's age} \]
\[ 21 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Zack's age} \]
\[ \text{Zack's age} = 21 \times 2 = 42 \text{ years} \]

Now, calculate their ages in three years:
- Adrian's age in three years: \( 63 + 3 = 66 \)
- Harriet's age in three years: \( 21 + 3 = 24 \)
- Zack's age in three years: \( 42 + 3 = 45 \)

Finally, calculate the average age of the three in three years:

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna, and then subtract the points scored by Naomi and Yuri from the total points.

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. So, Yuri's score is:
   \[
   \text{Yuri's score} = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44
   \]
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna's score is:
   \[
   \text{Brianna's score} = 68 + 17 = 85
   \]

Now, we add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[
\text{Total points by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna} = 68 + 44 + 85 = 197
\]

The total points scored by all four students is 251. Therefore, Jojo's score is:
\[
\text{Jojo's score} = 251 - 197 = 54

"First, let's calculate the total number of cards James has after the changes:

- Initial fire type cards: 30
- Initial grass type cards: 20
- Initial water type cards: 40

After losing 8 water type cards:
- Water type cards left: 40 - 8 = 32

After buying 14 new grass type cards:
- Grass type cards now: 20 + 14 = 34

Now, the total number of cards James has is:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 34
- Water type: 32

Total number of cards = 30 + 34 + 32 = 96

The number of water type cards left is 32. To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Students through exit A} = 1000 \times \frac{30}{100} = 300 \]

After students went through exit A, the remaining number of students is:

\[ \text{Remaining students} = 1000 - 300 = 700 \]

Next, we calculate the number of students who went out through exit B. According to the problem, 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B:

\[ \text{Students through exit B} = 700 \times \frac{3}{5} = 420 \]

The number of students who went out through exit C is the rest of the students after those who went through exits A and B. So, we subtract the number of students who went through exits A and B from the total number of students:

\[ \text{Students through exit C} = 1000 - 300 - 420 = 280 \]

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
"To solve this problem, let's start by determining how many candies Robert has. We know that John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find out how many candies Robert has:

\[ \text{John's candies} = 2 \times \text{Robert's candies} \]
\[ 54 = 2 \times \text{Robert's candies} \]
\[ \text{Robert's candies} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Now that we know Robert has 27 candies, we can determine how many candies James has. We know that James has 6 more candies than Robert:

\[ \text{James's candies} = \text{Robert's candies} + 6 \]
\[ \text{James's candies} = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Next, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's candies} - \text{James's candies} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

So, John has 21 more candies than James. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 21 \]"
"Dolly has 2 books and reads them all. She also reads Pandora's book, so she reads 2 + 1 = 3 books in total. Pandora has 1 book and reads it all, and she also reads Dolly's book, so she reads 1 + 1 = 2 books in total. Together, Dolly and Pandora read 3 + 2 = 5 books by the end.

The final numerical answer is 5."
"First, let's determine the number of pen pals Mike has left after stopping being pen pals with 2 of them. Initially, he had 5 pen pals, so after stopping being pen pals with 2, he has:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals} \]

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each pen pal sends:

\[ 2 \text{ letters/week} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 10 \text{ pages/week} \]

Since there are 3 pen pals, the total number of pages sent by all pen pals in a week is:

\[ 3 \text{ pen pals} \times 10 \text{ pages/pen pal/week} = 30 \text{ pages/week} \]

Mike responds in kind, so he also writes 30 pages a week. Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. Therefore, the time he spends writing 30 pages is:

\[ 30 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine how many minutes Jason has left on his phone plan, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he has used and then subtract that from his plan's total.

First, calculate the total number of minutes Jason has used:
- Jason uses 15 minutes per day for his boss.
- There are 30 days in the month.

So, the total minutes used for his boss calls is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Additionally, Jason has used 300 extra minutes for other people.

Therefore, the total minutes used in the month is:
\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Jason's phone plan allows for 1000 minutes per month. To find out how many minutes he has left, subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes allowed:
\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Jason has 250 minutes left."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin initially had 24 fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin had \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Now Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, so Colby took \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. Now Griffin has \(9 - 2 = 7\) fries left.
5. After receiving fries from Ginger, Griffin had 27 fries. So, the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin is \(27 - 7 = 20\).

Therefore, the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin is 20."
"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( F \).

Given:
- There are 4 snails in the first aquarium.
- There are 32 snails in the second aquarium.
- The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in both aquariums.
- Both aquariums have the same number of fish.

First, calculate the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums:
\[ 32 - 4 = 28 \]

According to the problem, this difference is twice the number of fish in both aquariums:
\[ 28 = 2 \times (2F) \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]

Now, solve for \( F \):
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ F = 7 \]

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 7 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist works for the movie:

6 hours/day * 4 days/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours

Next, let's calculate the total cost before the discount:

120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000

Now, let's calculate the discount amount:

10% of $30,000 = 0.10 * $30,000 = $3,000

Finally, let's calculate the total cost after the discount:

$30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

So, Jean paid $27,000."
"First, we need to calculate the total amount Isabelle spent on the party supplies. We do this by adding up all the individual expenses:

"First, let's determine how many cookies Sue's sister ate each day.

On Monday, her sister ate 5 cookies.
On Tuesday, her sister ate 13 cookies.

Next, we calculate how many cookies Sue ate each day based on the information given.

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cookies} \]

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister:
\[ 2 \times 13 = 26 \text{ cookies} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate over the two days.

Sue's total cookies:
\[ 20 \text{ (Monday)} + 26 \text{ (Tuesday)} = 46 \text{ cookies} \]

Her sister's total cookies:
\[ 5 \text{ (Monday)} + 13 \text{ (Tuesday)} = 18 \text{ cookies} \]

Each cookie has 200 calories. Therefore, we calculate the total calories consumed by each.

Sue's total calories:
\[ 46 \text{ cookies} \times 200 \text{ calories/cookie} = 9200 \text{ calories} \]

Her sister's total calories:
\[ 18 \text{ cookies} \times 200 \text{ calories/cookie} = 3600 \text{ calories} \]

Finally, we find the difference in calories consumed:
\[ 9200 \text{ calories} - 3600 \text{ calories} = 5600 \text{ calories} \]

So, Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister."
"First, let's determine the total number of students in the school. Since each class has 20 students and there are 3 classes, the total number of students is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

Given that the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the number of boys and girls in the school is:
\[ \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ boys and } 30 \text{ girls} \]

For the first class, there are 15 girls, so the number of boys in the first class is:
\[ 20 - 15 = 5 \text{ boys} \]

For the second class, there are 12 girls, so the number of boys in the second class is:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ boys} \]

Now, let's find out how many boys are in the third class. The total number of boys in the school is 30, and we already know the number of boys in the first and second classes:
\[ 5 \text{ boys in the first class} + 8 \text{ boys in the second class} = 13 \text{ boys} \]

Therefore, the number of boys in the third class is:
\[ 30 - 13 = 17 \text{ boys} \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Previous Night's Kill:**
   - Wolves: 10
   - Cougars: 15

2. **Today's Kill:**
   - Let the number of cougars killed today be \( c \).
   - According to the problem, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, so the number of wolves killed today is \( 3c \).
   - Also, Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, so the number of cougars killed today is \( 15 - 3 = 12 \).

3. **Calculating Today's Wolves:**
   - Since today's cougars are 12, the number of wolves killed today is \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \).

4. **Total Animals Killed:**
   - Wolves killed in total: \( 10 \text{ (previous night)} + 36 \text{ (today)} = 46 \)
   - Cougars killed in total: \( 15 \text{ (previous night)} + 12 \text{ (today)} = 27 \)

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many times Anne went down the water slide.
2. Use the number of times Anne went down the water slide to find out how many times Robert went down the water slide.

First, we know that Mitchel went down the water slide 30 times. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. To find out how many times Anne went down the slide, we calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30:

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.30 \times 30 = 9 \]

So, Anne went down the slide:

\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \text{ times} \]

Next, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. Therefore, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4:

\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

So, Robert went down the water slide 84 times. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 84 \]"
"Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, which totals to:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows, so the total number of cows becomes:
\[ 200 + 40 = 240 \text{ cows} \]

These 40 new cows are divided equally into the 20 stalls, so each stall gets:
\[ \frac{40}{20} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. Since each stall has 2 cows, 8 stalls will have:
\[ 8 \times 2 = 16 \text{ cows} \]

So, Brady has $45.00 in his piggy bank."
"First, we need to determine the total length of the redwood tree in feet, which is given as 200 feet.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before any damage. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can find the total weight by dividing the total length of the tree by the length of each section and then multiplying by the weight per section.

\[
\text{Total weight before damage} = \left(\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}}\right) \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 20 \times 400 = 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to account for the damage caused by the termites. The termites ate 30% of the tree's wood, which means 70% of the tree remains. We calculate the remaining weight as follows:

\[
\text{Remaining weight} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70 = 5600 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the final weight of the redwood tree is:

"Let's denote the number of apples Jamal has as \( J_a \) and the number of bananas Jamal has as \( J_b \).

From the information given:
1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, so if Andrea has 52 apples, then Jamal has \( 52 - 8 = 44 \) apples.
2. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so \( J_b = J_a + 4 \).
3. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so if Jamal has \( J_b \) bananas, then Andrea has \( \frac{J_b}{2} \) bananas. Since Andrea has 52 apples, we can use this to find the number of bananas Jamal has.

First, let's find the number of bananas Jamal has:
\[ J_b = J_a + 4 = 44 + 4 = 48 \]

Now, let's find the number of bananas Andrea has:
\[ \text{Andrea's bananas} = \frac{J_b}{2} = \frac{48}{2} = 24 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits:
- Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas.
- Jamal has 44 apples and 48 bananas.

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, which totals to:
\[ 36 + 30 = 66 \text{ cookies} \]

We know that 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies. To find out how many cups of flour are needed for 66 cookies, we can set up a proportion based on the given ratio:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{66 \text{ cookies}} \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 66 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} \]
\[ x = \frac{132}{12} \]
\[ x = 11 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow."
"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we first need to calculate how many pennies are in two thirds of the total pennies.

Given that there are 9,300 pennies in the cup, we calculate two thirds of 9,300 as follows:

\[
\text{Number of pennies in the stack} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9300
\]

Let's perform the multiplication:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9300 = 2 \times \frac{9300}{3} = 2 \times 3100 = 6200
\]

So, there are 6,200 pennies in the stack.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, the total dollar amount in the stack is:

"First, let's calculate the total price of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

The selling price of the house is $350,000.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price:
\[ \text{Brokerage Fee} = 350,000 \times \frac{5}{100} = 350,000 \times 0.05 = 17,500 \]

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price:
\[ \text{Transfer Fee} = 350,000 \times \frac{12}{100} = 350,000 \times 0.12 = 42,000 \]

Now, let's add the brokerage fee and the transfer fee to the selling price to get the total price of the house:
\[ \text{Total Price} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500 \]

Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. To find out how much more the total price of the house is than her budget, we subtract her budget from the total price:
\[ \text{Difference} = 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500 \]

So, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget."
"First, let's calculate the transfer fees. The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Transfer Fees} = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000 \]

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee. The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000 \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount paid for the transfer fees and the brokerage fee.

\[ \text{Total Fees} = 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000 \]

Mr. Tan also paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount of the house. To find the net proceeds, we subtract the total fees and the loan amount from the selling price.

\[ \text{Net Proceeds} = 400,000 - 32,000 - 250,000 = 118,000 \]

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is $118,000."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes for the oil to heat up to 400 degrees. We know it takes 20 minutes to heat the oil to 300 degrees, and it then takes 40% longer to heat it to 400 degrees.

40% of 20 minutes is:
\[ 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the additional time needed to heat the oil to 400 degrees is 8 minutes. Therefore, the total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that it takes 5 minutes less time to cook the chicken than it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees. So, the cooking time is:
\[ 28 - 5 = 23 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees and the time it took to cook the chicken:
\[ 28 + 23 = 51 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken is:

\[ \text{Cost of newspaper ads} = 50 \times 5 = 250 \]

The cost for the television ads is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Cost of television ads} = \text{Number of television ads} \times \text{Cost per television ad} \]
\[ \text{Cost of television ads} = 15 \times 75 = 1125 \]

Now, we add the two costs together to get the total amount spent:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of newspaper ads} + \text{Cost of television ads} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 250 + 1125 = 1375 \]

So, the real estate agent spent a total of $1375 on buying all the ads."

"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and then sum them up.

1. The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
2. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has \(300 + 12 = 312\) M&Ms.
3. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, so it has \(300 / 2 = 150\) M&Ms.

Now, we sum the M&Ms from all three bags:
\[ 300 + 312 + 150 = 762 \]

So, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"To find the total number of windows in both houses, we need to consider the windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows in each house.

Each house has 3 bedrooms, and each bedroom has 2 windows. Therefore, the number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is:
\[ 3 \text{ bedrooms/house} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows/house} \]

Additionally, each house has 4 windows that are not connected to the bedrooms. So, the total number of windows in one house is:
\[ 6 \text{ windows (bedrooms)} + 4 \text{ windows (additional)} = 10 \text{ windows/house} \]

Since John has 2 houses, the total number of windows in both houses is:

"First, let's determine the number of stitches for each part of the sweater:

- The collar takes a tenth of the stitches for the body of the sweater. Since the body takes 900 stitches, the collar takes \( \frac{900}{10} = 90 \) stitches.
- The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar. Since the collar takes 90 stitches, the rosette takes \( 90 \times 2 = 180 \) stitches.

Now, let's calculate the total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette:
- Collar: 90 stitches
- Rosette: 180 stitches

Adding these together gives:
\[ 90 + 180 = 270 \text{ stitches} \]

The total number of stitches for the whole sweater is 1800. Subtracting the stitches used for the collar and the rosette from the total gives the number of stitches used for the body and the sleeves:
\[ 1800 - 270 = 1530 \text{ stitches} \]

Since the sweater has two sleeves, the number of stitches for each sleeve is:
\[ \frac{1530}{2} = 765 \text{ stitches} \]

So, each sleeve takes 765 stitches. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 765 \]"
"To calculate the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the cost for the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately, and then add them together.

The cost for the tomato seeds is:
20 packets * $40/packet = $800

The cost for the celery seeds is:
80 packets * $30/packet = $2400

Adding these together gives the total cost:
$800 + $2400 = $3200

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the number of lines Sean has to memorize for each part of his role.

1. **Solo Song:**
   The solo song has 54 lines, and Sean has to memorize all of them.
   \[
   \text{Lines for the solo song} = 54
   \]

2. **First Scene:**
   The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song.
   \[
   \text{Lines for the first scene} = 2 \times 54 = 108
   \]
   Only a third of the lines in the first scene are Sean's lines.
   \[
   \text{Sean's lines for the first scene} = \frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36
   \]

3. **Second Scene:**
   The second scene has six more lines than the solo song.
   \[
   \text{Lines for the second scene} = 54 + 6 = 60
   \]
   Four-fifths of the lines in the second scene are Sean's lines.
   \[
   \text{Sean's lines for the second scene} = \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48
   \]

Now, let's add up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
\[
\text{Total lines Sean has to memorize} = 54 + 36 + 48 = 138
\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
138

"First, let's find out how many cards had the letter A on them. Since 2/5 of the cards had the letter A, we calculate:

\[ \text{Cards with letter A} = \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \]

Next, we find out how many cards were left after removing the cards with the letter A:

\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 80 - 32 = 48 \]

Then, we determine how many of these remaining cards had the letter B on them. Since 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B, we calculate:

\[ \text{Cards with letter B} = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]

Now, we find out how many cards were left after removing the cards with the letter B:

\[ \text{Remaining cards after B} = 48 - 24 = 24 \]

Next, we determine how many of these remaining cards had the letter C on them. Since 5/8 of the remaining cards had the letter C, we calculate:

\[ \text{Cards with letter C} = \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \]

Finally, we find out how many cards had the letter D on them by subtracting the number of cards with letters A, B, and C from the total number of cards:

\[ \text{Cards with letter D} = 80 - (32 + 24 + 15) = 80 - 71 = 9 \]

So, the number of cards that had the letter D on them is 9."
"To calculate the total time Matthew will take to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we first calculate the time for each type of hole and then sum them up.

For the small holes:
- Time to dig one small hole = 3 minutes
- Number of small holes = 30
- Total time for small holes = 3 minutes/hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes

For the large holes:
- Time to dig one large hole = 10 minutes
- Number of large holes = 15
- Total time for large holes = 10 minutes/hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes

Now, we add the total time for both types of holes:
- Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert the total time from minutes to hours:
- Total time in hours = 240 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 4 hours."
"If the sum of Mico and Marco's current ages is 20, then in 10 years, their ages will each increase by 10 years. Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

\[ 20 + 10 + 10 = 40 \]

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40."
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, which can be written as:
\[ R = 6S \]
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. This can be written as:
\[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]
Expanding the right side of the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
Subtracting \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]
Subtracting 9 from both sides:
\[ 3S = 18 \]
Dividing both sides by 3:
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old. To verify, if Sam is 6 years old, then Ruby is \( 6 \times 6 = 36 \) years old. In 9 years, Sam will be \( 6 + 9 = 15 \) years old and Ruby will be \( 36 + 9 = 45 \) years old. Indeed, 45 is 3 times 15, confirming our solution is correct.

The final numerical answer is:

Next, let's calculate the cost of the ice cream bars. Peter bought 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each. The total cost for the ice cream bars is:
\[ 4 \times 0.50 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars to find the total amount Peter paid:
\[ 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Peter paid is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of spots a mamba has. Since a cobra has 70 spots and a mamba has half as many spots as a cobra, a mamba has:

\[ \text{Spots per mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and all the mambas. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, so the total number of spots for the cobras is:

\[ \text{Total spots for cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots, so the total number of spots for the mambas is:

\[ \text{Total spots for mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Now, we find the combined total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas:

\[ \text{Total spots combined} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of the total number of spots:

\[ \text{Half the total spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 2450 \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of people who will be eating the pizza.

- There are 12 team members.
- There are 3 coaches.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so \(12 \text{ team members} \times 2 \text{ guests/team member} = 24 \text{ guests}\).

Adding these together, the total number of people is:
\[ 12 \text{ team members} + 3 \text{ coaches} + 24 \text{ guests} = 39 \text{ people} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Each pizza serves 3 people, so we divide the total number of people by the number of people each pizza can serve:
\[ \frac{39 \text{ people}}{3 \text{ people/pizza}} = 13 \text{ pizzas} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Each pizza costs $15, so:
\[ 13 \text{ pizzas} \times 15 \text{ dollars/pizza} = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Maddy will spend \(\boxed{195}\) dollars."
"To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to calculate the total length used by the topaz gemstones and then find out how much space is left for the sterling silver beads.

First, calculate the total length used by the topaz gemstones:
- Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long.
- Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace.
- Therefore, the total length used by the topaz gemstones is \( 8 \times 1 = 8 \) inches.

Next, determine the remaining length for the sterling silver beads:
- The total length of the necklace is 25 inches.
- The length used by the topaz gemstones is 8 inches.
- Therefore, the remaining length for the sterling silver beads is \( 25 - 8 = 17 \) inches.

Now, calculate the number of sterling silver beads:
- Each sterling silver bead is 0.25 inches long.
- The remaining length for the sterling silver beads is 17 inches.
- Therefore, the number of sterling silver beads is \( \frac{17}{0.25} = 68 \).

"To find the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot altogether, we need to calculate the number of stories each wrote in both weeks and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of stories each wrote in the second week:
- Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week and doubled that in the second week, so she wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories in the second week.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week and doubled that in the second week, so he wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories in the second week.
- Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week and doubled that in the second week, so she wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories in the second week.

Next, we sum up the total number of stories written by each of them:
- Alani wrote \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories in total.
- Braylen wrote \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories in total.
- Margot wrote \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories in total.

Finally, we add up the total number of stories written by all three:
\[60 + 120 + 180 = 360\]

So, the total number of stories they wrote altogether is 360."

"To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we first need to calculate the total number of stars accounted for by the rows of 8 and 6 stars, and then subtract that from the total number of stars on the flag.

The total number of stars on the flag is 76. There are three rows of 8 stars and two rows of 6 stars. Let's calculate the number of stars in these rows:

- Three rows of 8 stars: \(3 \times 8 = 24\)
- Two rows of 6 stars: \(2 \times 6 = 12\)

Adding these together gives the total number of stars in the rows of 8 and 6 stars:

\[24 + 12 = 36\]

Now, we subtract the number of stars in these rows from the total number of stars on the flag to find out how many stars are in the rows of 5 stars:

\[76 - 36 = 40\]

Since each row of 5 stars contains 5 stars, we divide the remaining number of stars by 5 to find the number of rows of 5 stars:

\[40 \div 5 = 8\]

Therefore, the number of rows of 5 stars is 8."
"First, we need to calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so:

\[ 80 \text{ flagstones} \times 75 \text{ pounds/flagstone} = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how many trucks are required to transport 6000 pounds, given that each truck can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds. We do this by dividing the total weight by the capacity of one truck:

\[ \frac{6000 \text{ pounds}}{2000 \text{ pounds/truck}} = 3 \text{ trucks} \]

Therefore, the number of trucks needed is 3."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, the speed of the car in the slow lane is:

\[ \text{Speed of slow lane car} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it took the car in the fast lane to travel 480 miles. The time taken can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the fast lane:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{fast lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at a constant speed of 30 miles/hour and it is covering the same distance of 480 miles, the time taken by the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance can be calculated as:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{slow lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

\[ 16 \text{ hours} \]"
"To find out how many medals have been given out for counting, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of medals Izzy has.
2. Calculate the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together.
3. Use the information that this total is 10 times less than the number of medals given out to find the total number of medals given out.

First, let's find out how many medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, we can calculate:

\[ \text{Medals Izzy has} = 22 - 5 = 17 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:

\[ \text{Total medals Ali and Izzy have} = 22 + 17 = 39 \]

According to the problem, this total (39 medals) is 10 times less than the number of medals given out. This means the number of medals given out is 10 times the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have:

\[ \text{Total medals given out} = 39 \times 10 = 390 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 390 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available:

- Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars.
- There are 8 packets.

So, the total number of chocolate bars is:

Next, let's determine how many chocolate bars the adults will get:

- There are 4 adults.
- Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars.

So, the total number of chocolate bars for the adults is:
\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars/adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, we can find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children:

\[ 40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

There are 8 children, and we need to share the remaining 16 chocolate bars equally among them:

\[ \frac{16 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars/child} \]

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars."
"Susan works for 3 hours in total, but she takes a 30-minute break. Therefore, she works for 3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she works for 2.5 * 60 = 150 minutes. She earns $5 every 10 minutes, so the number of 10-minute intervals in 150 minutes is 150 / 10 = 15. Therefore, she earns 15 * $5 = $75.

The final numerical answer is $75."
"First, let's determine the initial points for each player:

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Next, we check if any of the players get an extra point in the fourth round. According to the rules, a player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points.

- Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so Mike gets an extra point.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so Jim does not get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so Tony gets an extra point.

Now, we add the extra points to their initial points:

- Mike's new total is \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
- Jim's new total remains \(18\) points.
- Tony's new total is \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

Finally, we calculate the total points for all three players:

\[22 + 18 + 43 = 83\]

So, the total points for all three players after the extra points had been distributed is 83."

- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates

Let's add up the crates sold from Tuesday to Thursday:
15 crates (Tuesday) + 12 crates (Wednesday) + 18 crates (Thursday) = 45 crates

Now, we add the crates sold over the weekend:
45 crates (from Tuesday to Thursday) + 20 crates (over the weekend) = 65 crates

Sam's target was to sell 120 crates in the week. To find out how many crates he was off by, we subtract the total crates sold from the target:

\text{Afternoon and evening sales combined} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
\]

Since the loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[
\text{Afternoon sales} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ loaves}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[

"To determine how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week, we first need to find out how much weight Joey loses in a single week.

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. Therefore, the amount of weight Joey loses in one week is:
\[ \text{Weight lost by Joey in one week} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week, we can calculate the total weight Sandy needs to lose:
\[ \text{Weight Sandy needs to lose} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 8 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to determine how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds. Since Sandy loses 2 pounds per week, the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds is:
\[ \text{Number of weeks for Sandy} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds per week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the savings on the ice cream. The original price of one tub of ice cream is $13, and it is now sold at $11. The discount per tub is:

\[ 13 - 11 = 2 \]

So, the discount per tub of ice cream is $2. If you buy 2 tubs of ice cream, the total savings on the ice cream will be:

\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \]

Next, let's calculate the savings on the milk. The discount on one packet of milk is $0.5. If you buy 4 packets of milk, the total savings on the milk will be:

\[ 0.5 \times 4 = 2 \]

Now, we add the savings from the ice cream and the milk to find the total savings:

\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \]

So, the total amount saved if you buy 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To determine the number of new limbs Helena's serum will cause a person to grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and extra legs that grow based on the given growth rates.

The serum makes a person grow an extra arm every three days. So, in fifteen days, the number of extra arms grown is:
\[ \frac{15}{3} = 5 \]

The serum makes a person grow an extra leg every five days. So, in fifteen days, the number of extra legs grown is:
\[ \frac{15}{5} = 3 \]

Therefore, the total number of new limbs grown after fifteen days is the sum of the extra arms and extra legs:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \]

The final numerical answer is:
8"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
6 business suits at $100 each = 6 * $100 = $600

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
3 suitcases at $50 each = 3 * $50 = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit:
5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500
The cost of the flight ticket = $500 + $700 = $1200

Now, let's add up all the costs:
Cost of business suits = $600
Cost of suitcases = $150
Cost of flight ticket = $1200
Total cost = $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

The total amount Theo wishes to spend on the trip is $6000. He wants to save $2000 for the trip, so the amount he can spend on the trip is:
$6000 - $2000 = $4000

Now, we subtract the total cost of the items he has already bought from the amount he can spend on the trip to find out how much he can spend on gifts:
Amount to spend on gifts = $4000 - $1950 = $2050

The final numerical answer is $2050."
"To determine the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, let's calculate the daily egg consumption:
- Three people eat 3 eggs each day, so they consume \(3 \times 3 = 9\) eggs per day.
- The remaining two people eat 2 eggs each day, so they consume \(2 \times 2 = 4\) eggs per day.
- Therefore, the total daily egg consumption for the family is \(9 + 4 = 13\) eggs per day.

Next, we calculate the weekly egg consumption:
- Since they eat eggs every day, the weekly egg consumption is \(13 \times 7 = 91\) eggs.

So, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week."
"If Quinn is 30 years old, and Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, then Jane is:

\[ 30 - 3 = 27 \text{ years old} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 32."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera's current age is 46 years.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old six years ago.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since six years have passed, Noah's current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Let the current population of Chile be \(P\).
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was \(P / 2\).

4. **Relate the population of Chile six years ago to Noah's age:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age.
   - Therefore, \(P / 2 = 3000 \times 20\).

5. **Calculate the current population of Chile:**
   - Solve for \(P\):
     \[
     P / 2 = 3000 \times 20
     \]
     \[
     P / 2 = 60000
     \]
     \[
     P = 60000 \times 2

     \[
     P = 120000
     \]

The population of Chile now is 120000."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so it is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players in the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve for \( D \), we first combine the terms on the left side of the equation:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 3D + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{6D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{7D}{2} \]

So the equation becomes:
\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

To isolate \( D \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Then we divide both sides by 7:
\[ D = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha initially invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\)
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\)

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we need to account for the people who couldn't come due to illness and those with previous commitments:

- 8 people couldn't come due to illness.
- 1/4 of the 8 people with illness had previous commitments, which is \(8 \div 4 = 2\).

So, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Therefore, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is \(24 - 10 = 14\).

The final numerical answer is:
14"
"First, let's calculate the number of marbles Solomon received from his father. Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna. His father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Therefore, the number of marbles Solomon received from his father is:

"First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Height (depth) = 5 feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 5 = 120 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is given as $0.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The number of girls is 3 times the number of boys.
2. The number of nongendered children is 1/10 the number of boys.
3. The classroom has 30 boys.

First, calculate the number of girls:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 3 \times \text{Number of boys} = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

Next, calculate the number of nongendered children:
\[ \text{Number of nongendered children} = \frac{1}{10} \times \text{Number of boys} = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3 \]

Now, add up all the children in the classroom:
\[ \text{Total number of children} = \text{Number of boys} + \text{Number of girls} + \text{Number of nongendered children} \]
\[ \text{Total number of children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 \]

"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and there are 45 electric wires, we can find the number of electric poles by understanding that for every 3 wires, there is 1 pole.

To find the number of poles, we can set up a proportion based on the given ratio:

\[ \frac{\text{Number of poles}}{\text{Number of wires}} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Given that the number of wires is 45, we can substitute this value into the proportion:

\[ \frac{\text{Number of poles}}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \]

To find the number of poles, we can solve for the number of poles by multiplying both sides of the equation by 45:

\[ \text{Number of poles} = 45 \times \frac{1}{3} \]

\[ \text{Number of poles} = 15 \]

So, the total number of electric poles required is 15."
"At the beginning, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 25 + 15 = 40 people.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left, which means 1/4 * 40 = 10 people left.

If 22 men stayed at the party, this means that 22 - 10 = 12 men left the party.

Since 12 men left, 25 - 12 = 13 men are left at the party.

The number of women left at the party is the same as the number of women who were there initially, which is 15.

So, the number of women left at the party is 15."
"First, we need to determine the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book and the book costs $4, we can calculate the cost of the magazine as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of magazine} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cost of book} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of the pen, which is $1 less than the cost of the magazine. Therefore:

\[ \text{Cost of pen} = \text{Cost of magazine} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 \]

So, the cost of the pen is $1."

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the weakening of the coffee due to the cooling and the addition of cream.

First, let's calculate the weakening due to the cooling. Each degree of cooling weakens the coffee by 12 milliliters. If Shannon cools the coffee by 65 degrees, the weakening due to cooling is:
\[ 65 \text{ degrees} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/degree} = 780 \text{ milliliters} \]

Next, we need to consider the weakening due to the addition of cream. Adding 15 milliliters of cream weakens the coffee by 12 milliliters. Therefore, the weakening due to the addition of cream is:
\[ 15 \text{ milliliters} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/15 milliliters} = 12 \text{ milliliters} \]

Now, we add the weakening due to cooling and the weakening due to the addition of cream to find the total weakening:
\[ 780 \text{ milliliters} + 12 \text{ milliliters} = 792 \text{ milliliters} \]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is 792 milliliters weaker when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of junior and senior programmers.

Given that the total number of employees is 100 and the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:
\[ \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers is:
\[ \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Next, we know that each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total amount paid to junior programmers per month is:
\[ \text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

The senior programmers are paid $400 more than the junior programmers, so each senior programmer is paid:
\[ \text{Payment to each senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400 \]

Therefore, the total amount paid to senior programmers per month is:
\[ \text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

Finally, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers:
\[ \text{Total payment to all programmers} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 224000 \]"
"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the number of people on the bus becomes \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on, so the number of people on the bus becomes \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).

We are given that there were a total of 20 people heading to the third stop, which means that at the second bus stop, there were 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( 14 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has:
\[ 24 - 2 = 22 \]
lollipops left.

He passes 14 lollipops to his friends, so he has:
\[ 22 - 14 = 8 \]
lollipops left.

He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is:
\[ 2 \times 14 = 28 \]
So, he adds these to the 8 lollipops he has left:
\[ 8 + 28 = 36 \]
lollipops.

He eats 3 more that night and 2 more in the morning, so he eats:
\[ 3 + 2 = 5 \]
lollipops in total.

Therefore, the number of lollipops Oscar has left is:

The final numerical answer is 31."
"The phone is currently at 60% charged and needs to reach 100% charged. The recharging rate is 1 percentage point per 3 minutes. To find out how many percentage points are needed to fully charge the phone, we subtract the current charge from 100%:

100% - 60% = 40%

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, it will take:

40% * 3 minutes/percentage point = 120 minutes

To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60:

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

So, the final numerical answer is 2 hours."

"First, let's calculate the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip where they spent $80. For every $20 spent, they get $1 off their next purchase. So, for $80 spent, they would earn:

\[ \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ rewards} \]

Each reward is worth $1 off their next purchase. So, they earned 4 rewards, which means they get $4 off their next purchase.

Next, let's calculate the rewards they earned from their current shopping trip where they spent $43. For every $20 spent, they get $1 off their next purchase. So, for $43 spent, they would earn:

\[ \frac{43}{20} = 2.15 \]

Since they can only earn whole rewards, they would earn 2 rewards. This means they get $2 off their next purchase.

However, they used their rewards and applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. So, the $2 rewards were reduced by $4 (twice the amount of rewards).

Now, let's calculate the total amount they paid after applying the rewards and the coupon:

\[ 43 - 2 - 4 = 37 \]

So, the customer paid $37 on this shopping trip.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 37 \]"
"First, let's calculate the net pay for Job A.

Job A pays $15 per hour for 2000 hours a year, so the gross pay is:
\[ 15 \times 2000 = 30000 \text{ dollars} \]

The state tax rate is 20%, so the tax Nick pays is:
\[ 30000 \times 0.20 = 6000 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the net pay for Job A is:
\[ 30000 - 6000 = 24000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the net pay for Job B.

Job B pays $42,000 a year, but there is a $6,000 property tax, so the net income after property tax is:
\[ 42000 - 6000 = 36000 \text{ dollars} \]

Job B has a 10% tax rate on the net income after property tax, so the tax Nick pays is:
\[ 36000 \times 0.10 = 3600 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the net pay for Job B is:
\[ 36000 - 3600 = 32400 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we find the difference in net pay between the two jobs:
\[ 32400 - 24000 = 8400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Nick will make $8400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate compared to the other job."

"First, let's calculate the total cost for each offer.

For Furniture United:
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 installments of $350 each

Total cost for Furniture United = Advance payment + (Number of installments * Monthly installment amount)
Total cost for Furniture United = $1,350 + (6 * $350)
Total cost for Furniture United = $1,350 + $2,100
Total cost for Furniture United = $3,450

For Cozy Homes:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 installments of $250 each

Total cost for Cozy Homes = Advance payment + (Number of installments * Monthly installment amount)
Total cost for Cozy Homes = $1,100 + (9 * $250)
Total cost for Cozy Homes = $1,100 + $2,250
Total cost for Cozy Homes = $3,350

Now, let's find the cost difference between the two offers.

Cost difference = Total cost for Furniture United - Total cost for Cozy Homes
Cost difference = $3,450 - $3,350
Cost difference = $100

The cost difference between the two offers is $100."

For the fudge:
- Each batch requires 70 ounces of sugar.
- For 1 batch, the total sugar required is \( 70 \times 1 = 70 \) ounces.

Now, we add the sugar required for the suckers and the fudge:
- Total sugar required = sugar for suckers + sugar for fudge
- Total sugar required = 240 ounces + 70 ounces = 310 ounces.

The final numerical answer is 310 ounces."
"To find the final value of all Maria's shares, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the initial value of all shares.
2. Calculate the value of the shares after the first year's increase.
3. Calculate the value of the shares after the second year's decrease.

**Step 1: Initial value of all shares**
Maria buys 8 shares at $8 each.
\[ \text{Initial value} = 8 \times 8 = 64 \]

**Step 2: Value after the first year's increase**

"First, let's determine how many hot dogs Thomas ate. Since Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, we calculate:

\[ \text{Thomas's hot dogs} = 3 \times \text{Luke's hot dogs} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Next, we find out how many hot dogs John ate. John ate half the amount that Thomas ate, so:

\[ \text{John's hot dogs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Thomas's hot dogs} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \]

Now, to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number John ate:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's hot dogs} - \text{Luke's hot dogs} = 3 - 2 = 1 \]

So, John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The number of students in the smallest group would then be \( x - 10 \).

Given that the total number of students is 200, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two equal groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60."
"Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \) and the number of chickens as \( H \). According to the problem, the total number of animals is 60, and there are twice as many chickens as cows. This gives us the following equations:

\[ H + C = 60 \]
\[ H = 2C \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( C \):

\[ 2C + C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:

\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of legs. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:

\[ \text{Total legs} = (2 \times H) + (4 \times C) = (2 \times 40) + (4 \times 20) = 80 + 80 = 160 \]

\[ 1 \text{ ball/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 4 \text{ balls} \]

So, before the incident, he would have:

\[ 3 \text{ initial balls} + 4 \text{ added balls} = 7 \text{ balls} \]

However, when he walks on stage, he slips and drops 3 balls. Therefore, the number of balls he has left to juggle is:

\[ 7 \text{ balls} - 3 \text{ dropped balls} = 4 \text{ balls} \]

So, with a sigh, Josh starts to juggle on stage with 4 balls. The final numerical answer is:

4"
"To solve this problem, let's first establish the weights of the animals based on the information given:

1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. The pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
3. The pink frog weighs the same as a green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
4. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs \(50 + 10 = 60\) pounds.
5. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than a red bird, so the red bird weighs \(50 - 20 = 30\) pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, including the container itself. The total weight is the sum of the weights of the pink frog, the blue beetle, the green toad, the yellow snake, the red bird, and the container:

\[
50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 \text{ pounds}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
260

"To find the total distance Tyson covered in June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the additional distance Tyson should run each day.
2. Determine the total distance Tyson runs each day after taking the coach's advice.
3. Calculate the total distance Tyson runs in a month (30 days in June).
4. Provide the final numerical answer.

Step 1: Calculate the additional distance Tyson should run each day.
The coach wants Tyson to run 1/5 times more meters than he currently runs. Since Tyson currently runs 5000 meters, the additional distance is:
\[ \text{Additional distance} = 5000 \times \frac{1}{5} = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

Step 2: Determine the total distance Tyson runs each day after taking the coach's advice.
\[ \text{Total distance per day} = 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total distance Tyson runs in a month (30 days in June).
\[ \text{Total distance in June} = 6000 \times 30 = 180000 \text{ meters} \]

Step 4: Provide the final numerical answer.
\[ \text{Final answer} = 180000 \]

The total distance Tyson covered in June is 180000 meters."
"First, let's determine the cost of each juice box:

- Juice Box A costs 4 dollars.
- Juice Box B costs 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, so Juice Box B costs 4 + 5 = 9 dollars.
- Juice Box C costs 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, so Juice Box C costs 4 + 7 = 11 dollars.

Now, to find out how much more Juice Box C costs than Juice Box B, we subtract the cost of Juice Box B from the cost of Juice Box C:

11 - 9 = 2

So, Juice Box C is 2 dollars more than Juice Box B. The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total number of legs, we need to multiply the number of tables by the number of legs per table and then sum the results for both types of tables.

For the 40 tables with 4 legs each:
\[ 40 \times 4 = 160 \text{ legs} \]

For the 50 tables with 3 legs each:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \text{ legs} \]

Now, we add the legs from both types of tables:
\[ 160 + 150 = 310 \text{ legs} \]

The total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is 310."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Jenny buys in a week:
\[ 1 \text{ bag} \times 36 \text{ cookies per bag} = 36 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, let's determine how many cookies Jenny puts in her son's lunch box over the week:
\[ 4 \text{ cookies/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 20 \text{ cookies} \]

Now, let's calculate how many cookies her husband eats over the week:
\[ 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ cookies} \]

Now, we can find out how many cookies are left for Jenny to eat by subtracting the cookies her son and husband ate from the total number of cookies:
\[ 36 \text{ cookies} - 20 \text{ cookies} - 7 \text{ cookies} = 9 \text{ cookies} \]

So, Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the shirts without any discount. Davos bought 2 shirts, each costing $30, so the total cost is:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Next, we need to apply the 40% discount. A 40% discount means Davos pays 60% of the original price. To find out how much he pays, we calculate 60% of $60:

\[ 60 \times 0.60 = 36 \]

So, the final amount Davos paid for the 2 shirts is:

"First, let's calculate the daily revenue from tractors:
- They sold 10 tractors a day.
- Each tractor was sold for $100.

So, the daily revenue from tractors is:
\[ 10 \text{ tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate the daily revenue from silos:
- They sell 5 silos a day.
- Each silo is sold for $220.

So, the daily revenue from silos is:
\[ 5 \text{ silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day} \]

Now, we need to find the percentage increase in daily revenue from making silos compared to making tractors:
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New revenue} - \text{Old revenue}}{\text{Old revenue}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\$1100 - \$1000}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{\$100}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage more they are making per day now is:
\[ 10\% \]"

1. **Food Cost per Month:**
   - Food costs $25 per week.
   - There are 4 weeks in a month.
   - Therefore, the monthly cost for food is \( 25 \times 4 = 100 \) dollars.

2. **Treats Cost per Month:**
   - Treats cost $20 per month.
   - Therefore, the monthly cost for treats is $20.

3. **Medicine Cost per Month:**
   - Medicine costs $100 per month.
   - Therefore, the monthly cost for medicine is $100.

4. **Total Monthly Cost:**
   - Adding the costs of food, treats, and medicine gives us the total monthly cost.
   - Total monthly cost = $100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $120.

5. **Total Annual Cost:**
   - To find the annual cost, we multiply the total monthly cost by 12.
   - Annual cost = $120 \times 12 = $1440.

Therefore, Madeline spends $1440 on her dog per year."

"First, let's determine the number of plant pots needed for the roses. Since the number of plant pots needed for the roses is twice the number needed for the daisies, and the daisies require 30 plant pots, the roses will need:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ plant pots} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of plant pots needed for both the daisies and the roses:

\[ 30 \text{ (daisies)} + 60 \text{ (roses)} = 90 \text{ plant pots} \]

April had already bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many plant pots she has left over, we subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number she already bought:

\[ 100 - 90 = 10 \text{ plant pots} \]

So, the number of plant pots April has left over is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Andrea started with $36.
2. She spent some money on a sweater that cost $11.
3. She also gave her brother $4.

To find out how much money she saved, we need to subtract the total amount she spent from the initial amount she had.

First, calculate the total amount spent:
\[ \text{Total spent} = \text{Cost of sweater} + \text{Amount given to brother} = 11 + 4 = 15 \]

Now, subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:
\[ \text{Amount saved} = \text{Initial amount} - \text{Total spent} = 36 - 15 = 21 \]

So, Andrea saved $21.

"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming.

Boating time: 6 hours
Swimming time: 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours

Total time for boating and swimming: 6 hours + 3 hours = 9 hours

Next, let's calculate the total time he spent watching the shows.

Number of shows: 3
Duration of each show: 2 hours
Total show time: 3 shows * 2 hours/show = 6 hours

The total show time (6 hours) is 30% of the total time he spent on all activities. Let's denote the total time spent on all activities as \( T \).

So, 30% of \( T \) is 6 hours:
\[ 0.30 \times T = 6 \]
\[ T = \frac{6}{0.30} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we know the total time spent on all activities is 20 hours. John spent 40% of his time sightseeing. Let's calculate the time spent sightseeing.

Time spent sightseeing: 40% of 20 hours
\[ 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time John spent sightseeing is 8 hours."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Annabelle will earn from her first job. She earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours, so her earnings from the first job are:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Annabelle will earn from her second job. She earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours, so her earnings from the second job are:
\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's find the total amount of money Annabelle will have after working at both jobs. She already has $80 in her savings, so her total savings will be:
\[ 80 + 200 + 75 = 355 \text{ dollars} \]

The phone costs $400, so the amount of money Annabelle still needs to save is:
\[ 400 - 355 = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 45 \]"
"First, let's determine the height of the second tree. Since the second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, and the shortest tree is 6 feet tall, the height of the second tree is:
\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the combined height of the shortest and the second tree:
\[ 6 + 11 = 17 \text{ feet} \]

The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and the second tree:
\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height of the tallest tree is 34 feet."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the toy cars. Dean bought 6 toy cars, and each toy car costs $2. So, the total cost for the toy cars is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the teddy bears. Dean bought 5 teddy bears, and each teddy bear costs $1. So, the total cost for the teddy bears is:
\[ 5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's find the total cost of the toys Dean bought:
\[ 12 + 5 = 17 \text{ dollars} \]

Dean initially had $28. After buying the toys, the amount of money he has left is:
\[ 28 - 17 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

"First, let's calculate the total cost for the mini-golf and go-karts:

- Cost for one round of mini-golf: $5
- Cost for two rides on go-karts: $10 * 2 = $20

So, the total cost for mini-golf and go-karts is $5 + $20 = $25.

Now, let's subtract this cost from the total budget to find out how much money is left for arcade tokens:

- Total budget: $90
- Cost for mini-golf and go-karts: $25

Money left for arcade tokens: $90 - $25 = $65.

Since each friend (including Morgan) gets $5 worth of arcade tokens, we can find out how many friends can be invited by dividing the remaining money by the cost per friend:

- Money left for arcade tokens: $65
- Cost per friend for arcade tokens: $5

Number of friends (including Morgan) that can be invited: $65 / $5 = 13.

Therefore, Morgan can invite 12 friends (since we are not counting herself)."
"First, let's calculate how much Marisa spends on lollipops each day. She buys 4 lollipops every day, and each lollipop costs 25 cents. So, the cost of lollipops per day is:

\[ 4 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 100 \text{ cents} \]

Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar, Marisa spends $1 on lollipops each day.

Next, let's determine how much money Marisa earns each day. She gets $5 as pocket money every day.

Now, we need to find out how much money she saves each day. This is the difference between what she earns and what she spends:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars} - 1 \text{ dollar} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Marisa saves $4 each day. To find out how much she saves over 5 days, we multiply the daily savings by 5:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Billy spent on gumballs. He bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, so the total cost for the gumballs is:

\[ 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Since he spent half of his change on gumballs, the total amount of money he had initially was twice the amount he spent on gumballs:

\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Billy started with $10, so the amount of money he spent on candy is:

\[ 10 - 4 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of the candy is $1.5 per pound. To find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we divide the total amount spent on candy by the cost per pound:

\[ \frac{6}{1.5} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( x \). According to the problem, Carver's age (45 years) is 5 years less than twice his son's age. This relationship can be expressed with the following equation:

\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ \frac{50}{2} = x \]
\[ 25 = x \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the distance of the entire trip from the first city to the third city and back to the first city.

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city back to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the second and third city trip, which is \(100 - 50 = 50\) miles.

So, the total distance for one complete round trip (first to second, second to third, and third to first) is:
\[75 + 100 + 50 = 225 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[225 \times 3 = 675 \text{ miles}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance traveled in one day by the service interval:
\[675 \div 18000 = 0.0375\]

Since the train needs service every 18,000 miles, it will go between services after 18,000 miles of travel. To find out how many days this corresponds to, we divide 18,000 miles by the distance traveled in one day:
\[18000 \div 675 = 26.6667\]

Since the train cannot go a fraction of a day between services, we round up to the next whole number. Therefore, the train goes between services after 27 days.

The final numerical answer is:
\[27\]"
"First, let's determine the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed. The collie bed requires the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. A Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds of stuffing and a chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing. The average amount of stuffing for a collie bed is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Average stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we can calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the 4 chihuahua beds and the 3 collie beds:

\[
\text{Total stuffing for chihuahua beds} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]
\[
\text{Total stuffing for collie beds} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Adding these together gives the total amount of stuffing needed:

\[
\text{Total stuffing} = 8 + 15 = 23 \text{ pounds}

"First, let's calculate the time John spent driving to his friend's house. The distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, and he drives at a speed of 70 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip is:

\[ \text{Time to friend's house} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{200 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{200}{70} \text{ hours} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 2.857 \text{ hours} \]

Next, John took a detour that added 10 miles to his trip, making the total distance to his friend's house 210 miles. The time taken for this detour is:

\[ \text{Time for detour} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{210}{70} \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the time John spent driving back home. The distance home is 240 miles, and he drives at a speed of 80 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip is:

\[ \text{Time to return home} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = \frac{240}{80} \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, the total time for the trip is the sum of the time to his friend's house, the time for the detour, and the time to return home:

\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} \]

To add these times, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 7 and 1 is 7:

\[ \frac{20}{7} + 3 + 3 = \frac{20}{7} + \frac{21}{7} + \frac{21}{7} = \frac{20 + 21 + 21}{7} = \frac{62}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 8.857 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time for the trip is:

\[ \frac{62}{7} \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{\frac{62}{7}} \]"
"To find out how many fourth-grade boys were at Small Tree School on Friday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of fourth-grade boys at the school.
2. Subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of fourth-grade boys.

First, we know the total number of fourth-graders is 96 and 43 of them are girls. Therefore, the number of boys is:
\[ 96 - 43 = 53 \]

Next, we know that 4 boys were absent on Friday. So, the number of boys who were present on Friday is:
\[ 53 - 4 = 49 \]

Thus, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is 49."
"If there are 6 girls in the park and twice the number of boys, then there are 6 * 2 = 12 boys in the park. Therefore, the total number of kids in the park is 6 girls + 12 boys = 18 kids."
"To find the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test, we first need to calculate the total points she has already scored on her first two tests.

Points scored on the first test: 15 points
Points scored on the second test: 18 points

Total points scored on the first two tests: 15 + 18 = 33 points

Jane needs a total of at least 42 points across all three tests. Therefore, we need to find out how many more points she needs to reach this total.

Minimum points needed on the third test: 42 - 33 = 9 points

So, the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass is 9 points."
"Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as \( C \). According to the problem, \( C = 3 \).

The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is four times the number of customers minus 5, which can be expressed as \( 4C - 5 \). Substituting \( C = 3 \) into this expression, we get:
\[ 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]

The number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is three times the number of shoplifters, which can be expressed as \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \).

Now, we know the total number of customers and shoplifters and physical violence offenders:
- Customers: 3
- Shoplifters: 7
- Physical violence: 21

The total number of customers, shoplifters, and physical violence offenders is:
\[ 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 \]

Given that the total number of people kicked out of the Walmart is 50, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:
\[ 50 - 31 = 19 \]

Therefore, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is 19."
"To determine how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we need to first find out how many points Erin had after scoring 14 points.

Sara scored 8 points. After Erin scored 14 points, Erin has three times more points than Sara. So, we calculate Erin's points after scoring 14 points as follows:

\[ \text{Erin's points after scoring 14} = 3 \times \text{Sara's points} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Since Erin scored 14 points after having 24 points, we can find out how many points Erin had before by subtracting the 14 points she scored from her total points after scoring:

\[ \text{Erin's points before scoring 14} = \text{Erin's points after scoring 14} - 14 = 24 - 14 = 10 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames without the additional logo cost:
\[ 44 \text{ seniors} \times \$20 \text{ per frame} = \$880 \]

Next, we calculate the additional cost for etching the logo on each frame, which is 20% of the original cost:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } \$20 = 0.20 \times \$20 = \$4 \]
So, the total cost for etching the logo on each frame is:
\[ 44 \text{ frames} \times \$4 = \$176 \]

Now, we add the cost of the etching to the original cost of the picture frames:
\[ \$880 + \$176 = \$1056 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the pins for 2 seniors:
\[ 2 \text{ seniors} \times \$5 \text{ per pin} = \$10 \]

Then, we calculate the cost of the cords for 1/4 of the seniors, which is 11 seniors:
\[ 11 \text{ seniors} \times \$12 \text{ per cord} = \$132 \]

Finally, we add all these costs together to find the total amount spent on the senior gifts:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of pieces of equipment and then find out how many of those pieces were faulty and how many were functioning.

First, let's denote the total number of pieces of equipment as \( N \).

Given that 40% of the total number of pieces were faulty, the number of faulty pieces is:
\[ 0.4N \]

Therefore, the number of functioning pieces is:
\[ N - 0.4N = 0.6N \]

The total cost of the equipment is $400,000. Since the faulty pieces are returned, the company only pays for the functioning pieces. The cost of the functioning pieces is:
\[ 0.6N \times \frac{400000}{N} \]

"Mrs. Sherman made a dozen bread rolls, which is equal to 12 rolls. She gave one roll to each of her 6 children, so she gave away 6 rolls. This leaves her with 12 - 6 = 6 rolls. She then broke each of the remaining 6 rolls into 8 pieces. Therefore, the total number of pieces of rolls she fed to the chickens is 6 rolls * 8 pieces per roll = 48 pieces."
"First, we need to determine how many pupils like blue. Since half of the class likes blue, we calculate:

\[
\text{Pupils who like blue} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Next, we find out how many pupils are left after accounting for those who like blue:

\[
\text{Remaining pupils} = 40 - 20 = 20
\]

One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green, so we calculate:

\[
\text{Pupils who like green} = \frac{20}{4} = 5
\]

The rest of the pupils like yellow. To find out how many pupils like yellow, we subtract the number of pupils who like green from the remaining pupils:

\[
\text{Pupils who like yellow} = 20 - 5 = 15
\]

Thus, the number of pupils who like the color yellow is:

\[
15

"First, let's determine how many apples Lucy sold on Monday. Given that she sold all the apples she picked on Monday and received $56 from selling them at $4 per piece, we can calculate the number of apples sold on Monday as follows:

\[ \text{Number of apples sold on Monday} = \frac{\$56}{\$4/\text{apple}} = 14 \text{ apples} \]

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples. On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday, which means she picked:

\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ apples} \]

Now, to find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we add the apples picked on each day:

\[ 14 \text{ (Monday)} + 12 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 24 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 50 \text{ apples} \]

So, the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days is:

\[ 50 \]"
"To determine how many socks Lindsay has missed, we first need to calculate the total number of socks she has washed.

A pair of socks consists of 2 socks. Lindsay washes 10 pairs, so the number of socks from the pairs is:
\[ 10 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ socks per pair} = 20 \text{ socks} \]

She also washes 15 loose socks. So, the total number of socks she has washed is:
\[ 20 \text{ socks from pairs} + 15 \text{ loose socks} = 35 \text{ socks} \]

Lindsay started with 50 socks. To find out how many socks she has missed, we subtract the number of socks she has washed from the total number of socks:
\[ 50 \text{ socks} - 35 \text{ socks} = 15 \text{ socks} \]

Therefore, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is:
\[ 15 \]"

\[ 65 - 44 = 21 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 21."
"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we first need to calculate the total interest she will pay over the five months and then add that to the principal amount to get the total amount she will pay back. Finally, we divide this total by the number of months.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Given:
- Principal (P) = $3,650
- Rate (R) = 10% per year = 0.10 per year
- Time (T) = 5 months = \(\frac{5}{12}\) years

First, calculate the interest:
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 152.5875 \]

Now, add the interest to the principal to get the total amount to be paid back:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.5875 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3802.5875 \]

Finally, divide the total amount by the number of months to find the monthly payment:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{\text{Number of Months}} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.5875}{5} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.5175 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.52 \]

So, Karan has to pay $760.52 per month."

Difference = 67 km

So, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe."
"First, let's determine the number of silver and gold pesos Anna has.

Axel has 50 silver pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Axel has 80 gold pesos. Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so:
\[ 80 + 40 = 120 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of silver pesos they have together:
\[ 50 \text{ (Axel's silver pesos)} + 100 \text{ (Anna's silver pesos)} = 150 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of gold pesos they have together:
\[ 80 \text{ (Axel's gold pesos)} + 120 \text{ (Anna's gold pesos)} = 200 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Finally, let's find the total number of pesos they have together by adding the total silver pesos and the total gold pesos:
\[ 150 \text{ (total silver pesos)} + 200 \text{ (total gold pesos)} = 350 \text{ pesos} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make:

- Each pitcher holds 12 cups.
- She can make 3 pitchers of lemonade.

Total cups of lemonade = 3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups.

Next, let's determine the total revenue from selling all the lemonade:

- She sells each cup for $1.
- She has 36 cups of lemonade.

Total revenue = 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

Now, let's calculate the cost of making the lemonade:

- She spent $18 to buy the supplies.

Total cost = $18.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $36 - $18 = $18.

Millie sells all the lemonade, so the profit per hour is the total profit divided by the number of hours the stand is open. Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, we can find the number of hours the stand is open by dividing the total cups by the cups sold per hour:

Number of hours = Total cups / Cups sold per hour = 36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours.

Finally, the profit per hour is the total profit divided by the number of hours the stand is open:

Profit per hour = Total profit / Number of hours = $18 / 9 hours = $2/hour.

The final numerical answer is $2."
"Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially as \( L \).

According to the problem, he sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. We know that \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land is equal to 12.8 hectares.

To find the total amount of land \( L \), we can set up the following equation:

\[ \frac{2}{5} L = 12.8 \]

To solve for \( L \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[ L = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} \]

Let's calculate the value of \( L \).
```python
# Calculation
L = 12.8 * (5 / 2)

"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 50\% \times 52 = 0.50 \times 52 = 26 \]

Since the choir is evenly split between boys and girls, the number of boys is also 26.

Next, we need to find out how many female members are performing. Since all female members are performing, the number of female members is equal to the number of girls, which is 26.

On the day of the performance, half of the female members can't make it to the show because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of female members who can't make it is:

\[ \frac{26}{2} = 13 \]

This means that the number of female members who can make it to the show is:

\[ 26 - 13 = 13 \]

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is the sum of the female members who can make it and the 3 teachers:

\[ 13 + 3 = 16 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

Now, we add the number of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages delivered:

\[ \text{Total messages} = 66 + 22 = 88 \]

So, the total number of messages James delivers is 88."
"First, let's calculate the cost for David who buys a ride bracelet. The ride bracelet costs $30 and gives 9 rides. So, David's total cost is $30.

Next, let's calculate the cost for Dasha who buys tickets. Each ride costs 2 tickets, and there are 9 rides. Therefore, Dasha needs 9 rides * 2 tickets/ride = 18 tickets. Since each ticket costs $2, Dasha's total cost is 18 tickets * $2/ticket = $36.

Now, we need to find out how much money David saves by buying the ride bracelet instead of buying tickets. David's total cost is $30, and Dasha's total cost is $36. The amount David saves is the difference between Dasha's total cost and David's total cost.

So, the amount David saves is $36 - $30 = $6.

"To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we first need to determine how many popsicles each of them has based on the given ratio and total.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. Together, they have a total of 165 popsicles.

First, we find the sum of the parts of the ratio:
\[ 5 + 6 = 11 \]

This means that the total number of popsicles (165) is divided into 11 equal parts. To find the number of popsicles in one part, we divide the total number of popsicles by 11:
\[ \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can find out how many popsicles Betty and Sam have individually:
- Betty has \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \) popsicles.
- Sam has \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the monthly cost of the streaming services Tim will use after the discount:

- Netflix costs $10 a month.
- Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 each, but with a 20% discount, the cost for each is reduced by 20% of $10.

The discount for Hulu and Disney Plus is:
\[ 10 \times 0.20 = 2 \]

So, the discounted monthly cost for each of Hulu and Disney Plus is:
\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \]

Now, let's calculate the total monthly cost for Hulu and Disney Plus after the discount:
\[ 8 + 8 = 16 \]

Next, we add the cost of Netflix to the discounted cost of Hulu and Disney Plus to find the total monthly cost for the streaming services:
\[ 10 + 16 = 26 \]

"First, let's convert all the time spent into the same unit. We'll use minutes for this calculation.

Carol spends 4 hours writing a song. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 4 hours is:
\[ 4 \times 60 = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

She spends half that much time recording it, which is:
\[ \frac{240}{2} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

She spends 90 minutes editing it.

Now, let's add up the total time spent on all activities:
\[ 240 \text{ minutes (writing)} + 120 \text{ minutes (recording)} + 90 \text{ minutes (editing)} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

To find the percentage of her total work time that she spent editing, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{90}{450} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{5} \right) \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of her total work time that she spent editing is:

"To determine the energy saved by Mel, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the energy consumption of the air conditioner per hour.
2. Determine the daily energy consumption after the reduction.
3. Calculate the total energy saved in 30 days.

First, the air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour. Reducing the usage by 5 hours a day means the new usage is 8 - 5 = 3 hours a day.

The daily energy consumption after the reduction is:
\[ 900 \text{ watts/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 2700 \text{ watt-hours/day} \]

To convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours, we divide by 1000:
\[ 2700 \text{ watt-hours/day} = 2.7 \text{ kilowatt-hours/day} \]

Now, to find the total energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the daily energy saved by 30:

"To determine how much money Tyson would spend on meat and cheese, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of sandwiches needed.
2. Determine the total amount of meat and cheese required.
3. Calculate the cost of the meat and cheese.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of sandwiches needed.**

There are 20 people and each sandwich serves 4 people.
\[ \text{Total sandwiches needed} = \frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people/sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total amount of meat and cheese required.**

Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.
\[ \text{Total meat required} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound/sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]
\[ \text{Total cheese required} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound/sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of the meat and cheese.**

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of cannolis**: Allan initially has 40 cannolis.
2. **Corn to cannolis ratio**: There is twice as much corn as cannolis. Therefore, initially, Allan has \(2 \times 40 = 80\) corns.
3. **Cannolis after buying more**: Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new total number of cannolis is \(40 + 60 = 100\).
4. **Corn after buying fewer**: Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he had after buying more. Since he now has 100 cannolis, he bought \(100 - 40 = 60\) fewer corns. Therefore, the new total number of corns is \(80 - 60 = 20\).

Now, to find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house, we add the new totals of corns and cannolis:

\[100 \text{ (cannolis)} + 20 \text{ (corns)} = 120\]

So, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 120."
"Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day. He has already completed half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which means he has taken 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps so far. He also took an additional 1,000 steps with his friend. Let's denote the steps he took during his jog as \( J \).

After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps. This means that the total steps he took before his jog was 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps. We already know he took 5,000 steps to and from school and 1,000 steps with his friend, so the steps he took during his jog can be calculated as follows:

\[ J = 8,000 - (5,000 + 1,000) \]
\[ J = 8,000 - 6,000 \]
\[ J = 2,000 \]

So, Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog."

Next, let's determine how long it will take Toby to read the entire book:

\[ \text{Time to read the book} = \frac{\text{Total words}}{\text{Words per minute}} = \frac{9000}{300} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby plans to leave the airport in 60 minutes and it takes 10 minutes to get there. Therefore, he needs to start reading 70 minutes before he needs to be at the airport:

\[ \text{Time to start reading} = 60 - 10 = 50 \text{ minutes before the airport} \]

Since it takes Toby 30 minutes to read the book, we can calculate how many minutes early he will be:

\[ \text{Minutes early} = 50 - 30 = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Toby will be 20 minutes early."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to break down the payments for May and June.

**May:**
- Number of employees: 40
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours worked per week: 40
- Weeks in May: 4

First, calculate the weekly pay for one employee:
\[ \text{Weekly pay} = \text{Hourly wage} \times \text{Hours worked per week} = 15 \times 40 = 600 \]

Next, calculate the total pay for one employee for the month of May:
\[ \text{Monthly pay} = \text{Weekly pay} \times \text{Weeks in May} = 600 \times 4 = 2400 \]

Now, calculate the total pay for all 40 employees in May:
\[ \text{Total pay for May} = \text{Monthly pay per employee} \times \text{Number of employees} = 2400 \times 40 = 96000 \]

**June:**
- Number of employees whose contracts expired: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \)
- Number of employees whose contracts did not expire: \( 40 - 10 = 30 \)

For the employees whose contracts did not expire, the pay remains the same as in May:
\[ \text{Total pay for employees whose contracts did not expire in June} = 30 \times 2400 = 72000 \]

For the employees whose contracts expired, they are not paid in June:
\[ \text{Total pay for employees whose contracts expired in June} = 0 \]

Now, calculate the total pay for all employees in June:
\[ \text{Total pay for June} = 72000 + 0 = 72000 \]

Finally, calculate the total pay for both months:
\[ \text{Total pay for May and June} = \text{Total pay for May} + \text{Total pay for June} = 96000 + 72000 = 168000 \]

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is:
\[ \boxed{168000} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is sold at ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means for every 2 pounds of taffy, Sally pays $3 for the first pound and $1.50 for the second pound (since it's half off).

Sally bought 2 pounds of taffy. The cost for 2 pounds of taffy is:
- First pound: $3
- Second pound: $1.50

Total cost for taffy: $3 + $1.50 = $4.50

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells. The seashells cost $1.50.

Then, let's calculate the cost of the magnets. Each magnet costs $0.25, and Sally bought 4 magnets:
- Total cost for magnets: $0.25 * 4 = $1.00

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Cost of taffy: $4.50
- Cost of seashells: $1.50
- Cost of magnets: $1.00

Total cost: $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00

Sally's parents gave her $10 to spend. To find out how much money Sally has left, we subtract the total cost from the amount given to her:
- Money left: $10 - $7.00 = $3.00

The final numerical answer is $3.00."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the two packs of fireworks. The first pack costs $400, and the second pack costs twice as much, which is $800. So, the total cost for the two packs is:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the $1200. A 20% discount means Tim pays 80% of the total cost of the fireworks. So, we calculate 80% of $1200:

\[ 1200 \times 0.80 = 960 \]

Now, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted cost of the fireworks:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is:

\[ 1110 \]"
"Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies a night. Over 30 days, she will eat:
\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, the number of dozens she needs to make is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 5."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. We know that 5% of the candles are dangerous and have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. Additionally, 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode. Therefore, 1% of the candles are dangerous and do not have the defect.

First, let's find out how many candles are dangerous:
\[ \text{Number of dangerous candles} = 5\% \text{ of } 50000 = 0.05 \times 50000 = 2500 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these dangerous candles also have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. Since 5% of the candles are dangerous and have the defect:
\[ \text{Number of dangerous candles with the defect} = 5\% \text{ of } 2500 = 0.05 \times 2500 = 125 \]

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 125.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 125 \]"
"First, let's calculate the discount price for each blouse. The regular price of each blouse is $20, and there is a 30% discount.

The discount amount per blouse is:
\[ 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]

So, the discounted price per blouse is:
\[ 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so the total cost for the discounted blouses is:
\[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 56 \]"
"Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees as \( A \).

From the problem, we know:
- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples.
- Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
- Joanne's sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
- Joanne's sister doesn't take any apples from the average trees, so she contributes 0 apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is:
\[ 30 + 15 + A \]

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne's sister is:
\[ 60 + 45 + 0 = 105 \]

The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500:
\[ (30 + 15 + A) + (60 + 45 + 0) = 500 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 30 + 15 + A + 60 + 45 = 500 \]
\[ 150 + A = 500 \]

Solving for \( A \):
\[ A = 500 - 150 \]
\[ A = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees."
"Let's denote the number of camels as \( C \) and the number of dromedaries as \( D \).

From the problem, we have two equations:
1. The total number of heads: \( C + D = 180 \)
2. The total number of humps: \( 2C + D = 304 \)

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, we can express \( C \) in terms of \( D \) from the first equation:
\[ C = 180 - D \]

Next, we substitute \( C \) in the second equation:
\[ 2(180 - D) + D = 304 \]
\[ 360 - 2D + D = 304 \]
\[ 360 - D = 304 \]
\[ -D = 304 - 360 \]
\[ -D = -56 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 56 \]"
"First, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days. He traveled 200 kilometers every day, so:

\[ 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \]

Next, we need to find out how far he traveled in the next two days, which is 30% of the distance he traveled in the first four days. So:

\[ 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \]

So, the total distance traveled in the first six days is:

\[ 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} = 1040 \text{ km} \]

On the seventh day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance for that day is:

\[ 0 \text{ km} \]

For the next six days (the second week), he traveled 300 kilometers every day. So:

\[ 300 \text{ km/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 1800 \text{ km} \]

Now, we add up all the distances to find the total distance traveled during the two-week trip:

\[ 1040 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 1800 \text{ km} = 2840 \text{ km} \]

So, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:

\[ 2840 \text{ km} \]"
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to work backwards from the information given.

1. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. If Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, then Zack's locker is:
\[ \text{Zack's locker} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches} \]

2. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. If Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches, then Timothy's locker is:
\[ \text{Timothy's locker} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches} \]

So, the size of Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches."
"Stanley's comb fell from an elevation of 10,000 feet to a ledge at an elevation of 10,000 feet - 4,000 feet = 6,000 feet. Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. Therefore, Oliver must climb 6,000 feet - 3,000 feet = 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

The final numerical answer is 3000."
"To determine Mr. Josue's total capital after receiving funds from the banks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of money given by the second bank.
2. Sum the amounts given by both banks.
3. Add the total amount received from the banks to the initial capital.

First, the second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank. Since the first bank gave him $4000, the second bank gave him:
\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Next, we sum the amounts given by both banks:
\[ 4000 + 8000 = 12000 \]

Now, we add this total to the initial capital of $5000:
\[ 5000 + 12000 = 17000 \]

Therefore, the total capital Mr. Josue has now is:
\[ 17000 \]"
"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, which means a total of \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cats were taken away. Therefore, the number of cats remaining on the rock is \(50 - 20 = 30\).

Later, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse they'd seen. The number of cats that ran away is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \). Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is \(30 - 18 = 12\).

The final numerical answer is 12."
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service with the given pricing structure, we need to break down the cost into segments based on the different rates.

1. **First 6 months**: The cost is $8 per month.
   \[
   6 \text{ months} \times \$8/\text{month} = \$48
   \]

2. **Next 2 months (months 7 and 8)**: The cost is the normal rate of $12 per month.
   \[
   2 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$24
   \]

3. **Next 10 months (months 9 to 18)**: The cost is the increased rate of $14 per month.
   \[
   10 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$140
   \]

Now, we sum up the costs for all the segments:
\[
\$48 + \$24 + \$140 = \$212
\]

Therefore, the total cost for 2 years of the service is:
\[
\boxed{212}

"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:

\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of both pairs of jeans:

\[ 28 + 22 = 50 \]

Cole saved a total of $6. According to the problem, he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. Let's denote the total savings as \( S \). Since he saved $6 in total, we have:

\[ S = 6 \]

The savings from the jogger jeans is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]

The savings from the tattered jeans is:

\[ 6 - 2 = 4 \]

Now, let's verify the savings from each pair of jeans. The savings from the jogger jeans is $2, and the savings from the tattered jeans is $4. Since the tattered jeans originally cost $28, the savings from the tattered jeans is:

\[ 28 - \text{new price of tattered jeans} = 4 \]

So, the new price of the tattered jeans is:

\[ 28 - 4 = 24 \]

The original price of the jogger jeans was $22, and the new price is $24. The difference in the original cost between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is:

\[ 28 - 22 = 6 \]

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 more than the tattered jeans. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To calculate the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to add up the capacities of all the vehicles rented.

First, we calculate the capacity of the buses:
\[ 4 \text{ buses} \times 60 \text{ employees per bus} = 240 \text{ employees} \]

Next, we calculate the capacity of the minibusses:
\[ 6 \text{ minibusses} \times 30 \text{ employees per minibus} = 180 \text{ employees} \]

Then, we calculate the capacity of the minivans:
\[ 10 \text{ minivans} \times 15 \text{ employees per minivan} = 150 \text{ employees} \]

Now, we add up the capacities of all the vehicles:
\[ 240 \text{ employees} + 180 \text{ employees} + 150 \text{ employees} = 570 \text{ employees} \]

So, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"Lillian builds 3 bird feeders herself and buys 3 more, making a total of 6 bird feeders. Each of her bird feeders attracts 20 birds per day. The bird feeders she made herself attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so each of her bird feeders attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds per day.

To find the total number of birds she can expect to see each day, we multiply the number of feeders by the number of birds each feeder attracts:

\[ 6 \text{ feeders} \times 30 \text{ birds per feeder} = 180 \text{ birds per day} \]

The final numerical answer is 180."
"First, let's determine the cost of the soup. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. The bagel costs $4.

To find 25% of $4:
\[ 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]

So, the soup costs:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Next, we know the cake costs half of the price of the bagel. The bagel costs $4, so:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the dinner by adding the cost of the soup, the bagel, and the cake:
\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \]

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for the dinner she ordered."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of cards Kenny started with. Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( x \).

Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards, so he sells 2/3 of them. The number of cards he sells is \( \frac{2}{3}x \). He sells each card for $1.5, so the total amount of money he earns from selling the cards is \( 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}x = x \).

According to the problem, after selling the cards, Kenny has $50 in spending cash and the remaining $50 to buy the ticket to the amusement park, which costs $100. This means the total amount of money he has after selling the cards is $100. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x = 100 \]

So, Kenny started with 100 cards. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many hotdogs were initially prepared. The caterer was told to prepare enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs. There were 36 guests, so half of the guests would be:

\[ \frac{36}{2} = 18 \]

Each of these 18 guests was supposed to have 2 hotdogs, so the total number of hotdogs prepared was:

\[ 18 \times 2 = 36 \]

However, 40 guests showed up, and each guest wanted a second hotdog. This means that the total number of hotdogs needed is:

\[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \]

Since only 36 hotdogs were prepared, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:

\[ 40 - 36 = 4 \]

So, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 4."
"First, let's determine the number of letters in Indras' sister's name. We know that Indras' name has 6 letters. Half of the letters in Indras' name is:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name, so:

\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Now, to find the total number of letters in both names, we add the number of letters in Indras' name to the number of letters in her sister's name:

\[ 6 + 7 = 13 \]

So, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Mixing bowls: $20.00
- Utensils: 5 utensils at $5.00 each, so 5 * $5.00 = $25.00

Adding these together gives the total cost before the discount:
$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Now, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost:
20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00

Subtracting the discount from the total cost gives the final amount:
$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

So, the final numerical answer is $132.00."

So, the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew is 30."
"First, we need to determine how many gallons of gas are in one container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we can calculate the amount of gas per container as follows:

\[ \text{Gallons per container} = \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5 \text{ containers}} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Josey needed \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a container. Therefore, the amount of gas Josey needed in gallons is:

\[ \text{Gallons needed} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ container} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so:

\[ \text{Pints needed} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints per gallon} = \frac{3 \times 8}{4} = \frac{24}{4} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount of money George spent:**
   George spent $5.

2. **Determine the amount of money George had left:**
   Since he had 1% of his money left, the amount he had left is:
   \[
   0.01 \times 5 = 0.05 \text{ dollars} = 5 \text{ cents}
   \]

3. **Determine the amount of money George spent on chips:**
   Since he spent $5 in total and had 5 cents left, the amount spent on chips is:
   \[
   5 - 0.05 = 4.95 \text{ dollars} = 495 \text{ cents}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of bags of chips George bought:**
   Each bag of chips costs 40 cents, so the number of bags of chips he bought is:
   \[
   \frac{495}{40} = 12.375
   \]
   Since George can only buy whole bags of chips, he bought 12 bags of chips.

5. **Calculate the total cost of the chips George bought:**
   The cost of 12 bags of chips is:

"First, let's determine the time it takes for Wayne to drive to the theater. According to the information, it takes Wayne four minutes to drive to the theater.

Since the drive from Bernadette’s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne’s hotel, we can calculate the time it takes for Bernadette to drive to the theater as follows:
\[ \text{Time for Bernadette} = 4 \times \text{Time for Wayne} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Therefore, Bernadette should leave 5 minutes earlier than the time Wayne will leave.

Since Wayne will leave at the time the theater opens, Bernadette should leave 16 minutes before Wayne leaves.

Thus, Bernadette should leave 16 minutes - 5 minutes = 11 minutes before Wayne to get to the theater first.

"First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of Billie's room in feet is:
\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the width of the room. We know the area of the rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]
Given that the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, we can solve for the width:
\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{width} \]
\[ \text{width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can calculate the perimeter of the room. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]
Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

"First, let's calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

So, the total number of beads Elizabeth bought is:
\[ 1 \text{ pack of red} + 2 \text{ packs of clear} = 1 \times 20 + 2 \times 20 = 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ beads} \]

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

So, the total number of beads Margareth bought is:
\[ 3 \text{ packs of blue} + 4 \text{ packs of red} = 3 \times 20 + 4 \times 20 = 60 + 80 = 140 \text{ beads} \]

Now, let's find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:
\[ 140 \text{ beads} - 60 \text{ beads} = 80 \text{ beads} \]

"First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven. Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour.

\[ \text{Temperature increase from oven} = 3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, let's calculate the temperature decrease due to the window. Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.

\[ \text{Temperature decrease from window} = \left(\frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes}}\right) \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 3 \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 6 \text{ degrees} \]

Now, let's add the initial temperature of the house, the temperature increase from the oven, and the temperature decrease from the window.

\[ \text{Final temperature} = 40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees} \]

The house's final temperature is 49 degrees."
"First, let's convert all times to minutes for easier calculation:
- Jon's swim time: 40 minutes
- Jon's bike ride time: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 60 + 20 = 80 minutes
- Jon's run time: 50 minutes

Now, let's calculate James's times:
- James's swim time: Jon's swim time minus 10% of Jon's swim time
  \[ 40 \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]
- James's bike ride time: Jon's bike ride time plus 5 minutes
  \[ 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]
- James's run time: We need to find this.

The total time for Jon is:
\[ 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes} \]

Let \( x \) be the time James took to run. The total time for James is:
\[ 36 + 85 + x \]

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[ 36 + 85 + x = 170 + 10 \]
\[ 121 + x = 180 \]
\[ x = 180 - 121 \]
\[ x = 59 \]

So, James took 59 minutes to run. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{59} \]"

\[ 1.25 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, the length of Movie B is:

\[ 75 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, we can calculate the length of Movie A as follows:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ minutes}}{4} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"First, we need to determine how many miles the horse runs. The horse runs at a speed of 32 miles per hour for 30 minutes, which is half an hour. Therefore, the distance the horse runs is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 32 \text{ miles/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of hay the horse eats. For every mile the horse runs, it eats 1/2 a bail of hay. Therefore, for 16 miles, the horse eats:

\[ \text{Hay eaten} = 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail/mile} = 8 \text{ bails} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the hay. Since each bail of hay costs $3, the total cost for 8 bails is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars/bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which means he has:

\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the hay, the change Michael has is:

\[ \text{Change} = 30 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"

"First, let's calculate the cost price per sneaker:
\[ \text{Cost price per sneaker} = \frac{\$576}{48} = \$12 \]

Next, let's calculate the revenue from the 17 sneakers sold at $20 each:
\[ \text{Revenue from Monday sale} = 17 \times \$20 = \$340 \]

Now, let's find out how many sneakers were sold to the department store:
\[ \text{Number of sneakers sold to the department store} = 48 - 17 = 31 \]

Then, let's calculate the revenue from the department store:
\[ \text{Revenue from department store} = 31 \times \$25 = \$775 \]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = \$340 + \$775 = \$1115 \]

Finally, let's calculate the profit:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Cost price} = \$1115 - \$576 = \$539 \]

The salesman's profit is:

So, the total number of crayon pieces Beatrice bought is 112."
"Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as \( P \).

The cost of the super ticket is $20, and it includes one popcorn and one soda for an extra $1. So, the total cost for the super ticket is $20 + $1 = $21.

The cost of buying a movie ticket for $12 and a popcorn and a soda at regular price is $12 + \( P \) + $3 = $15 + \( P \).

According to the problem, you saved $2 by buying the super ticket instead of buying the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda separately. Therefore, the cost of buying the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda separately is $2 more than the cost of the super ticket.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 15 + P = 21 + 2 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[ 15 + P = 23 \]

To find \( P \), we subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:
\[ P = 23 - 15 \]
\[ P = 8 \]

The regular price of popcorn is $8."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the initial cost per balloon and then calculate the new cost per balloon after the price increase. Finally, we will find out how much Bentley paid for 170 balloons at the new price.

First, let's find the initial cost per balloon:
- The total cost for 20 balloons was $900.
- Therefore, the cost per balloon initially was:
  \[
  \text{Initial cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Two days later, the cost per balloon increased by $20:
- The new cost per balloon is:
  \[
  \text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost for 170 balloons at the new price:
- The total cost for 170 balloons at the new price is:
  \[
  \text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = 170 \times 65
  \]

Let's perform the multiplication:
\[
170 \times 65 = 170 \times (60 + 5) = (170 \times 60) + (170 \times 5)
\]
\[
170 \times 60 = 10200
\]
\[
170 \times 5 = 850
\]
\[
170 \times 65 = 10200 + 850 = 11050
\]

Therefore, the total amount Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons after the price increase is:
\[
\boxed{11050}

"To find the average speed of the car during the entire trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

First, calculate the distance for each segment of the trip:
- For the first segment at 60 mph for 2 hours: \(60 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles}\).
- For the second segment at 30 mph for 1 hour: \(30 \text{ mph} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 30 \text{ miles}\).

Next, add the distances to find the total distance:
- Total distance = \(120 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 150 \text{ miles}\).

Now, calculate the total time taken:
- Total time = \(2 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} = 3 \text{ hours}\).

Finally, calculate the average speed:
- Average speed = \(\frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ mph}\).

The car's average speed during the trip is 50 mph."
"First, let's calculate the value of the sapphires Jenna has left after the trade. Jenna started with 8 sapphires and traded 3 of them, so she has 5 sapphires left. Since each sapphire is worth $800, the value of the remaining sapphires is:

\[ 5 \text{ sapphires} \times \$800 \text{ per sapphire} = \$4000 \]

Next, we need to determine the value of the rubies Jenna received. She traded 3 sapphires for 2 rubies, and since each sapphire is worth $800, the value of the 3 sapphires she traded is:

\[ 3 \text{ sapphires} \times \$800 \text{ per sapphire} = \$2400 \]

Since the rubies are worth $1200 each, the value of the 2 rubies is:

\[ 2 \text{ rubies} \times \$1200 \text{ per ruby} = \$2400 \]

Now, we add the value of the remaining sapphires and the value of the rubies to find the total value of all her jewels:

\[ \$4000 + \$2400 = \$6400 \]

So, the total value of all her jewels is:

\[ \$6400 \]"

"First, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the raised bed) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

For one raised bed, the volume is:

\[ V = 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:

\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 \, \text{cubic feet} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet per bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{dollars per bag} = 1920 \, \text{dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 1920 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of green cards. We know there are 15 red cards and 60% more green cards than red cards. To find the number of green cards, we calculate 60% of 15 and add it to the 15 red cards.

\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + (0.60 \times 15) \]

\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + 9 = 24 \]

Next, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards.

\[ \text{Number of yellow cards} = \text{Number of red cards} + \text{Number of green cards} \]

\[ \text{Number of yellow cards} = 15 + 24 = 39 \]

Now, we can find the total number of cards by adding the number of red, green, and yellow cards together.

\[ \text{Total number of cards} = \text{Number of red cards} + \text{Number of green cards} + \text{Number of yellow cards} \]

\[ \text{Total number of cards} = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed:

- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
- Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
- Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, let's sum up the total weight of all the feed:

Total weight = 2 pounds (sugar cubes) + 48 pounds (carrots) + 3150 pounds (hay) + 1300 pounds (oats)
Total weight = 4500 pounds

The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips are needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:

\[ 2 \times 6 \text{ inches} = 12 \text{ inches} \]

To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Length of remoras}}{\text{Length of shark}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{120 \text{ inches}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{10} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"Let's denote the total number of students at the grade level as \( x \).

According to the problem, three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home. This means that one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer at home. We are given that 20 students do not have desktop computers.

We can set up the following equation to represent this situation:
\[
\frac{1}{4}x = 20
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 4:
\[
x = 20 \times 4
\]
\[
x = 80
\]

So, the total number of students at that grade level is 80."
"To determine how long Jason has to spend walking each day, we need to divide the total minutes required to break in the shoes by the number of days he plans to walk in a week.

Total minutes to break in the shoes = 240 minutes
Number of days per week to walk = 4 days

Minutes to walk each day = Total minutes to break in the shoes / Number of days per week to walk
Minutes to walk each day = 240 minutes / 4 days
Minutes to walk each day = 60 minutes

So, Jason has to spend 60 minutes walking each day."
"To find out how many books each child received, we first need to determine the total number of books Sarah bought. Since each book costs $15 and she spent $300, we can calculate the total number of books by dividing the total amount spent by the cost per book:

\[
\text{Total number of books} = \frac{\text{Total amount spent}}{\text{Cost per book}} = \frac{300}{15} = 20
\]

Now, Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids. To find out how many books each child received, we divide the total number of books by the number of kids:

\[
\text{Books per child} = \frac{\text{Total number of books}}{\text{Number of kids}} = \frac{20}{4} = 5
\]

So, each child received 5 books. The final numerical answer is:

\[
5

"To find out how many kids are not allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion. First, we calculate the number of kids who are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both.

The number of kids allergic to dairy is 9.
The number of kids allergic to peanuts is 6.
The number of kids allergic to both is 3.

Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion, the number of kids allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both is:
\[ 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

This means 12 kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both. Therefore, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is the total number of kids in the class minus the number of kids who are allergic to something:
\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \]

So, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is 20."
"To find the total number of people going on the tour, we need to calculate the total number of employees and tour guides.

First, we calculate the total number of employees:
- There are 3 groups of employees.

So, the total number of employees is:
\[ 3 \times 200 = 600 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of tour guides:
- There are 3 groups of tour guides.
- Each group has 7 tour guides.

So, the total number of tour guides is:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Now, we add the total number of employees and the total number of tour guides to find the total number of people going on the tour:
\[ 600 + 21 = 621 \]

Therefore, the total number of people going on this tour is:
\[ 621 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the plane tickets. Since Tom and his wife each need a plane ticket, the total cost for the plane tickets is:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Next, let's determine the cost of the hotel. The hotel is 20% more expensive than its normal price. The normal price of the hotel per day is $1500. Therefore, the increased price per day is:
\[ 1500 + (0.20 \times 1500) = 1500 + 300 = 1800 \]

Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 1800 \times 3 = 5400 \]

Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel to find the total cost of the trip:
\[ 10000 + 5400 = 15400 \]

So, the total cost of the trip is:
\[ 15400 \]"
"First, let's determine how many tubes of blue paint Jasper has. Since Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, and Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint, Jasper has:

Keegan earned $83 and Tashay earned $91. So, the total amount they have earned is:
\[ 83 + 91 = 174 \]

Their goal is to raise $200. To find out how much more they need to earn, we subtract the total amount they have already earned from their goal:
\[ 200 - 174 = 26 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 26 \]"
"First, let's determine how many songs Luri currently has on his player. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, we can calculate the number of songs Luri has as follows:

\[ \text{Number of songs Luri has} = 3 \times \text{Number of songs Gabriel has} = 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

Next, we need to find out how many songs each can add to their player. Since both players can store up to 100 songs, the number of additional songs each can add is:

\[ \text{Number of additional songs Gabriel can add} = 100 - \text{Number of songs Gabriel has} = 100 - 20 = 80 \]
\[ \text{Number of additional songs Luri can add} = 100 - \text{Number of songs Luri has} = 100 - 60 = 40 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel:

\[ \text{Fewer songs Luri can add} = \text{Number of additional songs Gabriel can add} - \text{Number of additional songs Luri can add} = 80 - 40 = 40 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we first need to determine how many oranges he ate. Since he ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the oranges they picked, and they picked 60 oranges, we can calculate the number of oranges he ate as follows:

\[ \text{Number of oranges Stetson ate} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60 \]

Let's calculate this value.
```python
# Total number of oranges picked
total_oranges = 60

# Fraction of oranges Stetson ate
fraction_eaten = 2 / 5

# Number of oranges Stetson ate
oranges_eaten = fraction_eaten * total_oranges
oranges_eaten
```
```output
24.0
```
Stetson ate 24 oranges. Since he gives up $10 for each orange he eats, the total amount of money he gave up is:

\[ \text{Total money given up} = 24 \times 10 \]

Let's calculate this.
```python
# Amount of money given up per orange
money_per_orange = 10

# Total money given up
total_money_given_up = oranges_eaten * money_per_orange
total_money_given_up
```
```output
NameError: name 'oranges_eaten' is not defined
```
It seems there was an issue with the variable reference. Let me re-calculate the total amount of money Stetson gave up directly using the value we found for the number of oranges he ate.

\[ \text{Total money given up} = 24 \times 10 \]

Let's perform this calculation.
```python
# Recalculating the total money given up
total_money_given_up = 24 * 10
total_money_given_up
```

"To determine how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total amount of oats consumed by one horse per day:**
   - Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal.
   - Each horse is fed twice a day.
   - Therefore, one horse consumes \(5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day}\).

2. **Calculate the total amount of oats consumed by all four horses per day:**
   - There are four horses.
   - Therefore, all four horses consume \(10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}\).

3. **Calculate the total amount of oats consumed by all four horses for five days:**
   - All four horses consume 40 pounds of oats per day.
   - Therefore, for five days, they consume \(40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds}\).

4. **Calculate the number of bags of oats needed:**
   - Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats.
   - Therefore, the number of bags needed is \(200 \text{ pounds} \div 50 \text{ pounds/bag} = 4 \text{ bags}\).

The final numerical answer is 4 bags."

"First, let's calculate the cost of 2 packs of razors without any discounts:

- Each pack costs $4.00.
- Heather buys 2 packs, so the cost before any discounts is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) dollars.

Now, let's apply the ""buy one get one free"" offer. Since she is buying 2 packs, she gets 2 packs for free. So, she only pays for 2 packs, which is still $8.00.

Next, we apply the $2.00 coupon to the $8.00 cost:

- The cost after applying the coupon is \(8 - 2 = 6\) dollars.

Now, we need to find the cost per razor. Since each pack contains 4 razors, 2 packs contain \(2 \times 4 = 8\) razors.

Finally, we calculate the cost per razor:

- The cost per razor is \(\frac{6}{8} = 0.75\) dollars.

To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100:

- \(0.75 \times 100 = 75\) cents.

So, the final numerical answer is 75 cents."

"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \( D \). According to the problem, Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects. Additionally, David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects. The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ D = 9 \]

So, David found 9 insects. Since Lily found 7 more than David, Lily found:

\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Therefore, the number of insects Lily found is 16."

Thus, Janet would save \(\boxed{2}\) dollars by buying the weekly bus pass."
"The farm has 30 cows and 15 sheep (since the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, and the zoo has 20 sheep, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep, but the question states the farm has 15 sheep, which is consistent with the zoo having twice as many cows as the farm).

The zoo has 20 sheep and 40 cows (since the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, and the farm has 30 cows, so the zoo has 30 * 2 = 60 cows, but the question states the zoo has 20 sheep and 40 cows, which is consistent).

The total number of animals on the farm is 30 cows + 15 sheep = 45 animals.
The total number of animals in the zoo is 40 cows + 20 sheep = 60 animals.

The combined total number of animals on the farm and in the zoo is 45 + 60 = 105 animals."

"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we first need to calculate the total number of calories he needs to burn to lose 30 pounds. Given that he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose one pound, the total calories he needs to burn to lose 30 pounds is:

\[ 3500 \text{ calories/pound} \times 30 \text{ pounds} = 105000 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to determine the number of days from December 31st to July 19th. We can break this down into months:

- December: 31 days
- January: 31 days
- February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
- March: 31 days
- April: 30 days
- May: 31 days
- June: 30 days
- July (up to July 19th): 19 days

Adding these together gives:

\[ 31 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 211 \text{ days} \]

Now, to find the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to maintain, we divide the total calories he needs to burn by the number of days:

\[ \frac{105000 \text{ calories}}{211 \text{ days}} \approx 498.06 \text{ calories/day} \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, Andy needs to maintain a daily calorie deficit of approximately 498 calories."
"Gerald earns $30 per day and works for 7 days in a week, so his total earnings for the week are:
\[ 30 \times 7 = 210 \]

He spent a total of $100, so the amount he has left is:
\[ 210 - 100 = 110 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to calculate the total distance Hannah will run. Since each lap is 0.25 km and she needs to run 8 laps, the total distance in kilometers is:

\[ 8 \text{ laps} \times 0.25 \text{ km/lap} = 2 \text{ km} \]

Next, we need to determine how much water Hannah needs to drink. She needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs. Therefore, for 2 km, the total amount of water she needs to drink is:

\[ 2 \text{ km} \times 60 \text{ ml/km} = 120 \text{ ml} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 120 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much money Julie spent on clothes. She spent 20% of $500 on clothes.

\[ \text{Amount spent on clothes} = 20\% \times 500 = 0.20 \times 500 = 100 \]

Now, let's find out how much money she has left after buying clothes.

\[ \text{Remaining money after clothes} = 500 - 100 = 400 \]

Next, Julie spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs.

\[ \text{Amount spent on CDs} = 25\% \times 400 = 0.25 \times 400 = 100 \]

Finally, let's calculate how much money Julie has left after buying CDs.

\[ \text{Remaining money after CDs} = 400 - 100 = 300 \]

So, Julie has $300 left."
"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, the house cost three times as much as the lot, so we can write:

\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]

Combining like terms, we have:

\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

To find the cost of the lot, we divide both sides by 4:

\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000 \]

Now, to find the cost of the house, we use the equation \( H = 3L \):

\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000 \]

So, the cost of the house is $90,000."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the canvas bags that Tara bought. She bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each, and each pack costs $4.

Total cost = Number of packs × Number of bags per pack × Cost per pack
Total cost = 8 × 5 × $4
Total cost = 40 × $4
Total cost = $160

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the canvas bags. She sold each of the 40 bags for $8.

Total revenue = Number of bags sold × Price per bag
Total revenue = 40 × $8
Total revenue = $320

Now, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $320 - $160
Profit = $160

So, the final numerical answer is $160."
"To find out how many punches Joe threw, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Determine the total duration of the fight in minutes.
2. Calculate the total number of punches thrown by multiplying the average number of punches per minute by the total duration of the fight.

First, the fight lasts 5 rounds, and each round is 3 minutes long. So, the total duration of the fight is:
\[ 5 \text{ rounds} \times 3 \text{ minutes/round} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, Joe throws 25 punches per minute. Therefore, the total number of punches thrown in 15 minutes is:
\[ 25 \text{ punches/minute} \times 15 \text{ minutes} = 375 \text{ punches} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 375 \]"
"To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many cookies Josh made.
2. Use the number of cookies Josh made to find out how many cookies Kelsie made.

First, we know that Suzanne made 36 cookies. Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made. Therefore, we calculate the number of cookies Josh made as follows:
\[ \text{Cookies made by Josh} = \frac{36}{4} = 9 \]

Next, Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. So, we calculate the number of cookies Kelsie made as follows:
\[ \text{Cookies made by Kelsie} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Thus, the number of cookies Kelsie made is:
\[ 18 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has. He has four $10 bills and six $20 bills.

The total amount from the $10 bills is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

The total amount from the $20 bills is:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of money Ali has:
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \]

Ali gives half of this total money to his sister:
\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \]

So, the remaining amount of money Ali has is:
\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \]

Ali uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining amount to buy dinner:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = \frac{3 \times 80}{5} = \frac{240}{5} = 48 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is:
\[ 80 - 48 = 32 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to convert Rob's time from hours to minutes. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, Rob's 2 hours is equal to \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes.

Next, we calculate double the time Rob takes to shingle a house. Since Rob takes 120 minutes, double that time is \(120 \times 2 = 240\) minutes.

Finally, we add 40 minutes to this doubled time to find out how long Royce takes. So, Royce takes \(240 + 40 = 280\) minutes.

The final numerical answer is 280."
"To determine the total number of skeins of wool Martha will need, we first calculate the number of each item she needs to knit for her 3 grandchildren:

- Hats: 3 hats
- Scarves: 3 scarves
- Sweaters: 3 sweaters
- Mittens: 3 pairs of mittens
- Socks: 3 pairs of socks

Next, we calculate the number of skeins needed for each item:

- Hats: 3 hats * 2 skeins per hat = 6 skeins
- Scarves: 3 scarves * 4 skeins per scarf = 12 skeins
- Sweaters: 3 sweaters * 12 skeins per sweater = 36 skeins
- Mittens: 3 pairs of mittens * 1 skein per pair = 3 skeins
- Socks: 3 pairs of socks * 2 skeins per pair = 6 skeins

Now, we sum up the total number of skeins needed:

6 (hats) + 12 (scarves) + 36 (sweaters) + 3 (mittens) + 6 (socks) = 63 skeins

Therefore, Martha will need to buy 63 skeins of wool."
"First, let's calculate the number of problems Chris completes on Tuesday. Since he completes 3 times as many problems on Tuesday as he did on Monday, and he completed 12 problems on Monday, the number of problems he completes on Tuesday is:

\[ 12 \times 3 = 36 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of problems completed by the end of Tuesday:

\[ 12 \text{ (Monday)} + 36 \text{ (Tuesday)} = 48 \]

Now, we determine the number of problems remaining after Tuesday:

\[ 100 - 48 = 52 \]

On Wednesday, Chris completes one-quarter of the remaining problems. Therefore, the number of problems he completes on Wednesday is:

\[ \frac{52}{4} = 13 \]

"First, let's determine the number of quarts each person can pick per hour:

- Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.
- Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
- Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick \(5 \times 2 = 10\) quarts per hour.
- Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than does Kathy, so Ricky can pick \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, let's add up the quarts picked per hour by all four individuals:

- Tony: 6 quarts
- Bobby: 5 quarts
- Kathy: 10 quarts
- Ricky: 8 quarts

Total quarts picked per hour = \(6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29\) quarts.

"First, we need to determine how many rows of red tulips Jackson can plant. He has 36 red tulips and can fit 6 red tulips in a row. So, the number of rows of red tulips is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Number of rows of red tulips} = \frac{36 \text{ red tulips}}{6 \text{ red tulips/row}} = 6 \text{ rows} \]

Next, we need to determine how many rows of blue tulips Jackson can plant. He has 24 blue tulips and can fit 8 blue tulips in a row. So, the number of rows of blue tulips is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Number of rows of blue tulips} = \frac{24 \text{ blue tulips}}{8 \text{ blue tulips/row}} = 3 \text{ rows} \]

To find the total number of rows of flowers Jackson will plant, we add the number of rows of red tulips and the number of rows of blue tulips:

\[ \text{Total number of rows} = 6 \text{ rows of red tulips} + 3 \text{ rows of blue tulips} = 9 \text{ rows} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate Ada's daily electric consumption before and after adding the new device.

Before adding the new device:
- Daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour
- Cost per kilowatt per hour: $1.50

Daily cost before:
\[ 12 \, \text{kWh/day} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$18.00/\text{day} \]

Weekly cost before:
\[ \$18.00/\text{day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = \$126.00/\text{week} \]

After adding the new device:
- Daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour + 2 kilowatts per hour = 14 kilowatts per hour
- Cost per kilowatt per hour: $1.50

Daily cost after:
\[ 14 \, \text{kWh/day} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$21.00/\text{day} \]

Weekly cost after:
\[ \$21.00/\text{day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = \$147.00/\text{week} \]

Now, let's find the difference between the weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device:

The difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is \$21.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which one person paints and then scale it up for 5 people.

1. One person can paint half a house in 5 days. Therefore, one person can paint a whole house in 10 days.
2. The rate of one person painting a house is \( \frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}} \).
3. If 5 people are working together, their combined rate is \( 5 \times \frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{2 \text{ days}} \).
4. This means that 5 people can paint a whole house in 2 days.

To convert this into hours, we multiply the number of days by 24 (since there are 24 hours in a day):

\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

So, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house."
"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and relationships given in the problem.

Let \( S_O \) be the number of sofas Ophelia has, and \( C_O \) be the number of chairs Ophelia has. Similarly, let \( S_J \) be the number of sofas Jenna has, and \( C_J \) be the number of chairs Jenna has.

From the problem, we know:
1. Ophelia has 20 sofas, so \( S_O = 20 \).
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so \( S_O = C_O - 2 \).
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so \( C_J = 3C_O \).
4. Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so \( S_J = C_J - 2 \).

First, we can find the number of chairs Ophelia has:
\[ S_O = C_O - 2 \]
\[ 20 = C_O - 2 \]
\[ C_O = 22 \]

Now, we can find the number of chairs Jenna has:
\[ C_J = 3C_O \]
\[ C_J = 3 \times 22 \]
\[ C_J = 66 \]

Next, we can find the number of sofas Jenna has:
\[ S_J = C_J - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 66 - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 64 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together:
\[ \text{Total sofas} = S_O + S_J = 20 + 64 = 84 \]
\[ \text{Total chairs} = C_O + C_J = 22 + 66 = 88 \]
\[ \text{Total number of sofas and chairs} = 84 + 88 = 172 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we need to account for the hours he worked out each week, including the exceptions.

First, let's calculate the total hours if he had worked out 4 hours every week:
\[ 4 \text{ hours/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to account for the additional hours he worked out in the two weeks where he worked out 5 hours each week:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

Then, we need to account for the additional hour he worked out in the week where he worked out 6 hours:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/week} \times 1 \text{ week} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add all these hours together:
\[ 32 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, Jame's current age is \( 27 - 5 = 22 \) years.

2. **Determine the cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 22 + 8 = 30 \) years old.
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \).
   - Therefore, Jame's cousin will be \( 60 - 5 = 55 \) years old in 8 years.

3. **Determine the cousin's current age:**
   - If Jame's cousin will be 55 in 8 years, then the cousin's current age is \( 55 - 8 = 47 \) years.

"Let's break down the information given:

- The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400.
- The computer costs $1,100.
- The printer costs $400 less than the computer, so the printer costs $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the computer and the printer:
- Cost of the computer: $1,100
- Cost of the printer: $700
- Total cost of the computer and the printer: $1,100 + $700 = $1,800

Since the total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400, we can find the total cost of the 2 monitors by subtracting the total cost of the computer and the printer from the total cost:
- Total cost of the computer and the printer: $1,800
- Total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer: $2,400
- Total cost of the 2 monitors: $2,400 - $1,800 = $600

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the total cost of the 2 monitors by 2:
- Total cost of the 2 monitors: $600
- Cost of one monitor: $600 / 2 = $300

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is $300."
"To find out how many seashells each girl brought, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of boys and girls.
2. Calculate the total number of seashells brought by the boys.
3. Calculate the total number of seashells brought by the girls.

First, since there are twenty kids in total and they are divided into two equal groups of girls and boys, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

Next, each boy brought back 60 seashells. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is:
\[ 10 \text{ boys} \times 60 \text{ seashells/boy} = 600 \text{ seashells} \]

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. So, the total number of seashells brought by the girls is:
\[ 600 \text{ seashells} + 4 \times 600 \text{ seashells} = 600 \text{ seashells} + 2400 \text{ seashells} = 3000 \text{ seashells} \]

Since there are 10 girls, the number of seashells each girl brought is:
\[ \frac{3000 \text{ seashells}}{10 \text{ girls}} = 300 \text{ seashells/girl} \]

Thus, the number of seashells brought by each girl is:
\[ 300 \]"

Anne's age = 6 + 2
Anne's age = 8

Therefore, Anne is 8 years old."
"To find the total thickness of the four books, let's calculate the thickness of each book step by step:

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so it is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm thick.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm thick.

Now, let's add the thicknesses of all four books together:

\[31 + 50 + 45 + 62\]

First, add 31 and 50:

\[31 + 50 = 81\]

Next, add 45 to the result:

\[81 + 45 = 126\]

Finally, add 62 to the result:

\[126 + 62 = 188\]

So, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma still needs to make to complete her monthly goal of 72 vlogs, we can subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her monthly goal.

Vlogs made so far: 18 (first week) + 21 (second week) + 15 (third week) = 54 vlogs

Vlogs needed to reach the goal: 72 (monthly goal) - 54 (vlogs made so far) = 18 vlogs

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable parts. First, we need to determine the total amount Elvis needs to save in April and then figure out how much he needs to save in the second half of the month.

April has 30 days. Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125. Therefore, he needs to save $1125 in April.

Let's denote the number of days in the first half of April as \( x \). Consequently, the number of days in the second half of April would be \( 30 - x \).

According to the problem, Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half of the month as he does in the first half. Let's denote the daily savings in the first half as \( y \). Therefore, the daily savings in the second half would be \( 2y \).

The total savings for the first half of the month can be expressed as:
\[ x \cdot y \]

The total savings for the second half of the month can be expressed as:
\[ (30 - x) \cdot 2y \]

The sum of these two amounts should equal Elvis's monthly target:
\[ x \cdot y + (30 - x) \cdot 2y = 1125 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ xy + 60y - 2xy = 1125 \]
\[ 60y - xy = 1125 \]
\[ y(60 - x) = 1125 \]

To find \( y \), we need to determine \( x \). Since \( x \) represents the number of days in the first half, it must be a whole number between 1 and 15 (inclusive). We need to find a value of \( x \) that makes \( y \) a whole number.

Let's test some values of \( x \):

If \( x = 15 \):
\[ y(60 - 15) = 1125 \]
\[ 45y = 1125 \]
\[ y = \frac{1125}{45} \]
\[ y = 25 \]

So, \( y = 25 \) and \( x = 15 \) are valid values. This means Elvis saves $25 per day in the first half of April and \( 2 \times 25 = 50 \) dollars per day in the second half of April.

To verify:
- First half savings: \( 15 \times 25 = 375 \)
- Second half savings: \( 15 \times 50 = 750 \)
- Total savings: \( 375 + 750 = 1125 \)

The calculations confirm that Elvis needs to save $50 per day in the second half of the month.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the apples:
- Verna bought 3 apples at $1.50 each.
- Total cost for apples = 3 * $1.50 = $4.50

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the oranges:
- Verna bought 5 oranges at $0.80 each.
- Total cost for oranges = 5 * $0.80 = $4.00

Then, let's calculate the total cost of the peaches:
- Verna bought 6 peaches at $0.75 each.
- Total cost for peaches = 6 * $0.75 = $4.50

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the fruits:
- Total cost = Cost of apples + Cost of oranges + Cost of peaches
- Total cost = $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

Verna gave $20 to the seller. To find out the change she received, we subtract the total cost of the fruits from the amount she gave:
- Change = Amount given - Total cost
- Change = $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

The final numerical answer is $7.00."
"First, let's calculate how much Jairus earns for completing 20 tasks. Jairus earns $0.8 for each task, so for 20 tasks, he earns:

\[ 0.8 \times 20 = 16 \]

Next, let's calculate how much Jenny earns for completing 20 tasks. Jenny earns $0.5 for each task, so for 20 tasks, she earns:

\[ 0.5 \times 20 = 10 \]

Now, to find out how much more Jairus earns than Jenny, we subtract Jenny's earnings from Jairus's earnings:

\[ 16 - 10 = 6 \]

So, Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny."
"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars. The total amount of money is $100, so we can write the equation:

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets $20. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's amount as:

\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets $80.

The final numerical answer is 80."
"Jeff walks 6 miles to work one way. Since he walks to work and back home each day, that's 6 miles per day. If he has to work 5 times a week, the total miles he walks in a week is:

So, the final numerical answer is 30."
"To determine the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Rewriting**: Elise writes the entire alphabet twice.
   - The alphabet has 26 letters.
   - Therefore, writing it twice means \(26 \times 2 = 52\) letters.

2. **Second Rewriting**: Elise writes half of the alphabet once.
   - Half of the alphabet is \(26 / 2 = 13\) letters.
   - Therefore, writing half of the alphabet once means \(13\) letters.

3. **Third Rewriting**: Elise rewrites everything she has already written.
   - This includes the two full alphabets and the half alphabet.
   - The total number of letters already written is \(52 + 13 = 65\).
   - Rewriting everything means writing \(65\) letters again.

Now, we sum up all the letters written:
- First rewriting: \(52\) letters.
- Second rewriting: \(13\) letters.
- Third rewriting: \(65\) letters.

Adding these together:
\[ 52 + 13 + 65 = 130 \]

Therefore, the total number of letters Elise has written is:
\[ 130 \]"

"First, let's calculate the total cost of each item before the discount:

- The cost of five notebooks is \(5 \times \$1.50 = \$7.50\).
- The cost of two pens is \(2 \times \$0.25 = \$0.50\).
- The cost of one calculator is \(1 \times \$12 = \$12\).
- The cost of one geometry set is \(1 \times \$10 = \$10\).

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost before the discount:
\[
\$7.50 + \$0.50 + \$12 + \$10 = \$20
\]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
\[
10\% \text{ of } \$20 = 0.10 \times \$20 = \$2

"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break down the commission structure:

1. For the first $1000 of sales, she earns a 30% commission.
2. For sales over $1000, she earns an additional 10% commission on the amount over $1000.

First, let's calculate the commission for the first $1000:
\[ \text{Commission for first } \$1000 = 1000 \times 0.30 = \$300 \]

Next, we calculate the additional commission for the sales over $1000. Antonella sold $2500 worth of goods, so the amount over $1000 is:
\[ 2500 - 1000 = \$1500 \]

The additional commission for the $1500 is:
\[ \text{Additional commission} = 1500 \times 0.10 = \$150 \]

Now, we add the two commissions together to find the total commission:
\[ \text{Total commission} = 300 + 150 = \$450 \]

Therefore, Antonella earned:
\[ \text{Final amount} = \$450 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of bottles Bill currently has. He has 2 cases of water, and each case has 24 bottles.

Total bottles Bill currently has = 2 cases * 24 bottles/case = 48 bottles.

Next, we need to determine the total number of bottles required for his guests. He has 70 guests, and he wants to provide 2 bottles per guest.

Total bottles needed = 70 guests * 2 bottles/guest = 140 bottles.

Now, we can find out how many additional bottles Bill needs to buy by subtracting the number of bottles he currently has from the number of bottles needed.

Additional bottles to buy = Total bottles needed - Total bottles Bill currently has
Additional bottles to buy = 140 bottles - 48 bottles = 92 bottles.

So, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water."
"First, let's determine how long it takes Ray to swim a mile when the water is warm.

Given:
- When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.
- When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold.

Let's calculate the time it takes to swim a mile in warm water:
- Twice the time it takes in cold water is \(2 \times 16 = 32\) minutes.
- Adding 2 minutes to this gives \(32 + 2 = 34\) minutes.

So, it takes Ray 34 minutes to swim a mile in warm water.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water:
- In cold water, it takes \(16 \times 3 = 48\) minutes to swim 3 miles.
- In warm water, it takes \(34 \times 3 = 102\) minutes to swim 3 miles.

Finally, to find out how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day, we subtract the time taken in cold water from the time taken in warm water:
- \(102 - 48 = 54\) minutes.

Therefore, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day."
"First, let's calculate how much John earns in a day. He earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day, so his daily earnings are:
\[ 2 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours/day} = 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \]

Next, let's calculate his weekly earnings. He works 4 days a week, so his weekly earnings are:
\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 4 \, \text{days/week} = 40 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take for John to save $80. We do this by dividing the total amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:
\[ \frac{80 \, \text{dollars}}{40 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 2 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80."
"First, let's determine the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub. Since it costs thrice as much as the foot-long fish sub, we calculate:

Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo sub = 3 * Cost of foot-long fish sub
Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo sub = 3 * $40
Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo sub = $120

Now, let's find the total cost for both subs:

Total cost = Cost of foot-long fish sub + Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo sub
Total cost = $40 + $120
Total cost = $160

So, the final numerical answer is $160."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes in all the buttons.

First, we know that there are 21 buttons in total. Out of these, 7 buttons have 2 holes each. So, the number of holes in these 7 buttons is:
\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ holes} \]

The rest of the buttons have 4 holes each. Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 of them have 2 holes, the number of buttons with 4 holes is:
\[ 21 - 7 = 14 \text{ buttons} \]

The number of holes in these 14 buttons is:
\[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \text{ holes} \]

Now, we add the holes from both types of buttons to get the total number of holes:
\[ 14 + 56 = 70 \text{ holes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 70 \]"
"First, let's determine the volume of Zack's locker. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can calculate the volume of Zack's locker as follows:

\[ \text{Volume of Zack's locker} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Volume of Timothy's locker} \]

Given that Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches, we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[ \text{Volume of Zack's locker} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 = 12 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we need to find the volume of Peter's locker, which is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. We can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Volume of Peter's locker} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Volume of Zack's locker} \]

Substituting the volume of Zack's locker into the equation:

\[ \text{Volume of Peter's locker} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ cubic inches} \]

So, the volume of Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches."
"First, let's determine the daily recommended cups of coffee for Octavia. Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, if we denote the daily recommended cups of coffee as \( R \), then Octavia drinks \( \frac{R}{2} \) cups of coffee.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks. Therefore, Juan drinks \( 10 \times \frac{R}{2} = 5R \) cups of coffee.

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. This means Juan needs to reduce his coffee intake from \( 5R \) cups to 4 cups.

To find out by how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we calculate the difference between his current intake and the recommended intake:
\[ 5R - 4 \]

Since the daily recommended cups of coffee for Octavia is \( R \), and Juan's current intake is \( 5R \), we need to express the reduction in terms of the daily recommended cups. The reduction in cups is:
\[ 5R - 4 \]

However, we need to find out how many cups this reduction is in terms of the daily recommended cups \( R \). To do this, we can express the reduction as a fraction of the daily recommended cups:
\[ \frac{5R - 4}{R} = 5 - \frac{4}{R} \]

Since \( R \) is the daily recommended cups, the reduction in terms of the daily recommended cups is:
\[ 5R - 4 \]

To find the exact number of cups, we need to know the value of \( R \). However, the problem does not provide the value of \( R \), so we can only express the reduction in terms of \( R \). But if we assume the daily recommended cups \( R \) is such that the reduction is a whole number, we can solve it directly.

Given that Juan's current intake is \( 5R \) and the doctor asks for 4 cups, the reduction is:
\[ 5R - 4 \]

If we assume \( R = 4 \) (a common daily recommended cup amount), then:
\[ 5 \times 4 - 4 = 20 - 4 = 16 \]

Therefore, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by:
\[ 16 \text{ cups} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To find the total number of rodents, we need to add the number of hamsters to the number of guinea pigs.

There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each, so the total number of hamsters is:

There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each, so the total number of guinea pigs is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Adding the number of hamsters and guinea pigs together gives:
\[ 30 + 15 = 45 \]

Therefore, the pet shop had a total of 45 rodents."
"First, let's determine the weights of Susan and Bob.

Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark. Since Mark weighs 150 pounds, Susan's weight is:
\[ 150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds} \]

Bob weighs twice as much as Susan. Since Susan weighs 130 pounds, Bob's weight is:
\[ 2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we can find the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob. The average weight is calculated by summing their weights and dividing by the number of friends (which is 3).

The total weight of the three friends is:
\[ 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

The average weight is:
\[ \frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the angle the sun makes with the ground after moving for 10 hours.

Initially, the sun is at the tip of the pyramid, which is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground. The sun moves upward at a rate of 5 degrees per hour. Over 10 hours, the sun will move upward by:

\[ 5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the total angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours will be the initial angle plus the angle the sun has moved upward:

\[ 32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much James spends on candles, we first need to find out how many candles he needs in total.

1. Determine the ages of the sons:
   - The older son is 12 years old.
   - The younger son is 4 years younger, so he is \(12 - 4 = 8\) years old.

2. Calculate the total number of candles needed:
   - James needs one candle for each son, so he needs \(12 + 8 = 20\) candles.

3. Determine how many packs of candles are needed:
   - Each pack contains 5 candles.
   - To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack: \(20 \div 5 = 4\) packs.

4. Calculate the total cost:
   - Each pack costs $3.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 4 packs is \(4 \times 3 = 12\).

James spends $12 on candles."
"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the pages read in the first week and add it to the pages read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week. She read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week. So, the total reading time in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pages she can read in 105 minutes. We know that she can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. Therefore, the number of pages she reads per minute is:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of pages read in the first week:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages. So, the total number of pages read in two weeks is:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

Thus, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"

"To find out how many goals all three teenagers scored, we need to determine the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna based on the information given.

First, we know that Richie scored 80 goals. According to the problem, Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. Therefore, we can calculate the number of goals Mark scored as follows:
\[ \text{Goals scored by Mark} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 20 = 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Next, we know that Richie also scored 45 more goals than Anna. Therefore, we can calculate the number of goals Anna scored as follows:
\[ \text{Goals scored by Anna} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 45 = 80 - 45 = 35 \]

Now, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers by adding the goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna:
\[ \text{Total goals} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} + \text{Goals scored by Mark} + \text{Goals scored by Anna} = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 \]

So, the total cost so far is $308."
"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we first need to calculate the total number of roses he grows in a week and then compare it to the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops.

Ford grows 40 roses every week. The flower shops order a total of:
- The first flower shop orders 20 roses.
- The second flower shop orders 15 roses.
- The third flower shop orders 30 roses.

So, the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week is:
\[ 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \]

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops in a month is:
\[ 65 \times 4 = 260 \]

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so in a month, he grows:
\[ 40 \times 4 = 160 \]

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the number of roses he grows from the number of roses ordered:
\[ 260 - 160 = 100 \]

Therefore, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."

\[ \text{Area} = 18 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the new carpet and padding:
\[ \text{Cost of new carpet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times \$12/\text{square foot} = \$2592 \]
\[ \text{Cost of padding} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times \$2/\text{square foot} = \$432 \]
\[ \text{Total cost for new carpet and padding} = \$2592 + \$432 = \$3024 \]

Now, we calculate the cost of removing the old carpet:
\[ \text{Cost of removing old carpet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times \$4/\text{square foot} = \$864 \]

Finally, we calculate the cost of installing the new carpet:
\[ \text{Cost of installing new carpet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times \$34/\text{square foot} = \$7344 \]

Adding all these costs together:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$3024 + \$864 + \$7344 = \$11232 \]

So, the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet is:
\[ \$11232 \]"
"To find the average number of birds Mack saw per day, we first need to calculate the total number of birds he saw over the week and then divide that by the number of days.

Here's the breakdown of the birds seen each day:
- Day 1 and Day 2: 50 birds
- Day 3: 0 birds
- Day 4 and Day 5: 120 birds
- Day 6: 20 birds
- Day 7: 90 birds

Total number of birds seen = 50 (Day 1) + 50 (Day 2) + 0 (Day 3) + 120 (Day 4) + 120 (Day 5) + 20 (Day 6) + 90 (Day 7)

Now, let's calculate the total:
50 + 50 + 0 + 120 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 450 birds

There are 7 days in the week, so we divide the total number of birds by 7 to find the average:
Average number of birds per day = 450 birds / 7 days

Now, let's calculate the final numerical answer:
450 / 7 = 64.28571428571429

Rounded to two decimal places, the average number of birds Mack saw per day is approximately 64.29."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Starting Value**: Diane gave the number train a starting value of 20.
2. **First Operation**: This starting value plus half the number was divided by 5.
   - Half of the starting value is \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \).
   - Adding this to the starting value gives \( 20 + 10 = 30 \).
   - Dividing this result by 5 gives \( \frac{30}{5} = 6 \).
3. **Second Operation**: The resulting value was multiplied by the starting value minus 12.
   - The starting value minus 12 is \( 20 - 12 = 8 \).
   - Multiplying the result from the first operation by this value gives \( 6 \times 8 = 48 \).

Therefore, the final value of the number train is 48."
"The boy has 5 cards. His brother has 3 fewer cards, which means his brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards. Together, they have 5 + 2 = 7 cards.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage error in Maggie's oven and then apply that same percentage error to the 520 degrees she needs for her recipe.

First, let's calculate the percentage error for the 450 degrees setting:

\[
\text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{\text{Actual Temperature} - \text{Set Temperature}}{\text{Set Temperature}} \right) \times 100
\]

\[
\text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{468 - 450}{450} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 = 4\%
\]

Now, we apply this 4% error to the 520 degrees required for the recipe:

\[
\text{Error} = 520 \times \frac{4}{100} = 520 \times 0.04 = 20
\]

\[
\text{Adjusted Temperature} = 520 - 20 = 500
\]

So, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees to achieve the desired temperature for her recipe."
"To find the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to add the duration of the first movie to the duration of the second movie.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Converting this to minutes:
1 hour = 60 minutes
So, 1 hour and 30 minutes = 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting this to minutes:
2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes
So, 2 hours and 5 minutes = 120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes.

Now, we add the durations of the two movies:
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is 215 minutes."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we first need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and then subtract that from Herb's price.

Herb's house price = $76,000

30% of Herb's house price = 0.30 * $76,000 = $22,800

Juan's house price = Herb's house price - 30% of Herb's house price
Juan's house price = $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

Now, we add the prices of both houses to find the combined value:

Combined value = Herb's house price + Juan's house price
Combined value = $76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200

The final numerical answer is $129,200."
"First, let's determine the number of cups and dishes Judy initially bought.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups.

She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.

At the event, her friend brought 40 cups. Since Judy initially bought 12 cups, her friend brought \(40 - 12 = 28\) more cups than Judy bought.

Her friend also brought 20 more dishes than Judy's initial purchase of 24 dishes. So, her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend.

Judy's total cups: \(12 + 28 = 40\)
Judy's total dishes: \(24 + 44 = 68\)

The total number of utensils (cups and dishes) brought by the two is:
\(40 + 68 = 108\)

The final numerical answer is:
108"
"First, let's calculate the discounted price of one box of contacts. The original price of one box is $100.00, and it is currently 10% off. 

The discount amount is:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the discounted price of one box is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost for the 2 boxes is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Since each box contains 90 single use contacts, 2 boxes will contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \]

Therefore, the cost per pair of contacts (which is 90 contacts) is:
\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 1.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total hours Jill worked.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so:
\[ \text{Total hours Jill worked} = 2 + 1 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Tabitha agreed to pay $10 per hour, so Jill's earnings are:
\[ \text{Jill's earnings} = 3 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$30 \]

Now, let's calculate the total hours John worked.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so:
\[ \text{John's hours on Saturday} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so:
\[ \text{John's hours on Sunday} = 3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, John's total hours worked are:
\[ \text{John's total hours} = 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ hours} \]

John's earnings are:
\[ \text{John's earnings} = 7 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$70 \]

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings:
\[ \text{Difference in earnings} = \$70 - \$30 = \$40 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$40 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total calories burned by Hannah during her workout.

For aerobics:
- She spends 2 hours doing aerobics.
- Aerobics burn 500 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from aerobics = 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.

For running:
- She spends 1 hour running.
- Running burns 600 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from running = 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.

Now, let's add the calories burned from both activities to get the total calories burned:
- Total calories burned = calories burned from aerobics + calories burned from running
- Total calories burned = 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories.

Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. To find out how many ml of water she needs to drink for 1600 calories, we can set up a proportion:

\[
\frac{100 \text{ ml}}{200 \text{ calories}} = \frac{x \text{ ml}}{1600 \text{ calories}}
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{100 \text{ ml} \times 1600 \text{ calories}}{200 \text{ calories}} = \frac{160000 \text{ ml-calories}}{200 \text{ calories}} = 800 \text{ ml}
\]

So, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the note, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \). Similarly, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of the red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \), we find:
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
- Number of red jelly beans = \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \)
- Number of green jelly beans = \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \)

The difference between the number of green and red jelly beans is:
\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

2. The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs \(10 \times 2 = 20\) pounds.
3. The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs \(20 \div 4 = 5\) pounds.
4. The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs \(5 \times 44 = 220\) pounds.

Therefore, the weight of the Mastiff is 220 pounds."
"First, let's calculate the total cost for the boots on Amazon.com:
- The cost of the boots on Amazon.com is $16.
- The shipping cost on Amazon.com is $4.
- Therefore, the total cost on Amazon.com is $16 + $4 = $20.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the boots on eBay:
- The cost of the boots on eBay is $13.
- The shipping cost on eBay is twice the shipping cost on Amazon.com, which is 2 * $4 = $8.
- Therefore, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

The beanstalk starts at 4 feet tall and doubles its height every day. Let's calculate the height of the beanstalk day by day:

- Day 0: 4 feet
- Day 1: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
- Day 2: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
- Day 3: 16 * 2 = 32 feet

On Day 3, the beanstalk reaches 32 feet, which is taller than the 20 feet height of Mark's window.

Therefore, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window."
"To determine how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms every day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of protein John gets from 200 grams of mushrooms in one day.
2. Multiply the daily protein intake by the number of days in a week (7 days).

First, we find the protein content per 200 grams of mushrooms:
- 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein.
- Therefore, 200 grams of mushrooms would contain \( \frac{200}{100} \times 3 = 2 \times 3 = 6 \) grams of protein per day.

Next, we calculate the total protein intake for a week:
- John eats 6 grams of protein per day.
- In a week, he eats \( 6 \times 7 = 42 \) grams of protein.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, we can write the equation:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
\[ J - 2J = -10 \]
\[ -J = -10 \]
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 13."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

George needs 2 implants, and each implant has a base price of $2000. So, the cost for the implants is:
\[ 2 \times 2000 = 4000 \]

For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. So, the additional cost for the crown is:
\[ 500 \]

The total cost for the dental work is:
\[ 4000 + 500 = 4500 \]

George has already put down a deposit of $600. Therefore, the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
\[ 4500 - 600 = 3900 \]

George makes $15 per hour at work. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
\[ \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \]

So, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 260 \]"
"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees, and the other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees. The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees and \( 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees. The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The measure of the largest angle in the triangle is \(\boxed{90}\) degrees."
"First, let's determine the total amount of money Colby has in cents.

"To determine the total number of legs in the pet store, we need to consider the number of legs each type of pet has and then multiply by the number of each type of pet.

- Dogs have 4 legs each.
- Cats have 4 legs each.
- Birds have 2 legs each.

Given:
- There are 5 dogs.
- There are 2 cats.
- There are 10 birds.

Now, we calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet:
- Total legs from dogs: \(5 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 20 \text{ legs}\)
- Total legs from cats: \(2 \text{ cats} \times 4 \text{ legs/cat} = 8 \text{ legs}\)
- Total legs from birds: \(10 \text{ birds} \times 2 \text{ legs/bird} = 20 \text{ legs}\)

"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz makes in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we can calculate the hourly rate for Ruiz as follows:

\[ \text{Ruiz's hourly rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa makes in one hour. According to the problem, Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we can calculate the amount Marissa makes in one hour as follows:

\[ \text{Marissa's hourly rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 60 \text{ pounds per hour} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of chocolates Ruiz and Marissa make together in 12 hours. First, we calculate the total amount Ruiz makes in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Ruiz's total in 12 hours} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Marissa makes in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Marissa's total in 12 hours} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the totals together to find the combined total amount of chocolates made by Ruiz and Marissa in 12 hours:

"To calculate the total earnings from selling lemonade, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the earnings from the first four hours and the earnings from the next two hours.

For the first four hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.
- Total cups sold in four hours = 15 cups/hour * 4 hours = 60 cups.
- Total earnings from the first four hours = 60 cups * $0.50/cup = $30.

For the next two hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.
- Total cups sold in two hours = 10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups.
- Total earnings from the next two hours = 20 cups * $0.60/cup = $12.

Now, we add the earnings from both parts to find the total earnings:
- Total earnings = $30 + $12 = $42.

"First, let's calculate the total number of rotations the tires make in a month. Given that the car drives 400 miles a month and the tires rotate 725 times for every 2 miles, we can find the total rotations per month as follows:

\[ \text{Rotations per mile} = \frac{725}{2} \]
\[ \text{Rotations per month} = 400 \times \frac{725}{2} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of rotations per month:

\[ \text{Rotations per month} = 400 \times 362.5 = 145000 \]

Now, we know that each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations. To find out how many months the tires can last, we divide the total number of rotations each tire can handle by the number of rotations per month:

\[ \text{Months per tire} = \frac{10,440,000}{145000} \]

Let's calculate this value:

\[ \text{Months per tire} = 72 \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can find out how many years the tires can last by dividing the number of months per tire by 12:

\[ \text{Years per tire} = \frac{72}{12} = 6 \]

Therefore, the tires can last for 6 years before they need to be replaced."
"To find out how much each pump costs, we first need to determine the total number of washes Jackie can get from one bottle of shampoo. Since the directions say 2 pumps give 120 washes, we can calculate the number of washes per pump:

\[ \text{Washes per pump} = \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washes per pump} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pumps are in the bottle. Since the bottle gives 120 washes and each pump gives 60 washes, the number of pumps in the bottle is:

\[ \text{Number of pumps} = \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{60 \text{ washes per pump}} = 2 \text{ pumps} \]

The total cost of the bottle is $24.00. To find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the number of pumps:

\[ \text{Cost per pump} = \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 12.00 \text{ dollars per pump} \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert dollars to cents (1 dollar = 100 cents):

\[ 12.00 \text{ dollars} = 12.00 \times 100 \text{ cents} = 1200 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the cost of each pump is:

"First, let's calculate the discount on the shirt and the shorts.

The shirt's original price is $25, and there is a 30% discount:
\[ \text{Discount on shirt} = 25 \times \frac{30}{100} = 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]
\[ \text{Discounted price of shirt} = 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

The shorts' original price is $35, and there is a 30% discount:
\[ \text{Discount on shorts} = 35 \times \frac{30}{100} = 35 \times 0.30 = 10.50 \]
\[ \text{Discounted price of shorts} = 35 - 10.50 = 24.50 \]

Now, let's add the discounted prices of the shirt and the shorts to find the total cost of the outfit:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 17.50 + 24.50 = 42.00 \]

Joe has $50 initially. After the purchase, the amount of money Joe will have left is:
\[ \text{Money left} = 50 - 42.00 = 8.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 8.00 \]"
"To determine how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a week.
2. Determine the total amount of butter needed based on the number of dozens.

Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week. A week has 7 days.

So, the total number of dozens of croissants he wants to make in a week is:
\[ 4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozen} \]

It takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. Therefore, to find out how many pounds of butter are needed for 28 dozen croissants, we multiply the number of dozens by the amount of butter needed per dozen:
\[ 28 \text{ dozen} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week."
"First, we need to calculate the cost to repave Monica's street. The cost is $194 per meter and the length of Monica's street is 150 meters.

\[ \text{Cost for Monica's street} = 150 \text{ meters} \times 194 \text{ dollars/meter} = 29100 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street. The length of Lewis' street is 490 meters.

\[ \text{Cost for Lewis' street} = 490 \text{ meters} \times 194 \text{ dollars/meter} = 94860 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we subtract the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis' street.

\[ \text{Difference in cost} = 94860 \text{ dollars} - 29100 \text{ dollars} = 65760 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 65760 \]"
"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the funding into two parts: the initial 5 months and the extended 5 months.

1. **Initial 5 months funding:**
   - The initial funding is $100,000 for the first 5 months.

2. **Extended 5 months funding:**
   - The research took 10 times the initial 5 months, which means it took \(10 \times 5 = 50\) months in total.
   - The first 5 months cost $100,000.
   - The remaining 45 months (50 months - 5 months) cost 50% more per month than the initial $100,000 / 5 = $20,000 per month.
   - The new monthly cost for the extended period is \(20,000 \times 1.5 = 30,000\) dollars per month.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the extended 45 months is \(45 \times 30,000 = 1,350,000\) dollars.

3. **Total cost:**
   - Adding the initial 5 months and the extended 45 months, the total cost is \(100,000 + 1,350,000 = 1,450,000\) dollars.

The total cost of John's research is **$1,450,000**."
"To find the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to add up the meat consumed by each player:

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so that's \(8 \times 1 = 8\) ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, that's 16 ounces.
4. The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Now, we sum the meat consumed by the first three players:
\[ 6 + 8 + 16 = 30 \]

Therefore, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces."
"To find the total number of posts in March, we need to calculate the number of days in March and then multiply it by the average number of posts per day per member.

"To calculate how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of loads of laundry Gary does in a year.
2. Calculate the total gallons of water used in a year.
3. Calculate the total cost of the water used in a year.

First, Gary does laundry twice a week. There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total number of loads of laundry Gary does in a year is:
\[ 2 \text{ loads/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 104 \text{ loads/year} \]

Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water, so the total gallons of water used in a year is:
\[ 104 \text{ loads/year} \times 20 \text{ gallons/load} = 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \]

A gallon of water costs $0.15, so the total cost of the water used in a year is:

"To find the total number of functioning street lights, we first need to calculate the total number of street lights available.

Each pole has 4 street lights, and there are 6 poles at each intersection. Therefore, the number of street lights at one intersection is:
\[ 6 \text{ poles/intersection} \times 4 \text{ street lights/pole} = 24 \text{ street lights/intersection} \]

Since there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights across all intersections is:
\[ 4 \text{ intersections} \times 24 \text{ street lights/intersection} = 96 \text{ street lights} \]

Given that 20 street lights are not working, the number of functioning street lights is:
\[ 96 \text{ street lights} - 20 \text{ non-functioning street lights} = 76 \text{ functioning street lights} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total cost of John's physical therapy, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of therapy sessions John attended.
2. Calculate the total number of hours John spent in therapy.
3. Compute the total cost based on the hourly rate.

First, John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks, and each week he attended twice for 2 hours at a time. Therefore, the total number of sessions is:
\[ 6 \text{ weeks} \times 2 \text{ sessions/week} = 12 \text{ sessions} \]

Next, since each session is 2 hours long, the total number of hours John spent in therapy is:
\[ 12 \text{ sessions} \times 2 \text{ hours/session} = 24 \text{ hours} \]

The cost per hour is $125, so the total cost is:
\[ 24 \text{ hours} \times 125 \text{ dollars/hour} = 3000 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total cost of John's physical therapy is:

"To determine how many pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, let's break down his consumption and give away step by step.

1. **Initial Pack**: Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum.
2. **Gum Consumption at School**: Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since a school day lasts 8 hours, he chews 4 pieces of gum at school (8 hours / 2 hours per piece = 4 pieces).
3. **Gum on the Way Home**: Jim chews 1 piece on the way home from school.
4. **Gum After Dinner**: Jim chews 1 piece after dinner.
5. **Gum Given to Sister**: After dinner, Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Let's calculate the remaining gum before giving any to his sister.

First, we calculate the total gum consumed during the day:
- Gum at school: 4 pieces
- Gum on the way home: 1 piece
- Gum after dinner: 1 piece
Total consumed = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 pieces

Now, we subtract the consumed gum from the initial pack:
20 - 6 = 14 pieces remaining before giving to his sister.

Since Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister:
14 / 2 = 7 pieces given to his sister.

Finally, we calculate the remaining gum after giving some to his sister:
14 - 7 = 7 pieces

So, the number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day is 7."
"To find out how old Charmaine will be 4 years from now, we first need to determine her current age. If she will be 16 years old in 12 years, we can subtract 12 years from 16 to find her current age:

\[ 16 - 12 = 4 \]

So, Charmaine is currently 4 years old. To find out how old she will be 4 years from now, we add 4 years to her current age:

\[ 4 + 4 = 8 \]

Therefore, Charmaine will be 8 years old 4 years from now."

"First, we need to convert Ashley's internet connection speed from kilobytes per second (kb/s) to megabytes per second (Mb/s).

Given:
- Ashley's internet connection speed = 20 kb/s
- 1 Mb = 1000 kb

To convert kb/s to Mb/s, we divide the speed in kb/s by 1000:
\[ \text{Speed in Mb/s} = \frac{20 \text{ kb/s}}{1000} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \]

Next, we need to find out how much data Ashley can get in one hour. There are 3600 seconds in one hour.

\[ \text{Speed in Mb/hour} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \times 3600 \text{ s} \]

So, Ashley’s internet connection speed in Mb per hour is 72 Mb/hour."
"To calculate the total number of cars towed by the tow truck over the week, we can break down the problem into two parts: the first three days and the last four days.

For the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day. Therefore, the total number of cars pulled in the first three days is:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

For the remaining four days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day than it did on the first three days. So, the number of cars pulled each day for the last four days is:
\[ 10 \text{ cars} - 4 \text{ cars} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]
Therefore, the total number of cars pulled in the last four days is:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Adding the number of cars pulled over the first three days and the last four days gives us the total number of cars towed that week:

"First, we need to convert Adam's current height from inches to feet to compare it with the required height. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, Adam's height in feet is:

\[ 40 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{40}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The minimum height required to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. Therefore, Adam needs to grow:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Adam grows 2 inches per year, which is equivalent to \(\frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6}\) feet per year. To find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet, we divide \(\frac{2}{3}\) by \(\frac{1}{6}\):

\[ \frac{2}{3} \div \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Therefore, Adam will be tall enough to ride the roller coaster in 4 years."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 cars James sold:
\[ \text{Total cost of cars} = 10 \times \$25,000 = \$250,000 \]

Next, we calculate the amount the company paid to acquire the cars:
\[ \text{Cost to acquire the cars} = 30\% \times \$250,000 = 0.30 \times \$250,000 = \$75,000 \]

Now, we find the total profit from selling the cars:
\[ \text{Total profit} = \text{Total cost of cars} - \text{Cost to acquire the cars} = \$250,000 - \$75,000 = \$175,000 \]

James gets a 10% commission on the profits:
\[ \text{James's commission} = 10\% \times \$175,000 = 0.10 \times \$175,000 = \$17,500 \]

"First, let's determine how many riders can stay upright on the wave. Since only 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright, we calculate:

\[ 100 \times 0.25 = 25 \]

So, 25 riders can stay upright on the wave.

Next, we need to find out how many of these 25 riders are women. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we calculate:

\[ 25 \times 0.60 = 15 \]

So, 15 riders are women who can stay upright on the wave.

To find out how many of these 25 riders are men, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is 10.

"First, let's find the price of the gold jewel. Given that the price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel, and the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

\[
\text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600
\]

Next, we need to find the price of the silver jewel. The problem states that the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of the gold jewel. Therefore, we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

\[
\text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
\]

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond jewel, the gold jewel, and the silver jewel:

\[
\text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800

"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between him and Bob.

First, let's find the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap. Since Bob is driving at 55 mph and Tom is driving at 70 mph, Tom is gaining on Bob at a rate of:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is closing the 75-mile gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. To find the time it takes for Tom to close this gap, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the maximum cost per class and then find out how many classes he can attend without exceeding this cost.

First, let's denote the total cost of the 10 classes as \( C \). The total cost is given as $60. If the cost per class exceeds $10, they won't sign him up again. Therefore, we need to find the maximum number of classes \( n \) such that the cost per class is not more than $10.

The cost per class if he misses \( m \) classes is:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60 - \text{cost of missed classes}}{10 - m} \]

We need to find the maximum \( m \) such that:
\[ \frac{60 - \text{cost of missed classes}}{10 - m} \leq 10 \]

Let's assume Manny misses \( m \) classes. Then the number of classes he attends is \( 10 - m \). The cost per class he pays for the attended classes is:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60 - \text{cost of missed classes}}{10 - m} \]

To find the maximum \( m \), we need to ensure that the cost per class does not exceed $10. Let's test different values of \( m \):

1. If Manny misses 1 class, he attends 9 classes:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60 - \text{cost of 1 class}}{9} \]
To ensure this is not more than $10:
\[ \frac{60 - \text{cost of 1 class}}{9} \leq 10 \]
\[ 60 - \text{cost of 1 class} \leq 90 \]
\[ \text{cost of 1 class} \geq 30 \]
This is not possible since the total cost is $60 for 10 classes.

2. If Manny misses 2 classes, he attends 8 classes:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60 - \text{cost of 2 classes}}{8} \]
To ensure this is not more than $10:
\[ \frac{60 - \text{cost of 2 classes}}{8} \leq 10 \]
\[ 60 - \text{cost of 2 classes} \leq 80 \]
\[ \text{cost of 2 classes} \geq -20 \]
This is always true.

3. If Manny misses 3 classes, he attends 7 classes:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60 - \text{cost of 3 classes}}{7} \]
To ensure this is not more than $10:
\[ \frac{60 - \text{cost of 3 classes}}{7} \leq 10 \]
\[ 60 - \text{cost of 3 classes} \leq 70 \]
\[ \text{cost of 3 classes} \geq -10 \]
This is always true.

4. If Manny misses 4 classes, he attends 6 classes:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60 - \text{cost of 4 classes}}{6} \]
To ensure this is not more than $10:
\[ \frac{60 - \text{cost of 4 classes}}{6} \leq 10 \]
\[ 60 - \text{cost of 4 classes} \leq 60 \]
\[ \text{cost of 4 classes} \geq 0 \]
This is always true.

5. If Manny misses 5 classes, he attends 5 classes:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60 - \text{cost of 5 classes}}{5} \]
To ensure this is not more than $10:
\[ \frac{60 - \text{cost of 5 classes}}{5} \leq 10 \]
\[ 60 - \text{cost of 5 classes} \leq 50 \]
\[ \text{cost of 5 classes} \geq 10 \]
This is not possible since the total cost is $60 for 10 classes.

Therefore, the maximum number of classes Manny can miss is 5. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"To determine the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we first need to find out how many customers each of them processes in a day.

Given that Jewel processes 50 customers per day, and Julie processes twice as many customers as Jewel, we can calculate the number of customers Julie processes per day as follows:
\[ \text{Customers processed by Julie per day} = 2 \times \text{Customers processed by Jewel per day} = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of customers processed by each of them in a week (7 days):
\[ \text{Total customers processed by Jewel in a week} = 50 \times 7 = 350 \]
\[ \text{Total customers processed by Julie in a week} = 100 \times 7 = 700 \]

Finally, we add the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel in a week to find the total weekly production:
\[ \text{Total weekly production} = \text{Total customers processed by Jewel in a week} + \text{Total customers processed by Julie in a week} = 350 + 700 = 1050 \]

"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the hole:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel one cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) it will take him to dig the hole is:

\[ T = \text{volume} \times \text{time per cubic foot} \]
\[ T = 72 \times 3 = 216 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total time Bill will take to dig the well, we need to calculate the time taken to dig through the soil and the time taken to dig through the clay separately, and then sum these times.

First, let's calculate the time to dig through the soil:
- Bill digs at a rate of 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He needs to dig 24 feet of soil.

\[
\text{Time to dig through soil} = \frac{\text{Distance through soil}}{\text{Rate through soil}} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}

"First, let's calculate the cost of the pomegranates Clara bought on Tuesday.

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the total cost before the voucher discount is:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \]

She got a $2 voucher, so the final cost for Clara is:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pomegranates Sheila bought on the next day.

The price per pomegranate increased to $30, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \]

The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount is:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the final cost for Sheila is:
\[ 600 - 60 = 540 \]

Now, we find the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila:

"To determine the number of good days left in the month, we need to first calculate the total number of good days and then subtract the number of good days that have already occurred.

Christina had twelve good days in total over the thirty days. The distribution of these good days is as follows:
- First eight days: 8 good days
- Second eight days: 0 good days
- Third eight days: 0 good days

So, the number of good days that have already occurred is:
\[ 8 + 0 + 0 = 8 \]

The next three days are described as good, neutral, and good. This means there are 2 more good days in the remaining days of the month.

To find the number of good days left, we subtract the number of good days that have already occurred from the total number of good days:
\[ 12 - 8 = 4 \]

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is:
\[ 4 \]"
"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Number of books Janey has} = 2S + 3 \]

We are given that Janey has 21 books. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 21 \]

To find \( S \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 18 \]

Next, divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 9 \]"
"First, we need to convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the current height in inches is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The bamboo grows 30 inches per day. We need to find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches. The difference in height needed is:

\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, the number of days required to grow 360 inches is:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 12 days."
"Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs. When 8 more dogs arrive, he needs to buy toys for these 8 dogs. So, he needs 8 toys.

After buying the toys for the 8 new dogs, there are now twice as many more dogs than when he left. This means there are 8 * 2 = 16 more dogs in the shelter. So, he needs to buy toys for these 16 dogs.

When James came back again, 3 dogs were gone, so he no longer needed the toys for those 3 dogs. However, this does not affect the total number of toys he needs to buy for the new dogs that arrived.

So, the total number of toys James needs is the sum of the toys needed for the initial 4 dogs, the 8 new dogs, and the 16 new dogs:

4 (initial toys) + 8 (toys for 8 new dogs) + 16 (toys for 16 new dogs) = 28 toys.

The final numerical answer is 28."
"First, let's determine how much Dylan invested. Dylan invested \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total amount of $1200.

\[ \text{Dylan's investment} = \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = \frac{2 \times 1200}{5} = \frac{2400}{5} = 480 \]

After Dylan's investment, the remaining amount in the account is:

\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

Next, Frances invested \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the remaining amount.

\[ \text{Frances's investment} = \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = \frac{2 \times 720}{3} = \frac{1440}{3} = 480 \]

After Frances's investment, the remaining amount in the account is:

\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 720 - 480 = 240 \]

Skyler's investment accounted for the rest of the remaining amount, which is $240.

\[ \text{Skyler's investment} = 240 \]

Exceeding load = 720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg

The final numerical answer is 20 kg."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Katarina has 68 cookies.
2. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so Max has \(68 + 5 = 73\) cookies.
3. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has \(73 - 12 = 61\) cookies.
4. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has \(73 + 23 = 96\) cookies.

Now, to find the total number of cookies they all have, we add up the cookies each person has:

\[68 + 73 + 61 + 96\]

Let's calculate the sum:

\[68 + 73 = 141\]
\[141 + 61 = 202\]
\[202 + 96 = 298\]

So, the total number of cookies they have is 298."
"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, so the extension is \( 0.5x \) cm.

She also adds 20 cm to the bottom of the dress with a lace trim.

The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm.

So, the equation representing the final length is:
\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Divide both sides by 1.5:
\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} \]
\[ x = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time Chris spent mowing half of his lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half in ""rabbit"" mode.

First, let's convert the times to a consistent unit. Since the question asks for the time in minutes, we'll use minutes for the calculations.

- In ""turtle"" mode, Chris takes 60 minutes to mow the entire lawn.
- In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris takes 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn.

Chris mows half of the lawn in each mode. Therefore, the time taken to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Similarly, the time taken to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode is:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

To find the total time taken to mow the entire lawn, we add the time taken in both modes:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is:
\[ 50 \text{ minutes} \]"

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( Tr \).

Given that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can write:
\[ T = Tr + 7 \]

Also, we know that the combined ages of the twins and the triplets are 44:
\[ T + T + Tr + Tr + Tr = 44 \]
\[ 2T + 3Tr = 44 \]

Substituting \( T = Tr + 7 \) into the equation:
\[ 2(Tr + 7) + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 2Tr + 14 + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr = 30 \]
\[ Tr = 6 \]

Now, substituting \( Tr = 6 \) back into the equation \( T = Tr + 7 \):
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, one of the twins is 13 years old. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how many coins Rong saves per month:**
   Rong saves 20 coins per month.

2. **Calculate how many coins Neil saves per month:**
   Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong. This means Neil saves \(20 + \frac{2}{5} \times 20\) coins per month.
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = \frac{40}{5} = 8
   \]
   So, Neil saves \(20 + 8 = 28\) coins per month.

3. **Calculate the total number of coins each saves in ten years:**
   There are 12 months in a year, so in ten years, there are \(10 \times 12 = 120\) months.
   
   - **Rong's total savings in 120 months:**
     \[
     20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins}

"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Since each vaccine costs $20 and John needs 2 vaccines, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \]

Next, let's denote the cost of the heartworm check as \( H \). According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as \( T \). Therefore, we have:
\[ H = 0.6T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + H \]

Since \( H = 0.6T \), we can substitute \( H \) in the total bill equation:
\[ T = 40 + 0.6T \]

To find \( T \), we need to solve the equation:
\[ T - 0.6T = 40 \]
\[ 0.4T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.4} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money the firefighters have left to raise and then calculate how many additional hours they need to work to reach their goal.

1. The total goal is $6300.
2. After 3 hours, they have raised $2100.
3. Therefore, the remaining amount to be raised is $6300 - $2100 = $4200.

Since they raise an equal amount of money every hour, we need to find out how many hours it will take to raise the remaining $4200.

\[ \text{Number of hours needed} = \frac{\text{Remaining amount}}{\text{Amount raised per hour}} \]

Since they raised $2100 in 3 hours, the amount raised per hour is:

\[ \text{Amount raised per hour} = \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

Now, we calculate the number of additional hours needed to raise $4200:

\[ \text{Number of additional hours} = \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

Adding the initial 3 hours to the additional hours:

\[ \text{Total hours needed} = 3 + 6 = 9 \]

"To find the percent of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the percentage of water used by the city for industrial purposes.
2. Subtract the industrial usage percentage from 100% to find the non-industrial usage percentage.

First, we know that Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. Out of this 40%, 80% is used for industrial purposes. Therefore, the percentage of water used by the city for industrial purposes is:
\[ 40\% \times 80\% = 40\% \times 0.80 = 32\% \]

Next, to find the percentage of water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the industrial usage percentage from 100%:

\[ 7 \text{ days/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 14 \text{ days} \]

Now, we calculate the total charge for 14 days:
\[ 14 \text{ days} \times \$12/\text{day} = \$168 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$168 \]"
"First, let's determine the production rate for each flavor.

For chocolate ice cream:
- 100 quarts in 2 hours means the factory makes 50 quarts per hour.

For vanilla ice cream:
- 50 quarts in 4 hours means the factory makes 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total production for 48 hours.

For chocolate ice cream in 48 hours:
- 50 quarts per hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts.

For vanilla ice cream in 48 hours:
- 12.5 quarts per hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts.

Adding the total quarts of both flavors:
- 2400 quarts (chocolate) + 600 quarts (vanilla) = 3000 quarts.

The final numerical answer is:
3000"
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of baked good:

- Croissants: 5 croissants * $3.00 each = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls * $2.50 each = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches * $4.00 each = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 blueberry muffins * $1.00 each = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost before the discount:

Total cost before discount = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $49.00

Marcus gets a 10% discount on his purchase. To find the discount amount:

Discount amount = 10% of $49.00 = 0.10 * $49.00 = $4.90

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final bill:

Final bill = $49.00 - $4.90 = $44.10

So, Marcus' total bill is $44.10."
"First, let's determine the cost of the deal. For every 2 scoops bought, Erin gets 1 scoop free. Since each scoop costs $1.50, the cost for 2 scoops is:

\[ 2 \times 1.50 = 3.00 \]

This means for every $3.00 spent, Erin gets 3 scoops of ice cream (2 bought + 1 free).

Erin has $6.00. To find out how many sets of $3.00 she can spend, we divide her total money by $3.00:

\[ 6.00 \div 3.00 = 2 \]

So, Erin can spend $3.00 twice, which means she can get 3 scoops twice, totaling:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Therefore, the total number of scoops of ice cream Erin should buy is 6."
"To determine how much more candy Amy has after two weeks compared to Ginger, we need to calculate the amount of candy each of them eats over that period and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the number of days in two weeks:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ days} \]

Next, we calculate how much candy Ginger eats in 14 days:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Then, we calculate how much candy Amy eats in 14 days:
\[ 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we find out how much candy Ginger has left after 14 days:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces} \]

And how much candy Amy has left after 14 days:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces} \]

Finally, we find the difference in the amount of candy Amy has compared to Ginger:
\[ 58 \text{ pieces} - 44 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy after two weeks. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 14 \]"
"To find out how many mosaic tiles Mr. Boarden needs to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the area of the bathroom that needs to be covered with tiles. This is two thirds of the total area of the bathroom.
2. Multiply the area that needs to be covered by the number of tiles required per square foot.

Let's start with step 1:
\[ \text{Area to be covered} = \frac{2}{3} \times 36 \, \text{sq ft} \]

\[ \text{Area to be covered} = 24 \, \text{sq ft} \]

Now, for step 2:
\[ \text{Number of tiles needed} = 24 \, \text{sq ft} \times 24 \, \text{tiles/sq ft} \]

\[ \text{Number of tiles needed} = 576 \, \text{tiles} \]

So, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom."
"First, let's calculate the total cost James incurred for picking the blueberries. The cost to go picking is $20, and the cost per pound is $1.5. He picked 30 pounds.

The cost for the blueberries he picked is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.5 \text{ per pound} = \$45 \]

So, the total cost for James to pick the blueberries is:
\[ \$20 + \$45 = \$65 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the same 30 pounds of blueberries at the store. The store price is $2.5 per pound.

The cost for 30 pounds at the store is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.5 \text{ per pound} = \$75 \]

Now, to find out how much James saved compared to buying at the store, we subtract the cost James paid for picking the blueberries from the cost of buying them at the store:
\[ \$75 - \$65 = \$10 \]

So, James saved:
\[ \$10 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the original price of each computer. The company planned to buy each computer for $700, but the price increased by 10%. To find the new price, we calculate 10% of $700 and add it to the original price.

10% of $700 is calculated as:
\[ 0.10 \times 700 = 70 \]

So, the new price of each computer is:
\[ 700 + 70 = 770 \]

Now, the company wanted to buy 500 computers at the new price of $770 each. The total amount of money they paid is:
\[ 500 \times 770 = 385000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices is:
\[ 385000 \]"
"First, let's calculate the calories from the eggs. John uses 6 eggs, and each egg is 75 calories. So, the total calories from the eggs are:
\[ 6 \text{ eggs} \times 75 \text{ calories/egg} = 450 \text{ calories} \]

Next, let's calculate the calories from the cheese. John uses 2 oz of cheese, and each ounce of cheese is 120 calories. So, the total calories from the cheese are:
\[ 2 \text{ oz} \times 120 \text{ calories/oz} = 240 \text{ calories} \]

Then, let's calculate the calories from the ham. John uses 2 oz of ham, and each ounce of ham is 40 calories. So, the total calories from the ham are:
\[ 2 \text{ oz} \times 40 \text{ calories/oz} = 80 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we add up all the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham to get the total calories in the omelet:
\[ 450 \text{ calories} + 240 \text{ calories} + 80 \text{ calories} = 770 \text{ calories} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the pencils and erasers.

The cost of one pencil is $0.50, so the cost of 6 pencils is:
\[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \]

The cost of one eraser is $0.25, so the cost of 8 erasers is:
\[ 8 \times 0.25 = 2.00 \]

Now, let's add the cost of the pencils and the erasers to find the total cost:
\[ 3.00 + 2.00 = 5.00 \]

You paid $10 for the items. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:
\[ 10.00 - 5.00 = 5.00 \]

So, the change you would get is:
\[ 5.00 \]"
"First, we need to find out how many people receive interviews. Since 30% of the 100 people receive interviews, we calculate:

\[ 100 \times 0.30 = 30 \]

So, 30 people receive interviews.

Next, we need to find out how many of these interviewees receive a job offer. Since 20% of the interviewees receive a job offer, we calculate:

\[ 30 \times 0.20 = 6 \]

So, 6 people receive a job offer.

Finally, we need to find out how many of these job offers are accepted. Since a third of the people who receive a job offer accept the position, we calculate:

\[ 6 \times \frac{1}{3} = 2 \]

Therefore, the number of people who accept the position is 2."
"Goldy gave a total of 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother, which sums up to 3 + 4 = 7 sacks. Since each sack contains 25 kilograms of rice, the total kilograms of rice she gave to her cousin and brother is 7 sacks * 25 kilograms/sack = 175 kilograms."
"This week, Castle bought 3 boxes of Coco Crunch and 5 boxes of Fruit Loops, which totals to 3 + 5 = 8 boxes of cereal.

Last week, she bought 4 boxes of cereal.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of taps Helga makes with both her feet over the 5-minute period, considering the different tap rates for different parts of her dance.

First, let's calculate the number of taps when her arms are at her sides:
- Right foot taps at 300 taps per minute.
- Left foot taps at 250 taps per minute.
- Combined, both feet tap at 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute.

For 3 minutes (since her arms are at her sides for 3 minutes out of the 5):
\[ 550 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 1650 \text{ taps} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of taps when her arms are raised:
- Right foot taps at 200 taps per minute.
- Left foot taps at 200 taps per minute.
- Combined, both feet tap at 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute.

For 2 minutes (since her arms are raised for 2 minutes out of the 5):
\[ 400 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 800 \text{ taps} \]

Now, we add the taps from both parts of the dance:
\[ 1650 \text{ taps} + 800 \text{ taps} = 2450 \text{ taps} \]

The combined total number of times that Helga taps both of her feet is:
\[ 2450 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost if Ron fixes the pothole himself.

The fine for unauthorized road maintenance is $120.
The cost of 3 buckets of asphalt is $25 per bucket, so for 3 buckets, it is \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.

The total cost if Ron fixes the pothole himself is the sum of the fine and the cost of the asphalt:
\[120 + 75 = 195\]

The damage to his car if the pothole is not fixed is $450.

The amount of money Ron saves by fixing the pothole is the difference between the damage to his car and the cost of fixing it himself:
\[450 - 195 = 255\]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[255\]"

"First, let's determine the total number of slices of pizza ordered. Since there are 5 people (Bryce and his four friends) and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate how many slices Bryce and two of his friends ate. They ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizzas:
\[ 2 \times 12 \times \frac{2}{3} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Then, we calculate how many slices the remaining two friends ate. They ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizzas:
\[ 2 \times 12 \times \frac{3}{4} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Now, we add the slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends and the slices eaten by the remaining two friends:
\[ 16 + 18 = 34 \]

Finally, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices to find out how many slices are left:
\[ 60 - 34 = 26 \]

So, the number of slices of pizza left is:
\[ 26 \]"
"First, let's determine the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages. The cat takes 30 minutes to eat nine sausages, and the dog takes \( \frac{2}{3} \) of that time.

\[
\text{Time for dog} = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we need to find the average time taken by the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. The average time is calculated by adding the times taken by the cat and the dog and then dividing by 2.

\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{\text{Time for cat} + \text{Time for dog}}{2} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}

"First, let's convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, Topher's shoe length of 8-feet and 4-inches is:

\[ 8 \times 12 + 4 = 96 + 4 = 100 \text{ inches} \]

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( x \) inches. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of windows in the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars.
- Each student's car has 4 windows.
- Therefore, the total number of windows in the students' cars is \(64 \times 4 = 256\) windows.

Next, let's calculate the number of windows in the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each teacher's car has 2 windows.
- Therefore, the total number of windows in the teachers' cars is \(32 \times 2 = 64\) windows.

Now, let's calculate the number of windows Hannah smashes in the students' cars:
- She smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.
- A quarter of 256 windows is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64\) windows.

Next, let's calculate the number of windows Hannah smashes in the teachers' cars:
- She smashes three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows.
- Three-quarters of 64 windows is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48\) windows.

Finally, let's add the number of windows smashed in the students' cars and the teachers' cars to find the total number of windows smashed:
- Total windows smashed = 64 (students) + 48 (teachers) = 112 windows.

"To find the percentage of blue spools, we first need to calculate the total number of spools and the number of blue spools.

Candy has:
- 15 light blue spools
- 45 dark blue spools
- 40 light green spools
- 50 dark green spools

The total number of spools is:
\[ 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150 \]

The total number of blue spools (light blue and dark blue) is:
\[ 15 + 45 = 60 \]

To find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplifying the fraction:
\[ \frac{60}{150} = \frac{2}{5} \]

Now, calculate the percentage:
\[ \left( \frac{2}{5} \right) \times 100 = 40\% \]

So, the percentage of blue spools is:
\[ 40\% \]"

"First, let's determine Dora's father's age. According to the problem, Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. Since Dora is 15 years old, we can calculate her father's age as follows:

\[
\text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8 = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38
\]

Next, we need to find Dora's mother's age. The problem states that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. Therefore, we can calculate her mother's age as follows:

\[
\text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4 = 38 - 4 = 34
\]

Now, we can find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother by adding their ages together:

"First, let's calculate the total weight of Cindy's math and science books. Since each of these books weighs 2 pounds and there are two of them:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds/book} \times 2 \text{ books} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know the weight of her French book:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \]

And the weight of her English book:

\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Her history book weighs twice as much as her English book, so:

\[ 2 \times 3 \text{ pounds} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

"First, let's calculate the number of votes candidate B received. Candidate A got 20% of the votes, and candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes.

Candidate A's votes = 20% of 100 = 0.20 * 100 = 20 votes

Candidate B's votes = Candidate A's votes + 50% of Candidate A's votes
Candidate B's votes = 20 + 0.50 * 20 = 20 + 10 = 30 votes

Now, let's calculate the total votes received by candidates A and B combined:
Total votes for A and B = Candidate A's votes + Candidate B's votes
Total votes for A and B = 20 + 30 = 50 votes

The rest of the votes were given to candidate C. Since there were 100 voters in total, the number of votes candidate C received is:
Votes for candidate C = Total votes - Total votes for A and B
Votes for candidate C = 100 - 50 = 50 votes

So, the final numerical answer is 50."
"First, let's determine how many apples Beck has initially. Since Boris has 100 apples and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, we can calculate the number of apples Beck has as follows:

\[ \text{Beck's initial apples} = \text{Boris's apples} - 23 = 100 - 23 = 77 \]

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. So, we need to update the number of apples each person has after this transaction:

\[ \text{Boris's apples after giving 10 to Beck} = 100 - 10 = 90 \]
\[ \text{Beck's apples after receiving 10 from Boris} = 77 + 10 = 87 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after this transaction:

\[ \text{Difference in apples} = \text{Boris's apples} - \text{Beck's apples} = 90 - 87 = 3 \]

First, since the total number of students in the two classes is 80 and each class has the same number of students, each class has:
\[ \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ students} \]

Next, since 40% of the students in each class are girls, the number of girls in each class is:
\[ 40 \times 0.40 = 16 \text{ girls} \]

Therefore, the number of boys in each class is:
\[ 40 - 16 = 24 \text{ boys} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 24 \]"
"Mara initially added 3 slices to the 2 slices already on the plate, making a total of 5 slices. She then tripled the number of slices, which means she had 5 * 3 = 15 slices. After eating 2 slices, she had 15 - 2 = 13 slices. When her friend stole 5 slices, the number of slices remaining on the plate is 13 - 5 = 8 slices.

The final numerical answer is 8."
"To find out how many animals Melissa will groom each day, we first need to calculate the total number of animals she has to groom this week. 

The total number of animals is:
8 dogs + 5 cats + 3 birds + 12 horses = 28 animals

Since she splits the grooming jobs evenly over the days of the week, and there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of animals by 7.

28 animals ÷ 7 days = 4 animals per day

So, the final numerical answer is 4."
"First, let's calculate the total cost Mark incurred. He bought 3 packs at $1800 each, so the total cost is:
\[ 3 \times 1800 = 5400 \]

Next, let's calculate the total value of the cards Mark received. He got one card worth $4000, another card worth $1000, and 30 cards each worth $50. The total value of these cards is:
\[ 4000 + 1000 + 30 \times 50 = 4000 + 1000 + 1500 = 6500 \]

The profit Mark made is the total value of the cards minus the total cost:
\[ 6500 - 5400 = 1100 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 1100 \]"
"To determine the savings, we need to calculate the total cost for Jake's family at both amusement parks and then find the difference.

For the first amusement park:
- The cost for 2 adults is \(2 \times 26 = 52\) dollars.
- The cost for 2 children is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dollars.
- The total cost for the first amusement park is \(52 + 24 = 76\) dollars.

For the second amusement park:
- The cost for 2 adults is \(2 \times 14 = 28\) dollars.
- The cost for 2 children is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) dollars.
- The total cost for the second amusement park is \(28 + 20 = 48\) dollars.

The savings by choosing the second amusement park over the first is the difference between the total costs:
\[76 - 48 = 28\]

So, they will be able to save 28 dollars if they choose the second amusement park over the first."
"To determine how much money the vendor saves a week, we need to calculate the daily savings and then multiply by the number of days in a week.

1. Calculate the daily savings:
   - Original cost per tomato: $0.50
   - New cost per tomato: $0.40
   - Savings per tomato: $0.50 - $0.40 = $0.10
   - Daily savings: 500 tomatoes/day * $0.10/tomato = $50/day

2. Calculate the weekly savings:
   - Daily savings: $50/day
   - Number of days in a week: 7 days
   - Weekly savings: $50/day * 7 days/week = $350/week

The final numerical answer is $350."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Sean's Marbles**: We are given that Sean has 56 marbles.
2. **Cal's Marbles**: Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. Therefore, if Sean has 56 marbles, Cal has \(56 \times 2 = 112\) marbles.
3. **Carl's Marbles**: Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. Since Sean has 56 marbles, Carl has \(56 \times 4 = 224\) marbles.

Now, to find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we add Carl's and Cal's marbles together:

\[224 + 112 = 336\]

So, the final numerical answer is 336."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many students would be in each group if the activity is divided into 12 groups.

First, we find out how many students would be in each group if there are 12 groups:
\[ \text{Number of students per group} = \frac{54 \text{ students}}{12 \text{ groups}} = 4.5 \text{ students per group} \]

Since the number of students per group must be a whole number, it is not possible to divide 54 students into 12 groups of equal size. Therefore, the question is asking for the number of additional groups needed to form, but since the division is not possible, the number of additional groups needed is not a whole number.

However, if we interpret the question as asking how many more groups are needed to form if we start from 6 groups and want to reach 12 groups, the answer would be:
\[ 12 \text{ groups} - 6 \text{ groups} = 6 \text{ groups} \]

So, the number of additional groups needed is 6."
"To calculate the total number of chairs Candy can rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during a single weekday and a single weekend day:
- Weekdays: 60 chairs per day
- Weekends: 100 chairs per day

Next, we need to determine the number of weekdays and weekend days in a 4-week month:
- There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a single week.
- Therefore, in a 4-week month, there are \(5 \times 4 = 20\) weekdays and \(2 \times 4 = 8\) weekend days.

Now, we can calculate the total number of chairs rented during a 4-week month:
- Chairs rented during weekdays: \(60 \times 20 = 1200\)
- Chairs rented during weekends: \(100 \times 8 = 800\)
- Total chairs rented in one 4-week month: \(1200 + 800 = 2000\)

Finally, we need to find out the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months:

"First, let's determine the total number of glasses and plates Jeff initially sent.

Jeff sent 8 dozen glasses. Since one dozen equals 12, the total number of glasses sent is:
\[ 8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ glasses} \]

Jeff also sent 4 dozen plates. The total number of plates sent is:
\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ plates} \]

Next, we need to account for the broken items. 10 glasses and 6 plates were broken. Therefore, the number of glasses and plates that are not broken are:
\[ 96 - 10 = 86 \text{ glasses} \]
\[ 48 - 6 = 42 \text{ plates} \]

Now, we add the number of glasses and plates that are not broken to find the total number of glasses and plates Jeff has now:

"First, let's determine how many small stickers Lorraine trades for large buttons. She starts with 30 small stickers and trades 90% of them:

\[ 30 \times 0.90 = 27 \text{ small stickers} \]

Since each large button is worth three small stickers, the number of large buttons she gets from trading 27 small stickers is:

\[ \frac{27}{3} = 9 \text{ large buttons} \]

Next, let's determine how many large stickers Lorraine trades for large buttons. She starts with 40 large stickers and trades 50% of them:

\[ 40 \times 0.50 = 20 \text{ large stickers} \]

Since each large button is worth three small stickers, the number of large buttons she gets from trading 20 large stickers is:

\[ \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ large buttons} \]

Since the number of large buttons must be a whole number, we assume she gets 6 large buttons (as typically fractional buttons are not considered in such problems).

Now, Lorraine has 20 - 20 = 0 large stickers left from the large stickers she traded, and she has 9 large buttons from the small stickers she traded. Therefore, the total number of large buttons she has by the end is:

\[ 9 + 6 = 15 \text{ large buttons} \]

Since each large button is worth three small stickers, and she has no small stickers left to trade, the total number of buttons she has by the end is:

\[ 15 \text{ large buttons} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 15 \]"
"To find out how many matches Joey played in one week, let's break down the information given:

- Joey played 2 matches on Monday.
- Joey played 1 match on Friday.
- Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday on Saturday, which means he played \(2 \times 2 = 4\) matches on Saturday.

Now, let's add up the matches played each day:

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, so it is \( 2x \).

The total number of votes cast is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is \( x + 2x = 3x \).

We know the total number of people on the council is 33, so:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x \):
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Thus, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Extra-small (XS) shirts**: 11 students need size extra-small.
2. **Small (S) shirts**: Twice as many students need size small as extra small. Therefore, the number of students needing size small is \(2 \times 11 = 22\).
3. **Medium (M) shirts**: Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size medium is \(22 - 4 = 18\).
4. **Large (L) shirts**: Half as many students need size large as size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size large is \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\).
5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts**: Six more students need size extra-large than large. Therefore, the number of students needing size extra-large is \(9 + 6 = 15\).

Now, let's sum up the total number of shirts ordered:

- Extra-small (XS): 11
- Small (S): 22
- Medium (M): 18
- Large (L): 9
- Extra-large (XL): 15

Total number of shirts = \(11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75\)

"To find the final price after a 5% discount on a $140 item, we first calculate the amount of the discount and then subtract it from the original price.

The discount amount is calculated as:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Original Price} \times \frac{\text{Discount Percentage}}{100} \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 140 \times \frac{5}{100} \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 140 \times 0.05 \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 7 \]

Now, subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the final price:
\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount Amount} \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 140 - 7 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 133 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 133."
"To find the total number of hours the 20 playlists will last, we need to follow these steps:

\[ \text{Total number of songs} = \text{Number of playlists} \times \text{Number of songs per playlist} \]
\[ \text{Total number of songs} = 20 \times 300 = 6000 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of hours:
\[ \text{Total number of hours} = \text{Total number of songs} \times \text{Length of each song in hours} \]
\[ \text{Total number of hours} = 6000 \times 10 = 60000 \]

So, the 20 playlists will last a total of 60,000 hours."
"First, let's calculate the number of people who think horse #2 will win. 

20% of 50 people is:
\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win. 

Next, we need to find out how many people are left after those who think horse #2 will win:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Now, 60% of the remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win:
\[ 0.60 \times 40 = 24 \]

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win. 

The rest of the people think horse #12 will win. To find out how many people think horse #12 will win, we subtract the number of people who think horse #7 will win from the remaining people:
\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \]

Therefore, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is 16."
"To find the total number of puppies Jana has, we can work backwards from the information given.

We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. Therefore, the total number of Pomeranian puppies is:
\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \]

Since these 18 Pomeranian puppies represent two thirds of all the puppies Jana has, we can set up the following equation to find the total number of puppies (let's call this number \( x \)):
\[ \frac{2}{3}x = 18 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by \( \frac{3}{2} \):
\[ x = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} \]
\[ x = 27 \]

So, Jana has 27 puppies in total."
"Jayden initially had $70 from selling pictures. His sister Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is $90 / 2 = $45. Adding this to the $70 Jayden already had, he now has $70 + $45 = $115. The camera costs $200, so the amount Jayden still needs is $200 - $115 = $85.

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The first house needs \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the second house, so the first house needs \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases.
- The third house needs double the first house, so the third house needs \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) cases.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{5}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{5} \):
\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{5} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. The third house needs double the first house, which is:
\[ 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = 2 \times \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 100 \]"

- The remaining movies are \( 600 - 200 = 400 \) movies.
- 40% of the remaining 400 movies are older movies, which means \( 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \) movies are older.
- The rest of the remaining movies are not in series or older, which is \( 400 - 160 = 240 \) movies.

Now, let's calculate the cost of replacing the movies:

- The cost for the series movies is $6 each, so the total cost for the series movies is \( 200 \times 6 = 1200 \) dollars.
- The cost for the older movies is $5 each, so the total cost for the older movies is \( 160 \times 5 = 800 \) dollars.
- The cost for the remaining movies is $10 each, so the total cost for the remaining movies is \( 240 \times 10 = 2400 \) dollars.

Adding these costs together gives the total cost of replacing the movies:

\[ 1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 4400."
"To calculate the total amount Winston spent on fruit, we need to multiply the number of pounds of each type of fruit by their respective prices and then sum the totals.

For peaches:
6 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $12.00

For plums:
8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = $8.00

For apricots:
6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Now, we add the totals:
$12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

So, Winston spent $38.00 on fruit."
"First, let's calculate the distance the Llesis family drove. They drove for 6 hours at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.

\[ \text{Distance driven} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 50 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, let's calculate the hiking speed. The hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half the driving speed.

\[ \text{Hiking speed} = \frac{50}{2} - 5 = 25 - 5 = 20 \, \text{miles/hour} \]

They hiked for 1.5 hours at this speed.

\[ \text{Distance hiked} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 20 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find the total distance to their vacation spot, we add the distance driven and the distance hiked.

\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance driven} + \text{Distance hiked} = 300 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 330 \, \text{miles} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 330 \]"
"Let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumps on as \( E_e \) and the number of berries she collects as \( B_e \). Ava jumps on \( E_a = E_e + 8 \) enemies and collects \( B_a = B_e + 3 \) berries. Emma's score is calculated as \( 10E_e + 5B_e \). Ava's score is calculated as \( 10E_a + 5B_a + 30 \times 4 \).

Substituting the values for Ava's score:
\[ \text{Ava's score} = 10(E_e + 8) + 5(B_e + 3) + 120 \]
\[ \text{Ava's score} = 10E_e + 80 + 5B_e + 15 + 120 \]
\[ \text{Ava's score} = 10E_e + 5B_e + 215 \]

Emma's score is:
\[ \text{Emma's score} = 10E_e + 5B_e \]

The difference in their scores is:
\[ \text{Difference} = (10E_e + 5B_e + 215) - (10E_e + 5B_e) \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 215 \]

So, the difference between their two scores is 215."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each. Then, we subtract this amount from the total cost to find the combined cost of the other two pizzas. Finally, we divide this amount by 2 to find the cost of each of the other two pizzas.

The total cost of the four pizzas is 64 dollars. The cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each is:
\[ 30 + 30 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting this from the total cost gives us the cost of the other two pizzas:
\[ 64 - 60 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the remaining cost by 2:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, each of the other two pizzas cost 2 dollars. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"To solve this, let's break down the problem into parts:

1. Chase and Rider ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days.
2. On two other days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days.

First, calculate the number of times they ride their bikes on the usual days:
- They ride 3 times a day.
- They ride for 5 days.
- So, the total number of rides on usual days is \(3 \times 5 = 15\).

Next, calculate the number of times they ride their bikes on the other two days:
- On these days, they ride twice as much as usual, which means they ride \(3 \times 2 = 6\) times a day.
- They ride for 2 days.
- So, the total number of rides on these days is \(6 \times 2 = 12\).

Now, add the rides from both sets of days to get the total number of rides in a week:
- Total rides in a week = rides on usual days + rides on other days
- Total rides in a week = \(15 + 12 = 27\)

The final numerical answer is 27."
"Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as \( w \) and the number of orange fish he bought as \( o \). We know that the total number of fish he bought from the pet store is \( o + w = 17 \).

After adding these fish to his pond, the total number of orange fish became \( 3 + o \) and the total number of white fish became \( 4 + w \). According to the problem, after adding the new fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish. This gives us the equation:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( o + w = 17 \)
2. \( 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \)

Let's solve the second equation first:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]
\[ 3 + o = 8 + 2w \]
\[ o - 2w = 5 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( o + w = 17 \)
2. \( o - 2w = 5 \)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use elimination. First, we'll eliminate \( o \) by subtracting the second equation from the first:
\[ (o + w) - (o - 2w) = 17 - 5 \]
\[ o + w - o + 2w = 12 \]
\[ 3w = 12 \]
\[ w = 4 \]

Now that we have \( w = 4 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( o \):
\[ o + 4 = 17 \]
\[ o = 13 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish and 13 orange fish. The number of white fish Bob bought at the store is \( 4 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total distance Andy travels in a week. Since he goes to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days. The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, so the round trip distance is 10 miles per day. Therefore, the total distance he travels in a week is:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 50 \text{ miles/week} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of gas Andy consumes in a week. Given that his car's fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon, the number of gallons consumed per week is:

\[ \frac{50 \text{ miles/week}}{10 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons/week} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost of the gas consumed in a week. The price of regular gas is $3 per gallon, so the cost per week is:

\[ 5 \text{ gallons/week} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 15 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie has in quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount from 140 quarters is:

\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie has in twenties. Since each twenty is worth $20, the total amount from ten twenties is:

\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Carrie spent 3/5 of the twenties. So, the amount spent on twenties is:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the amount spent on quarters and the amount spent on twenties to find the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch:

\[ 35 + 120 = 155 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is:

"To find out how many fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to calculate the total yield from the tomato plants and the eggplant plants separately, and then add them together.

For the tomato plants:
Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes, and Ricardo has 5 tomato plants.
So, the total yield from tomato plants is \( 22 \times 5 = 110 \) tomatoes.

For the eggplant plants:
Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants, and Ricardo has 8 eggplant plants.
So, the total yield from eggplant plants is \( 4 \times 8 = 32 \) eggplants.

Now, we add the total yield from both types of plants:
Total yield = Yield from tomato plants + Yield from eggplant plants
Total yield = 110 tomatoes + 32 eggplants
Total yield = 142 fruits

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 142."
"To find out how many OLED TVs were sold, we first need to determine the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold, and then subtract these from the total sales.

Given:
- One-fourth of the sales are smart TVs.
- One-eighth of the sales are analog TVs.
- The rest are OLED TVs.
- Total sales = 40 TVs.

First, calculate the number of smart TVs sold:
\[ \text{Number of smart TVs} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

Next, calculate the number of analog TVs sold:
\[ \text{Number of analog TVs} = \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5 \]

Now, calculate the number of OLED TVs sold by subtracting the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total sales:
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (\text{Number of smart TVs} + \text{Number of analog TVs}) \]
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (10 + 5) \]
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - 15 \]
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 25 \]

So, the number of OLED TVs sold is 25."

"First, we need to determine the temperature difference that needs to be prevented. The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. During the night, the temperature is 33 degrees colder than during the day, so the night temperature is:

\[ 45 \text{ degrees} - 33 \text{ degrees} = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

Since the night temperature is 12 degrees, we need to increase the temperature by:

\[ 32 \text{ degrees} - 12 \text{ degrees} = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs are needed to increase the temperature by 20 degrees, we divide the required temperature increase by the temperature increase per log:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ degrees}}{5 \text{ degrees/log}} = 4 \text{ logs} \]

So, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled by the first car:
- The first car travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance traveled by the first car is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}

"First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts of tea:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Now, let's add the quarts of tea consumed by all the students:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

We know that there are 10 quarts of tea left. Therefore, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we convert the total quarts to gallons:
\[ \frac{48}{4} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"Dale initially had 100 candies and sold 150, which means he sold more than he had. To correct this, he would need to return 50 candies. After returning the 50 unsold candies, he would have 50 candies left. Then he ordered 100 more candies, so he now has 50 + 100 = 150 candies. Since he started with 100 and sold 150, he needs to sell 150 more candies to have all of his candy sold. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

150"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students on campus at the end of each month and then find the difference from the initial number of students.

Starting with 10 students at the beginning of the year, the number of students doubles every month.

- At the end of January, the number of students is \(10 \times 2 = 20\).
- At the end of February, the number of students is \(20 \times 2 = 40\).
- At the end of March, the number of students is \(40 \times 2 = 80\).
- At the end of April, the number of students is \(80 \times 2 = 160\).
- At the end of May, the number of students is \(160 \times 2 = 320\).

Now, we need to find the total number of additional students who joined by the end of May, above and beyond the initial 10 students.

The total number of students at the end of May is 320, and the initial number of students is 10. Therefore, the number of additional students is \(320 - 10 = 310\).

The final numerical answer is 310."
"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we first need to determine the total number of branches he climbed during the week.

Given that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs and he made $105 during the week, we can calculate the total number of branches he climbed by dividing the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\text{Total money made}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} \]

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = 420 \]

Since he made this amount of money during the week, and there are 7 days in a week, we can find the average number of branches he climbed per day by dividing the total branches climbed by the number of days in the week:

\[ \text{Branches climbed per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches climbed}}{\text{Number of days in a week}} = \frac{420}{7} \]

\[ \text{Branches climbed per day} = 60 \]

So, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day."
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose initially picks:

- For the first 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals
- For the next 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals
- For the next 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals
- For the last 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals

Adding these together gives the total number of petals before any are dropped:
\[15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\]

Rose drops 1 of each type of flower, so she drops:
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

The total number of petals dropped is:
\[5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\]

Subtracting the dropped petals from the initial total gives the number of petals remaining in the vase:
\[101 - 22 = 79\]

So, the total number of petals in the vase is 79."
"First, let's determine the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean to make S'mores. John makes 9 S'mores and DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so together they make:

\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \text{ S'mores} \]

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they use 18 marshmallows in total. They started with 35 marshmallows and dropped 3 on the ground, so the number of marshmallows left is:

\[ 35 - 18 - 3 = 14 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Now, we need to determine how many S'mores they can make with the remaining 14 marshmallows. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they can make:

\[ 14 \text{ S'mores} \]

Since John and DeSean are sharing the remaining marshmallows equally, each of them can have:

\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ S'mores} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 7 \]"
"First, let's determine the total play time for each person in minutes. Jack and his two significantly worse friends can each play for 20 minutes. The friend who is significantly better can play for 1.5 times 20 minutes, which is 30 minutes.

The total play time for Jack and his two significantly worse friends is:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

The play time for the friend who is significantly better is:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total play time for all four friends is:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Since they play for 4 hours, we need to convert 4 hours into minutes:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to determine how many 20-minute intervals fit into 240 minutes:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/game}} = 12 \text{ games} \]

Since each game costs 1 quarter, the total number of quarters used is:
\[ 12 \text{ quarters} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"Let's denote the amount of each ingredient Tanya uses as follows:
- Let \( S \) be the amount of salt.
- Let \( O \) be the amount of oil.
- Let \( F \) be the amount of fragrance.
- Let \( C \) be the amount of citrus zest.
- Let \( G \) be the amount of sugar.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S = G \) (same amount of salt as sugar)
2. \( O = 2S \) (twice as much oil as salt)
3. \( F = C \) (same amount of fragrance as citrus zest)
4. \( S = C \) (same amount of salt as citrus zest)

Since \( S = C \) and \( F = C \), we can say \( S = F = C \).

The total amount of ingredients in the jar is 10 ounces. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total amount of ingredients as:
\[ S + O + F + C + G = 10 \]

Substituting the relationships into the equation:
\[ S + 2S + S + S + S = 10 \]
\[ 6S = 10 \]
\[ S = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \]

Since \( O = 2S \):
\[ O = 2 \times \frac{5}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \]

Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \( \frac{10}{3} \) ounces. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \frac{10}{3} \]"

"Paul currently has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes, which totals to 8 + 40 = 48 cupcakes. He needs 63 cupcakes in total, so he should buy 63 - 48 = 15 more cupcakes."
"If Robert has 20 cars, and Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, then Joe has \(2 \times 20 = 40\) cars.

Joe sells 20% of his cars, which is \(0.20 \times 40 = 8\) cars.

He gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother, which is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) cars.

After selling and giving away cars, the number of cars Joe remains with is \(40 - 8 - 16 = 16\) cars.

The final numerical answer is 16."
"To find out how much each student raised, we first need to determine the total amount of money raised by the students. The total amount raised by the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of this came from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to divide this amount by the number of students to find out how much each student raised. There are 20 students, so we calculate:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

Thus, each student raised $6,250."
"To calculate the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days in minutes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the time Sandy walked on the first day.
2. Determine the time Sandy walked on the second day.
3. Convert the total time from hours to minutes.

First, Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day.

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she did on the first day. Therefore, the time she walked on the second day is:
\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total time in hours:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we convert the total time from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply the total hours by 60:
\[ 12 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days in minutes is:
\[ 720 \]"
"During the lunch break, half the number of cars that were in the parking lot when Hunter got out of class had gone. Initially, there were 50 cars in the morning and 20 more cars arrived during the first break, making the total number of cars:

\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \]

When he got out of class for the lunch break, half of these 70 cars had gone, so the number of cars remaining in the parking lot is:

\[ \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Therefore, the total number of cars he counted during the lunch break is 35."
"To calculate how much John makes in a full 7-day week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily earnings:
   - John does 30 cycles of work a day.
   - Each cycle has 5 tasks.
   - Each task pays $1.20.
   - Therefore, the earnings per cycle are \(5 \times 1.20 = 6.00\) dollars.
   - So, the daily earnings are \(30 \times 6.00 = 180.00\) dollars.

2. Calculate the weekly earnings:
   - John works 7 days a week.
   - Therefore, the weekly earnings are \(180.00 \times 7 = 1260.00\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is 1260.00."
"In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, so Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points.

In the second game, which was at Julie's home court, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add the points from the first game to the points from the second game: 14 + 4 = 18 points.

The final numerical answer is 18."
"First, let's calculate the total number of tins of cat food Kimberly bought. She bought 8 packages of cat food, and each package contains 11 tins. So, the total number of tins of cat food is:

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now we know PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards. Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

So, the number of cards Becca has is 153."
"Cindy had 5 green eggs. She had twice as many blue eggs as green ones, so she had 5 * 2 = 10 blue eggs. She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs. Altogether, Cindy had 5 green + 10 blue + 9 pink + 3 yellow = 27 eggs. 

The final numerical answer is 27."
"First, let's calculate the shipping cost. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound plus $0.08 per mile.

The cost for the weight of the book is:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.35/\text{pound} = \$1.40 \]

The cost for the distance is:
\[ 20 \text{ miles} \times \$0.08/\text{mile} = \$1.60 \]

So, the total shipping cost is:
\[ \$1.40 + \$1.60 = \$3.00 \]

Next, we calculate the refundable amount from Amazon. Since Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, the refundable amount is:
\[ 32 \text{ dollars} \times 0.75 = \$24.00 \]

Now, we calculate the total cost Milly will incur:
\[ \text{Cost of the book} + \text{Shipping cost} = 32 \text{ dollars} + 3 \text{ dollars} = \$35.00 \]

Finally, the amount of money Milly will lose is the total cost minus the refundable amount:
\[ 35 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = \$11.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"

"To determine how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to work through the relationships given step by step.

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei can, so Saskay can lift a mountain \(12 \times 1 = 12\) inches.
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay can, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain \(4 \times 12 = 48\) inches.
4. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami can, so Naruto can lift a mountain \(10 \times 48 = 480\) inches.

"First, let's determine the speed relationship between the kangaroos and the turtles. If it takes 3 kangaroos 18 hours to travel across the highway, then the total distance \(D\) can be calculated as:

\[ D = \text{speed of one kangaroo} \times \text{time} \]
\[ D = \text{speed of one kangaroo} \times 18 \]

Now, let's consider the turtles. Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo. If we let the speed of one kangaroo be \(v\), then the speed of one turtle is \(v/2\). The total time \(T\) it takes for 4 turtles to travel the same distance \(D\) is given by:

\[ D = \text{speed of one turtle} \times \text{time} \]
\[ D = \frac{v}{2} \times T \]

Since \(D = 18v\) (from the kangaroo's travel time), we can substitute \(D\) in the turtle's equation:

\[ 18v = \frac{v}{2} \times T \]

Solving for \(T\):

\[ 18v = \frac{vT}{2} \]
\[ 36v = vT \]
\[ T = 36 \]

So, it will take 4 turtles 36 hours to travel across the highway. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to have to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to calculate the current daily milk production and then find out how much additional milk is needed.

The current daily milk production from 3 cows is:
\[ 5 \text{ liters/cow/day} \times 3 \text{ cows} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The additional milk needed is:
\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed to produce the additional 10 liters of milk is:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow/day}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs to have 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The final numerical answer is:

"Craig starts with 2 twenty dollar bills, which means he has a total of 2 * $20 = $40.

He buys six squirt guns at $2 each, so the total cost for the squirt guns is 6 * $2 = $12.

He also buys three packs of water balloons at $3 each, so the total cost for the water balloons is 3 * $3 = $9.

The total cost for the squirt guns and water balloons is $12 + $9 = $21.

Therefore, the amount of money Craig has left is $40 - $21 = $19.

The final numerical answer is 19."
"If Jack collected 60 dishes, and Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, then Jack has 60 / 2 = 30 socks.

Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has 30 * 2 = 60 socks.

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 30 (Jack's socks) + 60 (Peter's socks) + 30 (Jack's dishes) + 30 (Peter's dishes) = 150.

Therefore, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is 150."
"To determine how many students are good at math, we need to consider the information given:

- There are 20 students in total.
- 5 students are good at math only.
- 8 students perform well in English only.
- The rest are good at both math and English.

First, we calculate the number of students who are good at both math and English. Since the total number of students is 20, and we know the number of students who are good at math only and those who perform well in English only, we can find the number of students who are good at both by subtracting the sum of students who are good at math only and those who perform well in English only from the total number of students.

Let's denote:
- \( M \) as the number of students good at math.
- \( E \) as the number of students good at English.
- \( B \) as the number of students good at both math and English.

From the problem, we know:
- \( M = 5 \) (students good at math only)
- \( E = 8 \) (students good at English only)
- The rest are good at both math and English.

The number of students good at both math and English is:
\[ B = 20 - (5 + 8) = 20 - 13 = 7 \]

Now, to find the total number of students good at math, we add the students who are good at math only to the students who are good at both math and English:
\[ M = 5 + 7 = 12 \]

Thus, the total number of students good at math is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time required for one group to perform, including the time for getting on and off stage, and the intermission.

Time for one group:
- Getting on stage: 2 minutes
- Performing: 6 minutes
- Exiting the stage: 2 minutes
- Intermission: 10 minutes

Total time for one group = 2 + 6 + 2 + 10 = 20 minutes

The concert is 2 hours long, which is equivalent to 120 minutes.

To find out how many groups can perform, we divide the total concert time by the time required for one group:

Number of groups = Total concert time / Time per group
Number of groups = 120 minutes / 20 minutes per group
Number of groups = 6

So, the final numerical answer is 6."
"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years with simple interest, we can use the formula for simple interest:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Given:
- Principal (\(P\)) = $300
- Rate (\(R\)) = 3/4 of the original amount = 3/4 * $300 = $225 per year
- Time (\(T\)) = 3 years

First, calculate the simple interest:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times \frac{225}{100} \times 3 = 300 \times 2.25 \times 3 = 2025 \]

Now, add the simple interest to the principal to find the total amount:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Simple Interest} = 300 + 2025 = 2325 \]

So, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is $2325."

"First, let's determine the number of goats sold from each farm.

From Farm X, Mr. Smith sold 10 goats.

From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats as from Farm X, which means he sold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) goats.

Now, let's calculate the number of goats remaining in each farm.

In Farm X, initially there were 55 goats, and 10 were sold, so the number of goats left is \(55 - 10 = 45\).

In Farm Y, initially there were 45 goats, and 20 were sold, so the number of goats left is \(45 - 20 = 25\).

To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the remaining goats from Farm X and Farm Y:

\(45 + 25 = 70\).

So, the final numerical answer is 70."
"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
2. Divide the total amount spent on shoes by the total number of pairs bought.

James buys 2 pairs of shoes each month. There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of pairs of shoes he buys in a year is:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair of shoes, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs bought:
\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

So, the average amount James pays for each pair of shoes is:

The total number of homes built over the next three years is 144."
"Let's denote the ages as follows:
- Let \( S \) be my age.
- Then my brother's age is \( S + 3 \).
- My sister's age is \( S - 2 \).
- My mom's age is \( 3(S + 3) - 1 \).

The sum of our ages is given as 87. So we can write the equation:
\[ S + (S + 3) + (S - 2) + (3(S + 3) - 1) = 87 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ S + S + 3 + S - 2 + 3S + 9 - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 87 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 6S = 78 \]

Divide both sides by 6:

"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first calculate the total number of glue sticks required for the class. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks needed is:

\[ 27 \times 2 = 54 \]

Next, we need to figure out how many packs of glue sticks are required to get at least 54 glue sticks. Since glue sticks come in packs of 8, we divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:

\[ \frac{54}{8} = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks. To ensure he has enough glue sticks, we calculate the total number of glue sticks in 7 packs:

\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 \]

Since 56 is more than the 54 glue sticks needed, Mr. Jackson will have 2 extra glue sticks. Thus, the number of packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy is:

\[ 7 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of new infections each day and add them to the total number of infected people.

- **Day 0**: Initially, there are 10 infected people.
- **Day 1**: Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others, so the number of new infections is \(10 \times 6 = 60\). Therefore, the total number of infected people after Day 1 is \(10 + 60 = 70\).
- **Day 2**: Now there are 70 infected people, and each of them infects 6 others, so the number of new infections is \(70 \times 6 = 420\). Therefore, the total number of infected people after Day 2 is \(70 + 420 = 490\).
- **Day 3**: Now there are 490 infected people, and each of them infects 6 others, so the number of new infections is \(490 \times 6 = 2940\). Therefore, the total number of infected people after Day 3 is \(490 + 2940 = 3430\).

So, the total number of people infected after three days is 3430."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Rafaela received as tips. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate the total as follows:

\[ \text{Total tips for Rafaela} = 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Julieta received as tips. Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To find out how much less, we calculate 10% of Rafaela's total tips:

\[ \text{10% of Rafaela's tips} = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]

So, Julieta received:

\[ \text{Total tips for Julieta} = 800 - 80 = 720 \]

Now, to find out how much money Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether, we add their individual totals:

\[ \text{Total tips for both} = 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours Paige baked.**
Paige baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM. The total number of hours is:
\[ 6:00 \text{ PM} - 1:00 \text{ PM} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of banana bread loaves baked.**
Paige can bake 2 banana bread loaves per hour. Therefore, in 5 hours, she can bake:
\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of slices.**
Each banana bread loaf is cut into 8 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices from 10 loaves is:
\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

"Let's denote the number of books Anne has as \( A \). According to the problem, Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has \( A + 25 \) books. Additionally, Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Fawn has \( A + 12 \) books.

The total number of books they have together is 85. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ A + (A + 25) + (A + 12) = 85 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ A + A + 25 + A + 12 = 85 \]
\[ 3A + 37 = 85 \]

Next, we solve for \( A \):

\[ 3A = 85 - 37 \]
\[ 3A = 48 \]
\[ A = \frac{48}{3} \]
\[ A = 16 \]

So, Anne has 16 books. Since Fawn has 12 more books than Anne, we calculate the number of books Fawn has as follows:

\[ Fawn's \, books = A + 12 = 16 + 12 = 28 \]

Therefore, the number of books Fawn has is 28."

"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to determine how much Madeline and Keenan each pay per month.

Madeline pays 60% of the $400, so:
\[ \text{Madeline's monthly payment} = 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \]

Since the total monthly cost is $400, Keenan's monthly payment is:
\[ \text{Keenan's monthly payment} = 400 - 240 = 160 \]

Now, to find out how much Keenan spends per week, we divide his monthly payment by the number of weeks in a month:
\[ \text{Keenan's weekly payment} = \frac{160}{4} = 40 \]

So, Keenan spends $40 per week."
"First, let's calculate how many pieces Tobias ate on the first day. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 pieces:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ pieces}
\]

So, after the first day, the number of pieces remaining is:

\[
60 - 24 = 36 \text{ pieces}
\]

On the second day, Tobias ate 10 pieces, so the number of pieces remaining after the second day is:

\[
36 - 10 = 26 \text{ pieces}
\]

On the third day, Tobias ate \( \frac{7}{13} \) of the remaining 26 pieces:

"To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we first need to determine how many glasses Micah sold.

The total number of glasses sold by Julie, Micah, and Mitchell is 32. Julie sold 14 glasses. Since the boys (Micah and Mitchell) sold an equal number of glasses, we can denote the number of glasses sold by each boy as \( x \).

The equation representing the total glasses sold is:
\[ 14 + x + x = 32 \]
\[ 14 + 2x = 32 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ 2x = 32 - 14 \]
\[ 2x = 18 \]
\[ x = 9 \]

"First, let's calculate the total cost for Sarah to buy the rope for her friend. The rope is 20 meters long and costs $2 per meter.

\[
\text{Total cost for the rope} = 20 \text{ meters} \times \$2/\text{meter} = \$40
\]

Sarah will use the profit from selling the rope to buy a new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter. To find out how many meters of the new rope she can buy, we need to determine how much money she will have after selling the original rope.

\[
\text{Money left after selling the rope} = \$40
\]

Now, we need to find out how many meters of the new rope she can buy with $40.

\[
\text{Meters of new rope} = \frac{\$40}{\$1.5/\text{meter}} = \frac{40}{1.5} = \frac{400}{15} = \frac{80}{3} \approx 26.67 \text{ meters}
\]

Since the new rope costs $1.5 per meter, the total cost for the new rope is:

\[
\text{Total cost for the new rope} = 26.67 \text{ meters} \times \$1.5/\text{meter} = \$40
\]

Since the total cost for the new rope is exactly $40, Sarah will have no money left over after buying the new rope.

\[
\text{Money left over} = \$40 - \$40 = \$0
\]

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{0}

"To solve this problem, let's denote Melanie's current age as \( x \).

According to the problem, in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 10 = 18 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 18 - 10 \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

We need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. Let's denote the number of years from now as \( y \). At that time, her age will be \( 8 + y \), and we want this to be three times her current age:
\[ 8 + y = 3 \times 8 \]
\[ 8 + y = 24 \]

Solving for \( y \):
\[ y = 24 - 8 \]
\[ y = 16 \]

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of each item Kelly is buying:

1. **Bacon:**
   - Kelly has 5 packs of bacon.
   - The total cost for the bacon is $10.
   - Therefore, the cost per pack of bacon is $10 / 5 = $2.

2. **Chicken:**
   - Kelly has 6 packets of chicken.
   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - The cost per packet of chicken is $2 * 2 = $4.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the chicken is 6 * $4 = $24.

3. **Strawberries:**
   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries.
   - Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.

4. **Apples:**
   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples.
   - Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   - The price of each pack of apples is $4 / 2 = $2.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the apples is 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's sum up the total cost of all the items:
- Total cost of bacon: $10
- Total cost of chicken: $24
- Total cost of strawberries: $12
- Total cost of apples: $14

Total cost = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget:
- Money left = $65 - $60 = $5

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the usual runtime of Elaina's concerts as \( x \) minutes. According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, so the final concert is \( 2x \) minutes long. Additionally, at the end of the final concert, she performs a 15-minute encore. Therefore, the total runtime of the final concert including the encore is \( 2x + 15 \) minutes. We know from the problem statement that the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. So, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual runtime of Elaina's concerts is 25 minutes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 25 \]"
"Argo initially has 200 toys. After giving away 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky, the total number of toys given away is 40 + 80 + 30 = 150 toys. Therefore, the number of toys Argo has now is 200 - 150 = 50 toys.

"To find the total number of chimichangas made on those three days, we need to calculate the number of chimichangas made on each day and then sum them up.

- On Tuesdays, they make 125 chimichangas.
- On Wednesdays, they make 125 chimichangas.
- On Fridays, they make twice as many as on Tuesdays, which is \(2 \times 125 = 250\) chimichangas.

Now, let's add the number of chimichangas made on each day:

\[ 125 \text{ (Tuesdays)} + 125 \text{ (Wednesdays)} + 250 \text{ (Fridays)} = 500 \]

So, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many microphones are left after 20% of them are not able to fit in pairs. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Calculate 20% of the total microphones:
   \[
   20\% \text{ of } 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 10
   \]
   So, 10 microphones won't fit in pairs.

2. Subtract the number of microphones that won't fit from the total number of microphones to find out how many microphones can be paired:
   \[
   50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. Since the remaining microphones can be paired, we divide the number of paired microphones by 2 to find the number of pairs:
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]

Therefore, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage."
"First, let's determine the number of birds flying overhead. Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes. According to the problem, 2/3 of that number of birds are flying overhead. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of birds flying overhead} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of birds feeding. Jerry counts 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of birds feeding} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, we add up all the birds Jerry counts:

\[ \text{Total number of birds} = \text{Number of birds nesting} + \text{Number of birds flying overhead} + \text{Number of birds feeding} \]
\[ \text{Total number of birds} = 6 + 4 + 24 = 34 \]

"First, let's calculate the total number of petals on the orchids. Joelle has 5 orchids, and each orchid has 5 petals. So, the total number of petals on the orchids is:

\[ 5 \text{ orchids} \times 5 \text{ petals/orchid} = 25 \text{ petals} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals on the African daisies. Joelle has 4 African daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals. So, the total number of petals on the daisies is:

\[ 4 \text{ daisies} \times 10 \text{ petals/daisy} = 40 \text{ petals} \]

Now, to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies:

\[ 40 \text{ petals} - 25 \text{ petals} = 15 \text{ petals} \]

So, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants, so we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. We find the number of flowering plants by subtracting the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:

\[ \text{Number of flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25 \]

To find what percent of the total plants are flowering plants, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how fast a whirligig spins, we first need to determine the speed of the thingamabob. We know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, we can calculate the speed of the thingamabob as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{\text{Speed of whatchamacallit}}{11} = \frac{121 \text{ meters/second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters/second} \]

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can determine the speed of the whirligig. The whirligig spins five times faster than the thingamabob, so:

\[ \text{Speed of whirligig} = 5 \times \text{Speed of thingamabob} = 5 \times 11 \text{ meters/second} = 55 \text{ meters/second} \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Joe's Lawn Mowing:**
   - Tasha mowed Joe's lawn once for $6.
   - Therefore, the payment from Joe is $6.

2. **Kamala's Lawn Mowing:**
   - Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as she did Joe's lawn.
   - Since she mowed Joe's lawn once, she mowed Kamala's lawn three times.
   - The payment from Kamala is $6 * 3 = $18.

3. **Alba's Lawn Mowing:**
   - Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's lawn.
   - Since she mowed Joe's lawn once, she mowed Alba's lawn five times.
   - The payment from Alba is $6 * 5 = $30.

4. **Total Earnings from Mowing:**
   - Total earnings from mowing lawns = Payment from Joe + Payment from Kamala + Payment from Alba
   - Total earnings from mowing = $6 + $18 + $30 = $54.

5. **Total Earnings:**
   - Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns.

"First, let's determine Carl's weight. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, we can calculate Carl's weight as follows:

Carl's weight = Martin's weight + 16 kg
Carl's weight = 55 kg + 16 kg
Carl's weight = 71 kg

Next, we find Christian's weight, which is 8 kg more than Carl's weight:

Christian's weight = Carl's weight + 8 kg
Christian's weight = 71 kg + 8 kg
Christian's weight = 79 kg

Finally, we calculate Harry's weight, which is 5 kg less than Christian's weight:

Harry's weight = Christian's weight - 5 kg
Harry's weight = 79 kg - 5 kg
Harry's weight = 74 kg

The weight of Harry is 74 kg."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours John rents his car out in a month. He rents his car 10 times a month, and each time for 3 hours. So, the total number of hours rented in a month is:

"First, let's determine how many pages each person read over the two days.

Yesterday:
- Denise read 10 pages.
- Daniel read 13 pages.

Today:
- Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.
- Daniel was not able to read any pages today, so he read 0 pages today.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages each person read over the two days:
- Denise's total: \(10 + 18 = 28\) pages.
- Daniel's total: \(13 + 0 = 13\) pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total number of pages Daniel read from the total number of pages Denise read:

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to first understand the capacity of the pot and how it is divided among the family members.

The pot can fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls. Since Calvin is an adult, he will have one bowl of soup. His wife is also an adult, so she will have one bowl of soup as well. This means there are two adult bowls of soup used. The remaining soup will be for the two children.

The pot can fill eight child's bowls, and since two adult bowls have been used, the remaining soup can fill:
\[ 8 - 2 = 6 \text{ child's bowls} \]

Since there are two children, the number of times each child can have a bowl of soup is:

"To determine the amount of material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we first need to calculate the material required for each type of mask.

For small masks:
- 4 small masks require 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, 1 small mask requires \( \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \) yards of material.

For large masks:
- 3 large masks require 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, 1 large mask requires \( \frac{2.25}{3} = 0.75 \) yards of material.

Now, we calculate the material needed for 20 small masks and 8 large masks:
- Material for 20 small masks: \( 20 \times 0.5 = 10 \) yards.
- Material for 8 large masks: \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \) yards.

Adding these together gives the total material needed:

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( D \) be Duncan's age eight years ago and \( A \) be Adam's age four years ago.

From the problem, we know:
1. Duncan's current age is 60.
2. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( 60 - 8 = 52 \).
3. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was two times Adam's age four years ago.

So, we can write the equation:
\[ D = 2A \]
\[ 52 = 2A \]

From this, we can solve for \( A \):
\[ A = \frac{52}{2} = 26 \]

This means Adam's age four years ago was 26. To find Adam's current age, we add 4 years to 26:
\[ \text{Adam's current age} = 26 + 4 = 30 \]

To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 years to his current age:

"Let's denote the number of red balloons as \( R \) and the number of yellow balloons as \( Y \). According to the problem, \( R = 20 \).

Benny threw two pieces of bologna at each red balloon, so the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is \( 2R \). Given that \( R = 20 \), the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \).

The total number of pieces of bologna thrown at all balloons is 58. Therefore, the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons is \( 58 - 40 = 18 \).

Since Benny threw three pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, the number of yellow balloons \( Y \) can be found by dividing the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons by 3. So, \( Y = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).

Thus, the number of yellow balloons is 6. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of students playing each sport:

- Tennis: There are 6 students playing tennis.
- Volleyball: There are twice the number of students playing tennis, so \(6 \times 2 = 12\) students playing volleyball.
- Soccer: There are 16 boys and 22 girls, so the total number of students playing soccer is \(16 + 22 = 38\).

Now, let's add up the total number of students playing all the sports:

- Tennis: 6 students
- Volleyball: 12 students
- Soccer: 38 students

Total number of students = \(6 + 12 + 38 = 56\).

The final numerical answer is 56."
"First, let's calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class. Since there are 30 students and each student sold an average of 10 lollipops, the total number of lollipops sold is:

\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops. Each lollypop was sold for $0.8, so the total revenue is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollypop} = \$240 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops. Each lollypop was bought for $0.5, so the total cost is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollypop} = \$150 \]

Finally, the profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ \$240 - \$150 = \$90 \]

So, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops."
"To find the total number of Larry's pets, let's calculate the number of each type of pet step by step.

1. **Cats**: Larry has 3 cats.
2. **Dogs**: Larry has 3 times as many dogs as cats. Therefore, the number of dogs is \(3 \times 3 = 9\).
3. **Rabbits**: Larry has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. Therefore, the number of rabbits is \(9 - 2 = 7\).
4. **Fish**: Larry has three times the number of fish as rabbits. Therefore, the number of fish is \(3 \times 7 = 21\).
5. **Gerbils**: Larry has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has. Therefore, the number of gerbils is \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\).

Now, let's sum up all the pets:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Total number of pets = \(3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47\).

The final numerical answer is 47."
"Josh can eat 2 * 2 = 4 slices a day.

"Martha collects shells every month. She started collecting at the age of 5 and her 10th birthday marks the end of her collection period. To find out how many months she collected shells, we calculate the difference in years and convert it to months.

From age 5 to 10, she has 5 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of months is:

\[ 5 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 60 \text{ months} \]

Since she collects one shell each month, the total number of shells she has collected by her 10th birthday is:

\[ 60 \text{ shells} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 60 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total cups of tea**: Lana has 27 cups of tea.
2. **Rows of tea cups**: She divides these cups into 3 rows, so each row has \( \frac{27}{3} = 9 \) cups.
3. **Tea types in each row**: In each row, she brews an equal amount of chamomile and mint tea. Therefore, each row has \( \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \) cups of chamomile tea and \( \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \) cups of mint tea.
4. **Cups of cinnamon tea**: She uses the remaining cups to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea. Since she has already used \( 9 \times 2 = 18 \) cups for chamomile and mint tea, the remaining cups are \( 27 - 18 = 9 \) cups, but we know she uses 15 cups for cinnamon tea, which means the remaining cups are not part of the 9 cups she initially divided into rows.

Since the question asks for the number of cups of mint tea in each row, and we have established that each row has 4.5 cups of mint tea, the final answer is:

4.5"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground, given that he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

First, let's break down the time spent on each trip:
- The sloth takes 4 hours to make the trip down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up into his tree.

Since the sloth needs to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we need to find out how many trips he can make in 8 hours.

The time for one complete trip (down and back) is 4 hours. Therefore, in 8 hours, the number of complete trips the sloth can make is:
\[ \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips} \]

Since the sloth needs to collect 24 berries in 8 hours and he can make 2 trips in that time, the number of berries he needs to pick up per trip is:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip} \]

Thus, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip down to the ground is 12."
"First, we need to determine the amount of water in the tank. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons of water, the tank will have:

\[ \text{Tank capacity} = \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much water will be left in the tank after 6 days, given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. The total amount of water removed from the tank in 6 days is:

\[ \text{Water removed} = 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[ \text{Water remaining} = 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate his remaining budget after accounting for the items he has already purchased.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items he has already bought:
- 2 tubs of popcorn: \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars
- 4 boxes of candy: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars

Total cost of these items: \(16 + 8 = 24\) dollars

Colby's total monthly budget is $150. After spending $24, his remaining budget is:
\[ 150 - 24 = 126 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money he can spend on tickets. Since it is a Friday, the ticket price is $10. He has already seen 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, and 8 movies on other days, making a total of:
\[ 5 + 8 = 13 \text{ movies} \]

The cost of these movies is:
\[ 13 \times 10 = 130 \text{ dollars} \]

Since he has already spent $130 on tickets, he cannot afford to see any more movies with his remaining budget of $126. Therefore, the number of additional movies he can see is:
\[ 126 - 130 = -4 \]

Since he cannot see a negative number of movies, the final answer is:
\[ 0 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 0 \]"
"First, let's calculate the calories for the mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins.

For the mini cinnamon rolls:
- A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
- A mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll.
- Therefore, a mini cinnamon roll has \( \frac{600}{3} = 200 \) calories.
- Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls.
- So, the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls are \( 200 \times 200 = 40000 \) calories.

For the mini blueberry muffins:
- A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
- A mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin.
- Therefore, a mini blueberry muffin has \( \frac{450}{3} = 150 \) calories.
- Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins.
- So, the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins are \( 300 \times 150 = 45000 \) calories.

Now, let's add the total calories from both the mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins:
- Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls: 40000 calories.
- Total calories from mini blueberry muffins: 45000 calories.
- Therefore, the total calories from all the pastries are \( 40000 + 45000 = 85000 \) calories.

The final numerical answer is 85000."
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the five days and then divide that total by the number of days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, so she removed \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs each day.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days:
\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

First, add the Junebugs removed on Monday and Tuesday:
\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]

Next, add the Junebugs removed on Wednesday:
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]

Then, add the Junebugs removed on Thursday:
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]

Finally, add the Junebugs removed on Friday:
\[
243 + 57 = 300
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days is 300.

To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days (5):
\[
\frac{300}{5} = 60
\]

Thus, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is 60."
"To find out how much farther the bus traveled than the car, we first need to calculate the distance each traveled.

The distance traveled by the bus can be calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For the bus:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

For the car:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find out how much farther the bus traveled than the car:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to subtract the total number of other toys from the total number of toys Sophie has for her nephew.

The total number of other toys is the sum of the building blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings:
\[ 31 \text{ (building blocks)} + 8 \text{ (stuffed animals)} + 9 \text{ (stacking rings)} = 48 \]

Sophie's total number of toys for her nephew is 62. Therefore, the number of bouncy balls is:
\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

So, the number of bouncy balls that came in the tube is 14."
"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old:
\[ P + Pa + J = 100 \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
\[ Pa = J + 10 \]

3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
\[ P = Pa + J \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[ P = (J + 10) + J \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 \]

Now, we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

Now that we have \( J \), we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[ Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

So, the age of Peter is \( 50 \) years old. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 50 \]"
"Initially, Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons, so that's 4 friends * 2 balloons/friend = 8 balloons. Maria also got 2 balloons, so that's an additional 2 balloons. Therefore, before her mom gave them more balloons, the total number of balloons was 8 (for her friends) + 2 (for Maria) = 10 balloons.

Her mom then gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people in total (4 friends + Maria), that's 5 people * 3 balloons/person = 15 balloons.

So, the total number of balloons the girls had is 10 (initial balloons) + 15 (additional balloons) = 25 balloons."
"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes of stuff they have:

- 10 people donate 5 boxes each: \(10 \times 5 = 50\) boxes

Next, let's determine how many tables they can fit with the 60 boxes of stuff:

- They can fit 2 boxes per table
- Number of tables they can fit: \(60 \div 2 = 30\) tables

They already own 15 tables, so we need to find out how many more tables they need:

- Number of new tables needed: \(30 - 15 = 15\) tables

The final numerical answer is 15."
"First, let's calculate the total distance Zoey spits her seeds. Zoey has 40 seeds and spits each one 10 feet. So, the total distance Zoey spits is:

\[ 40 \text{ seeds} \times 10 \text{ feet/seed} = 400 \text{ feet} \]

Next, let's calculate the total distance Sydney spits her seeds. Sydney has 35 seeds and spits each one 12 feet. So, the total distance Sydney spits is:

\[ 35 \text{ seeds} \times 12 \text{ feet/seed} = 420 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we need to find the average total distance spat by both Zoey and Sydney. To do this, we add the total distances and divide by the number of people (which is 2):

\[ \text{Average total distance} = \frac{400 \text{ feet} + 420 \text{ feet}}{2} = \frac{820 \text{ feet}}{2} = 410 \text{ feet} \]

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the daily, monthly, and hourly widget production and sales revenue for each machine.

First, let's calculate the daily widget production for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1440 widgets/day
- WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1080 widgets/day

Next, let's calculate the monthly widget production for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: 1440 widgets/day * 30 days/month = 43200 widgets/month
- WidgetMaster 9000: 1080 widgets/day * 30 days/month = 32400 widgets/month

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling the widgets for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: 43200 widgets/month * $6/widget = $259200/month
- WidgetMaster 9000: 32400 widgets/month * $6/widget = $194400/month

Finally, let's find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000:

"To determine how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the total cost for his stay under both options and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost if Cameron chooses the 24-hour option:
- The initial 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos.
- The additional 12 hours (24-hour stay) cost 1600 pesos.
- Therefore, the total cost for the 24-hour option is 1000 + 1600 = 2600 pesos.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Cameron chooses the option of adding 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark:
- The initial 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos.
- Cameron stays from 5 pm to 10 am the next morning, which is 17 hours in total.
- The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos.
- The additional 5 hours cost 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.
- Therefore, the total cost for the 17-hour option is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Now, we find the savings by subtracting the total cost of the 17-hour option from the total cost of the 24-hour option:
- Savings = 2600 - 1350 = 1250 pesos.

The final numerical answer is:
1250"
"First, let's determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. So, we calculate twice the amount each goat needs and then subtract 3 pounds:

\[ \text{Hay per sheep} = 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep. There are 15 goats, and each needs 5 pounds of hay:

\[ \text{Total hay for goats} = 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

There are 12 sheep, and each needs 7 pounds of hay:

\[ \text{Total hay for sheep} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the total hay needed for the goats and the sheep gives us the total amount of hay Nate needs:

\[ \text{Total hay needed} = 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 159 \]"
"First, let's calculate John's earnings for the week:
\[ \text{Earnings} = \text{Hourly Wage} \times \text{Hours Worked} = 50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the gas:
\[ \text{Cost of Gas} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the remaining money after spending on gas:
\[ \text{Remaining Money} = \text{Earnings} - \text{Cost of Gas} = 300 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so we subtract that from the remaining money:
\[ \text{Money After Deposit} = \text{Remaining Money} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the pencils:
\[ \text{Cost of Pencils} = \text{Number of Pencils} \times \text{Cost per Pencil} = 5 \times 10 \text{ dollars} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the cost of the pencils from the money after the deposit:
\[ \text{Money After Buying Pencils} = \text{Money After Deposit} - \text{Cost of Pencils} = 150 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, let's calculate how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with the remaining money:
\[ \text{Number of Pens} = \frac{\text{Money After Buying Pencils}}{\text{Cost per Pen}} = \frac{100 \text{ dollars}}{25 \text{ dollars/pen}} = 4 \text{ pens} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles of apple juice are given to the students. There are 29 pupils, and each student receives 2 bottles of apple juice.

\[ 29 \text{ pupils} \times 2 \text{ bottles/pupil} = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher received from redeeming the coupons to find out how many bottles the teacher has left for herself.

\[ 900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

So, the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself is 842."
"To calculate the total charge for Patty's Plumbing, we need to consider the visit fee, the labor cost, and the cost of parts.

1. The visit fee is $40.
2. The labor cost is $35 per hour. Since the job took 2.25 hours, the labor cost is \(2.25 \times 35\).
3. The cost of parts is $60.

Let's calculate the labor cost first:
\[ 2.25 \times 35 = 78.75 \]

Now, we add the visit fee, the labor cost, and the cost of parts:

For the sweet potatoes:
10 sweet potatoes * $2 per sweet potato = $20

For the carrots:
4 carrots * $1.25 per carrot = $5

Now, we add up all the earnings:
$9 (from yams) + $20 (from sweet potatoes) + $5 (from carrots) = $34

So, Jen will earn $34 if she sells everything."
"First, let's calculate the distance James swims. He swims 60% of the 20-mile lake, which is:

\[ 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes for James to swim 12 miles at a pace of 2 miles per hour:

\[ \text{Time to swim 12 miles} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

James then rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is:

\[ \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

After resting, James swims the remaining 8 miles (20 miles - 12 miles) at half the speed, which is:

\[ \text{Speed for the remaining distance} = \frac{2 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile/hour} \]

The time it takes for James to swim the remaining 8 miles at 1 mile per hour is:

\[ \text{Time to swim remaining 8 miles} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, the total time it took James to get across the lake is the sum of the swimming time, the resting time, and the swimming time for the remaining distance:

\[ \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours} \]

"Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as \( A \), by Bahati as \( B \), and by Dinar as \( D \).

From the problem, we know:
1. \( B = A + 20 \)
2. \( B = D + 10 \)
3. The total points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar is 45, so \( B + A + D = 45 \).

First, we can express \( D \) in terms of \( A \) using the second equation:
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Next, we substitute \( B \) from the first equation into the expression for \( D \):
\[ D = (A + 20) - 10 = A + 10 \]

Now we substitute \( B \) and \( D \) in terms of \( A \) into the total points equation:
\[ (A + 20) + A + (A + 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]

Subtract 30 from both sides:
\[ 3A = 15 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points."

"Vince started stapling reports at 8:00 AM and continued until 11:00 PM. The total time he worked is from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is 5 hours and 0 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 5 hours is equal to 5 * 60 = 300 minutes.

Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many sets of 15 minutes are in 300 minutes, we divide 300 by 15:

300 minutes / 15 minutes/set = 20 sets.

Since each set of 15 minutes allows Vince to staple 30 reports, the total number of reports he stapled is:

20 sets * 30 reports/set = 600 reports.

So, the final numerical answer is 600."
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up early.

1. **Total sleep time**: Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Converting this to minutes:
   \[
   8 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Time spent sleepwalking**: Kim sleepwalked from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. The duration of sleepwalking is:
   \[
   2:38 \text{ a.m.} - 2:15 \text{ a.m.} = 23 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Time woke up early**: Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. This means she woke up at:
   \[
   6:00 \text{ a.m.} - 5 \text{ minutes} = 5:55 \text{ a.m.}
   \]
   The time she was awake before sleepwalking and before waking up early is:
   \[
   5:55 \text{ a.m.} - 2:15 \text{ a.m.} = 3 \text{ hours and } 40 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   Converting this to minutes:
   \[
   3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 220 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Total time awake**: Adding the time spent sleepwalking and the time she woke up early:
   \[
   23 \text{ minutes} + 220 \text{ minutes} = 243 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Time slept on the bed**: Subtracting the total time awake from the total sleep time:
   \[
   480 \text{ minutes} - 243 \text{ minutes} = 237 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Therefore, Kim slept on her bed for 237 minutes that day."
"First, let's determine the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has initially. Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has two dozen (24) measuring cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons as follows:

\[ \text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

Next, Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons. So, the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[ \text{Remaining measuring spoons} = 16 - 6 = 10 \]

Now, we add the remaining measuring spoons to the number of measuring cups to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining:

\[ \text{Total utensils} = \text{Remaining measuring spoons} + \text{Measuring cups} = 10 + 24 = 34 \]

So, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is 34."
"First, let's determine the initial number of occupied beds in the hospital. The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of these beds are occupied.

\[ \text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

So, the initial number of unoccupied beds is:

\[ \text{Initial unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 200 = 800 \]

Next, we need to calculate the number of patients admitted over 2 weeks. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, and 50 patients are admitted each day.

\[ \text{Total patients admitted in 2 weeks} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

Now, we can find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks by adding the initial occupied beds to the total patients admitted:

\[ \text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Finally, the total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks is:

\[ \text{Total unoccupied beds after 2 weeks} = 1000 - 900 = 100 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 100 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of emails Robyn sends to her family. We know that out of the sixteen emails, seven are work emails. Therefore, the number of emails that are not work emails is:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these nine emails are sent to her family. According to the problem, two-thirds of the remaining emails are to her family. So, the number of emails sent to her family is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

Now, we need to find out how many emails are left after sending emails to her family. This is:

\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

These three emails are sent to her boyfriend. According to the problem, one-third of these remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. So, the number of emails sent to her boyfriend is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

Therefore, the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day is:

\[ 1 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 1 \]"
"If Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, then Shawna is:

\[ 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

The final numerical answer is 45."
"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate the number that is 20% less than the number Courtney reported.

Courtney reported 48 people attended the concert. If this number is 20% more than the actual number, we can set up the following equation to find the actual number of attendees (let's call it \( x \)):

\[ 48 = x + 0.20x \]
\[ 48 = 1.20x \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.20:

\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \). According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 4J \) balls. We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so we can set up the equation:

\[ 2J = 2 \]

Solving for \( J \):

\[ J = 1 \]

Now we can determine how many balls each boy carried:
- Jeffrey carried \( J = 1 \) ball.
- Jason carried \( 2J = 2 \) balls.
- Jordan carried \( 4J = 4 \times 1 = 4 \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is:

\[ 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 7."
"To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the number of holes at the end of the first day.
3. Calculate the number of holes at the end of the third day.
4. Find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
- First day: 10 holes
- Second day: 13 holes
- Third day: 8 holes (but they filled in 2 holes, so they actually dug 8 - 2 = 6 holes)

Total holes by the end of the third day = 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 holes.

The island had four times as many holes by the end of the third day as it did at the end of the first day. So, the number of holes at the end of the first day is:
\[ \text{Holes at the end of the first day} = \frac{29}{4} = 7.25 \]

Since the number of holes must be a whole number, and considering the context of digging holes, it's reasonable to assume the number of holes at the end of the first day is 7 (as 7.25 would imply a fractional hole, which is not practical in this context).

Now, let's find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day. The number of holes at the end of the third day is 29, and the number of holes at the end of the fourth day is:
\[ \text{Holes at the end of the fourth day} = 4 \times 7 = 28 \]

So, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[ \text{Holes dug on the fourth day} = 29 - 28 = 1 \]

Therefore, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of corn chips based on the information given.

1. Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips.
2. Collins received 15 more corn chips than the number Amora and Lainey received, which means Collins received \(70 + 15 = 85\) corn chips.
3. The total number of corn chips is the sum of the corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins.

Let's calculate the total number of corn chips:

\[
\text{Total corn chips} = \text{Amora's chips} + \text{Lainey's chips} + \text{Collins' chips}
\]

\[
\text{Total corn chips} = 70 + 70 + 85

"To find the cost of the travel tickets, we need to calculate 50% more than the cost of the supplies. The supplies cost $400 in total.

First, calculate 50% of $400:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

Next, add this amount to the cost of the supplies to find the total travel cost:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

So, the travel cost is $600.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( X = S + 5 \)
2. \( S = 4A - 13 \)
3. \( X + S + A = 339 \)

First, we substitute the expressions for \( X \) and \( S \) from the first two equations into the third equation.

Substituting \( X = S + 5 \) and \( S = 4A - 13 \) into \( X + S + A = 339 \):

\[ (4A - 13) + 5 + (4A - 13) + A = 339 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 4A - 13 + 5 + 4A - 13 + A = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Add 21 to both sides:

\[ 9A = 360 \]

Divide by 9:

\[ A = 40 \]

Now, we can find \( S \) using \( S = 4A - 13 \):

\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

The final numerical answer is:
147"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Each episode is 20 minutes long.
2. Let the number of episodes be \( E \).
3. According to the problem, the number of episodes \( E \) is half as many as the minutes per episode. Since each episode is 20 minutes long, we can write:
   \[
   E = \frac{20}{2} = 10
   \]
4. To find the total time John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode:
   \[

   \]

Therefore, the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show is 200 minutes."
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance the bird traveled in each segment of her journey and then sum these distances.

1. **First Segment:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Direction: Norttherly
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \)

3. **Third Segment:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \)

Now, we sum the distances of all segments to find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes:

\[ 300 \text{ miles} + 36 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 446 \text{ miles} \]

The distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is \( 446 \) miles."
"First, let's calculate the total number of brownies Greta had initially:

- For herself, she made 1 dozen brownies, which is 12 brownies.
- At her office, she received 1/2 dozen brownies, which is 6 brownies.
- At her friends' surprise party, she received 4 dozen brownies, which is 48 brownies.

So, the total number of brownies she received is:
12 (from herself) + 6 (from the office) + 48 (from her friends) = 66 brownies.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. Since 1 dozen is 12, 1 1/2 dozen is 18 brownies.

Therefore, the number of brownies left after the party is:
66 (total received) - 18 (eaten) = 48 brownies.

The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total cost of the phones, we need to consider the pricing structure and the number of phones John is buying.

1. The first two phones cost the full price of $600 each.
2. Each phone after the first two is half price, which means each of these phones costs $600 / 2 = $300.

John is buying phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, which totals 4 phones.

- Cost of the first 2 phones: 2 * $600 = $1200
- Cost of the remaining 2 phones (half price): 2 * $300 = $600

Adding these together gives the total cost:
$1200 + $600 = $1800

So, the final numerical answer is 1800."

"First, let's determine the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington initially had and how many she gave away:

- Total boxes bought: 12
- Boxes given to mom: 2
- Boxes given to sister: 2

Total boxes given away = 2 + 2 = 4

So, the number of boxes Mrs. Harrington kept is:
12 - 4 = 8

Each box contains 20 oranges, so the total number of oranges is:
12 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 240 oranges

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges, so the number of oranges she kept is:
1/4 * 240 oranges = 60 oranges

Therefore, the number of oranges she sold is:
240 oranges - 60 oranges = 180 oranges

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( x \).

According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. Therefore, the number of states in India can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Number of states in India} = \frac{x}{2} + 4 \]

We need to find the total number of states in both countries together. This can be calculated by adding the number of states in India to the number of states in the USA:
\[ \text{Total number of states} = x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ \text{Total number of states} = x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{3x}{2} + 4 \]

To find the total number of states, we need to know the value of \( x \). However, the problem does not provide the exact number of states in the USA. Without this information, we cannot determine a specific numerical answer. 

If we assume the problem is asking for a general expression or if there's a specific value for \( x \) that was intended but not provided, we can't proceed further with a numerical answer.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Tyler wants to buy:
- Dictionary: $18
- Dinosaur book: $13
- Children's cookbook: $8

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Tyler has already saved $14. Therefore, the additional amount he needs to buy the books is:
Additional amount needed = Total cost - Amount saved
Additional amount needed = $39 - $14 = $25

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn the additional $25, we divide the additional amount needed by his hourly wage:
Hours needed = Additional amount needed / Hourly wage
Hours needed = $25 / $5 = 5 hours

So, Tyler has to work 5 hours to afford his books."
"First, let's determine how many cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 30 cherries and 10 more than Richard, we can calculate Richard's cherries as follows:

\[ \text{Richard's cherries} = \text{Robert's cherries} - 10 = 30 - 10 = 20 \]

Now, we know the total number of cherries is 60. We can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting the number of cherries Richard and Robert have from the total:

\[ \text{Jerry's cherries} = \text{Total cherries} - (\text{Richard's cherries} + \text{Robert's cherries}) = 60 - (20 + 30) = 60 - 50 = 10 \]

Now, to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Robert's cherries} - \text{Jerry's cherries} = 30 - 10 = 20 \]

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's define the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother as \(D\) and \(B\) respectively.

Given:
- Emil is currently 19 years old.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.

First, let's determine how many years it will be until Emil turns 24:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \text{ years} \]

In 5 years, Emil will be 24 years old, and his dad will be \(D + 5\) years old. According to the problem, at that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad:
\[ 24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5) \]
\[ 48 = D + 5 \]
\[ D = 43 \]

So, Emil's dad is currently 43 years old.

Next, in 5 years, Emil will be 24 years old, and he will be twice as old as his brother:
\[ 24 = 2 \times (B + 5) \]
\[ 24 = 2B + 10 \]
\[ 14 = 2B \]
\[ B = 7 \]

So, Emil's brother is currently 7 years old.

"First, let's find out how many students are football players. Since 20% of the class are football players, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 30 = \frac{20}{100} \times 30 = 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are football players. This means the remaining number of students is:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining 24 students are cheerleaders or part of the band. Since 25% of the remaining students are cheerleaders or part of the band, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 24 = \frac{25}{100} \times 24 = 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are either cheerleaders or part of the band. Adding the football players to these students, we get the total number of students leaving early:

\[ 6 \text{ (football players)} + 6 \text{ (cheerleaders or band members)} = 12 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we first need to determine the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size five boots, Charlie wears size \(5 \times 5 = 25\) boots.

Next, we calculate the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie. The average is found by adding the sizes of their boots and then dividing by 2:

\[
\text{Average size} = \frac{\text{Charlie's size} + \text{Sophie's size}}{2} = \frac{25 + 5}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

15"
"First, let's convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches to match the units of the flower width. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

\[ 111 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 1332 \text{ inches} \]

Each flower is 12 inches wide, and there needs to be 1.5 feet of space between each plant. Since 1.5 feet is equivalent to 18 inches, we need to calculate how many plants can fit in the flower bed.

The total space taken by one plant and the space between it and the next plant is:

\[ 12 \text{ inches (flower)} + 18 \text{ inches (space)} = 30 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we can determine how many such units fit into the 1332 inches of the flower bed:

\[ \frac{1332 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/unit}} = 44.4 \text{ units} \]

Since we can't have a fraction of a unit in this context, we take the whole number part, which means 44 units can fit, and there will be some space left over. However, we need to consider the 17 plants Pat already owns. Each of these plants takes up 12 inches, so the total space taken by these 17 plants is:

\[ 17 \text{ plants} \times 12 \text{ inches/plant} = 204 \text{ inches} \]

Subtracting this from the total length of the flower bed gives us the remaining space:

\[ 1332 \text{ inches} - 204 \text{ inches} = 1128 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we can calculate how many additional plants can fit in the remaining space:

\[ \frac{1128 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/unit}} = 37.6 \text{ units} \]

Again, we take the whole number part, which means 37 additional plants can fit. Adding the 17 plants Pat already owns, the total number of plants Pat will have is:

\[ 17 + 37 = 54 \text{ plants} \]

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for the plants is:

\[ 54 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 324 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 324 \]"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we first need to determine how many pretzels his brother eats in a day. Since Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, we calculate:

\[ \text{Pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many pretzels his brother eats in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of pretzels he eats in a day by 7:

\[ \text{Pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week} = 9 \times 7 = 63 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 63 \]"
"To determine the total cost Katherine will spend, we need to calculate the cost for one basket and then multiply by the number of baskets.

First, let's calculate the cost for one basket:
- Cost of petunias: 3 petunias * $3.00/petunia = $9.00
- Cost of sweet potato vines: 2 sweet potato vines * $2.50/vine = $5.00

Total cost for one basket:
$9.00 (petunias) + $5.00 (sweet potato vines) = $14.00

Now, we need to find the total cost for 5 baskets:
5 baskets * $14.00/basket = $70.00

Therefore, the total amount Katherine will spend is $70.00."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

For the sunflowers:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

For the carnations:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of soil they have is 30 pounds. So, the remaining soil for roses is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. Therefore, the number of roses they can plant is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"First, let's determine how much Jessica sets aside each month for fancy shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly paycheck.

\[ \text{Monthly savings for shoes} = 25\% \times \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times \$2,000.00 = \$500.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy with her monthly savings. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes per month} = \frac{\$500.00}{\$1,000.00} = 0.5 \]

Since Jessica can only buy whole pairs of shoes, she can buy 0 pairs of shoes per month.

To find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year, we need to consider the number of months in a year, which is 12.

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes per year} = 0.5 \times 12 = 6 \]

However, since she can only buy whole pairs, the number of pairs she can buy in a year is 0.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 0 \]"
"First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, the time required to peel 90 shrimp is:

\[ \text{Time to peel} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to saute 30 shrimp. Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, the time required to saute 90 shrimp (which is three times 30 shrimp) is:

\[ \text{Time to saute} = 3 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Emily can peel and saute simultaneously, the total time required to peel and saute 90 shrimp is the longer of the two times calculated, which is 30 minutes.

So, the final numerical answer is 30 minutes."
"First, let's calculate the temperature change during each phase of the air conditioner's operation.

1. **Low setting for 3 hours:**
   - Cooling rate: 2 degrees per hour
   - Time: 3 hours
   - Temperature change: \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ degrees}\)

2. **High setting for 4 hours:**
   - Cooling rate: 3 degrees per hour
   - Time: 4 hours
   - Temperature change: \(3 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ degrees}\)

3. **Off for 2 hours:**
   - No cooling, so the temperature increases by 2 degrees per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Temperature change: \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ degrees}\)

Now, let's sum up the temperature changes:
- Total cooling: \(6 \text{ degrees} + 12 \text{ degrees} = 18 \text{ degrees}\)
- Total warming: \(4 \text{ degrees}\)

Net temperature change: \(18 \text{ degrees} - 4 \text{ degrees} = 14 \text{ degrees}\)

Since the air conditioner was off for 2 hours, the room would have warmed up by 4 degrees during that time. Therefore, the final temperature is 4 degrees higher than the starting temperature.

The final temperature is 4 degrees higher than the starting temperature, so the room is 4 degrees higher than the starting temperature. The room is 4 degrees lower than the starting temperature if we consider the cooling effect.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's father when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Bill's father saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Since his father was 30 years old when he saw the comet, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet for the second time.

3. **Determine the age difference between the first and second sightings:**
   - The comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, so the second sighting is 75 years after the first sighting.
   - Therefore, Bill was 90 - 75 = 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, let's break down his monthly check-writing habits:

1. Electric bill: 1 check per month
2. Gas bill: 1 check per month
3. Church: 2 checks per month
4. Pest and lawn service: 1 check every quarter (which is 3 months)

First, let's calculate the total number of checks he writes in a year for each category:

- Electric bill: 1 check/month * 12 months/year = 12 checks/year
- Gas bill: 1 check/month * 12 months/year = 12 checks/year
- Church: 2 checks/month * 12 months/year = 24 checks/year
- Pest and lawn service: 1 check/3 months * 12 months/year = 4 checks/year

Now, let's sum these up to find the total number of checks Buford writes per year:

12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52 checks/year

So, the final numerical answer is 52."
"Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as \( F \). According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4}F \). The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany, so the number of flights to France is \( \frac{1}{4}F \) and the number of flights to Germany is also \( \frac{1}{4}F \).

The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, which is half the number of flights the first plane makes. Therefore, the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day is \( 2 \times 44 = 88 \). So, \( F = 88 \).

Now, we can calculate the number of flights to France by the first plane:
\[ \text{Flights to France} = \frac{1}{4}F = \frac{1}{4} \times 88 = 22. \]

The final numerical answer is:
22"
"First, let's determine the duration of each wolf's howl.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so:
\[ \text{Chikote's howl duration} = 2 \times 20 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Igneous howls for as long as Tobias and Chikote combined, so:
\[ \text{Igneous's howl duration} = 20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} = 60 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, let's find the combined duration of all three wolves' howls in seconds:
\[ \text{Combined duration} = 20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} + 60 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ seconds} \]

To convert the combined duration from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):
\[ \text{Combined duration in minutes} = \frac{120 \text{ seconds}}{60} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much money Adam's father gave him. Since his father gave him twice as much as his mother, and his mother gave him $6, his father gave him:

\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Now, let's add the money given by his mother and father:

\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \]

Adam spent $30 on the trousers. To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount given by his parents from the cost of the trousers:

\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

So, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"To find Wilfred's age, we first need to determine the average age of the group. The total age of the children is given as 20 years. Since there are four children, the average age is:

\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Total age of the children}}{\text{Number of children}} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \text{ years}
\]

Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. Therefore, Helene's age is:

\[
\text{Helene's age} = 2 \times \text{Average age} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ years}
\]

Now, we know the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene. We can use this information to find Wilfred's age. Let's denote Wilfred's age by \( W \). The sum of the ages of all four children is 20, so we can write the equation:

\[
\text{Akbar's age} + \text{Alessandro's age} + \text{Helene's age} + \text{Wilfred's age} = 20
\]

Substituting the known ages into the equation:

\[
3 + 4 + 10 + W = 20
\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[
17 + W = 20
\]

Solving for \( W \):

\[
W = 20 - 17 = 3
\]

Therefore, Wilfred's age is:

\[
\boxed{3}

"First, let's calculate the total amount Walter has collected from his neighbors and the online fund:

- From neighbors: $500
- From online fund: $1500

Total collected so far: $500 + $1500 = $2000

Next, Walter's lawyer is going to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. To find out how much the lawyer will donate, we need to know how much everyone else has donated. Walter's friend is going to donate $200, which is the amount that will trigger the lawyer's donation.

Since the lawyer will donate three times the amount of what everyone else donates, the lawyer's donation will be:

$200 * 3 = $600

So, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $600."
"First, we need to calculate the total number of cookies. Since there were 100 guests and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies/guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies} \]

The bride decided to give half of the cookies to the church next door. Therefore, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500 \text{ cookies}}{2} = 750 \text{ cookies} \]

Each person in the church next door got 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church next door, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people} \]

So, the number of people in the church next door is 50."
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the distribution of the watermelon slices among the family members. Let's denote the total volume of the watermelon as \( V \).

Given that there are 2 adults and 4 kids, and each adult's slice is twice as big as each kid's slice, we can represent the volume of each adult's slice as \( 2x \) and the volume of each kid's slice as \( x \).

The total volume of the watermelon is the sum of the volumes of all the slices:
\[ 2(2x) + 4(x) = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

Since the total volume of the watermelon is \( V \), we have:
\[ 8x = V \]

Each adult's slice is \( 2x \), so the total volume of the slices for the adults is:
\[ 2(2x) = 4x \]

To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we calculate:
\[ \frac{4x}{V} \times 100\% \]

Since \( 8x = V \), we can substitute \( V \) with \( 8x \):
\[ \frac{4x}{8x} \times 100\% = \frac{1}{2} \times 100\% = 50\% \]

Therefore, each adult gets 50% of the watermelon."
"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones will spend on checking on the inpatients. He has 9 inpatients, and it takes him 20 minutes per inpatient.

\[ 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes per inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's convert the 180 minutes into hours:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the total time he will spend on his appointments. He has 10 appointments, and each appointment takes 30 minutes.

\[ 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes per appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's convert the 300 minutes into hours:

"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to complete all the steps and then subtract this total from the desired serving time of 5:00 pm.

1. Time to make the cake batter: 20 minutes
2. Time to bake the cake: 30 minutes
3. Time to cool the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
4. Time to frost the cake: 10 minutes

Now, let's add up all these times:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Convert 180 minutes into hours and minutes:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Jordan needs 3 hours to complete all the steps. If she wants the cake to be ready by 5:00 pm, we subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm:

- Fixed cost per session: $25
- Variable cost per student per session: $1.50
- Number of students: 10
- Total variable cost per session: $1.50 * 10 = $15
- Total cost per session: $25 + $15 = $40

Next, let's calculate the total earnings per session:
- Number of days the studio is rented per week: 3
- Number of weeks in a month: 4 (assuming a 4-week month)
- Total sessions in a month: 3 days/week * 4 weeks = 12 sessions
- Total earnings per session: $40

Finally, let's calculate the total earnings for the month:
- Total earnings for the month: $40/session * 12 sessions = $480

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"To find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we first need to determine the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes.

Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars. Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes is:
\[ \text{Chocolate bars per box (Peter)} = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]

Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars. Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes is:
\[ \text{Chocolate bars per box (Martha)} = \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

Now, to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we subtract the number of chocolate bars per box for Martha from the number of chocolate bars per box for Peter:
\[ \text{Difference} = 16 - 8 = 8 \]

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha."
"First, let's find the number of female porcupines in the park. Given that the number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the number of babies born each month is:

\[ \text{Number of babies per month} = 30 \times 4 = 120 \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[ \text{Total number of babies in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440 \]

The total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be the original population plus the total number of babies born in a year:

\[ \text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1490 \]"
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the swimming pool. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:

\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

\[ \text{Volume} = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. We know that 1 cubic foot is approximately equal to 7.48 gallons. Therefore:

\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = 1400 \times 7.48 \]

\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = 10472 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:

\[ \text{Cost} = 10472 \times 0.10 \]

\[ \text{Cost} = 1047.20 \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is $1047.20."

"First, we calculate the distance Matteo traveled. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Matteo:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 55 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance Shandy traveled:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} = 45 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the distance Matteo traveled from the distance Shandy traveled:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many laps each person can run:

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) laps.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps.

Now, to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run:

\[10 - 5 = 5\]

So, Bethany can run 5 more laps than Quinn."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days and then subtract this from the tank's total capacity.

First, let's determine the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day:

- Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity on the first day.
- The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, so Wanda pumped \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons on the first day.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda, so she pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons on the first day.

Next, let's determine the amount of water pumped on the second day:

- Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day, so she pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons on the second day.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day, so she pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons on the second day.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank over the two days:

- Total water pumped by Wanda: \( 4500 + 3000 = 7500 \) gallons.
- Total water pumped by Ms. B: \( 3375 + 1125 = 4500 \) gallons.
- Total water pumped into the tank: \( 7500 + 4500 = 12000 \) gallons.

Finally, we subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity to find out how much water is remaining:

- Remaining water: \( 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \) gallons.

The final numerical answer is 6000 gallons."
"Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as \( C \).

First, we know that the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour for 5 hours. This means that after 5 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ C \times (1 - 0.09)^5 = C \times 0.91^5 \]

Calculating \( 0.91^5 \):
\[ 0.91^5 \approx 0.652 \]

So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is approximately:
\[ C \times 0.652 \]

Next, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour for 3 hours. This means that after another 3 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ C \times 0.652 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = C \times 0.652 \times 0.93^3 \]

Calculating \( 0.93^3 \):
\[ 0.93^3 \approx 0.817 \]

So, after 8 hours, the charge remaining is approximately:
\[ C \times 0.652 \times 0.817 \]

We know that after 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%, or 0.28. Therefore:
\[ C \times 0.652 \times 0.817 = 0.28 \]

Now, we solve for \( C \):
\[ C = \frac{0.28}{0.652 \times 0.817} \]
\[ C = \frac{0.28}{0.534} \]
\[ C \approx 0.523 \]

So, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 52.3%."
"First, let's calculate Janet's total weekly earnings. She earns $10 per hour from wages and $15 per hour from tips, so her total weekly earnings are:

\[ 10 + 15 = 25 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are:

\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ dollars per week} \]

Next, we need to determine how much she needs to save to buy the car. The down payment for the car is $10,000. She wants to save 20% of this amount:

\[ 10000 \times 0.20 = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to save $2000 at a rate of $1000 per week. We do this by dividing the total amount she needs to save by her weekly savings:

\[ \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

So, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment for the car. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased:

- Peaches: 3 peaches * $0.50 each = $1.50
- Pears: 4 pears * $0.50 each = $2.00
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00 each = $2.00
- Apples: 5 apples * $0.75 each = $3.75

Now, let's add up the cost of these fruits:

Total cost of purchased fruits = $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar has $10 to spend, so the remaining amount he can spend on plums is:

Remaining amount = $10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums he can buy is:

Number of plums = $0.75 / $0.25 each = 3

So, Jamaar can buy 3 plums."
"First, we need to determine the total number of pieces of sweets Anne purchased. Since she bought a box containing 15 packs and each pack has 60 pieces, we calculate the total number of pieces as follows:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept 2 packs for herself. The number of pieces in these 2 packs is:

\[ 2 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

To find out how many pieces of sweets she gave to her friends, we subtract the number of pieces she kept from the total number of pieces:

\[ 900 \text{ pieces} - 120 \text{ pieces} = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne gave these 780 pieces to her 10 friends equally. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide the total number of pieces given to friends by the number of friends:

\[ \frac{780 \text{ pieces}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 78 \text{ pieces per friend} \]

So, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 78 \]"
"To calculate the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating the future value of an item with a constant annual rate of increase. The formula is:

\[ \text{Future Value} = \text{Present Value} \times (1 + \text{rate})^{\text{number of periods}} \]

Given:
- Present Value (initial price) = $120
- Rate of increase = 5% = 0.05
- Number of periods (years) = 3

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Future Value} = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ \text{Future Value} = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]
\[ \text{Future Value} = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ \text{Future Value} = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ \text{Future Value} = 139 \]

So, the price of carrots after three years would be $139."
"To solve this, we first need to determine how many pictures were put into each album. Since Olivia uploaded 72 pictures and divided them equally into 8 albums, we can calculate the number of pictures per album by dividing 72 by 8.

\[ \text{Pictures per album} = \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these pictures were selfies and how many were portraits. We know that 3 of the albums were selfies only and 2 of the albums were portraits. Since each album contains 9 pictures, we can calculate the number of selfies and portraits as follows:

\[ \text{Number of selfies} = 3 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures/album} = 27 \]
\[ \text{Number of portraits} = 2 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures/album} = 18 \]

To find the total number of selfies and portraits, we add the number of selfies and portraits together:

\[ \text{Total number of selfies and portraits} = 27 + 18 = 45 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 45 \]"
"To determine how long James spends reading, we first need to find out how many minutes it takes him to read one page. Since it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can calculate the time it takes to read one page by dividing 10 minutes by 3 pages:

\[ \text{Time per page} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages. We do this by multiplying the time it takes to read one page by 18:

\[ \text{Time to read 18 pages} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes} \]

Let's perform the multiplication:

\[ 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, James spends 60 minutes reading. The final numerical answer is:

"To find the final number of guests in the hotel, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.
2. 24 guests checked out early, so the number of guests decreased by 24:
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76
   \]
3. 15 guests checked out late, so the number of guests decreased by 15:
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61
   \]
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, twice that number is:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30
   \]
   So, 30 new guests checked in:
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91
   \]
5. After dinner was served, 7 more people checked in:
   \[
   91 + 7 = 98
   \]

Therefore, the final number of guests in the hotel is 98."
"On Wednesday, John picks 4 bananas.
On Thursday, John picks 6 bananas.
On Friday, John picks triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

To find the total number of bananas John has, we add the bananas picked on each day:
4 (Wednesday) + 6 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) = 22 bananas.

The final numerical answer is 22."
"First, let's determine the number of easy, average, and difficult questions in the quiz.

- Total questions: 60
- Easy questions: 40% of 60 = 0.40 * 60 = 24 questions
- Average and difficult questions combined: 60 - 24 = 36 questions
- Since the average and difficult questions are equally divided, there are 36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct. So, the number of easy questions she is sure to get correct is:
\[ 75\% \text{ of } 24 = 0.75 \times 24 = 18 \]

Aries is sure to get half of the average and difficult questions correct. So, the number of average and difficult questions she is sure to get correct is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \text{ of } 18 = 9 \]

Adding these up, the total number of questions Aries is sure to get correct is:
\[ 18 \text{ (easy)} + 9 \text{ (average)} + 9 \text{ (difficult)} = 36 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 36 \]"
"First, let's determine the price of a large stuffed animal. Since each small stuffed animal costs $4 and large stuffed animals are sold at three times the price of small ones, the price of a large stuffed animal is:

\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( L \). According to the problem, the number of small stuffed animals sold is twice the number of large stuffed animals sold, so the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2L \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as the sum of the earnings from the large stuffed animals and the small stuffed animals. The earnings from the large stuffed animals are \( 12L \) dollars, and the earnings from the small stuffed animals are \( 4 \times 2L = 8L \) dollars. The total earnings are given as $120, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ 12L + 8L = 120 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 20L = 120 \]

To find \( L \), we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

\[ L = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

Since the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2L \), we substitute \( L = 6 \) into the expression for the number of small stuffed animals sold:

\[ 2L = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we first need to calculate the total number of sandwiches they eat in one day and then multiply that by 7 (the number of days in a week).

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, the wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and the son eats 2 sandwiches per day. So, the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by the family is:

\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \text{ sandwiches per day} \]

Now, to find out how many sandwiches they eat in one week, we multiply the daily total by 7:

\[ 11 \times 7 = 77 \text{ sandwiches per week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 77."
"First, let's calculate Suzanne's earnings from selling cookies and cupcakes.

She sold 80 cookies at $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are:
\[ 80 \text{ cookies} \times \$1/\text{cookie} = \$80 \]

She sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are:
\[ 60 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$4/\text{cupcake} = \$240 \]

Now, let's add the earnings from cookies and cupcakes to find her total earnings:
\[ \$80 + \$240 = \$320 \]

Next, we need to account for the money she gave to her two sisters. She gave each sister $10, so the total amount given to her sisters is:
\[ 2 \times \$10 = \$20 \]

Finally, to find out how much money Suzanne has left, we subtract the amount given to her sisters from her total earnings:
\[ \$320 - \$20 = \$300 \]

So, the final amount of money Suzanne has left is:
\[ \$300 \]"
"The Smith twins found a total of 30 + 30 = 60 eggs. Since all the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends, the friends found 100 - 60 - 10 = 30 eggs.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the ore mining rate with a steel pickaxe:**
   - A dwarf with an iron pickaxe mines 12 pounds per day.
   - A dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 50% more than a dwarf with an iron pickaxe.
   - 50% of 12 pounds is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6\) pounds.
   - Therefore, a dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines \(12 + 6 = 18\) pounds per day.

2. **Calculate the total ore mined by one dwarf with a steel pickaxe in a month:**
   - A month has 30 days.
   - One dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines \(18 \times 30 = 540\) pounds in a month.

3. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month:**
   - There are 40 dwarves.
   - The total ore mined by 40 dwarves is \(540 \times 40 = 21600\) pounds.

The final numerical answer is 21600 pounds."
"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to use the information that the prices are proportional. We can set up a proportion based on the given information:

- The first package with 2 sandwiches costs $3.
- The second package with 4 sandwiches costs $6.
- The third package with 8 sandwiches costs an unknown amount, which we will call \( x \).

Since the prices are proportional, the ratio of the number of sandwiches to the cost should be the same for all packages. We can write the proportion as:

\[
\frac{2 \text{ sandwiches}}{3 \text{ dollars}} = \frac{4 \text{ sandwiches}}{6 \text{ dollars}} = \frac{8 \text{ sandwiches}}{x \text{ dollars}}
\]

We can use the first two parts of the proportion to find the cost of the third package. Notice that the second package has twice the number of sandwiches as the first package and the cost is also twice. Therefore, the cost of the third package should be four times the cost of the first package. Since the first package costs $3, the third package should cost:

\[
4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost \(\boxed{12}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine how much Tom has to pay for the bedroom set after using the money from selling his old bedroom. He initially buys the bedroom set for $3000 and sells his old bedroom for $1000. So, the remaining amount he needs to pay is:

\[ 3000 - 1000 = 2000 \]

Next, Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining $2000 per month. To find out how much he has to pay each month, we calculate 10% of $2000:

\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 200 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst due to the gust of wind. Sally initially had 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst.

\[ \text{Red balloons that burst} = 25 \times \frac{40}{100} = 25 \times 0.4 = 10 \]

So, the number of red balloons remaining is:

\[ \text{Remaining red balloons} = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Next, Sally accidentally released half of the yellow balloons. She initially had 12 yellow balloons.

\[ \text{Yellow balloons released} = 12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons remaining is:

\[ \text{Remaining yellow balloons} = 12 - 6 = 6 \]

Sally found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining balloons.

\[ \text{Blue balloons added} = 8 \times \frac{75}{100} = 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \]

So, the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school is the sum of the remaining red, yellow, and the added blue balloons.

\[ \text{Total balloons} = \text{Remaining red balloons} + \text{Remaining yellow balloons} + \text{Blue balloons added} \]
\[ \text{Total balloons} = 15 + 6 + 6 = 27 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of the different scenarios and their outcomes.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of the substitute teacher collecting the homework: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of having to turn in the homework: 50% or 0.50

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having the normal teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of getting an extension from the normal teacher: 40% or 0.40
   - Probability of not getting an extension from the normal teacher: 60% or 0.60
   - Probability of convincing the teacher to give a personal extension: 20% or 0.20
   - Probability of not convincing the teacher: 80% or 0.80

Now, let's calculate the overall probability of having to turn in the homework:

- **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
  - Probability of having to turn in the homework: 50% or 0.50

- **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
  - Probability of not getting an extension: 60% or 0.60
  - Probability of having to turn in the homework: 100% - 20% = 80% or 0.80

Now, we combine these probabilities:

- Probability of having to turn in the homework given the substitute teacher:
  - 50% or 0.50

- Probability of having to turn in the homework given the normal teacher:
  - 60% (not getting an extension) * 80% (convinced to get a personal extension) = 0.60 * 0.80 = 0.48

Now, we sum the probabilities of the two scenarios:

- Total probability of having to turn in the homework:
  - 50% (substitute teacher) + 40% (normal teacher) = 90%

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 90%."
"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we first need to determine the total number of tickets that need to be distributed after accounting for the seats reserved for graduates and faculty.

The total capacity of the Fine Arts Center is 6000 seats. The number of seats reserved for graduates is 950, and the number of seats reserved for faculty is 300. Therefore, the number of tickets that need to be distributed is:

\[ 6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750 \]

These 4750 tickets are to be split equally among the graduates. To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we divide the total number of tickets by the number of graduates. Since the problem does not specify the number of graduates, we assume that the number of graduates is the same as the number of tickets to be distributed, which is 4750.

Thus, each graduate would receive:

\[ \frac{4750}{\text{number of graduates}} \]

However, since the number of graduates is not specified and we are to assume it is the same as the number of tickets to be distributed, each graduate would receive:

\[ \frac{4750}{4750} = 1 \]

So, each graduate would receive 1 ticket to give to their friends and family. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we first need to calculate the number of soda bottles he will place along the driveway.

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and he wants to place a bottle every 3 feet. Therefore, the number of bottles is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Number of bottles} = \frac{\text{Total width of the driveway}}{\text{Distance between each bottle}} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles}
\]

Richard will need to go from one bottle to the next to drop the candy in. Since he starts at the first bottle and goes to the next 7 times, the total number of trips he will make is 7.

Each trip takes 5 seconds, so the total time for all trips is:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Number of trips} \times \text{Time per trip} = 7 \times 5 \text{ seconds} = 35 \text{ seconds}

"First, let's calculate the cost of the Parmesan cheese:
- The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound.
- Moises buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese.
- Therefore, the cost for the Parmesan cheese is \( 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$11/\text{pound} = \$22 \).

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mozzarella cheese:
- The price of mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound.
- Moises buys 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese.
- Therefore, the cost for the mozzarella cheese is \( 3 \text{ pounds} \times \$6/\text{pound} = \$18 \).

Now, let's find the total cost of the cheese:
- The total cost is the sum of the cost of the Parmesan cheese and the cost of the mozzarella cheese.
- Total cost = \$22 + \$18 = \$40.

Moises starts with $50. To find out how much money he will have left after buying the cheese, we subtract the total cost from his initial amount:

"First, let's calculate the total amount Jim borrowed during his college years. He borrowed $50,000 per year for 4 years, so the total amount borrowed is:

\[ 50,000 \times 4 = 200,000 \]

Next, let's determine his income after graduating from college. His original income was $25,000 per year, and his income tripled, so his new income is:

\[ 25,000 \times 3 = 75,000 \]

Now, let's calculate the total income he would have earned if he had not gone to college. He would have earned $25,000 per year for 4 years:

\[ 25,000 \times 4 = 100,000 \]

The total income he would have earned if he had not gone to college is $100,000. The total income he earned during his college years is $200,000. Therefore, the total income he lost by going to college is:

\[ 200,000 - 100,000 = 100,000 \]

Now, we need to calculate how long it would take for him to earn back the $200,000 he borrowed, plus the $100,000 he lost in income during his college years. The total amount he needs to earn back is:

\[ 200,000 + 100,000 = 300,000 \]

Since his new income after college is $75,000 per year, the number of years it would take to earn $300,000 is:

\[ \frac{300,000}{75,000} = 4 \]

Therefore, it would take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"To determine the total square feet of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of each piece of fabric he requires. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each piece of fabric is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

First, calculate the dimensions of one piece of fabric:
- Length: \( 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \)
- Width: \( 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \)

Next, calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
\[ \text{Area of one piece} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[ \text{Total area} = 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total square feet of fabric Jim needs to buy is:
\[ 160 \text{ square feet} \]"
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then sum them up.

First, let's determine the number of letters delivered on Tuesday. According to the problem, Tuesday's delivery is 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery. Monday's delivery was 425 letters.

\[
\text{Tuesday's delivery} = \frac{1}{5} \times 425 + 17
\]

Calculating \(\frac{1}{5} \times 425\):

\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 425 = 85
\]

Adding 17 to 85:

\[
85 + 17 = 102
\]

So, Tuesday's delivery was 102 letters.

Next, we calculate the number of letters delivered on Wednesday. According to the problem, Wednesday's delivery is 5 more than twice Tuesday's delivery.

\[
\text{Wednesday's delivery} = 2 \times 102 + 5
\]

Calculating \(2 \times 102\):

\[
2 \times 102 = 204
\]

Adding 5 to 204:

\[
204 + 5 = 209
\]

So, Wednesday's delivery was 209 letters.

Now, we sum the deliveries from Monday to Wednesday:

\[
\text{Total delivery} = 425 + 102 + 209
\]

Adding these numbers:

\[
425 + 102 = 527
\]

\[
527 + 209 = 736
\]

Therefore, the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is:

\[
736

"To find out how much Johnny's dad lost on average that day, we need to calculate the total amount lost and then divide it by the number of races.

1. **First Race:**
   - Johnny's dad lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost.
   - Amount lost in the first race = $5.
   - Twice the amount lost in the first race = 2 * $5 = $10.
   - Amount won in the second race = $10 + $1 = $11.
   - Since he won, this is a positive amount, but for the purpose of calculating the total loss, we consider the amount lost, which is $0.

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Amount won in the second race = $11.
   - Amount lost in the third race = 1.5 * $11 = $16.5.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost:
- Total loss = Amount lost in the first race + Amount lost in the third race
- Total loss = $5 + $16.5 = $21.5

To find the average loss per race, we divide the total loss by the number of races:
- Number of races = 3
- Average loss per race = Total loss / Number of races
- Average loss per race = $21.5 / 3 = $7.1667 (rounded to four decimal places)

The final numerical answer is:
$7.17"

The final numerical answer is 130,000."
"First, we need to convert all measurements to the same unit for easier comparison. Let's use inches.

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, Xavier's height in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Xavier grew 3 inches, so his current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole's initial height was 50 inches. Cole grew 2 inches, so his current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier’s height now is 1 inch."
"Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( 420 \).

"To determine the number of hours each painter worked, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of days the painters worked:**
   - There are 3 weeks of work.
   - Each week has 7 days.
   - Therefore, the total number of days is \(3 \times 7 = 21\) days.

2. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by the team:**
   - Each day, the team worked \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day.
   - Therefore, the total number of hours worked by the team is \( 21 \times \frac{3}{8} \).

3. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by the team:**
   \[
   21 \times \frac{3}{8} = \frac{21 \times 3}{8} = \frac{63}{8} = 7.875 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of hours each painter worked:**
   - There are 4 painters.
   - Therefore, each painter worked \( \frac{7.875}{4} \) hours.

5. **Calculate the number of hours each painter worked:**
   \[
   \frac{7.875}{4} = 1.96875 \text{ hours}

Thus, each painter put in approximately 1.96875 hours of work."
"Let's denote the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, Rory retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2}) = 2 \cdot 19 \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now that we know \( x = 6 \), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

So, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation year by year from 2007 to 2010.

The formula for depreciation is:
\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^{\text{Number of Years}} \]

Given:
- Initial Price = $20000
- Depreciation Rate = 21% = 0.21
- Number of Years from 2007 to 2010 = 3

Now, we can plug these values into the formula:
\[ \text{Final Price} = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 20000 \times 0.493039 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 9860.78 \]

So, the price of the car in the year 2010 is approximately $9860.78."
"First, let's determine the number of English books. Since half of the 50 books are written in English, we calculate:

Next, we calculate the number of German books. Since 10% of the books are written in German, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of German books} = 10\% \times 50 = 0.10 \times 50 = 5 \]

Now, to find the number of Spanish books, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:

\[ \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - (\text{Number of English books} + \text{Number of German books}) \]
\[ \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - (25 + 5) \]
\[ \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - 30 \]
\[ \text{Number of Spanish books} = 20 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 20."

"To determine how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the number of loads required for the twin beds and the king size bed separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of loads for the twin beds:
- Greg has 4 twin beds.
- Each load can wash 2 twin sets of sheets.
- Therefore, the number of loads needed for the twin beds is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) loads.

Next, let's calculate the number of loads for the king size bed:
- Greg has 1 king size bed.
- Each load can wash 1 king set of sheets.
- Therefore, the number of loads needed for the king size bed is \( \frac{1}{1} = 1 \) load.

Now, we sum the loads for the twin beds and the king size bed:
- Total loads per week = 2 (twin beds) + 1 (king size bed) = 3 loads.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total number of loads in a year is:
- Total loads per year = 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads.

"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time for the meal is the sum of the times for both parts, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Next, we isolate \( D \) by subtracting 18 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Then, we solve for \( D \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's part as follows:

\[ Betsy's\ part = D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes. The final numerical answer is:

- Total guests invited: 25 + 7 + 13 = 45

Next, we need to account for the 4 people who could not come:

- Total guests who will attend: 45 - 4 = 41

Now, we need to calculate the cost based on the given pricing structure:

- The base fee for renting the theater for 20 guests is $125.
- The additional fee is $6 for each guest beyond the initial 20.

The number of additional guests beyond the initial 20 is:

- Additional guests: 41 - 20 = 21

The cost for the additional guests is:

- Additional cost: 21 * $6 = $126

Finally, we add the base fee to the additional cost to get the total cost:

- Total cost: $125 + $126 = $251

The final numerical answer is $251."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Maggie spent a quarter of her money. Since she had $60 initially, the amount she spent is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15
   \]
   So, Maggie has:
   \[
   60 - 15 = 45
   \]
   dollars left.

2. Riza spent one-third of her money. Since she had $60 initially, the amount she spent is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
   \]
   So, Riza has:
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]
   dollars left.

3. To find out how much money Maggie and Riza have left together, we add the amounts they each have left:
   \[
   45 + 40 = 85
   \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Maggie and Riza have left is $85."
"First, let's determine the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats:
\[ 10 + 4 = 14 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Together, the first and second monkeys eat:
\[ 10 + 14 = 24 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. Therefore, the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day is:
\[ \frac{315}{7} = 45 \text{ bananas each day} \]

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we subtract the number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day:
\[ 45 - 24 = 21 \text{ bananas each day} \]

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 21 \]"
"Teddy finished half of the first 500-piece puzzle, which means Teddy placed 500 / 2 = 250 pieces of the first puzzle. Teddy also finished the second 500-piece puzzle, which means Teddy placed 500 pieces of the second puzzle. Therefore, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is 250 + 500 = 750 pieces."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the roses Jenny bought. She bought 15 roses, and since roses cost $2 each, the total cost for the roses is:

\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2/\text{rose} = \$30 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of the dozen roses she bought. Since a dozen roses cost $15, and she bought 15 roses, she bought 1.25 dozen roses (which is 1.25 * 12 = 15 roses). Therefore, the cost for the dozen roses is $15.

Now, we subtract the cost of the dozen roses from the total cost to find out how much she spent on the additional roses:

\[ \$30 - \$15 = \$15 \]

This $15 is spent on the remaining 0.25 dozen roses. Since a dozen roses cost $15, 0.25 dozen roses would cost:

\[ 0.25 \times \$15 = \$3.75 \]

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which is a total of:

\[ 5 \times \$5 = \$25 \]

After buying the roses, she has:

\[ \$25 - \$30 = -\$5 \]

This negative value indicates that she needs an additional $5 to cover the cost. However, since she only has $25 and the cost is $30, she cannot afford the additional 0.25 dozen roses with the money she has. Therefore, she only buys the dozen roses and does not buy the additional 0.25 dozen roses.

The cost of the dozen roses is $15, and she pays with five $5 bills, which is $25. Since she only needs $15, she will have $10 left. Since the florist only gives change in quarters, we need to convert $10 into quarters. Each quarter is worth $0.25, so:

\[ 10 \div 0.25 = 40 \]

Therefore, Jenny leaves with 40 quarters. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"To calculate the total money Terry makes, we need to calculate the earnings from each item separately and then sum them up.

1. Earnings from milkshakes: \(6 \times 5.50 = 33.00\)
2. Earnings from burger platters: \(9 \times 11 = 99.00\)
3. Earnings from sodas: \(20 \times 1.50 = 30.00\)

Now, we sum these amounts to find the total earnings:

\(33.00 + 99.00 + 30.00 = 162.00\)

So, the total money Terry makes is $162.00."
"To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, let's break down the schedule step by step:

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays in the station for 20 minutes.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives half an hour after the first train leaves the station.
   - The first train leaves the station 10 minutes after it arrives, so it leaves at 10 + 10 = 20 minutes.
   - The second train arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves, so it arrives at 20 + 30 = 50 minutes.
   - Stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives an hour after the second train leaves the station.
   - The second train leaves the station 50 minutes after it arrives, so it leaves at 50 + 60 = 110 minutes.
   - The third train arrives 60 minutes after the second train leaves, so it arrives at 110 + 60 = 170 minutes.
   - Leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it stays in the station for 0 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station.
   - The third train leaves the station at 170 minutes, so it arrives at 170 + 20 = 190 minutes.
   - This is the train Paul needs to get on.

Now, let's calculate the time Paul will wait for his train:
- The fourth train arrives at 190 minutes.
- Paul arrives at 10 minutes (when the first train arrives).
- Therefore, Paul will wait for 190 - 10 = 180 minutes.

The final numerical answer is:
180"
"To determine how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we first need to calculate how many toothpicks she has already saved.

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks:
\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

She needs a total of 200 toothpicks. The number of toothpicks she still needs is:
\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since she saves 10 toothpicks each week, the number of additional weeks required to save the remaining 80 toothpicks is:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take her 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks."
"First, let's determine the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch. The original price of the watch is $2000, and he bought it at 75% of its original price.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers paid} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage discount Mr. Rogers's friend obtained from the original price. The original price was $2000, and the friend paid $1800 for the watch.

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

To find the percentage discount:

\[ \text{Percentage discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers's friend from the original price is 10%."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs over a period of 4 hours. Given that each spring creates one jellyfish every second, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. **Determine the number of jellyfish created by one spring in one hour:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are \(60 \times 60 = 3600\) seconds in an hour.
   - Since one spring creates one jellyfish every second, in one hour, one spring will create \(3600\) jellyfish.

2. **Determine the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - Since one spring creates 3600 jellyfish in one hour, in 4 hours, one spring will create \(3600 \times 4 = 14400\) jellyfish.

3. **Determine the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates 14400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create \(14400 \times 5 = 72000\) jellyfish in 4 hours.

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs working at the same rate in 4 hours is 72000."
"To find Frankie's score, we can use the information given:

1. Binkie's score is 90.
2. Frankie's score is 15 more than twice Binkie's score.

First, calculate twice Binkie's score:
\[ 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Then, add 15 to this result to find Frankie's score:
\[ 180 + 15 = 195 \]

So, Frankie's score is 195."
"First, let's determine the total distance James walked. He walked halfway to the store, which is 2 miles, and then walked back home, which is another 2 miles. So, the total distance he walked is 2 miles + 2 miles = 4 miles.

James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour. To find out how long it took him to walk 4 miles, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 1 hour."
"First, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually.

Jenny buys 10 bunches, and each bunch has 4 bananas. Therefore, the total number of bananas is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

The cost of buying 40 bananas individually at $0.80 each is:
\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches.

Jenny buys 10 bunches at $3.00 per bunch:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

Now, we find the savings by subtracting the cost of buying the bananas in bunches from the cost of buying them individually:
\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, Jenny saved:
\[ \$2.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) and the amount of fence Harry gets as \( H \). According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so we can write:

\[ H = S + 60 \]

Since the total amount of fence is 100 feet, we can also write:

\[ S + H = 100 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Subtract 60 from both sides:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we can first determine its growth rate per year. The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, so the growth rate per year is:

\[ \text{Growth rate per year} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \]

Now, to find out how many inches it will grow in 13 years, we multiply the growth rate per year by 13:

\[ \text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 26 \]"
"To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month, we need to calculate the total earnings from each type of bike and then sum them up.

First, let's determine the number of each type of bike sold:
- Total bikes sold = 300
- Number of Trekking bikes sold = 50% of 300 = 0.5 * 300 = 150
- Number of BMX bikes sold = 15% of 300 = 0.15 * 300 = 45
- Number of MTB bikes sold = Total bikes sold - Trekking bikes sold - BMX bikes sold = 300 - 150 - 45 = 65

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike:
- Price of one MTB = $500
- Price of one BMX = Half the price of an MTB = $500 / 2 = $250
- Price of one Trekking bike = $450

Now, we calculate the total earnings:
- Earnings from MTB bikes = Number of MTB bikes sold * Price of one MTB = 65 * $500 = $32,500
- Earnings from BMX bikes = Number of BMX bikes sold * Price of one BMX = 45 * $250 = $11,250
- Earnings from Trekking bikes = Number of Trekking bikes sold * Price of one Trekking bike = 150 * $450 = $67,500

Finally, we sum up the earnings from all types of bikes:
- Total earnings = Earnings from MTB bikes + Earnings from BMX bikes + Earnings from Trekking bikes = $32,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $111,250

The final numerical answer is $111,250."
"To determine how many bales of hay are left in the field after a 6-hour workday, we need to calculate the number of bales made and the number of bales picked up by the truck.

First, let's calculate the number of bales made by the farmer in 6 hours:
\[ \text{Bales made by farmer} = 5 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ bales} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of bales picked up by the truck in 6 hours:
\[ \text{Bales picked up by truck} = 3 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 18 \text{ bales} \]

Now, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer to find out how many bales are left in the field:
\[ \text{Bales left in the field} = 30 \text{ bales} - 18 \text{ bales} = 12 \text{ bales} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many hours a week John spends learning, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Number of periods John has to take each day:**
   - A normal student has 6 periods.
   - John has 2 extra classes, so he has \(6 + 2 = 8\) periods each day.

2. **Time spent in class each day:**
   - Each class is 40 minutes long.
   - Therefore, the time spent in class each day is \(8 \times 40 = 320\) minutes.

3. **Time spent in class each week:**
   - John goes to class 5 days a week.
   - So, the time spent in class each week is \(320 \times 5 = 1600\) minutes.

4. **Extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday:**
   - John spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday.
   - The total weekly minutes are 1600.
   - Therefore, the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday is \(\frac{1600}{16} = 100\) minutes.

5. **Total weekly learning time:**
   - The total time spent learning each week is the sum of the time spent in class and the extra learning time.
   - So, the total weekly learning time is \(1600 + 100 = 1700\) minutes.

6. **Convert minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the total weekly learning time in hours is \(\frac{1700}{60} = \frac{1700}{60} = 28.3333...\) hours.

The final numerical answer is 28.3333 hours."
"First, we need to determine the initial height from which the ball is dropped. Since the ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony and each story is 24 feet high, the height from the third-floor balcony is:

\[ 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ feet} \]

The ball bounces to 2/3 of its starting height with each bounce. Therefore, on the first bounce, the ball will reach:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 72 = 48 \text{ feet} \]

On the second bounce, the ball will again bounce to 2/3 of its height from the first bounce, which is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 48 = 32 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height the ball goes on its second bounce is:

\[ 32 \text{ feet} \]"
"First, let's convert all heights to inches for easier calculation. The first child is 6 feet tall, which is 6 * 12 = 72 inches. The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall. The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

The final numerical answer is:
72 inches"
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we first need to determine how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we divide the total number of apples sold by the number of apples per bag:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total number of apples}}{\text{Number of apples per bag}} = \frac{2000}{10} = 200 \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags by the price per bag:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of bags} \times \text{Price per bag} = 200 \times 5 = 1000 \]

So, the orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag."
"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of the meat, so it left \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
3. The Allosaurus then ate the remaining meat, which is \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms. According to the problem, this amount is 270 kilograms.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]

To find \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

Therefore, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 kilograms.

The final numerical answer is:
1080"
"First, let's calculate the total area of the walls that Tony needs to paint.

The north and south walls are each 10 feet by 8 feet, so the area of each is:
\[ 10 \times 8 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is:
\[ 80 \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The east and west walls are each 5 feet by 8 feet, so the area of each is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is:
\[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Adding the areas of all the walls together gives the total area to be painted:
\[ 160 + 80 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, since each gallon of paint costs $12, the total cost to paint the room is:
\[ 12 \times 12 = 144 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 144 \]"
"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the probabilities step by step.

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Ellen starts with 12 sodas.
   - She shakes 3 sodas, leaving 9 unshaken sodas.
   - Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 8 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.

2. **Ellen's Brother's Actions:**
   - Ellen's brother takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas.
   - After this, there are 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas left.

3. **Ellen's Friend's Turn:**
   - Ellen's friend now has to choose from the remaining 8 sodas (2 shaken and 6 unshaken).
   - The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left.

The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is:
\[ \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \]

To express this probability as a percentage:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 25%."
"To find out how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we first need to determine the speed of each train and then calculate the distance each train travels in that time.

The first train travels at 60 miles per hour.
The second train travels at half the speed of the first train, which is \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) miles per hour.

Next, we calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours.

For the first train:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

For the second train:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{miles} \]

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each train has traveled:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 180 \, \text{miles} + 90 \, \text{miles} = 270 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 270 \]"
"To determine how many people Billy helps with their taxes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.
2. Determine the number of days Billy works.
3. Calculate the total number of hours Billy works.
4. Determine the total number of people he helps.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.**

- March has 31 days.
- April 19th is included in the count.

Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days

**Step 2: Determine the number of days Billy works.**

Billy takes 20% off, so he works 80% of the days.

Days Billy works = 50 days * 80% = 50 * 0.8 = 40 days

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of hours Billy works.**

Billy works 3 hours a day for 40 days.

Total hours = 40 days * 3 hours/day = 120 hours

**Step 4: Determine the total number of people he helps.**

"First, let's calculate the number of people in the buses:

Number of people in buses = Number of buses * People per bus
Number of people in buses = 12 * 35
Number of people in buses = 420

Next, let's calculate the number of people in the cars:

Number of people in cars = Number of cars * People per car
Number of people in cars = 20 * 3
Number of people in cars = 60

Now, let's add the number of people in the buses and the cars to find the total number of people who were not inside the church:

Total number of people outside the church = Number of people in buses + Number of people in cars
Total number of people outside the church = 420 + 60
Total number of people outside the church = 480

Therefore, the number of people inside the church is:

Number of people inside the church = Total number of people outside the church
Number of people inside the church = 480

The final numerical answer is 480."

"To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes for each slide and then find the difference.

For the biggest slide:
- Length: 300 feet
- Speed: 60 feet/minute

Time to slide down the biggest slide = Length / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
- Length: 240 feet
- Speed: 80 feet/minute

Time to slide down the second biggest slide = Length / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

Now, we find the difference in time:
Time difference = Time for biggest slide - Time for second biggest slide = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

The final numerical answer is 2 minutes."
"To calculate the total time Bobby spends on his lunches and breaks over 5 days, we first need to determine the daily total and then multiply by 5.

Bobby's daily break time is 2 breaks of 15 minutes each, which totals to:
\[ 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding his 30-minute lunch break, the total time per day is:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

To find the total time over 5 days, we multiply the daily total by 5:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ \frac{300 \text{ minutes}}{60} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \]"
"First, let's calculate how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's miles as follows:

\[ \text{Micah's miles} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know the total miles run by all three is 52 miles. We can find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total miles:

\[ \text{Ahito's miles} = 52 - (8 + 28) = 52 - 36 = 16 \text{ miles} \]

So, Ahito ran 16 miles. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 16 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the items after the returns and purchases:

1. Sheila initially charged $85.00 worth of merchandise.
2. She returned an item that cost $15.00, so the charge is reduced by $15.00.
3. The new balance after the return is $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the items she bought:

1. The frying pan was on sale for 20% off $20.00. The discount is 20% of $20.00, which is $20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00. So, the frying pan cost $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.
2. The set of towels was 10% off $30.00. The discount is 10% of $30.00, which is $30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00. So, the set of towels cost $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

Now, let's add the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels to the new balance:

1. The new balance after the return is $70.00.
2. Adding the frying pan ($16.00) and the set of towels ($27.00) to the new balance gives $70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00.

Therefore, the new balance on her credit card is $113.00."
"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem:
- A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{J}{5} \).
- A third of the large jellyfish change color under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{J}{5} = \frac{J}{15} \).
- When the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color. Therefore, \( \frac{J}{15} = 6 \).

To find \( J \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{J}{15} = 6 \]
\[ J = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ J = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

The final numerical answer is:
90"

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Lauren saves each year and then figure out how many years she needs to work to save for her retirement.

1. **Calculate Lauren's annual savings:**
   Lauren saves 20% of her annual salary.
   \[
   \text{Annual savings} = 20\% \times \$100,000 = 0.20 \times \$100,000 = \$20,000
   \]

2. **Determine the amount Lauren needs to save for retirement:**
   Lauren plans to live with 40% of her current annual salary after retirement.
   \[
   \text{Annual living expenses after retirement} = 40\% \times \$100,000 = 0.40 \times \$100,000 = \$40,000
   \]
   Since she plans to save for 20 years, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to save.
   \[
   \text{Total savings needed} = \$40,000 \times 20 = \$800,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of years Lauren needs to work to save \$800,000:**
   \[
   \text{Number of years} = \frac{\text{Total savings needed}}{\text{Annual savings}} = \frac{\$800,000}{\$20,000} = 40 \text{ years}
   \]

Since Lauren plans to save for 20 years, we need to find out how many more years she needs to work to reach the total of 40 years.

\[
\text{Additional years needed} = 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ years}
\]

Thus, Lauren needs to work an additional 20 years."
"To find out the length of each final cut, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, Marty cuts the 100 centimeters of ribbon into 4 equal parts. To find the length of each part, we divide 100 by 4:

"To find the total number of students in the school, we start by noting that 40% of the school population consists of 240 boys. Let's denote the total number of students in the school as \( T \).

Given that 40% of \( T \) is equal to 240 boys, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.40 \times T = 240 \]

To find \( T \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} \]

Calculating the right side:
\[ T = 600 \]

So, the total number of students in the school is 600. Now, to find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = T - 240 = 600 - 240 = 360 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 360 \]"

"First, let's determine how many kilograms of apples each person wants.

Pierre wants a quarter of the total 12 kg of apples:
\[ \text{Pierre's share} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg} \]

Paul wants a third of the total 12 kg of apples:
\[ \text{Paul's share} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg} \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount of apples that Pierre and Paul want:
\[ \text{Total wanted by Pierre and Paul} = 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg} \]

Since the total amount of apples is 12 kg, the amount of apples that James will have left is:
\[ \text{James's share} = 12 \text{ kg} - 7 \text{ kg} = 5 \text{ kg} \]

So, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times."
"First, let's calculate the total number of male and female guppies and goldfishes Tate has after the purchase.

Initially, Tate has:
- 4 male guppies
- 7 female guppies
- 3 male goldfishes
- 5 female goldfishes

After buying more fish:
- He buys 2 more male guppies, so he now has 4 + 2 = 6 male guppies.
- He buys 1 more female guppy, so he now has 7 + 1 = 8 female guppies.
- He buys 2 more male goldfishes, so he now has 3 + 2 = 5 male goldfishes.
- He buys 3 more female goldfishes, so he now has 5 + 3 = 8 female goldfishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of male and female fishes:
- Total male fishes = 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfishes) = 11 male fishes.
- Total female fishes = 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfishes) = 16 female fishes.

To find out how many more female fishes than male fishes Tate has, we subtract the total number of male fishes from the total number of female fishes:
- Difference = 16 (female fishes) - 11 (male fishes) = 5.

So, Tate has 5 more female fishes than male fishes. The final numerical answer is 5."
"First, let's determine the time each person took to complete their chores:

1. Amalia mowed the lawn, which took her 4 hours.
2. Megan walked the dog, which took her 2 hours longer than Amalia. Therefore, Megan's chore took her \(4 + 2 = 6\) hours.
3. Dior did the laundry, which took her well over 4 hours longer than Amalia. Since Amalia's chore took 4 hours, Dior's chore took more than \(4 + 4 = 8\) hours. Let's assume the minimum time Dior took, which is 9 hours (since ""well over"" typically means more than the minimum additional time).

Now, we can calculate the total time they all took to do their chores altogether:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Amalia's time} + \text{Megan's time} + \text{Dior's time} = 4 + 6 + 9 = 19 \text{ hours} \]

"To solve this, let's first calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers.

Two workers produce 6 toys per hour, so together they produce \(2 \times 6 = 12\) toys per hour. Over a 10-hour shift, they produce \(12 \times 10 = 120\) toys.

The other two workers produce 4 toys per hour, so together they produce \(2 \times 4 = 8\) toys per hour. Over a 10-hour shift, they produce \(8 \times 10 = 80\) toys.

Adding the toys produced by all four workers, we get \(120 + 80 = 200\) toys.

The total order is 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, 200 toys have been produced. Therefore, the manufacturer still needs \(400 - 200 = 200\) toys to be able to ship the order.

Since the fifth worker is also working for 10 hours, let's denote the number of toys produced by the fifth worker per hour as \(x\). Over 10 hours, the fifth worker will produce \(10x\) toys.

The total number of toys produced by all five workers is \(200 + 10x\). We know this total must equal the 400 toys needed for the order, so we set up the equation:

\[200 + 10x = 400\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[10x = 400 - 200\]
\[10x = 200\]
\[x = 20\]

Therefore, the fifth worker produces 20 toys per hour. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's first determine Liam's age two years ago. Since Liam is currently 16 years old, two years ago he was:

\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \text{ years old} \]

According to the problem, two years ago Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. Let's denote Vince's age two years ago as \( V \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 14 = 2V \]

To find \( V \), we solve for \( V \):

\[ V = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]

So, two years ago Vince was 7 years old. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:

"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline as \( A \). Since they painted the same number of eggs, the total painted by Arnold and Madeline is \( 2A \).

Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Sarah as \( S \). Therefore, the number of eggs painted by Camden is \( S + 12 \). The total painted by Camden and Sarah is given by:
\[ S + (S + 12) = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]
So, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

Now, we know the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. The total painted by Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah is:
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]
So, Arnold and Madeline each painted 13 eggs.

To find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold, we calculate:
\[ 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Therefore, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups} \]

Each group of 8 crayons will be placed in a box. Since each box contains 8 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the weight of each box is:

\[ \text{Weight of each box} = 8 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 8 \text{ ounces} \]

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the weight of each box in pounds is:

\[ \text{Weight of each box in pounds} = \frac{8 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes. There are 25 boxes, each weighing 0.5 pounds:

\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 0.5 \text{ pounds/box} = 12.5 \text{ pounds} \]

The total weight of the crayons is:

\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Converting the total weight of the crayons to pounds:

\[ \text{Total weight of crayons in pounds} = \frac{200 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 12.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 12.5 \text{ pounds (crayons)} + 12.5 \text{ pounds (boxes)} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine how many 4-foot logs John can make from the 80-foot tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, the length of the logs he can make is:

\[ 80 \text{ feet} \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 4-foot logs he can cut from 64 feet of wood:

\[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

Now, we need to determine how many planks John can get from these 16 logs. Since he cuts 5 planks from each log:

\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

Finally, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling these planks. Since each plank is sold for $1.2:

\[ 80 \text{ planks} \times 1.2 \text{ dollars/plank} = 96 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns half of what her brother earns, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Valerie's salary} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

Given that Valerie earns $5000 per month, we can solve for her brother's salary:

\[ 5000 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

\[ \text{Brother's salary} = 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Now, we know Valerie's brother earns $10000 per month. Next, we need to find out how much their mother earns. Their mother earns twice their combined salary. First, we calculate their combined salary:

\[ \text{Combined salary} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} \]

\[ \text{Combined salary} = 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Their mother earns twice this amount:

\[ \text{Mother's salary} = 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \]

Now, we can find the total amount of money they all have together by adding their salaries:

\[ \text{Total amount} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} + \text{Mother's salary} \]

\[ \text{Total amount} = 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

So, the total amount of money they all have together is $45000."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time spent by Grandma on the beach and on the sidewalk, and then sum these times to find the total time for the 3-mile walk.

First, let's denote the speed of Grandma on the beach as \( v \) miles per minute. Since she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes, we can write:
\[ v = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} \]

On the sidewalk, Grandma walks at twice the speed, so her speed on the sidewalk is:
\[ 2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Next, we calculate the time spent on the sidewalk. Since the distance on the sidewalk is 1 mile, the time spent on the sidewalk is:
\[ \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we sum the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk to find the total time for the 3-mile walk:
\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"

\[ 60 \, \text{dollars} - 32 \, \text{dollars} = 28 \, \text{dollars} \]

Since she saves $4 each week, the number of additional weeks required to save the remaining $28 is:
\[ \frac{28 \, \text{dollars}}{4 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 7 \, \text{weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take her 7 more weeks to save a total of $60."
"To find the total number of blue birds, we can break down the problem into parts and then sum them up.

First, we have 3 trees each with 7 blue birds:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Next, we have 2 trees each with 4 blue birds:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

Finally, we have 1 tree with 3 blue birds:
\[ 1 \times 3 = 3 \]

Now, we add all these numbers together to get the total number of blue birds:
\[ 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 \]

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"First, let's determine how many marbles Bob currently has. If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen is equal to 24 marbles, we can set up the following equation to find out how many marbles Bob currently has:

\[ \text{Current marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

Subtracting 24 from both sides of the equation gives:

\[ \text{Current marbles} = 60 - 24 \]
\[ \text{Current marbles} = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles. If he loses 10 of the marbles he has, the number of marbles he will have is:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

26"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the second mug of water such that after Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle, the resulting water can be drunk at a temperature of at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote the temperature of the second mug of water as \( T \) degrees.

First, we calculate the temperature of the water left in the 33-degree mug after pouring 4 ounces:
- The initial volume of water in the 33-degree mug is \( V \) ounces.
- After pouring 4 ounces, the remaining volume is \( V - 4 \) ounces.
- The temperature of the remaining water in the 33-degree mug is still 33 degrees because the temperature of the water does not change by pouring it out.

Next, we calculate the temperature of the water in the second mug after pouring 1 ounce:
- The initial volume of water in the second mug is \( V \) ounces.
- After pouring 1 ounce, the remaining volume is \( V - 1 \) ounce.
- The temperature of the remaining water in the second mug is \( \frac{T \times 1}{V - 1} = \frac{T}{V - 1} \) degrees.

Now, we mix the remaining water from both mugs into Donny's water bottle. The total volume of water in the bottle is \( V - 4 + (V - 1) = 2V - 5 \) ounces.

The temperature of the water in the bottle is the weighted average of the temperatures of the remaining water from both mugs:
\[ \text{Temperature of the water in the bottle} = \frac{(V - 4) \times 33 + (V - 1) \times \frac{T}{V - 1}}{2V - 5} \]

We know that this temperature must be at least 40 degrees:
\[ \frac{(V - 4) \times 33 + (V - 1) \times \frac{T}{V - 1}}{2V - 5} \geq 40 \]

Simplify the numerator:
\[ (V - 4) \times 33 + (V - 1) \times \frac{T}{V - 1} = 33V - 132 + T \]

So the inequality becomes:
\[ \frac{33V - 132 + T}{2V - 5} \geq 40 \]

Multiply both sides by \( 2V - 5 \) to clear the denominator:
\[ 33V - 132 + T \geq 40(2V - 5) \]

Expand and simplify:
\[ 33V - 132 + T \geq 80V - 200 \]
\[ T \geq 80V - 200 - 33V + 132 \]
\[ T \geq 47V - 68 \]

Since \( V \) is the initial volume of water in the mugs and we need to find the minimum temperature \( T \) such that the resulting water can be drunk at 40 degrees, we can assume \( V \) is a positive value. To find the minimum \( T \), we need to consider the smallest possible value for \( V \), which is 1 ounce (since the problem doesn't specify the exact volume but implies it's a reasonable amount).

Substitute \( V = 1 \):
\[ T \geq 47(1) - 68 \]
\[ T \geq 47 - 68 \]
\[ T \geq -21 \]

However, since the temperature cannot be negative and we need to ensure the water is at least 40 degrees after the mixture, we need to re-evaluate the problem constraints. Given the problem setup and the need for the resulting water to be at least 40 degrees, the minimum temperature \( T \) must be such that the mixture results in a temperature of at least 40 degrees. Given the constraints and the need for the mixture to be at least 40 degrees, the minimum temperature \( T \) must be 40 degrees or higher.

Thus, the minimum temperature of the second bottle is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added over the period and then add these to the initial numbers.

First, let's calculate the number of cows added:
- Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day.
- There are 21 days in three weeks (since 3 weeks = 21 days).

So, the number of cows added is:
\[ 20 \text{ cows/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 420 \text{ cows} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of chickens added:
- Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day.
- There are 21 days in three weeks.

So, the number of chickens added is:
\[ 10 \text{ chickens/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ chickens} \]

Now, let's find the total number of cows and chickens on the farm after three weeks:
- Initial number of cows: 50
- Number of cows added: 420
- Total number of cows: \( 50 + 420 = 470 \)

- Initial number of chickens: 20
- Number of chickens added: 210
- Total number of chickens: \( 20 + 210 = 230 \)

Finally, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is:
\[ 470 \text{ cows} + 230 \text{ chickens} = 700 \text{ animals} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 700 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount:

Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs cost:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Since he orders 4 packs, he gets a 10% discount on the total cost. The discount amount is:
\[ 40 \times 0.10 = 4 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \]

Now, we need to find out the cost per bagel. Since he ordered 4 packs and each pack contains 9 bagels, the total number of bagels is:
\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \]

The cost per bagel is:
\[ \frac{36}{36} = 1 \]

So, the cost per bagel after the discount is $1.00."
"First, let's determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. According to the question, Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, we calculate:

\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 1 less than 3 is 2 scoops, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. The question states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, 1 less than 3 scoops is 2 scoops, and 3 less than 6 potatoes is 3 potatoes. Therefore, 2 scoops of mashed potatoes require 3 potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes are required for 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 2 scoops require 3 potatoes, 18 scoops would require:

\[ \frac{18}{2} \times 3 = 9 \times 3 = 27 \]

So, Gomer ate 27 potatoes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 27 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days:
- Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days.
- Total eggs in the first 30 days = 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs.

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the next 30 days:
- Chester eats 5 eggs a day for 30 days.
- Total eggs in the next 30 days = 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.

Now, let's find the total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days:
- Total eggs in 60 days = 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.

To find out how many dozens of eggs Chester needs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs):
- Total dozens of eggs = 240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens.

The final numerical answer is 20 dozens."
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we first need to determine the number of red jellybeans and then subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus initially.

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can represent the number of men as \(5x\) and the number of women as \(9x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of passengers is given as 84. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[5x + 9x = 84\]
\[14x = 84\]
\[x = 6\]

Now, we can find the number of men and women:
- Number of men = \(5x = 5 \times 6 = 30\)
- Number of women = \(9x = 9 \times 6 = 54\)

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:
\[54 - 20 = 34\]

So, the number of women who have remained on the bus is 34."
"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to first determine how many bouquets he sold in one day and then calculate the total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days.

From the information given:
- Each bouquet of sunflowers costs $8.
- Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers.
- Faraday earned $56 from selling bouquets per day.

First, we calculate the number of bouquets sold per day:
\[ \text{Number of bouquets sold per day} = \frac{\text{Earnings from bouquets per day}}{\text{Price per bouquet}} = \frac{56}{8} = 7 \text{ bouquets} \]

Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold per day is:
\[ \text{Number of sunflowers sold per day} = \text{Number of bouquets sold per day} \times 12 = 7 \times 12 = 84 \text{ sunflowers} \]

Now, to find out how many sunflowers were sold in 3 days:
\[ \text{Number of sunflowers sold in 3 days} = \text{Number of sunflowers sold per day} \times 3 = 84 \times 3 = 252 \]

So, the total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that both tickets are winners.

First, let's denote the probability of winning with the first ticket as \( P(W_1) \). According to the problem, \( P(W_1) = 20\% = 0.20 \).

The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning with the second ticket, \( P(W_2) \), is:
\[ P(W_2) = 3 \times P(W_1) = 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60 \]

Since the events are independent, the probability that both tickets are winners is the product of their individual probabilities:
\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = P(W_1) \times P(W_2) = 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

"To calculate the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to consider the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the number he eats on weekends.

Mason eats 4 carrots each weekday. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is:
\[ 4 \text{ carrots/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ carrots} \]

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is:
\[ 5 \text{ carrots/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ carrots} \]

Adding the carrots eaten on weekdays and the weekend gives us the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week:

"To determine how many more bottles of juices Hortex would have to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bottles needed to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.
2. Subtract the current daily production from the total number of bottles needed.

First, let's calculate the total number of bottles needed:
- Each person's daily energy demand is covered by 20% of a bottle.
- Therefore, to cover 100% of a person's daily energy demand, we need 5 bottles (since 100% / 20% = 5).

For 2300 people:
\[ 2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we subtract the current daily production from the total number of bottles needed:
- Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day.

\[ 11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles/day} = 7300 \text{ bottles} \]

So, Hortex would have to produce 7300 more bottles of juices to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of babies dressed in purple and blue, and then calculate the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple.

First, let's find out how many babies are dressed in purple and how many are dressed in blue:
- Total babies = 8
- Babies dressed in purple = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- Babies dressed in blue = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we calculate how many babies wear bows:
- Babies wearing bows among the blue-wearers = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 2 = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.6667 \) (rounding to the nearest whole number, 1 baby)
- Babies wearing bows among the purple-wearers = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is \( 1 + 2 = 3 \).

Now, we need to find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. This can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of purple-wearers wearing bows}}{\text{Total number of babies wearing bows}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) \times 100 \approx 66.67\% \]

Therefore, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is approximately 66.67%."

"First, let's determine how much land Abraham sold in each transaction.

1. Abraham initially owned 80 square meters of land.
2. He sold half of his land for $50. Half of 80 square meters is 40 square meters. So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.
3. After a month, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. One quarter of 80 square meters is 20 square meters. So, he sold 20 square meters for $30.
4. The remaining land is the total land minus the land sold in the first and second transactions. The land sold in the first transaction was 40 square meters, and in the second transaction, it was 20 square meters. So, the total land sold is 40 + 20 = 60 square meters. The remaining land is 80 - 60 = 20 square meters. He sold this remaining land for $3 per square meter.

Now, let's calculate the total money Abraham earned from each transaction:

- From the first transaction: $50
- From the second transaction: $30
- From the remaining land: 20 square meters * $3 per square meter = $60

Adding these amounts together gives the total money Abraham earned:

$50 + $30 + $60 = $140

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we need to determine the number of fruits produced each year and then sum them up.

1. **5-year-old tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old tree**: Produces \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
3. **7-year-old tree**: Produces \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
4. **8-year-old tree**: Produces \(10 \times 50 - 200 = 500 - 200 = 300\) fruits.
5. **9-year-old tree**: Produces 0 fruits.
6. **10-year-old tree**: Produces \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, we sum the fruits produced each year:

\[ 50 + 150 + 350 + 300 + 0 + 1000 = 1850 \]

The total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is 1850."
"Sophia gave Jack 1/5 of her $100, which is $100 * 1/5 = $20. Therefore, Jack now has $100 + $20 = $120.

"Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters, the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters, and the red rope as \( R \) centimeters.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we substitute \( B \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ R = 4(Y - 7) \]

Next, we substitute \( B \) and \( R \) into the third equation:
\[ 4(Y - 7) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]

Add 35 to both sides:
\[ 6Y = 72 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now, we find \( B \) and \( R \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \]
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

The length of the red rope is \( 20 \) centimeters."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine how much money Rissa and Ronnie were given initially:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = $15\).

2. **Let \(x\) be the amount of money each of them gave to their sister.**
   - After giving \(x\) dollars to their sister, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her initial amount.
   - Therefore, \(15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15\).

3. **Solve for \(x\):**
   \[
   15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
   \]
   \[
   15 - x = 12
   \]
   \[
   x = 15 - 12
   \]
   \[
   x = 3
   \]

4. **Determine how much money Rissa has left:**
   - Rissa initially had $15 and gave $3 to her sister.
   - Therefore, Rissa is left with \(15 - 3 = 12\) dollars.

5. **Determine how much money Ronnie has left:**
   - Ronnie initially had $5 and did not give any money to his sister.
   - Therefore, Ronnie is left with \(5\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}

"Let's break down the information given:

- There are four different colors of paint: red, white, purple, and yellow.
- There are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint.
- Half the mural is yellow.
- The total amount of paint used is 12 pints.

Let's denote the amount of red paint as \( R \), white paint as \( W \), purple paint as \( P \), and yellow paint as \( Y \).

From the information given:
- \( R = W = P \)
- \( Y = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \) pints (since half the mural is yellow)
- The total amount of paint is \( R + W + P + Y = 12 \) pints

Since \( R = W = P \), we can substitute \( W \) and \( P \) with \( R \) in the total paint equation:
\[ R + R + R + 6 = 12 \]
\[ 3R + 6 = 12 \]

Now, solve for \( R \):
\[ 3R = 12 - 6 \]
\[ 3R = 6 \]
\[ R = 2 \]

Therefore, the number of pints of red paint used is 2 pints."
"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. The area of one bedroom is given by the product of its length and width:

\[ \text{Area of one bedroom} = 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

\[ \text{Total area of bedrooms} = 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so:

\[ \text{Area of the living room} = 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

\[ \text{Total area of the house} = 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

So, the total area of the house is:

\[ 3160 \text{ square feet} \]"
"To find the total number of puffs of clouds Alice counts from Monday to Friday, we need to calculate the number of puffs for each day and then sum them up.

- Monday: 3 puffs
- Tuesday: 2 * Monday = 2 * 3 = 6 puffs
- Wednesday: 2 * Tuesday = 2 * 6 = 12 puffs
- Thursday: 2 * Wednesday = 2 * 12 = 24 puffs
- Friday: 2 * Thursday = 2 * 24 = 48 puffs

Now, we sum the puffs from each day:
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93

The total number of puffs of clouds Alice counts at the end of the week is 93."
"To determine how many dishwashing cycles can be run for $1 with the new box, we first need to find out how many pods are in the new box.

The original box has 100 pods and costs $12. The new box has 20% more pods than the original box. Therefore, the number of pods in the new box is:

\[ 100 + (0.20 \times 100) = 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The new box also costs $12, so the cost per pod in the new box is:

\[ \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

If you use 1 pod per cycle, the number of cycles you can run for $1 is:

\[ \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \text{ cycles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 10 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of 20 dollar bills Thomas initially withdraws from the bank. Since he withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \]

So, Thomas initially has 50 twenty-dollar bills.

Next, he loses 10 bills while getting home. The number of bills he has left is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Thomas then uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. The number of bills he uses is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, the number of bills he has left is:

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \]

Thomas then triples his money. Since each bill is worth $20, the total amount of money he has after tripling is:

\[ 20 \times 20 \times 3 = 1200 \]

Finally, Thomas converts all his money to 5 dollar bills. The number of 5 dollar bills he has is:

\[ \frac{1200}{5} = 240 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 240 \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. In the first half, team A scores 4 goals.
2. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A in the first half, so team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals in the first half.
3. In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so team B scores \(2 \times 4 = 8\) goals in the second half.
4. In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, so team A scores \(8 / 4 = 2\) goals in the second half.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by each team:

- Team A scores \(4 + 2 = 6\) goals in the match.
- Team B scores \(2 + 8 = 10\) goals in the match.

The total number of goals scored in the match is the sum of the goals scored by team A and team B:

\[6 + 10 = 16\]

So, the final numerical answer is 16."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chalk the teacher has left and then calculate how many days he can use the chalk before it reaches 2 inches.

1. **Initial Chalk Length**: The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
2. **Chalk Used on Monday**: The teacher used 45% of the chalk by the end of Monday. So, the chalk used on Monday is:
   \[
   5 \times 0.45 = 2.25 \text{ inches}

"First, let's determine the number of teeth that the dentist fixes. According to the problem, the dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills. Since he drills 4 teeth, he caps \(4 + 7 = 11\) teeth.

Next, we calculate the total number of teeth that the dentist fixes. This is the sum of the teeth he drills and the teeth he caps, which is \(4 + 11 = 15\) teeth.

Now, we need to find what percentage of James' teeth (30 teeth) the dentist fixes. The percentage is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\%
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the refund amount, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total cost of the milk Mr. Marcellus initially purchased.
2. Calculate the amount of milk that had passed the expiry date.
3. Determine the refund amount based on the amount of milk returned.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the milk purchased.**

The company sold 4000 gallons of milk at $3.5 per gallon.
\[
\text{Total cost} = 4000 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5/\text{gallon} = \$14000
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the amount of milk that had passed the expiry date.**

Mr. Marcellus returned 2/5 of the milk that he purchased.
\[
\text{Amount of milk returned} = \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \text{ gallons} = \frac{2 \times 4000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \text{ gallons}
\]

**Step 3: Determine the refund amount.**

The refund amount is based on the cost of the 1600 gallons of milk that was returned.
\[
\text{Refund amount} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5/\text{gallon} = 1600 \times 3.5 = 5600
\]

Therefore, the refund amount is:
\[
\boxed{5600}

"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now, we substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5(C + 7)) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5(C + 7)}{3} \]
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old. Let's verify this by calculating Wendy's current age and checking the conditions.

If Colin is 20 years old, then:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) = 5(20 + 7) = 5 \times 27 = 135 \]

In 25 years, Colin will be 45 years old, and Wendy will be 160 years old. Checking the second condition:
\[ C + 25 = 20 + 25 = 45 \]
\[ \frac{1}{3}W = \frac{1}{3} \times 135 = 45 \]

Both conditions are satisfied, so the solution is correct. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, we need to determine how much money Bob spends on books in total. Since he can buy 100 books for $500, we can calculate the cost per book:

\[ \text{Cost per book} = \frac{\$500}{100 \text{ books}} = \$5 \text{ per book} \]

Next, we need to find out how many books Bob can buy with the total amount of $27,000:

\[ \text{Number of books} = \frac{\$27000}{\$5 \text{ per book}} = 5400 \text{ books} \]

Now, we need to distribute these 5400 books equally among the 3 schools:

\[ \text{Books per school} = \frac{5400 \text{ books}}{3 \text{ schools}} = 1800 \text{ books per school} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1800 \]"
"Let's break down the sequence of events and calculate the number of apples Newton brought home:

1. Initially, two apples fell out of the tree.
2. One of these apples landed on Newton's head, so he now has 1 apple.
3. Newton picked up the two apples that fell, put one in his pocket, and threw the other into the tree. This caused 5 more apples to fall out of the tree.
4. Now, Newton has 1 (from his head) + 5 (newly fallen) = 6 apples.
5. He picked up these 6 apples, put all but one in his pocket, and threw the remaining one at the tree. This caused 6 more apples to fall out of the tree.
6. Now, Newton has 1 (from his pocket) + 6 (newly fallen) = 7 apples.

Therefore, Newton brought home 7 apples."
"First, we need to determine how many 50 kg bags are in 850 kg of coal. We do this by dividing the total weight of coal by the weight of each bag:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{850 \text{ kg}}{50 \text{ kg/bag}} = 17 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of bags by the cost per bag:

"First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed by Kate's friends. Each of the 6 friends eats 6 slices of cheese pizza:

\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices} \]

Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, we need to determine how many cheese pizzas are required to provide 36 slices:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed by Kate's friends. Each of the 6 friends eats 4 slices of pepperoni pizza:

\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Since the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we need to determine how many pepperoni pizzas are required to provide 24 slices:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

To find the total number of pizzas Kate needs to buy, we add the number of cheese pizzas and pepperoni pizzas required:

\[ 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net number of snowballs Jay can make per hour and then determine how long it will take to reach 60 snowballs.

Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in an hour, 2 snowballs melt every hour. Therefore, the net number of snowballs Jay can make in an hour is:

\[ 20 - 2 = 18 \text{ snowballs per hour} \]

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs. We can set up the following equation:

\[ 18 \times \text{hours} = 60 \]

Solving for hours:

\[ \text{hours} = \frac{60}{18} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \]

So, it will take Jay approximately 3.33 hours to have 60 snowballs."
"If John is 28 years old now and he is twice as old as Jim when the Digimon series came out, we can determine Jim's age at that time by dividing John's age by 2. 

So, Jim's age at that time was \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \) years old.

Since the question asks for Jim's current age, and no information is given about the passage of time since the series came out, we can assume Jim is also 14 years old now.

The final numerical answer is 14."

"Let's break down the problem day by day to find out how many bandages were used and how many were left at the end of each day.

**First Day:**
- They used 38 bandages.
- They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
- Total bandages at the end of the first day: \(38 - 38 + 50 = 50\).

**Second Day:**
- They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
- Total bandages at the end of the second day: \(50 - 28 = 22\).

**Third Day:**
- They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered \(2 \times 50 = 100\) bandages.
- They used half a pack, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.
- Total bandages at the end of the third day: \(22 - 25 + 100 = 97\).

According to the problem, they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means there was a discrepancy in the calculation. Let's correct it:

- They used 25 bandages on the third day, so the correct calculation should be: \(22 - 25 + 100 = 97\). But since they ended up with 78 bandages, we need to adjust the initial bandages to match this condition.

Let's denote the number of bandages they started with on the first day as \(x\). From the first day, we know they had 50 bandages at the end. So, the number of bandages used on the first day is \(50 - x\). Given they used 38 bandages, we have:
\[50 - x = 38 \implies x = 12.\]

So, they started with 12 bandages on the first day. Let's verify this:

- On the first day, they used 38 bandages, so they had \(12 - 38 = -26\) bandages, which is not possible. This indicates an error in the initial setup or interpretation. Let's recheck the initial setup with the correct bandage count.

Given the correct bandage count and the problem constraints, the initial number of bandages they started with on the first day is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the haircut. May's hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches, so the haircut involved cutting 2 inches of hair.

The cost for the haircut is $30 per inch, so for 2 inches, the cost is:
\[ 2 \text{ inches} \times \$30/\text{inch} = \$60 \]

Next, we add the cost of the color, which is $40.

So, the total cost is:
\[ \$60 + \$40 = \$100 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$100 \]"
"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to consider her regular pay and the additional attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her regular pay:
- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- She works 6 days a week.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

So, her daily pay is \(7.5 \times 1.5 = 11.25\) dollars.
Her weekly pay is \(11.25 \times 6 = 67.5\) dollars.

Since there are exactly 4 weeks in April, her total pay for April is \(67.5 \times 4 = 270\) dollars.

Additionally, since she has complete attendance for the month, she receives an extra $10 for each week, which amounts to \(10 \times 4 = 40\) dollars.

Therefore, her total earnings for April are \(270 + 40 = 310\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
310"
"To calculate the total amount of money Jason earned, we need to multiply the number of times he performed each task by the amount he earns for each task and then sum these amounts.

- For emptying the dishwasher: Jason emptied the dishwasher 6 times, and he earns $0.50 for each time. So, the earnings from emptying the dishwasher are \(6 \times 0.50 = 3.00\) dollars.
- For doing laundry: Jason did laundry once, and he earns $3.00 for each time. So, the earnings from doing laundry are \(1 \times 3.00 = 3.00\) dollars.
- For taking the trash out: Jason took the trash out twice, and he earns $0.75 for each time. So, the earnings from taking the trash out are \(2 \times 0.75 = 1.50\) dollars.
- For cleaning his room: Jason cleaned his room once, and he earns $1.50 for each time. So, the earnings from cleaning his room are \(1 \times 1.50 = 1.50\) dollars.

Now, we sum these amounts to find the total earnings:

So, Jason earned a total of $9.00 in the two week period."
"First, let's determine the amount of blood in one shark. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons of blood, we can calculate the blood volume in one shark as follows:

\[ \text{Blood volume in one shark} = 3 \times 40 \text{ gallons} = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have together. We do this by multiplying the blood volume of one shark by ten:

\[ \text{Total blood volume for ten sharks} = 120 \text{ gallons/shark} \times 10 \text{ sharks} = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:

\[ 1200 \text{ gallons} \]"
"To calculate the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day, we need to add up all the groups of people who entered.

3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people.

Now, we sum these numbers:

\[
50 \text{ (morning)} + 40 \text{ (10:00)} + 80 \text{ (twice 10:00)} + 150 \text{ (evening)} = 320

The final numerical answer is 75."
"First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600, so the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \]

Next, we need to find the cost per bottle of cognac. The cognac costs 50% more per bottle than the scotch, so the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 \times 1.5 = 90 \]

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

The total cost for the cognac is:

\[ \text{Total cost of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \]

Now, we can find the total amount John spends on everything by adding the cost of the scotch and the cost of the cognac:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2400 \]"
"To find the total number of trees Mr. Julius planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted each day and then sum them up.

First, let's determine the number of trees planted on the first day:
- Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
- He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which means he planted \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

So, the total number of trees planted on the first day is:
\[ 20 \text{ (White Oak)} + 40 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 60 \text{ trees} \]

Next, let's determine the number of trees planted on the second day:
- Mr. Julius planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day, which means he planted \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
- He planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day. The number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the first day was 40, so \(\frac{1}{4}\) more than 40 is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]
Thus, the number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is:
\[ 40 + 10 = 50 \]

So, the total number of trees planted on the second day is:
\[ 30 \text{ (White Oak)} + 50 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 80 \text{ trees} \]

Finally, the total number of trees planted over the two days is:
\[ 60 \text{ (first day)} + 80 \text{ (second day)} = 140 \text{ trees} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{140} \]"
"To find out how much root beer was available for each person to drink during the party, we need to calculate the total amount of root beer remaining after all the losses and spills.

Starting with 24 gallons:
- On the first day, 4 gallons were drunk by Fred's children, so we subtract 4 gallons: \(24 - 4 = 20\) gallons.
- On the second day, 7 gallons were accidentally spilled by Barbie, so we subtract 7 gallons: \(20 - 7 = 13\) gallons.
- On the third day, 5 gallons were taken by Ronnie, so we subtract 5 gallons: \(13 - 5 = 8\) gallons.

On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party, and the remaining 8 gallons were shared equally among them. Therefore, each person would get \(8 \div 3\) gallons.

To find the numerical answer:
\[ \frac{8}{3} = 2 \frac{2}{3} \]

So, the amount of root beer available for each person to drink during the party is \(2 \frac{2}{3}\) gallons."

- Two eyeshadow palettes, each with four colors: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors
- Three makeup sets, each with six colors: \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors

So, the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had is:
\[8 + 18 = 26\]

Her sister steals one of the palettes, which means Amy loses 4 colors:
\[26 - 4 = 22\]

Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which means she uses up 3 colors (since half of 6 is 3):
\[22 - 3 = 19\]

"First, let's determine the height of Mattison's house and the height of the first floor.

Mattison's height is 60 inches. The two-story house is 7 times as high as Mattison is:
\[ \text{Height of the house} = 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

The first floor is thrice as high as Mattison is:
\[ \text{Height of the first floor} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Since the house is two stories, the height of the second floor from the ground is:
\[ \text{Height of the second floor} = \text{Height of the house} - \text{Height of the first floor} = 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is the same as the height of the first floor:
\[ \text{Height of the roof from the second floor's floor} = 180 \text{ inches} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 180 \]"
"First, let's calculate how many shells team Alphas found. They found 40% of the 700 shells:

\[ \text{Shells found by Alphas} = 700 \times \frac{40}{100} = 700 \times 0.4 = 280 \]

Next, we need to find out how many shells are left after team Alphas have found their share:

\[ \text{Remaining shells} = 700 - 280 = 420 \]

Team The finders found 60% of the remaining shells:

\[ \text{Shells found by The finders} = 420 \times \frac{60}{100} = 420 \times 0.6 = 252 \]

Now, we can calculate how many shells team Gogetters found by subtracting the shells found by Alphas and The finders from the total:

"Let's denote the number of miles the last dog needs to walk as \( x \).

The total number of miles the four dogs need to walk per day is the sum of the miles each dog needs:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 + x \]

According to the problem, the average number of miles the dogs need to walk per day is 3 miles. Since there are 4 dogs, the total number of miles they need to walk per day is:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \]

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 + x = 12 \]

Simplifying the left side:
\[ 8 + x = 12 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:

"To find the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed per day for each setting and then multiply by the number of days it was used at that setting.

1. **Low setting:**
   - Removes 1 liter of water per day.
   - Brian used it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed at low setting = 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters.

2. **Medium setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the low setting.
   - Therefore, it removes 2 liters of water per day.
   - Brian used it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed at medium setting = 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters.

3. **High setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting.
   - Therefore, it removes 4 liters of water per day.
   - Brian used it for 5 days.
   - Total water removed at high setting = 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters.

Now, we sum up the total water removed from all settings:

"First, let's determine the capacity of Ali's class. According to the information provided, Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students.

Next, we need to find the capacity of John's classes. Since each of John's classes has \( \frac{1}{8} \) the capacity of Ali's class, we calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:
\[ \text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{120}{8} = 15 \text{ students} \]

John has two classes, so the total capacity of John's classes is:
\[ \text{Total capacity of John's classes} = 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ students} \]

Now, we can find the combined capacity of both schools by adding the capacity of Ali's class and the total capacity of John's classes:
\[ \text{Combined capacity} = 120 + 30 = 150 \]

The combined capacity of both schools is 150 students."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen will owe his sister, including the 2% interest.

The interest is 2% of $300, which is:
\[ 0.02 \times 300 = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen will owe is:
\[ 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Stephen will pay over the 11 months. He will pay $25 per month for 11 months, which totals:
\[ 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

The remaining amount, which will be paid in the twelfth month, is the total amount Stephen owes minus the amount he has already paid over the 11 months:
\[ 306 - 275 = 31 \]

Therefore, the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is:
\[ 31 \]"

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of the jar:**
   The jar has a square base with dimensions 6 inches by 6 inches and a height of 15 inches.
   \[
   \text{Volume of the jar} = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans:**
   Given the packing efficiency is 80%, the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans is:
   \[
   \text{Effective volume} = \text{Volume of the jar} \times \text{Packing efficiency} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of jelly beans that fit in the jar:**
   Each jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches.
   \[
   \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{\text{Effective volume}}{\text{Volume per jelly bean}} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of red jelly beans:**
   Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red.
   \[
   \text{Number of red jelly beans} = 0.30 \times \text{Total number of jelly beans} = 0.30 \times 2880 = 864
   \]

5. **Determine the difference between Tim's guess and the true number of red jelly beans:**
   The true number of red jelly beans is 900.
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{True number of red jelly beans} - \text{Tim's guess} = 900 - 864 = 36
   \]

Tim was 36 jelly beans off from his guess."

"To determine how much Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to break down the problem into steps.

1. **Initial Cost Calculation:**
   - Pauline visits the museum three times a year.
   - The initial cost per visit is $2.
   - Over one year, the total cost is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) dollars.
   - Over 5 years, the total cost is \(5 \times 6 = 30\) dollars.

2. **Cost Increase Calculation:**
   - The cost of one visit increased by 150% after 5 years.
   - A 150% increase means the new cost is \(2 + (2 \times 1.5) = 2 + 3 = 5\) dollars per visit.

3. **Cost for the Next 3 Years:**
   - For the next 3 years, Pauline continues to visit the museum three times a year.
   - The cost per visit is now $5.
   - Over one year, the total cost is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.
   - Over 3 years, the total cost is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) dollars.

4. **Total Cost Calculation:**
   - The total cost over the 8 years (5 years + 3 years) is the sum of the costs from the first 5 years and the next 3 years.
   - Total cost = \(30 + 45 = 75\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is 75 dollars."
"To determine how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups required and then multiply by the time each group takes.

1. There are 10 students in each of the 3 grades (grades 4, 5, and 6), so the total number of students is:
   \[
   10 \text{ students/grade} \times 3 \text{ grades} = 30 \text{ students}
   \]

2. Only 8 students can try the escape room at a time, so the number of groups needed is:
   \[
   \lceil \frac{30 \text{ students}}{8 \text{ students/group}} \rceil = \lceil 3.75 \rceil = 4 \text{ groups}

So, Ali has to pay John $100."
"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Consequently, the length of the longer piece would be \( 4x \) feet. Since the total length of the board is 40 feet, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find the value of \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece is \( 4x \), which is:

\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet."
"To determine how much of his secret seasoning Aiden will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many pounds of meat are needed to make 80 meatballs.
2. Calculate the amount of secret seasoning needed based on the amount of meat.

First, we know that Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat. To find out how many pounds of meat are needed for 80 meatballs, we divide the number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound:

\[
\text{Pounds of meat needed} = \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds of meat}
\]

Next, we know that Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of his secret seasoning for every pound of ground beef. Therefore, for 5 pounds of meat, the amount of seasoning needed is:

\[
\text{Amount of seasoning needed} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts: the cost for the first 16 minutes and the cost for the remaining minutes.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute:
\[ 16 \text{ minutes} \times \$0.25/\text{minute} = \$4.00 \]

For the remaining 20 minutes (since 36 - 16 = 20), the cost is $0.2 per minute:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes} \times \$0.2/\text{minute} = \$4.00 \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total cost:
\[ \$4.00 + \$4.00 = \$8.00 \]

So, the total cost for a 36-minute call is $8.00."

"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly made as \( C \) and the number of brownies as \( B \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be expressed as:
\[ B = 3C - 2 \]

Carly's class has 5 people, and each person gets 2 treats. Therefore, the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

The total number of treats is the sum of the cupcakes and brownies:
\[ C + B = 10 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]

Adding 2 to both sides:
\[ 4C = 12 \]

Dividing both sides by 4:
\[ C = 3 \]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes. The final numerical answer is:

"To find the final price of the toy after the price changes, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price of the toy in December after an 80% increase.
2. Calculate the price of the toy in January after a 50% decrease from the December price.

**Step 1: Calculate the price in December.**

The original price of the toy in November was $40. In December, the price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we calculate 80% of $40 and add it to the original price.

\[ \text{Increase in December} = 40 \times \frac{80}{100} = 40 \times 0.8 = 32 \]

So, the price in December is:

\[ 40 + 32 = 72 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the price in January.**

In January, the price decreased by 50% from the December price. To find the new price, we calculate 50% of $72 and subtract it from the December price.

\[ \text{Decrease in January} = 72 \times \frac{50}{100} = 72 \times 0.5 = 36 \]

So, the price in January is:

\[ 72 - 36 = 36 \]

The final price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"First, let's calculate the standard fee for a 1-hour lesson, which is $80.

Next, we calculate the reduced fee for a lesson given to a veteran, which is 25% off the standard rate. The reduced rate is:

Let's calculate the sum of the scores first:
\[ 50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 \]

Adding these step by step:
\[ 50 + 80 = 130 \]
\[ 130 + 80 = 210 \]
\[ 210 + 60 = 270 \]
\[ 270 + 40 = 310 \]
\[ 310 + 90 = 400 \]
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \]
\[ 500 + 70 = 570 \]
\[ 570 + 60 = 630 \]

So, the total sum of the scores is 630.

"To find the percentage of the distance Michael has covered, we first need to calculate the total distance he travels in 3 days.

Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr. There are 24 hours in a day, so in 3 days, the total number of hours is:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 72 \text{ hours} \]

The total distance Michael travels in 72 hours at 50 km/hr is:
\[ 72 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ km/hr} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

The distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. To find the percentage of the distance he has covered, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{\text{Distance covered}}{\text{Total distance}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 0.6 \times 100 = 60\% \]

"First, let's calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms. Since it takes 15 minutes per classroom, the total time required is:

\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert the total time into hours because the workday is given in hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 1200 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

The custodian works 8 hours per day. To find out how much of their day is spent cleaning, we divide the total cleaning time by the number of hours they work in a day:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours/day}} = 2.5 \text{ days} \]

However, the custodian only has 5 days to complete the cleaning. This means they will spend:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{5 \text{ days}} = 4 \text{ hours/day} \]

To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Cleaning hours per day}}{\text{Total hours in a day}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{4 \text{ hours/day}}{24 \text{ hours/day}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{6} \right) \times 100 \approx 16.67\% \]

So, the custodian spends approximately 16.67% of their day, on average, cleaning classrooms."
"First, let's determine the capacity of each shelf:

- Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase:

- The total capacity of one bookcase is the sum of the capacities of all the shelves: \(10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books.

Given that Elly has 110 books, we need to determine how many bookcases are required to hold all of them:

- The number of bookcases needed is the total number of books divided by the capacity of one bookcase: \(110 \div 55 = 2\).

Therefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs Rose bought. Since she bought five dozens of eggs and each dozen costs $2.40, the total cost is:

\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12.00 \]

Next, let's determine the total number of eggs Rose bought. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, let's calculate how much Rose will earn by selling the eggs. She sells the eggs at the rate of $1 for 3 eggs. Therefore, the total earnings from selling 60 eggs can be calculated as follows:

\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ sets of 3 eggs} \]

Since each set of 3 eggs is sold for $1, the total earnings are:

\[ 20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find Rose's profit, we subtract the total cost from the total earnings:

\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \]

So, Rose's profit is:

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \). According to the problem, we have:

\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

And the total number of ice cubes is:

\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) into the total equation gives:

\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying this equation:

\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides:

\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:

\[ S = 20 \]

Now, substituting \( S = 20 \) back into the equation for \( B \):

\[ B = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is 96."

"To determine how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we can break down the problem into the steps provided by the historical averages.

1. **Determine the number of customers needed to sell 15 cars:**
   - For every 2 cars sold, 1 customer comes in.
   - Therefore, for 15 cars, the number of customers needed is:
     \[
     \frac{15 \text{ cars}}{2 \text{ cars/customer}} = 7.5 \text{ customers}
     \]
   - Since Jason can't have half a customer, we round up to the next whole number, which is 8 customers.

2. **Determine the number of telephone calls needed to get 8 customers:**
   - For every 25 telephone calls, 1 customer comes in.
   - Therefore, the number of telephone calls needed to get 8 customers is:
     \[
     8 \text{ customers} \times 25 \text{ calls/customer} = 200 \text{ calls}
     \]

So, Jason needs to make 200 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus."
"First, let's determine the number of flashlights. There are 4 people in the house, so there are 4 flashlights for them. Additionally, there are 2 flashlights per room, and there are 8 rooms. Therefore, the number of additional flashlights is:

\[ 2 \text{ flashlights/room} \times 8 \text{ rooms} = 16 \text{ flashlights} \]

Adding the flashlights for the people and the flashlights for the rooms, we get:

\[ 4 \text{ flashlights} + 16 \text{ flashlights} = 20 \text{ flashlights} \]

Next, let's determine the number of candles. There are 8 rooms in the house, and half of these rooms (4 rooms) have small candles, while the other half (4 rooms) have medium candles. Each small candle provides light for half a room, and each medium candle provides light for a full room.

The number of small candles needed for the 4 rooms is:

\[ 4 \text{ rooms} \times 2 \text{ small candles/room} = 8 \text{ small candles} \]

The number of medium candles needed for the 4 rooms is:

\[ 4 \text{ rooms} \times 5 \text{ medium candles/room} = 20 \text{ medium candles} \]

Adding the small and medium candles together, we get:

\[ 8 \text{ small candles} + 20 \text{ medium candles} = 28 \text{ candles} \]

Now, we add the total number of flashlights and candles to find the total number of candles and flashlights used:

\[ 20 \text{ flashlights} + 28 \text{ candles} = 48 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total amount of water Crista needs every day, we can break down the problem into parts based on the amount of water each group of plants needs.

1. **Plants needing half a cup of water:**
   - Number of plants: 4
   - Water per plant: 0.5 cups
   - Total water for these plants: \(4 \times 0.5 = 2\) cups

2. **Plants needing 1 cup of water:**
   - Number of plants: 8
   - Water per plant: 1 cup
   - Total water for these plants: \(8 \times 1 = 8\) cups

3. **Plants needing a quarter of a cup of water:**
   - Number of plants: \(20 - 4 - 8 = 8\)
   - Water per plant: 0.25 cups
   - Total water for these plants: \(8 \times 0.25 = 2\) cups

Now, we sum up the total water needed for all the plants:
- Total water = Water for half a cup plants + Water for 1 cup plants + Water for quarter cup plants
- Total water = \(2 + 8 + 2 = 12\) cups

Therefore, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time Phineas spends hopping and swimming.

Phineas needs to travel a total distance of 200 yards. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, he will travel 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.

The time taken to hop 100 yards on land at a speed of 20 yards per minute is:
\[ \text{Time hopping} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

The time taken to swim 100 yards in water at a speed of 10 yards per minute is:
\[ \text{Time swimming} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards/minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

\[ \text{Number of boxes} = \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost. Each box costs $2.00, so we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Bob to build his project is $14.00."
"To determine the total cost of the phone plan, we first need to find out how much each additional phone costs. Given that the main phone costs $20 and it is twice as much as each additional phone, we can calculate the cost of each additional phone as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of each additional phone} = \frac{\text{Cost of the main phone}}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

There are five phones in total, with one being the main phone and the other four being additional phones. Therefore, the total cost of the additional phones is:

\[ \text{Total cost of additional phones} = 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Now, we add the cost of the main phone to the total cost of the additional phones to get the total cost of the phone plan:

\[ \text{Total cost of the phone plan} = \text{Cost of the main phone} + \text{Total cost of additional phones} = 20 + 40 = 60 \]

"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the number of people present each day and then sum them up.

1. **First Day**: Conor saw 50 people.
2. **Second Day**: Conor saw 20 more people than on the first day, which is \(50 + 20 = 70\) people.
3. **Third Day**: The total number of people was twice the number that were there on the second day, which is \(2 \times 70 = 140\) people.

Now, we need to find the number of people seen on the remaining days of the week (fourth, fifth, and sixth days). We know the average number of people seen each day for the rest of the week is 60. Since there are three days left, the total number of people seen on these days is \(60 \times 3 = 180\).

Finally, we sum the number of people seen each day to get the total number of people seen in the week:

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is \(\boxed{440}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount pop, which is \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels.
3. In the next 30 seconds, four times the initial amount pop, which is \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels.
4. In the final 30 seconds, half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, which is \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) kernels.

Now, let's sum up the total number of kernels that popped during the cooking process:
\[ 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 \]

After the pan is taken off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds pop from the residual heat. The number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds is 40, so a quarter of that is:
\[ \frac{40}{4} = 10 \]

Adding these to the total number of kernels that popped during the cooking process:
\[ 200 + 10 = 210 \]

Therefore, the final number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat is:

- Dinner plate: $6.00
- Salad plate: $4.00
- Bowl: $5.00

So, the cost for one set is $6.00 + $4.00 + $5.00 = $15.00.

Since Avery is having 12 people over, she will need 12 sets. Therefore, the total cost will be:
$15.00 * 12 = $180.00

The final numerical answer is $180.00."
"To find out how long it took Anna to finish the puzzle, we first need to determine half of Steve's time and then add 2 hours to that.

Steve's time to complete the puzzle is 10 hours. Half of Steve's time is:
\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Anna took 2 hours more than this half time, so:
\[ 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Anna took 7 hours to finish the puzzle. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 7 \]"
"To determine how many pounds of feed are left after a week, we need to calculate the total amount of feed consumed by the pigs over that period.

First, let's find out how much feed one pig eats in a day:
- Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day.
- Therefore, one pig eats \(4 \times 2 = 8\) pounds of feed per day.

Next, we calculate the total feed consumption for all five pigs in one day:
- Five pigs eat \(8 \times 5 = 40\) pounds of feed per day.

Now, we find out how much feed all five pigs consume in a week (7 days):
- In a week, the pigs consume \(40 \times 7 = 280\) pounds of feed.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. To find out how much feed is left after a week, we subtract the total feed consumed from the initial amount:
- The remaining feed is \(300 - 280 = 20\) pounds.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
20"
"First, we need to calculate the total number of hot dogs required for the party. John invited 20 people and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs, so:

\[ 20 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ hot dogs/guest} = 40 \text{ hot dogs} \]

John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party, so we subtract these from the total required:

\[ 40 \text{ hot dogs} - 4 \text{ hot dogs} = 36 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Next, we need to determine how many packs of hot dogs John needs to buy. Each pack contains 6 hot dogs, so we divide the number of hot dogs needed by the number of hot dogs per pack:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ hot dogs}}{6 \text{ hot dogs/pack}} = 6 \text{ packs} \]

Each pack costs $2, so the total cost for the packs is:

\[ 6 \text{ packs} \times 2 \text{ dollars/pack} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, John needs to spend:

\[ 12 \text{ dollars} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total money Frances earns from selling cupcakes and cookies.

For cupcakes:
20 cupcakes * $2/cupcake = $40

For cookies:
40 cookies * $1/cookie = $40

Total earnings:
$40 (cupcakes) + $40 (cookies) = $80

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the trays of cookies.

For trays of cookies:
5 trays * $4/tray = $20

Now, let's calculate the money Frances has left after her expenses.

Money left:
$80 (total earnings) - $20 (cost of trays) = $60

So, the final numerical answer is:
60"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Street**: There are 5 children.
2. **Second Street**: Each of the 5 children is joined by another child. Therefore, the number of children becomes \(5 + 5 = 10\).
3. **Third Street**: Each of the 10 children is joined by another 2 children. Therefore, the number of children becomes \(10 + (10 \times 2) = 10 + 20 = 30\).

On the third street, the original 5 children give up and leave the group. So, we subtract these 5 children from the total of 30 children.

The final number of children following the truck is \(30 - 5 = 25\).

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to subtract the number of meals she has already given out from the total number of meals she has.

First, let's add up the meals given out:
- Meals given out on Friday: 64
- Meals given out on Saturday: 30
- Meals given out on Sunday: 48

Total meals given out = 64 + 30 + 48

Now, let's calculate the total:
Total meals given out = 64 + 30 + 48 = 142

Now, we subtract the total meals given out from the initial number of meals:
Meals left to distribute = 1,360 - 142

Let's calculate this:
Meals left to distribute = 1,360 - 142 = 1,218

So, the number of meals Mamou has left to distribute is 1,218."

25 cents (quarter) + 10 cents (nickels) + 70 cents (dimes) = 105 cents

So, the final numerical answer is 105."
"To find the total age of all the siblings, we need to add up the ages of the 2 brothers and 3 sisters.

- The ages of the sisters are all 16 years old. Since there are 3 sisters, their total age is \(3 \times 16 = 48\) years.
- One of the brothers is 12 years old. The older brother is twice the age of the younger brother, so the older brother is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) years old.

Now, we add the ages of all the siblings together:
- The total age of the sisters is 48 years.
- The total age of the brothers is \(12 + 24 = 36\) years.

So, the total age of all the siblings is \(48 + 36 = 84\) years.

"First, let's calculate the time Charisma spends meditating each day. She meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes in the evening, which totals to 30 minutes per day.

Next, let's calculate the time she spends on yoga each week. She practices yoga for 1 hour (60 minutes) 5 days a week, so she spends 5 * 60 = 300 minutes on yoga each week.

Now, let's calculate the total time spent on meditation and yoga in one week. Since she meditates for 30 minutes each day and there are 7 days in a week, she spends 30 * 7 = 210 minutes on meditation each week. Adding the time spent on yoga, she spends 210 + 300 = 510 minutes on meditation and yoga each week.

Finally, to find out how much time she has spent on meditation/yoga practice in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly total by 4:

510 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 2040 minutes.

Converting 2040 minutes into hours, we get:

2040 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 34 hours.

So, the final numerical answer is 34 hours."
"To find the total square footage of the quilt, we need to calculate the square footage contributed by each type of t-shirt and then sum them up.

For the small t-shirts:
11 small t-shirts * 3 square feet per small t-shirt = 33 square feet

For the medium t-shirts:
8 medium t-shirts * 4 square feet per medium t-shirt = 32 square feet

For the large t-shirts:
6 large t-shirts * 6 square feet per large t-shirt = 36 square feet

Now, we add up the square footage from all the t-shirts:
33 square feet (small) + 32 square feet (medium) + 36 square feet (large) = 101 square feet

The total square footage of the quilt is 101 square feet."
"First, let's determine the number of seeds in a large sunflower. A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since one dozen equals 12, a small sunflower has:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds} \]

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36 seeds, we calculate:

\[ 0.50 \times 36 = 18 \text{ seeds} \]

Adding this to the 36 seeds of the small sunflower gives the number of seeds in a large sunflower:

\[ 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds} \]

Now, to find the total number of seeds in both a small and a large sunflower, we add the seeds from both:

\[ 36 + 54 = 90 \text{ seeds} \]

So, the total number of sunflower seeds altogether is:

\[ 90 \]"
"If George has 18 pens, then Timothy has 3 times that amount, which is 3 * 18 = 54 pens. Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, so she has 54 / 2 = 27 pens.

"To determine how much money the company will receive for selling the chocolate bars during two weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of bars produced in two weeks.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling those bars.

First, let's find out how many bars are produced in two weeks. Since the company produces 5000 bars per day, in two weeks (which is 14 days), the company will produce:
\[ 5000 \text{ bars/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 70000 \text{ bars} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling these bars. Since each bar is sold for $2, the total revenue will be:
\[ 70000 \text{ bars} \times 2 \text{ dollars/bar} = 140000 \text{ dollars} \]

"First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts with the buy one get one 50% off deal.

The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, he gets the second T-shirt at 50% off the original price.

The discounted price of the second T-shirt is:
\[ 8 \times 0.5 = 4 \]

So, the total cost for the two T-shirts is:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes after the 40% discount.

The original price of the shoes is $40. The discount is 40%, so the price Jake pays is:
\[ 40 \times (1 - 0.4) = 40 \times 0.6 = 24 \]

Now, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends:
\[ 12 + 24 = 36 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is:

- Special honey: 2 pounds at $10 per pound = 2 * $10 = $20

Total cost for one jar = $12 (passion fruit) + $12 (jackfruit) + $20 (honey) = $44

Now, let's calculate the profit for one jar:
- Selling price of one jar = $50
- Cost of one jar = $44
- Profit per jar = $50 - $44 = $6

Finally, let's calculate the profit for 10 jars:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Aaron's speed:**
   - Let's denote the distance Aaron ran as \(d_A\) miles.
   - Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, so Vanessa ran \(2d_A\) miles.
   - We know Vanessa ran 4 miles, so \(2d_A = 4\).
   - Solving for \(d_A\), we get \(d_A = 2\) miles.

2. **Determine Vanessa's speed:**
   - Aaron's speed is twice as fast as Vanessa's speed.
   - Let Vanessa's speed be \(v_V\) miles per minute.
   - Then Aaron's speed is \(2v_V\) miles per minute.
   - Since Aaron completed 2 miles in 16 minutes, we can write the equation for Aaron's speed as:
     \[
     2 \text{ miles} = 16 \text{ minutes} \times 2v_V \text{ miles per minute}
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     2 = 32v_V \implies v_V = \frac{2}{32} = \frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute}
     \]

3. **Determine Vanessa's time to complete her part:**
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles at a speed of \(\frac{1}{16}\) miles per minute.
   - The time \(t_V\) Vanessa took to complete her part is given by:
     \[
     t_V = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{\frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute}} = 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ minutes}

"First, let's calculate the total selling price of the watermelons. The vendor made a profit of 25% on the cost price. The cost price for 50 watermelons is $80.

The profit amount can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Cost Price} \times \text{Profit Percentage} = 80 \times \frac{25}{100} = 80 \times 0.25 = 20 \]

So, the total selling price is:
\[ \text{Total Selling Price} = \text{Cost Price} + \text{Profit} = 80 + 20 = 100 \]

Now, to find the selling price per watermelon, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:
\[ \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{\text{Total Selling Price}}{\text{Number of Watermelons}} = \frac{100}{50} = 2 \]

So, each watermelon was sold for $2."

"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in that time.

First, let's find out how many oranges each can peel in one minute:
- Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in one minute, she peels \( \frac{1}{3} \) of an orange.
- Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in one minute, she peels \( \frac{1}{4} \) of an orange.

Next, we calculate how many oranges each can peel in one hour (60 minutes):
- In one hour, Ana peels \( 60 \times \frac{1}{3} = 20 \) oranges.
- In one hour, Jane peels \( 60 \times \frac{1}{4} = 15 \) oranges.

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane in one hour:
- The difference is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \) oranges.

"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400, and Mark gets it at 80% off.

The discount amount is:
\[ 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \]

So, the cost of the radiator after the discount is:
\[ 400 - 320 = 80 \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost of hiring the mechanic. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.

The cost for the mechanic is:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator after the discount to the cost of hiring the mechanic to find the total amount Mark paid:
\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 230 \]"
"Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( Co \).

We know that:
1. Each chicken has 2 legs.
2. Each cow has 4 legs.
3. The total number of animals is 20.
4. The total number of legs is 70.

From the information given, we can set up the following equations:
\[ C + Co = 20 \]
\[ 2C + 4Co = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2Co = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + Co = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2Co = 35 \)

To solve this system, we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (C + 2Co) - (C + Co) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ Co = 15 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can substitute \( Co = 15 \) back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is 5."
"First, we need to determine the total number of slices available from the 7 pizzas. Since each pizza is cut into 8 slices, we can calculate the total number of slices as follows:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to divide the total number of slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends, which makes a total of 4 people. So, we divide the total number of slices by 4:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Thus, each of them can have 14 slices. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 14 \]"
