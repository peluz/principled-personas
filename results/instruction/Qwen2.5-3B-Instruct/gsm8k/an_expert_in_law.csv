"First, let's determine how many eggs Janet has left after eating and using some for baking.

Janet starts with 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 eggs for baking muffins. So, the number of eggs left for sale is:

\[ 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 \]

Janet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg. Therefore, the amount of money she makes every day is:

\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 18 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of fiber required for both the blue and white fibers and then sum them up.

1. The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.
2. The robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Therefore, the amount of white fiber needed is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) bolt.

Now, we add the bolts of blue and white fiber together:
\[ 2 \text{ bolts (blue)} + 1 \text{ bolt (white)} = 3 \text{ bolts} \]

So, the total number of bolts needed is 3.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"First, we need to calculate the new value of the house after the repairs and the increase in value.

The initial value of the house is $80,000. Josh adds $50,000 in repairs, so the total cost before the increase is:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

The value of the house increases by 150%. To find out how much the value increases, we calculate 150% of $130,000:
\[ 130,000 \times 1.5 = 195,000 \]

Adding this increase to the total cost gives us the new value of the house:
\[ 130,000 + 195,000 = 325,000 \]

The profit Josh made is the new value of the house minus the total amount he spent (the purchase price plus the repairs):
\[ 325,000 - 130,000 = 195,000 \]

So, the profit Josh made is:
\[ 195,000 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 195000 \]"
"To determine the total number of meters James runs in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the total distance James runs in one sprint.
2. Calculate the total distance James runs in one week for one sprint.
3. Multiply the weekly distance for one sprint by the number of sprints he runs in a week.

Step 1: James runs 60 meters in one sprint.

Step 2: James runs 3 sprints a week, so the distance he runs in one week for one sprint is:
\[ 60 \, \text{meters/sprint} \times 3 \, \text{sprints/week} = 180 \, \text{meters/week} \]

Step 3: Since James runs 3 sprints a week, the total distance he runs in a week is:
\[ 180 \, \text{meters/week} \times 3 \, \text{sprints/week} = 540 \, \text{meters/week} \]

Therefore, the total number of meters James runs in a week is 540 meters."
"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she gives her flock in the morning and afternoon.

Wendi gives her flock 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. Therefore, the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
\[ 15 + 25 = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Since Wendi has a flock of 20 chickens and she feeds each chicken three cups of feed per day, the total amount of feed needed for the entire flock is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how many cups of feed are needed in the final meal, we subtract the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total amount of feed needed for the day:
\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Thus, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:
\[ 20 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"
"To determine the total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5.

First, let's calculate the cost of the second glass:
\[ 60\% \text{ of } \$5 = 0.60 \times 5 = \$3 \]

Now, we can see that for every pair of glasses, the cost is:
\[ \$5 + \$3 = \$8 \]

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can pair them up:
\[ \frac{16}{2} = 8 \text{ pairs} \]

Each pair costs $8, so the total cost for 8 pairs is:
\[ 8 \times 8 = \$64 \]

Therefore, the total amount Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses is:
\[ \boxed{64} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of sheep in each city based on the given relationships and the number of sheep in Seattle.

1. Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. Therefore, Charleston has \(4 \times 20 = 80\) sheep.
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Therefore, Toulouse has \(2 \times 80 = 160\) sheep.

Now, we sum the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle:
\[160 + 80 + 20 = 260\]

The total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is \(\boxed{260}\)."
"To determine the total time Carla spends downloading the 200 GB file, we need to break down the process into parts and calculate the time for each part.

1. **First 40% of the download:**
   - The file size is 200 GB, so 40% of 200 GB is \(0.40 \times 200 = 80\) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \(80 \div 2 = 40\) minutes.

2. **Windows update installation:**
   - This takes 20 minutes.

3. **Restarting the download:**
   - After the update, Carla has to start the download from the beginning, which means she has to download the entire 200 GB file again.
   - The time to download the entire 200 GB file at a rate of 2 GB/minute is \(200 \div 2 = 100\) minutes.

Now, we sum up the time for each part:
- Time for the first 40% of the download: 40 minutes
- Time for the Windows update installation: 20 minutes
- Time to download the entire file again: 100 minutes

Total time = \(40 + 20 + 100 = 160\) minutes.

The final numerical answer is 160 minutes."
"To determine how far John is from home at the end of 4 hours, we need to break down his journey into segments and calculate the distance for each segment.

1. **First Segment:**
   - Time: 3 hours
   - Speed: 60 mph
   - Distance: \(3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ mph} = 180 \text{ miles}\)

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Time: 2 hours (in traffic)
   - Speed: 0 mph
   - Distance: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 0 \text{ mph} = 0 \text{ miles}\)

3. **Third Segment:**
   - Time: 0.5 hours
   - Speed: 30 mph
   - Distance: \(0.5 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ miles}\)

4. **Fourth Segment:**
   - Time: 3.5 hours (since the total time is 4 hours and the first 2 hours were in traffic)
   - Speed: 80 mph
   - Distance: \(3.5 \text{ hours} \times 80 \text{ mph} = 280 \text{ miles}\)

Now, we sum up the distances from all segments to find the total distance traveled:
\[180 \text{ miles} + 0 \text{ miles} + 15 \text{ miles} + 280 \text{ miles} = 475 \text{ miles}\]

Therefore, the total distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours is:
\[475 \text{ miles}\]"
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break it down into regular hours and overtime hours.

First, we calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours at her regular rate:
\[ \text{Regular earnings} = 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \]

Next, we calculate her earnings for the 5 overtime hours at her overtime rate. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate:
\[ \text{Overtime rate} = 1.2 \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$12/\text{hour} \]
\[ \text{Overtime earnings} = 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

Now, we add the regular earnings and the overtime earnings to find her total earnings for the week:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$460 \]"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the number of downloads for each month and then sum them up.

1. **First Month:**
   The number of downloads in the first month is given as 60.

2. **Second Month:**
   The number of downloads in the second month is three times the number of downloads in the first month.
   \[
   \text{Downloads in the second month} = 3 \times 60 = 180
   \]

3. **Third Month:**
   The number of downloads in the third month is 30% less than the number of downloads in the second month.
   \[
   \text{Downloads in the third month} = 180 - (0.30 \times 180) = 180 - 54 = 126
   \]

4. **Total Downloads Over Three Months:**
   Sum the downloads from each month.
   \[
   \text{Total downloads} = 60 + 180 + 126 = 366
   \]

The total number of downloads over the three months is \(\boxed{366}\)."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts:
- Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
- Each dozen of donuts costs $68.
- Therefore, the cost of the donuts is \(3 \times 68 = 204\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:
- Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
- Each dozen of mini cupcakes costs $80.
- Therefore, the cost of the mini cupcakes is \(2 \times 80 = 160\) dollars.

Then, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes:
- Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
- Each dozen of mini cheesecakes costs $55.
- Therefore, the cost of the mini cheesecakes is \(6 \times 55 = 330\) dollars.

Finally, we add up the costs of all the pastries to find the total cost:
- Total cost = cost of donuts + cost of mini cupcakes + cost of mini cheesecakes
- Total cost = \(204 + 160 + 330 = 694\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is 694."
"To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point at which this profit becomes positive.

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:
- Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons.
- Each lemon is sold for $1.5.
- Therefore, the annual revenue from lemons is \(7 \times 1.5 = 10.5\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the annual cost of watering and feeding the tree:
- The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.

Now, we can determine the net profit each year by subtracting the annual cost from the annual revenue:
- Net profit per year = Annual revenue - Annual cost
- Net profit per year = \(10.5 - 3 = 7.5\) dollars.

Since the initial cost to plant the tree is $90, we need to find out how many years it will take for the net profit to cover this initial cost.

Let \(n\) be the number of years it takes to start earning money. The total net profit after \(n\) years is \(7.5n\). We need this to be at least equal to the initial cost of $90:
\[7.5n \geq 90\]

Solving for \(n\):
\[n \geq \frac{90}{7.5} = 12\]

Therefore, it will take at least 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had as \( x \).

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \).

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \).

3. She then sold half of what was left at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \). The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \).

We know that after these sales, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

Let's solve this equation step by step.

First, simplify the expression inside the parentheses:

\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \left( \frac{x}{3} - 1 \right) = \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{x}{3} + 1 = \frac{x}{3} - 1 \]

So the equation becomes:

\[ \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5 \]

Add 1 to both sides:

\[ \frac{x}{3} = 6 \]

Multiply both sides by 3:

\[ x = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners. Let's verify this by checking the steps:

1. She sold \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) vacuum cleaners at the green house, leaving her with \( 18 - 6 = 12 \) vacuum cleaners.
2. She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, leaving her with \( 12 - 2 = 10 \) vacuum cleaners.
3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) vacuum cleaners, leaving her with \( 10 - 5 = 5 \) vacuum cleaners.

Since the final number of vacuum cleaners left is 5, our solution is correct. The initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had is:

\[
\boxed{18}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we have:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after those who enrolled in contemporary dance have been accounted for:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Now, 25% of these remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

The rest of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance. To find out how many students that is, we subtract the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance from the remaining students:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of students in hip-hop dance}}{\text{Total number of students}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.60 \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the entire students that enrolled in hip-hop dance is 60%."
"To determine which purchase plan will maximize the profit, we need to calculate the future value of each item based on the expected market growth and then compare the profit from each plan.

1. **Jewelry:**
   - Current value: $5,000
   - Expected growth: 2.5%
   - Future value of jewelry = Current value + (Current value * Growth rate)
   - Future value of jewelry = $5,000 + ($5,000 * 0.025) = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125

2. **Electronic Gadgets:**
   - Current value: $8,000
   - Expected growth: 1.2%
   - Future value of electronic gadgets = Current value + (Current value * Growth rate)
   - Future value of electronic gadgets = $8,000 + ($8,000 * 0.012) = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096

Now, we calculate the profit for each plan:
- Profit from jewelry = Future value of jewelry - Current value of jewelry
- Profit from jewelry = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets = Future value of electronic gadgets - Current value of electronic gadgets
- Profit from electronic gadgets = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Comparing the profits:
- Profit from jewelry: $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets: $96

The merchant would maximize profit by choosing to purchase the jewelry, which would result in a profit of $125."
"To determine the total distance covered by each train over the two days, we need to add the distances traveled in both directions.

1. The first day, the train travels 80 miles west.
2. The second day, the train travels 150 miles north.

The total distance covered by each train is the sum of these two distances:
\[ 80 \text{ miles} + 150 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles} \]

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles."
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from both teaching and coaching separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her annual earnings from teaching:
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual teaching hours = 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year
Annual teaching earnings = 1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her annual earnings from coaching:
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual coaching hours = 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year
Annual coaching earnings = 750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year

Now, we sum up her annual earnings from both teaching and coaching:
Annual salary = Annual teaching earnings + Annual coaching earnings
Annual salary = $35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

The final numerical answer is $57,500."
"To determine how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs Claire uses per day.
2. Calculate the number of eggs Claire uses per week.
3. Calculate the number of eggs Claire uses in 4 weeks.
4. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.

Step 1: Claire uses 3 eggs per day.

Step 2: There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Step 3: Over 4 weeks, she will use:
\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Step 4: Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, the number of dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks is:
\[ \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozen} \]

The final numerical answer is 7 dozen."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour over the entire 12-mile trail.

First, let's calculate the total time Marissa has already spent hiking:
- She took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles.
- She took another 1 hour to walk the next 2 miles.
So, the total time spent hiking so far is \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours.

Let's denote the remaining distance as \(x\) miles. The time taken to walk the remaining distance is \(\frac{x}{v}\), where \(v\) is the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance.

The total distance is 12 miles, so the remaining distance is \(12 - 4 - 2 = 6\) miles. The total time for the entire hike is \(2 + \frac{6}{v}\) hours.

We want the average speed to be 4 miles per hour. The formula for average speed is total distance divided by total time. Therefore, we set up the equation:

\[
\text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} = 4 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
4 = \frac{12}{2 + \frac{6}{v}}
\]

To solve for \(v\), we first clear the fraction by multiplying both sides by the denominator:

\[
4 \left(2 + \frac{6}{v}\right) = 12
\]

Distribute the 4:

\[
8 + \frac{24}{v} = 12
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[
\frac{24}{v} = 4
\]

Solve for \(v\) by multiplying both sides by \(v\) and then dividing by 4:

\[
24 = 4v \implies v = \frac{24}{4} = 6
\]

Thus, Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles at a speed of 6 miles per hour to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire hike.

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{6}
\]"
"First, let's determine the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the amount of water in the orange drink is:

\[ \text{Water in orange drink} = 10 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ liters} \]

Next, let's determine the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is:

\[ \text{Water in pineapple drink} = 15 \times \frac{3}{5} = 9 \text{ liters} \]

After adding the orange drink to the pineapple drink, we have a total of 24 liters of mixture. However, we spill one liter of the orange drink, so the total volume of the mixture is:

\[ 24 - 1 = 23 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we need to find the total amount of water in the 23 liters of mixture. The total amount of water from the orange drink and the pineapple drink is:

\[ \text{Total water} = \frac{20}{3} + 9 = \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3} \text{ liters} \]

To find the percentage of water in the 23 liters of mixture, we calculate:

\[ \text{Percentage of water} = \left( \frac{\frac{47}{3}}{23} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{47}{3 \times 23} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{47}{69} \right) \times 100 = \frac{4700}{69} \approx 68.02 \text{ percent} \]

Therefore, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is approximately 68.02 liters. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 68.02 \]"
"First, let's determine Raymond's current age. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha and Samantha is currently 31 years old, Raymond is currently \(31 - 6 = 25\) years old.

   - From 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is a span of 4 hours.

2. Determine the rate of melting:
   - The candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour.

3. Calculate the total decrease in height:
   - Total decrease in height = Rate of melting × Total burning time
   - Total decrease in height = 2 cm/hour × 4 hours = 8 cm

Therefore, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

The final numerical answer is:
8"
"To find the original price of the book, we can set up the equation based on the information given. If the book was bought for $19.50 with a 25% discount, this means Kyle paid 75% of the original price (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \). According to the problem, 75% of \( P \) is $19.50. We can write this as:

\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we need to solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's calculate the value of \( P \).
```python
# Calculation
original_price = 19.50 / 0.75
original_price
```
```output
RuntimeError
```
It seems there was an error in the execution environment. Let's perform the calculation manually:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was \( \$26 \).

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{26}

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered except for the boxes of pizza.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
The cost of 4 apples is \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Adding these costs together, we get:
\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\] dollars.

Marie paid a total of $50. If we subtract the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples from the total amount paid, we can find out how much she spent on the boxes of pizza:
\[50 - 33 = 17\] dollars.

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, we can determine the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered by dividing the amount spent on pizza by the cost per box:
\[17 \div 8.50 = 2\]

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{2}

"To find out how much Mishka spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of each type of clothing item separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the cost of the shorts:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts.
- Each pair of shorts costs $16.50.
- Therefore, the total cost for the shorts is \(3 \times 16.50 = 49.50\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pants:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
- Each pair of pants costs $22.50.
- Therefore, the total cost for the pants is \(3 \times 22.50 = 67.50\) dollars.

Then, let's calculate the cost of the shoes:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
- Each pair of shoes costs $42.
- Therefore, the total cost for the shoes is \(3 \times 42 = 126\) dollars.

Finally, we sum up the costs of the shorts, pants, and shoes to find the total amount Mishka spent:
- Total cost = Cost of shorts + Cost of pants + Cost of shoes
- Total cost = $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243

So, Mishka spent a total of 243 dollars on all the clothing items."
"To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.
2. Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need to buy.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.**

Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night. There are 60 days in the period, so she will eat:
\[ 60 \text{ servings} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need to buy.**

Each carton contains 15 servings. To find out how many cartons she needs, we divide the total servings by the servings per carton:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.**

Each carton costs $4.00. Therefore, the total cost for 4 cartons is:
\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To determine how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to calculate the distance from his first stop to his second stop.

1. Henry's first stop was after 20 miles.
2. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip is 60 miles, the second stop was at \(60 - 15 = 45\) miles.

The distance between his first and second stops is the difference between the mileages at these two stops:
\[ 45 \text{ miles} - 20 \text{ miles} = 25 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the number of miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops is:
\[ 25 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 25 \]"
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

The cost of the first pair of high heels is $33. The cost of the second pair of high heels is twice the cost of the first pair, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = 104 \]

So, the cost of the boots is \( 104 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 104 \]"
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the ages of Darrell and Allen in terms of a variable. Let Darrell's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a positive integer. According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

To find the value of \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen. Darrell's age is \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\) and Allen's age is \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\).

Next, we need to find Allen's age 10 years from now. Adding 10 years to Allen's current age, we get:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"To find the average guess, we first need to determine each friend's guess and then calculate the average of these guesses.

1. The first friend's guess is 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60. So, the second friend's guess is 60 jelly beans.
3. The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, and adding this to 80 gives us 100. So, the third friend's guess is 100 jelly beans.

Now, we calculate the average of these guesses:
- The first guess is 80.
- The second guess is 60.
- The third guess is 100.

The sum of these guesses is \(80 + 60 + 100 = 240\).

The average guess is the sum of the guesses divided by the number of guesses, which is \(240 / 3 = 80\).

So, the average guess is 80 jelly beans."
"To determine how many hours a week John spends taking care of the dogs, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. First, calculate the total hours John spends on one dog per day:
   \[
   0.5 \text{ hours/dog/day}
   \]

2. Next, calculate the total hours John spends on all 10 dogs per day:
   \[
   0.5 \text{ hours/dog/day} \times 10 \text{ dogs} = 5 \text{ hours/day}
   \]

3. Finally, calculate the total hours John spends on all the dogs in one week (7 days):
   \[
   5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week}
   \]

So, the total number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs in a week is 35 hours."
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these pieces of information as equations:
\[ G + S = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins \( S \) is 40, we can find the number of gold coins \( G \) using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 70 \]"
"First, let's determine how many jewels Aaron has. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Since Raymond has 40 jewels, we can calculate half of Raymond's jewels as follows:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Now, we add 5 to this number to find out how many jewels Aaron has:

\[
20 + 5 = 25
\]

So, Aaron has 25 jewels. Next, we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. The problem states that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Therefore, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:

\[
25 - 2 = 23
\]

Thus, Siobhan has 23 jewels. The final numerical answer is:

\[
23
\]"
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points he scores in the second 20 minutes, we calculate 25% of 4 points and add it to the original 4 points.

25% of 4 points is \( 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \) point.

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) points.

Adding the points from both periods, the total points Mike scored is \( 4 + 5 = 9 \) points.

The final numerical answer is 9."
"To determine how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days:**
   Terry eats 2 yogurts a day.
   \[
   \text{Total yogurts in 30 days} = 2 \, \text{yogurts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 60 \, \text{yogurts}
   \]

2. **Determine how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts:**
   The yogurts are sold in sets of 4 for $5.00.
   \[
   \text{Number of sets} = \frac{60 \, \text{yogurts}}{4 \, \text{yogurts/set}} = 15 \, \text{sets}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for 15 sets:**
   Each set costs $5.00.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 15 \, \text{sets} \times 5 \, \text{\$/set} = 75 \, \text{\$}
   \]

Therefore, Terry spends \(\boxed{75}\) dollars on yogurt over 30 days."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John makes from selling his lego sets. He has 13 lego sets and sells each for $15.

\[ \text{Total money from lego sets} = 13 \times 15 = 195 \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money John spends on the video games. He buys 8 video games for $20 each.

\[ \text{Total money spent on video games} = 8 \times 20 = 160 \]

Now, we can determine how much money John has left after buying the video games. We know he has $5 left after these purchases.

\[ \text{Money left} = 195 - 160 = 35 \]

Since the problem states that John has $5 left, we can verify that the calculation is consistent with the given information.

Finally, since John did not sell any lego sets after buying the video games, he still has all 13 lego sets.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{13} \]"
"To find out how fast John runs, we need to determine the total distance he runs in a week and the total time he spends running in a week.

First, we know that John runs a total of 60 miles in a week and he runs 3 days a week. So, the distance he runs each day is:
\[ \text{Distance per day} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ days}} = 20 \text{ miles/day} \]

Next, we know that on the first day, he runs 3 hours, and on the other two days, he runs half as much as he does on the first day. So, the distance he runs on the second and third days is:
\[ \text{Distance on second and third days} = \frac{3 \text{ hours}}{2} = 1.5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Since he runs 20 miles each day, we can calculate the speed for each day. Speed is calculated as distance divided by time. For the first day:
\[ \text{Speed on first day} = \frac{20 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ miles/hour} \approx 6.67 \text{ miles/hour} \]

For the second and third days:
\[ \text{Speed on second and third days} = \frac{20 \text{ miles}}{1.5 \text{ hours}} = \frac{20}{1.5} \text{ miles/hour} = \frac{40}{3} \text{ miles/hour} \approx 13.33 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Since the question asks for the speed he runs, and typically we consider the average speed over the days he runs, we can take the average of the speeds from the first day and the second/third days:
\[ \text{Average speed} = \frac{\left(\frac{20}{3}\right) + \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)}{2} = \frac{\frac{60}{3}}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ miles/hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/hour} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how far Dana can travel in six hours given her running, walking, and skipping speeds, and the time she spends on each activity.

First, let's find Dana's walking speed. We know that her skipping speed is half her running speed, and she skips at 3 miles per hour. Therefore, her running speed is twice her skipping speed:
\[ \text{Running speed} = 2 \times 3 \text{ miles per hour} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine the time she spends running and walking. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Since the total time is six hours, the time spent running is:
\[ \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]
And the time spent walking is:
\[ \text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the distance she covers while running and walking. The distance covered while running is:
\[ \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time running} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]
The distance covered while walking is:
\[ \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time walking} \]
Since her walking speed is the same as her skipping speed (3 miles per hour), the distance covered while walking is:
\[ \text{Distance walking} = 3 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

The total distance Dana can travel in six hours is the sum of the distances covered while running and walking:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance walking} = 12 \text{ miles} + 12 \text{ miles} = 24 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{24} \]"
"To determine the age of Brandon's iPhone, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Suzy's iPhone Age:**
   Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.

2. **Ben's iPhone Age:**
   Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone. Therefore, we calculate Ben's iPhone age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Ben's iPhone age} = 2 \times \text{Suzy's iPhone age} = 2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. **Brandon's iPhone Age:**
   Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. Therefore, we calculate Brandon's iPhone age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Brandon's iPhone age} = 4 \times \text{Ben's iPhone age} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ years old}
   \]

Thus, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how far Polly can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone. We know that without the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet. When holding the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther. Therefore, the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone is:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's breath can reach up to 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance Polly can throw the javelin:

\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 200 \]"
"Grandma Jones had 5 apple pies, each cut into 8 pieces, so the total number of pieces was:

"First, let's determine the number of calories in one serving of the bag of chips. Given that a 300g bag has 5 servings and contains 250 calories per serving, we can calculate the total calories in the bag as follows:

\[ \text{Total calories in the bag} = 5 \text{ servings} \times 250 \text{ calories/serving} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories are left for the day. The daily calorie target is 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories:

\[ \text{Calories left for the day} = 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to determine how many servings of chips you can eat with the remaining 200 calories. Since each serving contains 250 calories:

\[ \text{Number of servings} = \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories/serving}} = \frac{200}{250} = \frac{4}{5} = 0.8 \text{ servings} \]

Since each serving is 500g (300g / 5 servings), the amount of chips you can eat is:

\[ \text{Grams of chips} = 0.8 \text{ servings} \times 500 \text{ grams/serving} = 400 \text{ grams} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 400 \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of making the candles. Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax and wicks for every 10 candles. For 20 candles, he will need 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks. The cost for 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks is:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pound} = \$20.00 \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles at $2.00 each:

\[ 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00 \text{ per candle} = \$40.00 \]

Now, we can find the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00 \]

So, Charlie's net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of articles written on each day.
2. Calculate the total number of hours spent writing articles over the three days.

**Step 1: Determine the number of articles written on each day.**

- **Monday:** Meredith wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday:** She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. So, the number of articles on Tuesday is:
  \[
  5 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 5 \right) = 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ articles}
  \]
- **Wednesday:** She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, the number of articles on Wednesday is:
  \[
  2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ articles}
  \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of hours spent writing articles over the three days.**

- Each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write about.
- Total articles written over the three days:
  \[
  5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles}
  \]
- Total hours spent writing articles:
  \[
  26 \text{ articles} \times 4 \text{ hours/article} = 104 \text{ hours}
  \]

The total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days is \(\boxed{104}\)."
"To determine how many Post-it notes were in the package that Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Post-it Notes**: Candice started with 80 Post-it notes.
2. **Post-it Notes Used**: She placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee. Therefore, she used 220 Post-it notes.
3. **Remaining Post-it Notes**: After using the Post-it notes for the coffee cups, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased as \( x \).

The total number of Post-it notes she had before purchasing the new package is the sum of the initial notes and the notes she purchased:
\[ 80 + x \]

After using 220 notes and having 23 notes left, the equation representing the total number of notes is:
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x - 220 = 23 - 80 \]
\[ x - 220 = -57 \]
\[ x = -57 + 220 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

Therefore, the number of Post-it notes in the package that she purchased is 163.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 163 \]"
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Given that each blue tie costs $40 and he spent a total of $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of each red tie. Since red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, the cost of each red tie is:

\[ \text{Cost per red tie} = \text{Cost per blue tie} \times (1 + 0.50) = 40 \times 1.50 = 60 \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

Finally, the total amount John spent on ties is the sum of the cost of the blue ties and the cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total spent on ties} = \text{Total spent on blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 800 \]"

So, the total length of the wire in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 6-inch pieces can be cut from the 48-inch wire. We do this by dividing the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"First, we need to determine the total number of units in the building. The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units. Therefore, the total number of units is:

\[ 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units per floor} = 120 \text{ units} \]

Next, we need to find out how many units are occupied. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is:

\[ 120 \text{ units} \times \frac{3}{4} = 90 \text{ units} \]

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

\[ 120 \text{ units} - 90 \text{ units} = 30 \text{ units} \]

So, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is:

\[ 30 \]"
"First, we need to determine how many dozens of eggs Lloyd gets from his farm per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs produced per day by 12:

\[ \text{Dozens of eggs per day} = \frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 21 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we calculate how much Lloyd makes per day by selling the eggs at $2 per dozen:

\[ \text{Daily earnings} = 21 \text{ dozen} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much Lloyd makes in a week, we multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in a week (7 days):

\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 42 \text{ dollars/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 294 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Tom to travel back from his destination. However, the question does not specify the distance he traveled to get to his destination. Without this information, we cannot calculate the time it takes for him to travel back.

If we assume that the distance to his destination is \(D\) miles, then the time it takes to travel to the destination is \( \frac{D}{10} \) hours. The time it takes to travel back is \( \frac{D}{6} \) hours. Since the question only provides the speed for the return trip and does not specify the distance, we cannot determine the exact time for the return trip.

Given the information provided, the time it takes to get back cannot be determined numerically."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, and he removes 30 comic books.

\[ \text{Total weight of comic books} = 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds in comic books, the remaining weight that needs to be removed is:

\[ \text{Remaining weight to be removed} = 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[ \text{Number of toys to be removed} = \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 15 \]"
"To determine which day the mechanic earned more revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for each day.

**Thursday:**
- Revenue from truck tires: \(6 \text{ tires} \times \$60 \text{ per tire} = \$360\)
- Revenue from car tires: \(4 \text{ tires} \times \$40 \text{ per tire} = \$160\)
- Total revenue on Thursday: \(\$360 + \$160 = \$520\)

**Friday:**
- Revenue from car tires: \(12 \text{ tires} \times \$40 \text{ per tire} = \$480\)
- Revenue from truck tires: \(0 \text{ tires} \times \$60 \text{ per tire} = \$0\)
- Total revenue on Friday: \(\$480 + \$0 = \$480\)

Now, we compare the total revenues:
- Thursday's revenue: \$520
- Friday's revenue: \$480

The difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday is:

   Each box weighs 15 pounds. To find the maximum number of boxes, divide the maximum allowable weight for the boxes by the weight of one box.

   \[
   \text{Maximum number of boxes} = \left\lfloor \frac{1245}{15} \right\rfloor
   \]

   Perform the division:

   \[
   \frac{1245}{15} = 83
   \]

   Since 83 is an integer, the number of boxes is exactly 83.

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes which can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is:

\[
\boxed{83}

"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries after all the additional fees, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the original total of $40.00.
2. Add the 25% delivery fee to the original total.
3. Add the $3.00 delivery fee.
4. Add the $4.00 tip.

First, calculate the 25% delivery fee on the original total:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } \$40.00 = 0.25 \times \$40.00 = \$10.00 \]

Next, add the 25% delivery fee to the original total:
\[ \$40.00 + \$10.00 = \$50.00 \]

Then, add the $3.00 delivery fee:
\[ \$50.00 + \$3.00 = \$53.00 \]

"First, let's break down the information given:

- Total number of oranges = 25
- Number of bad oranges = 1
- Number of unripe oranges = 20% of 25 = 0.20 * 25 = 5
- Number of sour oranges = 2

To find the number of good oranges, we need to subtract the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges from the total number of oranges.

Number of good oranges = Total number of oranges - (Number of bad oranges + Number of unripe oranges + Number of sour oranges)
Number of good oranges = 25 - (1 + 5 + 2)
Number of good oranges = 25 - 8
Number of good oranges = 17

The final numerical answer is 17."
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the brooch before insurance. The cost of the material is $500 and the cost of the jeweler is $800. Adding these together gives:

\[ 500 + 800 = 1300 \]

"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of working, we need to break down the calculation into two parts: the first 20 years and the next 10 years.

1. **First 20 years:**
   - Marcy earns a fixed annual pension of $50,000.
   - For 20 years, the total pension amount is:
     \[
     20 \times 50,000 = 1,000,000
     \]

2. **Next 10 years:**
   - Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.
   - The value of the pension at the start of the 21st year is $1,000,000.
   - The annual pension for the next 10 years is 5% of $1,000,000:
     \[
     0.05 \times 1,000,000 = 50,000
     \]

Since Marcy quits after 30 years, she will receive the pension for the first 20 years at $50,000 per year and then for the next 10 years at $50,000 per year.

Therefore, her annual pension after 30 years is:
\[
50,000

"First, let's calculate the amount of potato salad that the adults will eat. Since each adult eats 10 lbs of potato salad, and there are 20 adults, the total amount of potato salad for the adults is:

\[ 20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ lbs/adult} = 200 \text{ lbs} \]

Next, let's calculate the amount of potato salad that the children will eat. Since each child eats half as much as an adult, each child eats:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ lbs}}{2} = 5 \text{ lbs/child} \]

With 5 children, the total amount of potato salad for the children is:

\[ 5 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ lbs/child} = 25 \text{ lbs} \]

Now, we add the total amount of potato salad needed for the adults and the children:

\[ 200 \text{ lbs} + 25 \text{ lbs} = 225 \text{ lbs} \]

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 225 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of pets each person has based on the information provided.

1. Cindy has 4 pets.
2. Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy. Therefore, Marcia has \(4 + 2 = 6\) pets.
3. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia. Therefore, Jan has \(3 \times 6 = 18\) pets.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pets the three have together:
\[ \text{Total pets} = \text{Cindy's pets} + \text{Marcia's pets} + \text{Jan's pets} = 4 + 6 + 18 = 28 \]

The final numerical answer is 28."
"To solve this problem, let's define the ages of the kids using variables:

- Let \( J \) be Jackson's age.
- Then Amy's age is \( J + 5 \) (since Amy is 5 years older than Jackson).
- Corey's age is \( J + 5 + 2 = J + 7 \) (since Amy is 2 years younger than Corey).
- James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey's age is \( 10 + 1 = 11 \).

Since Corey's age is \( J + 7 \) and we know Corey's age is 11, we can set up the equation:
\[ J + 7 = 11 \]

Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 11 - 7 \]
\[ J = 4 \]

So, Jackson is 4 years old.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine how long it takes Lee to run the 400-meter hurdles. According to the problem, Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.

Since Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald would run it, we can calculate Gerald's original time as follows:
\[ \text{Gerald's original time} = \text{Lee's time} + 2 \]
\[ \text{Gerald's original time} = 38 + 2 = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, Gerald improved his speed by 10%. To find out how much faster Gerald can now run, we calculate 10% of his original time:
\[ \text{Improvement} = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, with his improved diet, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in:
\[ \text{Gerald's improved time} = \text{Gerald's original time} - \text{Improvement} \]
\[ \text{Gerald's improved time} = 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of dogs:**
   The number of dogs is given as 60.

2. **Determine the number of cats:**
   Since there are two cats for every dog, the number of cats can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Number of cats} = 2 \times \text{Number of dogs} = 2 \times 60 = 120
   \]

3. **Calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:**
   \[
   \text{Combined number of dogs and cats} = \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of cats} = 60 + 120 = 180
   \]

4. **Determine the number of rabbits:**
   The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. Therefore:
   \[
   \text{Number of rabbits} = \text{Combined number of dogs and cats} - 12 = 180 - 12 = 168
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of pets:**
   \[
   \text{Total number of pets} = \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of cats} + \text{Number of rabbits} = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348

The total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348."
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in Grade 5.

Given that 2/5 of the 200 students are boys, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:
\[ \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

Since the total number of students is 200, the number of girls can be calculated by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. According to the problem, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout:
\[ \text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find the number of girls who are not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[ \text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40 \]

Therefore, the number of girls not in the girl scout is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"To find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we first need to calculate how many hours James slept. Since James slept only \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what Harry slept, we can calculate the hours James slept as follows:

\[ \text{Hours James slept} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 \]

Let's calculate this value.
```python
# Calculate the hours James slept
hours_james_slept = (2/3) * 9
hours_james_slept
```
```output
6.0
```
James slept 6 hours last night.

Now, to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we subtract the hours James slept from the hours Harry slept:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Hours Harry slept} - \text{Hours James slept} \]

Let's calculate this difference.
```python
# Calculate the difference in hours slept
hours_difference = 9 - hours_james_slept
hours_difference

"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the volume of tomatoes before cooking.
2. Calculate the number of tomatoes based on the volume before cooking.

First, we know that the final volume of the sauce is 32 ounces, and this volume is half the volume of the tomatoes before cooking. Therefore, the volume of the tomatoes before cooking was:
\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we know that each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes. To find out how many 16-ounce cans were used, we divide the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of one can:
\[ \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/can}} = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes used is:
\[ 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes/can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Thus, the number of tomatoes Freda used is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Initially, there were 30 cars on the motorway.
- 5 cars exited the motorway, so the number of cars remaining on the motorway after the exits is \(30 - 5 = 25\) cars.
- In the remaining 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through the traffic jam.
- Let \(x\) be the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes.

Since the 25 cars remaining on the motorway after the exits are the ones that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes plus the 20 cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes, we can write the equation:

\[x + 20 = 25\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[x = 25 - 20\]
\[x = 5\]

So, 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

"First, let's determine the total number of potted plants Mary currently has. She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so:

\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Next, Mary will give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges tomorrow. Therefore, she will give away:

\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

To find out how many potted plants Mary will remain with, we subtract the number of plants she will give away from the number of plants she currently has:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

So, the final number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of doorbell rings made by each friend and then sum them up.

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. So, the second friend pressed the doorbell \(20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25\) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. So, the third friend pressed the doorbell \(60 + 10 = 70\) times.

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday. Therefore, the remaining pages he needs to read are:

Remaining pages = Total pages - Pages read on Monday
Remaining pages = 39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read, on average, in one day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days left:

Pages per day = Remaining pages / Number of days left
Pages per day = 24 / 4 = 6 pages

So, Solo needs to read, on average, 6 pages per day. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to break down his water consumption by weekdays and weekends.

First, let's calculate the number of glasses of water John drinks on a weekday:
- John drinks 1 glass of water with breakfast.
- John drinks 1 glass of water with lunch.
- John drinks 1 glass of water with dinner.
- John drinks 1 glass of water before bed.

So, on a weekday, John drinks:
\[ 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 \text{ glasses of water} \]

Since there are 5 weekdays in a week, the total number of glasses of water John drinks on weekdays is:
\[ 4 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ glasses} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of glasses of water John drinks on a weekend day:
- John drinks 1 glass of water with dinner.

So, on a weekend day, John drinks:
\[ 1 \text{ glass of water} \]

Since there are 2 weekend days in a week, the total number of glasses of water John drinks on weekends is:
\[ 1 \text{ glass/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 2 \text{ glasses} \]

Now, we add the total glasses of water consumed on weekdays and weekends to find the total for the week:

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to determine the inner dimensions of a single box and then calculate its volume. After that, we can multiply the volume of one box by 3 to get the total inner volume of all 3 boxes.

The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, the inner dimensions of each box are:
- Length: 5 inches - 2 * 1 inch = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - 2 * 1 inch = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - 1 inch = 3 inches

The inner volume of one box is:
\[ \text{Volume} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} = 3 \times 4 \times 3 = 36 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:

"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry meant to bake as \( x \). According to the problem, he actually baked twice as many as he meant to, plus 15 more cookies. So, the number of cookies he actually baked is \( 2x + 15 \).

After baking, he drops 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \). We know that after dropping 5 cookies, he has a total of 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2x = 100 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 50 \]

So, Henry meant to bake 50 cookies. Since he actually baked twice as many as he meant to, plus 15 more, the number of cookies he baked last year is:
\[ 2 \times 50 + 15 = 100 + 15 = 115 \]

Therefore, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is \(\boxed{115}\)."

"To find the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we first need to calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups each of them ate.

For Beatrice:
- The width of her fruit roll-up is 2 roll-ups.
- The length of her fruit roll-up is 24 roll-ups.
- Therefore, the total number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice ate is \(2 \times 24 = 48\).

For Marcell:
- The width of his fruit roll-up is 3 roll-ups.
- The length of his fruit roll-up is 14 roll-ups.
- Therefore, the total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell ate is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

Next, we find the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by both:
- Total number of fruit roll-ups eaten = \(48 + 42 = 90\).

To find the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by both, we divide the total number of fruit roll-ups by the number of people (which is 2):

Thus, the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice is 45."
"First, let's determine the speed at which Julia rows the boat. It takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Therefore, her rowing speed is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{5 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes her to row the entire 64 seconds distance to the shore:

\[ \text{Time to row 64 seconds} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds/20 feet}} = \frac{64}{16} \times 20 = 4 \times 20 = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. To find out how much water the boat took on during the 80 feet row, we can set up the following proportion:

\[ \text{Water taken on} = \left( \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 80 \text{ feet} = \frac{2 \times 80}{10} = \frac{160}{10} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the leftover lumber Sasha has.

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 10 boards.
- Each board cost her $10.
- Total cost for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $10/board = $100.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 5 boards.
- Each board cost her $16.
- Total cost for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $16/board = $80.

The total cost of the leftover lumber is:
- Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the leftover lumber.

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 10 boards.
- She sells each board for the same price as when she bought them, which is $10.
- Total revenue from 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $10/board = $100.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 5 boards.
- She sells each board for the same price as when she bought them, which is $16.
- Total revenue from 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $16/board = $80.

The total revenue from selling the leftover lumber is:
- Total revenue = $100 + $80 = $180.

Now, let's calculate the profit.

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the ratio and the total quantities used. The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total number of parts in the ratio is \(7 + 13 = 20\).

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water. To find out how many teaspoons of sugar she used, we need to determine what fraction of the total 120 corresponds to the 7 parts of sugar in the ratio.

The fraction of the total that is sugar is \(\frac{7}{20}\). Therefore, the number of teaspoons of sugar used is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Number of teaspoons of sugar} = \frac{7}{20} \times 120
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[
\frac{7}{20} \times 120 = \frac{7 \times 120}{20} = \frac{840}{20} = 42
\]

So, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used is:

"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of vehicles initially counted by the customs officer.
2. Calculate the difference between the total number of vehicles after the second day and the initial number of vehicles.
3. Use the difference to find the number of containers imported on the second day.

Initially, the customs officer counted 2 containers, each with 5 vehicles:
\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles/container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

After the second day, the total number of vehicles became 30. Therefore, the number of vehicles added on the second day is:

   Four years later, Adrien's salary had increased by 40% from his initial salary. Therefore, his new salary is:
   \[
   40,000 \times 1.40 = 56,000
   \]

4. **Determine Lylah's salary four years later:**
   Since Lylah's salary increased simultaneously with Adrien's, and assuming the same percentage increase, Lylah's new salary is:
   \[
   30,769.23 \times 1.40 = 43,076.92 \approx 43,076.92
   \]

5. **Calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later:**
   Adding Adrien's and Lylah's new salaries:
   \[
   56,000 + 43,076.92 = 99,076.92
   \]

The total salary the two were receiving four years later is \(\boxed{99076.92}\)."

"To find out how many hours Sadie slept in total throughout the week, we need to calculate the hours she slept each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: Sadie slept 8 hours.
2. **Tuesday**: She slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.
3. **Wednesday**: She also slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.
4. **Thursday**: She slept 1 hour more than she did on Tuesday, so she slept \(6 + 1 = 7\) hours.
5. **Friday**: She slept 1 hour more than she did on Wednesday, so she slept \(6 + 1 = 7\) hours.
6. **Saturday**: She slept 1 hour more than she did on Thursday, so she slept \(7 + 1 = 8\) hours.
7. **Sunday**: She slept 1 hour more than she did on Friday, so she slept \(7 + 1 = 8\) hours.

Now, we sum up the hours she slept each day:
\[ 8 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 7 + 8 + 8 = 42 \]

So, the total number of hours Sadie slept in the week is 42.

"First, let's calculate the distance Rosie covers in the initial 3 hours at a speed of 10 miles per hour.

\[ \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time}_1 = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

After the initial 3 hours, Rosie runs at a speed of 5 miles per hour for the remaining time. The remaining time is:

\[ \text{Remaining time} = 7 \, \text{hours} - 3 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the distance Rosie covers in the remaining 4 hours at a speed of 5 miles per hour.

\[ \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed}_2 \times \text{Time}_2 = 5 \, \text{mph} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is the sum of the distances covered in both parts of her run.

\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} = 50 \, \text{miles} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many letters were already stamped when Jennie began her work.

1. Jennie has a pile of 60 letters needing stamps.
2. She puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps. Therefore, the number of letters she stamps is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
   \]
3. After stamping, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. This means that the number of letters that were already stamped when Jennie began plus the 20 letters she stamped equals 30. Let's denote the number of letters that were already stamped when Jennie began as \( x \). Therefore, we have:
   \[
   x + 20 = 30
   \]
4. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 30 - 20 = 10
   \]

So, the number of letters that were already stamped when Jennie began is 10.

"First, let's determine the cost of each type of fruit based on the given information:

1. Each pepper costs $15.
2. A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, so a watermelon costs \(3 \times 15 = 45\) dollars.
3. An orange costs 5 dollars less than what a watermelon costs, so an orange costs \(45 - 5 = 40\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the items Dillon is buying:

- The cost of 4 watermelons is \(4 \times 45 = 180\) dollars.
- The cost of 20 peppers is \(20 \times 15 = 300\) dollars.
- The cost of 10 oranges is \(10 \times 40 = 400\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost:

So, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is $880."
"To determine the hospital's profit from these visits, we need to calculate the revenue and the cost, and then find the difference between them.

First, let's calculate the total number of patient hours seen per day:
- The hospital sees 500 people a day.
- Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes, which is equivalent to 0.4 hours (since 24 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 0.4 hours).

Total patient hours per day = 500 people * 0.4 hours/person = 200 hours.

Next, let's calculate the revenue generated by the hospital:
- Doctors charge $150 per hour to the hospital.
- Total revenue from doctors = 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000.

Now, let's calculate the cost incurred by the hospital:
- The hospital charges patients $200 per hour.
- Total revenue from patients = 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000.

The profit is the total revenue from patients minus the total revenue from doctors:
- Profit = Total revenue from patients - Total revenue from doctors = $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

Thus, the hospital's profit from these visits is $10,000."

1. Determine how many miles Walt walked on Tuesday.
2. Calculate the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday.
3. Subtract the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday from the total miles walked from Monday to Wednesday to find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday.

First, we know that Walt walked 4 miles on Monday. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he did on Monday. Therefore, the number of miles he walked on Tuesday is:
\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday:
\[ 4 \text{ miles (Monday)} + 24 \text{ miles (Tuesday)} = 28 \text{ miles} \]

We know that the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. Therefore, the number of miles he walked on Wednesday is:

"Let's denote the number of queens as \( Q \), the number of baby bees as \( B \), and the number of worker bees as \( W \).

According to the problem:
1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so \( W = 2B \).
2. There are twice as many baby bees as queens, so \( B = 2Q \).
3. The total number of bees is 700, so \( W + B + Q = 700 \).

First, we can express \( W \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Q \):
- Since \( B = 2Q \), and \( W = 2B \), we can substitute \( B \) to get \( W = 2(2Q) = 4Q \).

Now we substitute \( W \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Q \) into the total number of bees equation:
\[ 4Q + 2Q + Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now that we know the number of queens \( Q \) is 100, we can find the number of baby bees \( B \) and worker bees \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]
\[ W = 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is \( 400 \).

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the nonfood items before tax:

- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

Total cost of nonfood items = $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $15

Next, we calculate the tax on the nonfood items. The tax rate is 10%, so the tax amount is:

Tax amount = 10% of $15 = 0.10 * $15 = $1.50

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of the nonfood items to get the final cost:

Final cost of nonfood items = $15 + $1.50 = $16.50

The cost of food items (milk, eggs, light bulbs, cups, and roach traps) is $15, and there is no tax on food items. Therefore, the total cost including tax is:

"To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of harvests John can have in a year.
2. Determine the total number of pineapples harvested based on the number of harvests.

First, since John harvests his pineapples every 3 months, we need to find out how many 3-month periods there are in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so:

\[ \text{Number of harvests in a year} = \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests} \]

Next, we know that John has 100 pineapples per hectare and he has 10 hectares of pineapple field. Therefore, the total number of pineapples per harvest is:

\[ \text{Total pineapples per harvest} = 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} \times 10 \text{ hectares} = 1000 \text{ pineapples} \]

Since John harvests 4 times a year, the total number of pineapples he can harvest in a year is:

\[ \text{Total pineapples in a year} = 1000 \text{ pineapples/harvest} \times 4 \text{ harvests} = 4000 \text{ pineapples} \]

"To determine how many bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours, we need to break down the information given and calculate step by step.

1. **Bees leaving the hive in the first 6 hours:**
   Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.

2. **Bees returning in the next 6 hours:**
   Debra sees \(\frac{1}{2}\) of the 30 bees return, which is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \text{ bees}
   \]

3. **Bees leaving the hive in the next 6 hours:**
   Debra sees twice as many bees leave as those that left in the first 6 hours. Since 30 bees left in the first 6 hours, twice that number is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ bees}
   \]

4. **Bee returns in the last 6 hours:**
   Every bee that left before the last 6 hours returns to the hive in this period. The total number of bees that left before the last 6 hours is the sum of the bees that left in the first 6 hours and the bees that left in the next 6 hours:
   \[

"First, we need to convert the distance from miles to feet because the speeds are given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance in feet:
\[ 3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet} \]

Tim's distance in feet:
\[ 2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each to reach home.

Time for Steve to reach home:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

Time for Tim to reach home:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

The winner is Steve, who takes 36 minutes to reach home. The loser is Tim, who takes 40 minutes to reach home. The difference in their waiting time at home is:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes} \]

   - Total cost for the unicycle = 1 unicycle * 1 tire/unicycle * $0.25/tire = $0.25.

Now, we sum up the total cost:
- Total cost = Cost for bicycles + Cost for tricycles + Cost for the unicycle
- Total cost = $2.50 + $2.25 + $0.25 = $5.00.

Therefore, Shawnda made $5.00 that day."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Carl buys:

"Let's denote the initial number of french fries in the pack as \( x \).

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
4. After the pigeons, the number of fries left is \( x - 14 - 7 - 9 = x - 20 \).
5. The raccoon then ate two thirds of the remaining fries, so it ate \( \frac{2}{3}(x - 20) \) fries, leaving \( \frac{1}{3}(x - 20) \) fries.
6. An ant then ate the last remaining french fry, leaving 5 fries.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{3}(x - 20) = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \):
\[ x - 20 = 15 \]
\[ x = 35 \]

Therefore, the initial number of french fries in the pack was 35.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 35 \]"
"To calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly class schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has three 1-hour classes each day. So, the total number of hours he spends on these days is:
\[ 3 \text{ days/week} \times 3 \text{ classes/day} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} = 9 \text{ hours/week} \]

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes each day. So, the total number of hours he spends on these days is:
\[ 2 \text{ days/week} \times 2 \text{ classes/day} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 8 \text{ hours/week} \]

Adding the hours from both sets of days gives the total number of hours he spends on classes each week:
\[ 9 \text{ hours/week} + 8 \text{ hours/week} = 17 \text{ hours/week} \]

Since there are 16 weeks in the semester, the total number of hours he spends attending classes in one semester is:
\[ 17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 272 \]"
"First, we need to convert all the lengths to the same unit for easier calculation. We will use inches for this problem.

- Each roll is 4 inches long, and Bill bakes 300 rolls. So, the total length of the rolls is:
  \[
  300 \text{ rolls} \times 4 \text{ inches/roll} = 1200 \text{ inches}
  \]

- Each croissant is 6 inches long, and Bill bakes 120 croissants. So, the total length of the croissants is:
  \[
  120 \text{ croissants} \times 6 \text{ inches/croissant} = 720 \text{ inches}
  \]

- Each baguette is 2 feet long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is:
  \[
  2 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 24 \text{ inches}
  \]
  Bill bakes 60 baguettes, so the total length of the baguettes is:
  \[
  60 \text{ baguettes} \times 24 \text{ inches/baguette} = 1440 \text{ inches}
  \]

Now, we add the lengths of all the baked goods together:
\[
1200 \text{ inches} + 720 \text{ inches} + 1440 \text{ inches} = 3360 \text{ inches}
\]

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[
3360 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 280 \text{ feet}
\]

So, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is:
\[
\boxed{280 \text{ feet}}

"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order to last for 2 months, we first need to calculate the total number of bananas required by all the apes in one month and then multiply that by 2.

- Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
- Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
- Baboons need 100 bananas per month.

So, the total number of bananas needed per month is:
\[ 200 \text{ (monkeys)} + 400 \text{ (gorillas)} + 100 \text{ (baboons)} = 700 \text{ bananas per month} \]

For 2 months, the total number of bananas needed is:
\[ 700 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 1400 \text{ bananas} \]

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order \(\boxed{1400}\) bananas to last for 2 months."
"To determine how far Blake and Kelly each run, we need to calculate the total distance each of them covers.

First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs:
- Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field.
- Each round trip is 200 yards (100 yards out and 100 yards back).
- Therefore, the total distance Blake runs is \(15 \times 200 = 3000\) yards.

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs:
- Kelly runs back and forth once to the 40-yard line and back, which is a total of 80 yards.
- She does this 34 times.
- Therefore, the total distance Kelly runs is \(34 \times 80 = 2720\) yards.

Now, we compare the distances:
- Blake runs 3000 yards.
- Kelly runs 2720 yards.

The difference in the distance they run is:
\[3000 - 2720 = 280\] yards.

The winner runs 280 yards farther than the loser. Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To find the water depth on Wednesday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the water depth on Tuesday.
2. Calculate the water depth on Wednesday based on the depth on Tuesday.

First, we know the depth of the water on Monday is 17 feet. On Tuesday, the depth increased by 7 feet. Therefore, the depth on Tuesday is:
\[ 17 + 7 = 24 \text{ feet} \]

Next, on Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. So, we calculate two thirds of 24 feet:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is:
\[ 16 \text{ feet} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many starfish Locsin caught. Anakin caught 10 starfish, and Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin:
\[ 10 - 5 = 5 \]
So, Locsin caught 5 starfish.

Next, let's determine how many sea horses Locsin caught. Anakin caught 6 sea horses, and Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin:
\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \]
So, Locsin caught 3 sea horses.

Now, let's determine how many clownfish Locsin caught. Anakin caught 3 clownfish, and Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin:
\[ 3 + 2 = 5 \]
So, Locsin caught 5 clownfish.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fish caught by Anakin:
\[ 10 \text{ (starfish)} + 6 \text{ (sea horses)} + 3 \text{ (clownfish)} = 19 \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of fish caught by Locsin:
\[ 5 \text{ (starfish)} + 3 \text{ (sea horses)} + 5 \text{ (clownfish)} = 13 \]

Finally, let's find the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:
\[ 19 + 13 = 32 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the price of the bag of marbles after each 2-month period, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months.

The original price of the bag of marbles is $20.

The price increase every two months is 20% of $20, which is:
\[ 20 \times 0.20 = 4 \]

So, the price after each 2-month period is the original price plus the increase:
\[ 20 + 4 = 24 \]

Since the price increases every two months, we need to determine how many 2-month periods are in 36 months:
\[ 36 \div 2 = 18 \]

This means the price will increase 18 times over 36 months. Each time the price increases by 4 dollars, we can calculate the new price after each increase. However, we can also use the formula for compound interest to find the price after 36 months:
\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} \times (1 + \text{Increase Rate})^{\text{Number of Periods}} \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 20 \times (1 + 0.20)^{18} \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \]

Now, we need to calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \):
\[ (1.20)^{18} \approx 10.488 \]

So, the final price is:
\[ 20 \times 10.488 \approx 209.76 \]

Therefore, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is approximately $209.76.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 209.76 \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of one red car. According to the problem, one red car costs $4.

Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and an action figure costs $5, the cost of 3 action figures is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]
Therefore, the doll costs $15.

Now, we know the cost of one red car is $4, and the doll costs $15. We need to find the total cost of all the toys:
- The cost of 5 red cars is:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \]
- The cost of 3 action figures is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]
- The cost of the doll is:
\[ 15 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost of all the toys:
\[ 20 + 15 + 15 = 50 \]

So, the total value of all the toys is $50."

Elvira's total budget is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost of the accessories from her budget:

Money left for clothing = €1500 - €509 = €991

So, the final numerical answer is €991."
"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit to make 15 Spanish flans, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs needed to make 15 flans.
   - Each flan requires 3 eggs.
   - Therefore, for 15 flans, the total number of eggs needed is \( 15 \times 3 = 45 \) eggs.

2. Determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit to collect 45 eggs.
   - Each babysitting session provides 9 eggs.
   - To find the number of babysitting sessions required, divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs provided per babysitting session: \( \frac{45}{9} = 5 \).

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit 5 times to collect enough eggs to make 15 Spanish flans.

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \). According to the problem, Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write the first equation as:
\[ S = 2B \]

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write the second equation as:
\[ (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \]
Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ B + S + 4 = 28 \]
Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get:
\[ B + S = 24 \]

Now we substitute the expression for \( S \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ B + 2B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's current age is 8, we can find Seth's current age using the first equation:
\[ S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is currently 16 years old. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"

The problem also states that Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has. This can be written as:
\[ J = 2E + 2 \]

Now, substituting the value of \( E \) into the equation:
\[ J = 2(8) + 2 \]
\[ J = 16 + 2 \]
\[ J = 18 \]

So, Jimmy has $18. The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total number of miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to consider his daily walking distance and the number of days in a week.

- From Monday to Friday, he walks 20 miles each day. So for 5 days, he walks \(20 \times 5 = 100\) miles.
- On Saturday and Sunday, he walks 10 miles each day. So for 2 days, he walks \(10 \times 2 = 20\) miles.

Adding these together, the total number of miles he walks in a week is \(100 + 20 = 120\) miles.

The final numerical answer is 120."
"First, let's determine the cost of each item:
- The cost of the hat is $25.
- The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat, so it is \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.
- The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket. The average is calculated as \(\frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50\) dollars.

Now, we add up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of one uniform:

The total age of the four birds is 51."
"First, let's calculate the amount Jessica needs to pay each month if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum.

For the student loans:
Minimum payment = $300
50% more than the minimum = $300 * 1.5 = $450

For the credit card:
Minimum payment = $200
50% more than the minimum = $200 * 1.5 = $300

For the mortgage:
Minimum payment = $500
50% more than the minimum = $500 * 1.5 = $750

Now, let's add up the monthly payments:
Total monthly payment = $450 (student loans) + $300 (credit card) + $750 (mortgage) = $1,500

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the total monthly payment by 12:
Total annual payment = $1,500 * 12 = $18,000

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel and cut each potato and then multiply by the total number of potatoes.

First, let's calculate the time to peel and cut one potato:
- Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
- Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

Convert the time to peel one potato to seconds for easier calculation:
- 1.5 minutes = 1.5 * 60 seconds = 90 seconds

Now, add the time to peel and cut one potato:
- Total time for one potato = 90 seconds (peeling) + 5 seconds (cutting) = 95 seconds

Next, calculate the total time for 60 potatoes:
- Total time = 95 seconds/potato * 60 potatoes = 5700 seconds

Finally, convert the total time from seconds to minutes:
- 5700 seconds = 5700 / 60 minutes = 95 minutes

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

The final numerical answer is 95 minutes."
"First, let's determine the total revenue from selling lemonade. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, so the revenue per gallon is:
\[ 20 \text{ glasses/gallon} \times \$0.50/\text{glass} = \$10/\text{gallon} \]

Next, we need to find out the total cost for each gallon. The cost for lemons and sugar per gallon is:
\[ \$3 \text{ (lemons)} + \$2 \text{ (sugar)} = \$5/\text{gallon} \]

The profit per gallon is the revenue minus the cost:
\[ \$10/\text{gallon} - \$5/\text{gallon} = \$5/\text{gallon} \]

Given that their total profit is $25, we can determine the number of gallons they sold:
\[ \text{Number of gallons} = \frac{\$25}{\$5/\text{gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost for the lemons they spent:

\[ \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \]

2. Car fuel: \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his salary
\[ \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \]

3. Total spent on rent and car fuel
\[ \text{Total spent} = 1500 + 2000 = 3500 \]

4. Remaining amount after rent and car fuel
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 6000 - 3500 = 2500 \]

5. Donation to charity: half of the remaining amount
\[ \text{Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \]

6. Remaining amount after donation
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \]

7. Expenses for his daughter and wife
\[ \text{Total expenses} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

"To determine the number of votes the loser received, we first need to calculate the number of votes the winner received.

The winner received \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total votes. Given that the total number of votes cast is 80, we can calculate the number of votes the winner received as follows:

\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80
\]

\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = 60
\]

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser received is the total number of votes minus the number of votes the winner received:

"Let's denote the number of white carnations Sandra ordered as \( w \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, so the number of red roses is \( 4w \).
2. Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which are five times the number of white carnations, so \( 200 = 5w \).

First, we solve for \( w \) using the equation \( 200 = 5w \):
\[
w = \frac{200}{5} = 40
\]

Now that we know \( w = 40 \), we can find the number of red roses:
\[
4w = 4 \times 40 = 160

"First, let's calculate the total time for the faster team to complete the race. Since each member of the faster team runs their leg in 55 seconds, the total time for the race is:

\[ 55 \text{ seconds/runner} \times 4 \text{ runners} = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time for the slower team to complete the race. The first runner takes 60 seconds, the second runner takes 57 seconds (3 seconds faster than the first), the third runner takes 54 seconds (3 seconds faster than the second), and the fourth runner takes 51 seconds (3 seconds faster than the third). The total time for the race is:

\[ 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, to find out how many seconds the faster team will win by, we subtract the total time of the faster team from the total time of the slower team:

First, let's determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers on a six-sided die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Next, let's determine the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:
\[ P(\text{even on first roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also:
\[ P(\text{even on second roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of both events happening (rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll) is:
\[ P(\text{even on first and second roll}) = P(\text{even on first roll}) \times P(\text{even on second roll}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25 \]

Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. This is the difference in the probabilities divided by the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, and then expressed as a percentage.

The difference in probabilities is:
\[ 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 \]

To find how much more likely it is, we divide this difference by the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row and then convert it to a percentage:
\[ \frac{0.25}{0.25} \times 100\% = 100\% \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"If Jenna's mother picked 20 apples, and Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother, then Jenna picked:

\[ \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ apples} \]

\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ apples} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 30 \]"
"Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as \( r \).

From the information given:
- There are 3 cages of rats, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is \( 3 \times 6 \times r = 18r \).
- There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \).
- There are 20 pieces of straw distributed among the rabbits.

The total number of pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents is the sum of the pieces of straw given to the rats, the hamsters, and the rabbits. According to the problem, this total is 160 pieces. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 18r + 50 + 20 = 160 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 18r + 70 = 160 \]
\[ 18r = 160 - 70 \]
\[ 18r = 90 \]
\[ r = \frac{90}{18} \]
\[ r = 5 \]

So, the number of rats in each cage is \( 5 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"To determine how much Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to calculate the interest accrued over that period and then add it to the original amount owed.

The original amount owed is $100, and the monthly interest rate is 2%. Therefore, the interest for one month is:
\[ 100 \times 0.02 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the interest is compounded monthly, the interest for 3 months would be:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the interest to the original amount gives:
\[ 100 + 6 = 106 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Mandy should give Benedict $106.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 106 \]"
"Let's denote the number of bags of wheat as \( n \).

The cost per bag includes the purchase price and the transportation cost, which is \( 20 + 2 = 22 \) dollars per bag.

The total cost for \( n \) bags is \( 22n \) dollars.

The selling price per bag is $30, so the total revenue from selling \( n \) bags is \( 30n \) dollars.

The trader made a total profit of $400, so the profit can be expressed as the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ 30n - 22n = 400 \]
\[ 8n = 400 \]
\[ n = \frac{400}{8} \]
\[ n = 50 \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 50 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food:

- The cost of the tickets is $20.25.
- The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, so it is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

Next, we add the cost of the tickets and the cost of the food to find the total cost of the tickets and food:

- Total cost of tickets and food = $20.25 + $15.75 = $36.00.

Now, we add the cost of the rides. They went on 2 rides, each costing $33:

- Total cost of rides = 2 rides * $33/ride = $66.00.

Now, we add the cost of the tickets, food, and rides to find the total cost:

- Total cost = $36.00 (tickets and food) + $66.00 (rides) = $102.00.

Since they agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:

- Each person's share = $102.00 / 3 = $34.00.

So, each of them paid $34.00."
"To determine the total number of peaches John collects, we need to calculate the product of the number of minutes he works and the number of peaches he collects per minute.

"To determine how many pounds of insects the flock of ten ducks need per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of insects needed per day for one duck.
2. Multiply the daily amount needed for one duck by the number of ducks in the flock.

First, we know that the total amount of insects needed per week for one duck is 3.5 pounds. There are 7 days in a week, so the amount of insects needed per day for one duck is:
\[ \frac{3.5 \text{ pounds}}{7 \text{ days}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per day} \]

Next, since there are ten ducks in the flock, the total amount of insects needed per day for the flock is:
\[ 0.5 \text{ pounds per day per duck} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 5 \text{ pounds per day} \]

So, the total number of pounds of insects needed per day for the flock of ten ducks is:
\[ 5 \text{ pounds per day} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the net increase in trees each year.
2. Determine the number of trees after 10 years without considering the trees that die.
3. Calculate the number of trees that die after 10 years.
4. Subtract the number of dead trees from the total number of trees after 10 years.

**Step 1: Net increase in trees each year**
Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year.
Net increase per year = 10 - 2 = 8 trees.

**Step 2: Number of trees after 10 years without considering the trees that die**
Starting with 50 trees, after 10 years, the number of trees would be:
\[ 50 + 8 \times 10 = 50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees} \]

**Step 3: Number of trees that die after 10 years**
30% of the trees die after 10 years.
Number of trees that die = 30% of 130 = 0.30 * 130 = 39 trees.

**Step 4: Number of trees left after 10 years**
Subtract the number of dead trees from the total number of trees after 10 years.
\[ 130 - 39 = 91 \text{ trees} \]

The final number of trees Tom has left after 10 years is:
\[ \boxed{91} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Placement on Friday:**
   - Sue's front yard starts with 18 pink plastic flamingos.

2. **Action on Saturday:**
   - The neighbors take back one third of the flamingos.
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
   - The neighbors take back 6 pink flamingos and paint them white.
   - The number of flamingos left on Sue's front yard is \( 18 - 6 = 12 \).
   - The neighbors then put the 6 white flamingos back out.

3. **Placement on Sunday:**
   - The neighbors add another 18 pink plastic flamingos.
   - The total number of flamingos on Sue's front yard is now \( 12 \text{ (remaining pink)} + 18 \text{ (new pink)} = 30 \).

4. **Counting the Flamingos:**
   - Pink flamingos: 30
   - White flamingos: 6

5. **Difference Calculation:**
   - The difference between the number of pink flamingos and white flamingos is \( 30 - 6 = 24 \).

Therefore, at noon on Sunday, there are 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the cost of a pencil and an eraser combined. A pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30. Therefore, the combined cost of a pencil and an eraser is:

\[ 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50 \]

Since a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined, a pen costs $1.50.

To find out how much 8 pens will cost, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8:

\[ 1.50 \times 8 = 12.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we first need to calculate the total amount of carrots that will be distributed to the 40 restaurants.

Each restaurant receives 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. Therefore, the total amount of carrots distributed is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds/restaurant} \times 40 \text{ restaurants} = 80 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of carrots available is 200 pounds. To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we subtract the total amount distributed from the total amount available:
\[ 200 \text{ pounds} - 80 \text{ pounds} = 120 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To find the number of children in the city of Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

Total population = 23786
Number of men = 8417
Number of women = 9092

Number of children = Total population - (Number of men + Number of women)

Let's calculate the number of children:

Number of children = 23786 - (8417 + 9092)
Number of children = 23786 - 17509

"To find out how many Pokemon cards Elaine has now, we need to calculate the number of cards she collected each month and then sum them up.

1. **Initial number of cards**: Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.
2. **First month collection**: She collected three times the number of cards she initially had.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ cards}
   \]
3. **Second month collection**: She collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40 \text{ cards}
   \]
4. **Third month collection**: She collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months.
   \[
   2 \times (60 + 40) = 2 \times 100 = 200 \text{ cards}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the cards collected over the three months to find the total number of cards Elaine has now:
\[
20 \text{ (initial)} + 60 \text{ (first month)} + 40 \text{ (second month)} + 200 \text{ (third month)} = 320 \text{ cards}

"First, let's determine how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher each week. Since he edits an equal number of sentences each week for both publishers and a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B.

Next, we know that Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, the amount Mark earns from Publisher A each week is:
\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays Mark:
\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10 \text{ cents/sentence} \]
Therefore, the amount Mark earns from Publisher B each week is:
\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

To find out how much Mark makes in a week in total, we add the amounts from both publishers:
\[ 2500 \text{ cents} + 5000 \text{ cents} = 7500 \text{ cents} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 7500 \]"
"To determine the total amount of water Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the water he gets in the morning and the afternoon separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the water Baldur gets in the morning:
- He gets 5 pails of water every morning.
- Each pail contains 5 liters of water.

So, the total water from the morning is:
\[ 5 \text{ pails} \times 5 \text{ liters/pail} = 25 \text{ liters} \]

Next, we calculate the water Baldur gets in the afternoon:
- He gets 6 pails of water every afternoon.
- Each pail contains 5 liters of water.

So, the total water from the afternoon is:
\[ 6 \text{ pails} \times 5 \text{ liters/pail} = 30 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we sum the water from the morning and the afternoon to find the total amount of water Baldur gets every day:

"To calculate how much money John made that year after winning the award, we need to consider both the one-time monetary reward and the annual raise in his salary.

First, let's calculate the annual raise in his salary:
- John's current weekly salary is $2000.
- The raise is 5% of his weekly salary.
- The raise amount per week is \(2000 \times 0.05 = 100\).
- Therefore, his new weekly salary after the raise is \(2000 + 100 = 2100\).
- The annual raise is \(100 \times 52 = 5200\).

Next, let's calculate his total earnings for the year before the award:
- John earns $2000 per week.
- There are 52 weeks in a year.
- So, his total earnings before the award are \(2000 \times 52 = 104000\).

Now, let's add the one-time monetary reward of $5000 to his total earnings:
- His total earnings for the year after winning the award are \(104000 + 5000 = 109000\).

"To determine the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to break down the problem into parts and calculate each part step by step.

1. **Sandwiches for lunch:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 5 days.
   - Each sandwich uses 2 slices of cheese.
   - Total slices of cheese used for sandwiches = \(5 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 10 \text{ slices}\).

2. **Omelets for breakfast:**
   - Carl ate omelets 3 days in the week.
   - Each omelet uses 1 more slice of cheese than a sandwich, so each omelet uses \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices of cheese.
   - Total slices of cheese used for omelets = \(3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices}\).

3. **Macaroni and cheese dish:**
   - Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese to last him several dinners for the week and used 8 slices of cheese in it.

"To find the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the sum of the first five test scores.
2. Determine the total sum of the six test scores needed to achieve an average of 93.
3. Find the score required on the sixth test by subtracting the sum of the first five test scores from the total sum needed.

First, let's calculate the sum of the first five test scores:
\[ 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 440 \]

Next, we need to find the total sum of the six test scores that would give an average of 93:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total Sum of Six Tests}}{6} = 93 \]
\[ \text{Total Sum of Six Tests} = 93 \times 6 = 558 \]

Now, we can find the score required on the sixth test by subtracting the sum of the first five test scores from the total sum needed:

"To determine the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then sum them up.

First, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams. Since there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we need to find the weight of each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ grams} \]

With 80 candied apples, the total weight of the candied apples is:
\[ 80 \times 20 = 1600 \text{ grams} \]

Now, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to get the total weight of the bag of candy:

The total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is \(\boxed{76}\)."
"First, let's break down the problem into smaller parts.

1. **Calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Half a dozen plates means 6 plates.
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 6 plates is \(6 \times 6000 = 36000\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the cost of 20 dozen cups:**
   - 20 dozen cups means \(20 \times 12 = 240\) cups.
   - According to the problem, the cost of 20 dozen cups is $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
   - The total cost of half a dozen plates is $36000.
   - Therefore, the cost of 20 dozen cups is \(36000 - 1200 = 34800\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the cost of each cup:**
   - The cost of 240 cups is $34800.
   - Therefore, the cost of each cup is \(\frac{34800}{240}\).

Now, let's perform the final calculation for the cost of each cup.
```python
# Given values
total_cost_half_dozen_plates = 36000
cost_difference = 1200
number_of_cups = 240

# Calculate the cost of each cup
cost_per_cup = (total_cost_half_dozen_plates - cost_difference) / number_of_cups
cost_per_cup
```
```output
Done
```
The cost of each cup is \(\frac{34800}{240} = 145\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, let's determine how much money Sara earns from babysitting and mowing the lawn:
- Sara earns $5 each time she babysits, and she babysits 4 times, so she earns \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars from babysitting.
- Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, and we need to find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to afford the $70.

Let's denote the number of times Sara needs to mow the lawn as \(x\). The total amount of money Sara will have after mowing the lawn is the sum of the money she already has and the money she earns from mowing the lawn:
\[10 + 4x\]

We need this total to be at least $70 to afford the jacket and shoes:
\[10 + 4x \geq 70\]

Subtract 10 from both sides to isolate the term with \(x\):
\[4x \geq 60\]

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \(x\):
\[x \geq 15\]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn at least 15 times to afford the jacket and shoes. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \). According to the problem, the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs every day. Additionally, it is given that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which can be expressed as:

\[ w = r + 2 \]

The total number of eggs collected each day can be expressed as:

\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Now, substitute \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation \( 3r + 5w = 42 \):

\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens. To verify, we can calculate the number of white chickens and the total number of eggs:

\[ w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \]
\[ 3r + 5w = 3(4) + 5(6) = 12 + 30 = 42 \]

The calculations confirm that the total number of eggs collected is indeed 42. Therefore, the number of red chickens Jerry has is:

\[
\boxed{4}

"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. He walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \( t \) it takes to walk a certain distance \( d \) at a speed \( v \) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Here, the distance \( d \) is 15 miles and the speed \( v \) is 3 miles per hour:

\[ t = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park. The final numerical answer is:

2. Calculate the total number of customers over the three days.
3. Find the number of customers on the third day by subtracting the total number of customers on the first and second days from the total number of customers over the three days.

First, we know that on the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than on the first day. Therefore, the number of customers on the second day is:
\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \]

Next, we know the total number of customers over the three days is 500. To find the number of customers on the third day, we subtract the number of customers on the first and second days from the total number of customers over the three days:
\[ 500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250 \]

So, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons.

From the problem, we know that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Since each pool loses 4 gallons per minute due to the leak, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
Simplifying this equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ B = 2S + 16 \]

Now, we know that the current amount of water in the big pool is four times the current amount of water in the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have two equations:
1. \( B = 2S + 16 \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

We can set these two equations equal to each other:
\[ 2S + 16 = 4S \]
Solving for \( S \):
\[ 16 = 2S \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool currently has 8 gallons of water. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of her purchase.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

So, the total cost of the purchase is $352.00. Lori earns $8.00 per hour at her part-time job. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44.00 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 44 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She promised to return the original $2000 plus an additional 10% of that amount.

The additional amount is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she promised to return is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Janeth is paying $165 per month for 12 months. The total amount she will pay over 12 months is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we need to find out how much of the total amount she promised to return she has paid after 12 months. This is $1980. Therefore, her remaining balance is:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance by the end of 12 months is:
\[ 220 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 220 \]"
"There are 4 roses in the vase. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, there are 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias. The total number of flowers in the vase is the sum of the roses and dahlias, which is 4 + 11 = 15.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack, and then find their average age in three years.

1. **Determine Harriet's current age:**
   Harriet is currently 21 years old.

2. **Determine Zack's current age:**
   Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, we can calculate Zack's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. **Determine Adrian's current age:**
   Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age:
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years old}
   \]

4. **Calculate their ages in three years:**
   - Harriet's age in three years: \(21 + 3 = 24\)
   - Zack's age in three years: \(42 + 3 = 45\)
   - Adrian's age in three years: \(63 + 3 = 66\)

5. **Calculate the average age of the three in three years:**
   \[
   \text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Harriet's age in three years} + \text{Zack's age in three years} + \text{Adrian's age in three years}}{3} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna, and then use the total points to find Jojo's score.

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. So, Yuri's score is:
   \[
   \text{Yuri's score} = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44
   \]
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna's score is:
   \[
   \text{Brianna's score} = 68 + 17 = 85
   \]

Now, we know the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[
\text{Total points by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna} = 68 + 44 + 85 = 197
\]

The total points scored by all four students is 251. Therefore, Jojo's score is:
\[
\text{Jojo's score} = 251 - 197 = 54

"To determine the total time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles and the time spent on sudoku puzzles separately, and then sum these times.

First, we calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
- It takes Carmen 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles.
- Therefore, the total time spent on crossword puzzles is \(10 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 3 \text{ puzzles} = 30 \text{ minutes}\).

Next, we calculate the time spent on sudoku puzzles:
- It takes Carmen 5 minutes to finish one sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 sudoku puzzles.
- Therefore, the total time spent on sudoku puzzles is \(5 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 8 \text{ puzzles} = 40 \text{ minutes}\).

Finally, we sum the time spent on both puzzles:
- Total time spent = time spent on crossword puzzles + time spent on sudoku puzzles.
- Total time spent = \(30 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 70 \text{ minutes}\).

The final numerical answer is 70."
"Initially, the tank has 120 liters of water. Celine used 90 liters to water her garden, so the amount of water left in the tank is:

\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters} \]

Celine then collected rainwater that is twice the amount left in the tank. Since there are 30 liters left, the amount of rainwater collected is:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters} \]

Adding the collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank gives:

\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final amount of water in the tank is:

\[ 90 \text{ liters} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine the number of petunias Andy plants. Since he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, and he plants 90 geraniums, we can calculate the number of petunias as follows:

Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
Number of petunias = 90 - 40
Number of petunias = 50

Next, we need to find the total number of flowers planted by adding the number of geraniums and the number of petunias:

Total number of flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
Total number of flowers = 90 + 50
Total number of flowers = 140

So, the total number of flowers Andy plants is 140."
"To find the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years, we need to calculate the amount spent in the second year and then add it to the amount spent in the first year.

First, we calculate the amount spent on advertising in the second year. The company spends a third of the $15000 from the first year on advertising in the second year:

\[
\text{Amount spent in the second year} = \frac{15000}{3} = 5000
\]

Next, we add the amount spent in the first year to the amount spent in the second year to find the total amount spent over the two years:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 15000 + 5000 = 20000
\]

So, the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Travel by Bus:**
   - Andrew takes 6 days to travel by bus from New Jersey to Rochester.

2. **Travel by Car:**
   - It takes half as many days to travel by car from New Jersey to Rochester.
   - Therefore, the travel time by car is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) days.

3. **Return Trip:**
   - Andrew plans to return from Rochester to New Jersey by car.
   - The travel time for the return trip by car is also 3 days.

4. **Total Travel Time:**
   - The total travel time for the round trip (New Jersey to Rochester by bus and back by car) is the sum of the travel times for each leg of the trip.
   - Total travel time = 6 days (bus) + 3 days (car) + 3 days (car) = 12 days.

"First, let's calculate the total number of cards James has after the changes:

- Initial fire type cards: 30
- Initial grass type cards: 20
- Initial water type cards: 40

After losing 8 water type cards:
- Water type cards left: 40 - 8 = 32

After buying 14 new grass type cards:
- Grass type cards now: 20 + 14 = 34

Now, the total number of cards James has is:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 34
- Water type: 32

So, the total number of cards is:
30 + 34 + 32 = 96

The number of water type cards left is 32. To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 = 0.3333 \times 100 = 33.33\% \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33%.

"First, let's determine how many pieces Kalinda and her mom can place together in one minute.

Kalinda places 4 pieces per minute.
Her mom places half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

Together, they can place \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces per minute.

The puzzle has 360 pieces. To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can place together per minute:

\[ \text{Time in minutes} = \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \text{Time in hours} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many watermelons were ready for harvest after the first two months. Since 30% of the 120 watermelons were ready, we calculate:

\[ 120 \times 0.30 = 36 \]

So, Ashlyn took home 36 watermelons. This means the number of watermelons remaining after she took home the first batch is:

\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest two weeks later. Since 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready, we calculate:

\[ 84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 63 \]

This means 63 watermelons were ready for harvest two weeks later. Therefore, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:

\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

"First, let's calculate the cost of the cars before tax and registration fees. Each car costs $20,000, and Mark buys 12 cars.

\[ \text{Total cost of cars} = 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000 \]

Next, we calculate the tax on the cars. The tax rate is 10%.

\[ \text{Tax on cars} = 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000 \]

Now, we add the tax to the cost of the cars to get the total cost before registration fees.

\[ \text{Total cost before registration} = 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000 \]

Then, we calculate the registration fees. Each car has a registration fee of $1,000, and Mark has 12 cars.

\[ \text{Total registration fees} = 12 \times 1,000 = 12,000 \]

Finally, we add the total cost before registration to the total registration fees to get the final amount Mark pays.

"First, let's determine how much Steve's girlfriend eats. Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, and Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, his girlfriend eats:

\[ \text{Steve's girlfriend's consumption} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ tomatoes per day} \]

Next, we calculate the total consumption per week. Since there are 7 days in a week, Steve eats:

\[ \text{Steve's weekly consumption} = 6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ tomatoes per week} \]

And his girlfriend eats:

\[ \text{Girlfriend's weekly consumption} = 3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ tomatoes per week} \]

So, together they eat:

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the process Ram uses to make new pens from the empty ones. Ram can make one full pen by mixing the ink from five empty pens. This means that for every five empty pens, he gets one new full pen.

Ram initially buys 25 pens. Since he can make one new pen from five empty pens, we can determine how many new pens he can make from the 25 empty pens he has initially:

\[ \text{Number of new pens} = \frac{25}{5} = 5 \]

After making these 5 new pens, Ram will have used up 25 empty pens, and he will have 5 new full pens. Now, he has 5 new full pens, and he can continue the process of making new pens from the empty ones. However, since the problem does not specify how many more pens he will use to make more new pens, we assume he will stop here because the question does not provide further information about additional empty pens.

Therefore, the total number of pens Ram will have is the initial 25 pens plus the 5 new pens he made:

\[ \text{Total pens} = 25 + 5 = 30 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 30 \]"

"First, let's calculate the number of students who went out through exit A. Since 30% of the students went out through exit A, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Students through exit A} = 1000 \times 0.30 = 300 \]

After students have left through exit A, the remaining number of students is:

\[ \text{Remaining students} = 1000 - 300 = 700 \]

Next, we calculate the number of students who went out through exit B. According to the problem, 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B:

\[ \text{Students through exit B} = 700 \times \frac{3}{5} = 420 \]

The number of students who went out through exit C is the rest of the students after those who went through exits A and B have left. Therefore, we subtract the number of students who went through exits A and B from the total number of students:

\[ \text{Students through exit C} = 700 - 420 = 280 \]

So, the number of students who went out through exit C is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of candies each person has and then find the difference between the number of candies John has and the number of candies James has.

First, let's find out how many candies Robert has. We know that John has twice as many candies as Robert and John has 54 candies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find the number of candies Robert has:

\[ \text{Number of candies Robert has} = \frac{\text{Number of candies John has}}{2} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Now that we know Robert has 27 candies, we can find out how many candies James has. We know that James has 6 more candies than Robert. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find the number of candies James has:

\[ \text{Number of candies James has} = \text{Number of candies Robert has} + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Next, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James. We know John has 54 candies and James has 33 candies. Therefore, we can calculate the difference as follows:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Number of candies John has} - \text{Number of candies James has} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

So, John has 21 more candies than James. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of pen pals Mike has left after stopping being pen pals with 2 of them. Initially, he had 5 pen pals, so after stopping being pen pals with 2, he has:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals} \]

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each pen pal sends:

\[ 2 \text{ letters/week} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 10 \text{ pages/week} \]

Since there are 3 pen pals, the total number of pages sent by all pen pals in a week is:

\[ 3 \text{ pen pals} \times 10 \text{ pages/pen pal/week} = 30 \text{ pages/week} \]

Mike responds to each of these 30 pages in kind, so he also writes 30 pages a week. Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, so the time he spends writing 30 pages is:

\[ 30 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin initially had 24 fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin had \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Now Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin as \(x\). After receiving \(x\) fries from Ginger, Griffin had \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, so Colby took \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. After Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries left.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
7. Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20

\[ 28 = 2 \times (2F) \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]

Solving for \( F \):
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ F = 7 \]

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

She requires 6 hours of makeup each day and needs it done 4 times a week. So, the weekly hours are:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ hours/week} \]

The movie takes 5 weeks to finish, so the total hours worked for the movie are:
\[ 24 \text{ hours/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ hours} \]

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 120 \text{ hours} \times \$250/\text{hour} = \$30,000 \]

After the movie is done, she gives Jean a 10% discount. The discount amount is:
\[ 10\% \times \$30,000 = 0.10 \times \$30,000 = \$3,000 \]

Therefore, the final amount Jean pays after the discount is:
\[ \$30,000 - \$3,000 = \$27,000 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$27,000 \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total amount Isabelle spent on the party supplies. We do this by adding up all the individual expenses:

\[
12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22 = 96
\]

Isabelle spent a total of $96 on the party supplies. Since she split the cost evenly with her two parents, the total cost is divided among three people. To find out how much each person paid, we divide the total cost by 3:

\[
96 \div 3 = 32
\]

Therefore, each person paid \(\boxed{32}\) dollars."
"First, we need to find the total weight of the onions. The chef bought 4 bags, and each bag weighs 50 pounds. So, the total weight is:

\[ 4 \text{ bags} \times 50 \text{ pounds per bag} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total cost. A pound of onions costs $1.50, so for 200 pounds, the cost is:

\[ 200 \text{ pounds} \times 1.50 \text{ dollars per pound} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the chef spent \(\boxed{300}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine how many cookies Sue's sister ate each day.

On Monday, her sister ate 5 cookies.
On Tuesday, her sister ate \( \frac{13}{5} = 2.6 \) cookies.

Next, we calculate how many cookies Sue ate each day.

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, so:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cookies} \]

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so:
\[ 2 \times 2.6 = 5.2 \text{ cookies} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate over the two days.

Sue's total cookies:
\[ 20 + 5.2 = 25.2 \text{ cookies} \]

Her sister's total cookies:
\[ 5 + 2.6 = 7.6 \text{ cookies} \]

Each cookie has 200 calories, so we calculate the total calories consumed by each.

Sue's total calories:
\[ 25.2 \times 200 = 5040 \text{ calories} \]

Her sister's total calories:
\[ 7.6 \times 200 = 1520 \text{ calories} \]

Finally, we find the difference in calories consumed:
\[ 5040 - 1520 = 3520 \text{ calories} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3520} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of students in the school. Since each class has 20 students and there are 3 classes, the total number of students is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

Given that the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the number of boys and girls in the school is:
\[ \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ boys and } 30 \text{ girls} \]

For the first class, there are 15 girls, so the number of boys in the first class is:
\[ 20 - 15 = 5 \text{ boys} \]

For the second class, there are 12 girls, so the number of boys in the second class is:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ boys} \]

Now, we need to find the number of boys in the third class. Since the total number of boys in the school is 30, the number of boys in the third class is:
\[ 30 - (5 + 8) = 30 - 13 = 17 \]

So, the number of boys in the third class is:
\[ \boxed{17} \]"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Previous Night's Kill:**
   - Wolves: 10
   - Cougars: 15

2. **Today's Kill:**
   - Let the number of cougars killed today be \( c \).
   - According to the problem, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, so the number of wolves killed today is \( 3c \).
   - Also, Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, so the number of cougars killed today is \( 15 - 3 = 12 \).

3. **Calculating Today's Wolves:**
   - Since today's number of cougars is 12, the number of wolves killed today is \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \).

4. **Total Animals Killed:**
   - Wolves killed: 10 (previous night) + 36 (today) = 46
   - Cougars killed: 15 (previous night) + 12 (today) = 27
   - Total animals killed: 46 (wolves) + 27 (cougars) = 73

The final numerical answer is 73."

"First, let's determine how many times Anne went down the water slide. Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Anne's rides} = \text{Mitchel's rides} - (\text{Mitchel's rides} \times 0.30) \]
\[ \text{Anne's rides} = 30 - (30 \times 0.30) \]
\[ \text{Anne's rides} = 30 - 9 \]
\[ \text{Anne's rides} = 21 \]

Next, we need to find out how many times Robert went down the water slide. Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne:

\[ \text{Robert's rides} = \text{Anne's rides} \times 4 \]
\[ \text{Robert's rides} = 21 \times 4 \]
\[ \text{Robert's rides} = 84 \]

So, Robert went down the water slide 84 times. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the total number of cows after Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows. Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, which totals:

\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows/stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows, so the total number of cows becomes:

\[ 200 \text{ cows} + 40 \text{ cows} = 240 \text{ cows} \]

Next, Mr. Sylas divides these 40 new cows equally among the 20 stalls. Each stall will get:

\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows/stall} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. Since each stall has 2 cows, 8 stalls will have:

\[ 8 \text{ stalls} \times 2 \text{ cows/stall} = 16 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total amount of money Brady has in his piggy bank, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and bill separately and then sum them up.

1. **Pennies**: Each penny is worth $0.01. Brady has 100 pennies.
   \[
   100 \text{ pennies} \times 0.01 \text{ dollars/penny} = 1 \text{ dollar}
   \]

2. **Nickels**: Each nickel is worth $0.05. Brady has 40 nickels.
   \[
   40 \text{ nickels} \times 0.05 \text{ dollars/nickel} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Dimes**: Each dime is worth $0.10. Brady has 20 dimes.
   \[
   20 \text{ dimes} \times 0.10 \text{ dollars/dime} = 2 \text{ dollars}

"First, we need to determine the total length of the redwood tree in feet, which is given as 200 feet.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the entire redwood tree before any damage. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can find the total weight by dividing the total length of the tree by the length of each section and then multiplying by the weight of each section.

\[
\text{Total weight of the tree} = \left(\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}}\right) \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 20 \times 400 = 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to account for the damage caused by the termites. The termites ate 30% of the tree's wood, which means 70% of the tree remains. We calculate the remaining weight of the tree as follows:

\[
\text{Remaining weight} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70 = 5600 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the final weight of the redwood tree is:

\[
\boxed{5600 \text{ pounds}}

"To calculate the total amount Nancy has to pay, we need to consider both the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee.

First, we calculate the cost of the overdue books. Nancy has 8 books overdue, and each book costs $0.50. So, the total cost for the books is:
\[ 8 \times 0.50 = 4.00 \]

Next, we add the flat fee for having at least one book overdue, which is $2.00. Therefore, the total amount Nancy has to pay is:
\[ 4.00 + 2.00 = 6.00 \]

So, the total amount Nancy has to pay is $6.00."
"Let's denote the number of apples Jamal has as \( J_a \) and the number of bananas Jamal has as \( J_b \).

From the information given:
1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, so if Andrea has 52 apples, then Jamal has \( 52 - 8 = 44 \) apples.
2. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so \( J_b = J_a + 4 \).
3. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so if Jamal has \( J_b \) bananas, then Andrea has \( \frac{J_b}{2} \) bananas. Since Andrea has 52 apples, we can use this to find the number of bananas Jamal has.

First, we know Jamal has 44 apples, so:
\[ J_b = 44 + 4 = 48 \]
This means Jamal has 48 bananas.

Now, we can find out how many bananas Andrea has:
\[ \text{Andrea's bananas} = \frac{J_b}{2} = \frac{48}{2} = 24 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits:
- Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas, so Andrea has \( 52 + 24 = 76 \) fruits.
- Jamal has 44 apples and 48 bananas, so Jamal has \( 44 + 48 = 92 \) fruits.

The total number of fruits is:
\[ 76 + 92 = 168 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 168 \]"
"To determine how many cups of flour Carla will need, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she plans to make and then determine the total amount of flour required based on the given ratio.

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, so the total number of cookies is:
\[ 36 + 30 = 66 \]

We know that 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies. To find out how many cups of flour are needed for 66 cookies, we can set up a proportion based on the given ratio:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{66 \text{ cookies}} \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 66 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} \]
\[ x = \frac{132}{12} \]
\[ x = 11 \]

Therefore, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow. The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we first need to calculate how many pennies are in two thirds of the 9,300 pennies.

The number of pennies in two thirds of the cup is:
\[ \text{Number of pennies} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9300 \]

Let's calculate this value.
```python
# Calculate the number of pennies in two thirds of the cup
number_of_pennies = (2/3) * 9300
number_of_pennies
```
```output
Done
```
The number of pennies in two thirds of the cup is 6200. 

Since each penny is worth $0.01, the total dollar amount in the stack is:
\[ \text{Total dollar amount} = 6200 \times 0.01 \]

Let's calculate this value.
```python
# Calculate the total dollar amount
total_dollar_amount = 6200 * 0.01
total_dollar_amount
```
```output
NameError: name '6200' is not defined

"First, let's calculate the total price of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

The selling price of the house is $350,000.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price:
\[ \text{Brokerage Fee} = 350,000 \times \frac{5}{100} = 350,000 \times 0.05 = 17,500 \]

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price:
\[ \text{Transfer Fee} = 350,000 \times \frac{12}{100} = 350,000 \times 0.12 = 42,000 \]

Now, let's calculate the total price of the house including both fees:
\[ \text{Total Price} = \text{Selling Price} + \text{Brokerage Fee} + \text{Transfer Fee} \]
\[ \text{Total Price} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500 \]

Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. To find out how much more the total price of the house is than her budget, we subtract her budget from the total price:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Total Price} - \text{Budget} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500 \]

The total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget."
"First, we need to calculate the transfer fees, which are 3% of the selling price of the house.

Transfer fees = 3% of $400,000 = 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000

Next, we calculate the brokerage fee, which is 5% of the selling price of the house.

Brokerage fee = 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000

Now, we add the transfer fees and the brokerage fee to find the total fees paid.

Total fees = Transfer fees + Brokerage fee = $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000

Mr. Tan also paid $250,000 to settle the remaining loan amount of the house.

Total expenses = Total fees + Loan payment = $32,000 + $250,000 = $282,000

Finally, to find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we subtract the total expenses from the selling price.

Net proceeds = Selling price - Total expenses = $400,000 - $282,000 = $118,000

The final numerical answer is $118,000."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes for the oil to heat up to 400 degrees. We know it takes 20 minutes to heat the oil to 300 degrees, and it then takes 40% longer to heat it to 400 degrees.

40% of 20 minutes is:
\[ 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the additional time needed to heat the oil to 400 degrees is 8 minutes. Therefore, the total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that it takes 5 minutes less time to cook the chicken than it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees. So, the cooking time is:
\[ 28 - 5 = 23 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees and the time it took to cook the chicken:
\[ 28 + 23 = 51 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken is:

"To calculate the total amount spent by the real estate agent on buying all the ads, we need to calculate the cost for the newspaper ads and the television ads separately, and then sum these amounts.

The cost for the newspaper ads is calculated as:
\[ \text{Cost of newspaper ads} = \text{Cost per newspaper ad} \times \text{Number of newspaper ads} \]
\[ \text{Cost of newspaper ads} = \$5 \times 50 \]
\[ \text{Cost of newspaper ads} = \$250 \]

The cost for the television ads is calculated as:
\[ \text{Cost of television ads} = \text{Cost per television ad} \times \text{Number of television ads} \]
\[ \text{Cost of television ads} = \$75 \times 15 \]
\[ \text{Cost of television ads} = \$1125 \]

Now, we sum the costs of the newspaper ads and the television ads to find the total amount spent:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of newspaper ads} + \text{Cost of television ads} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$250 + \$1125 \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$1375 \]

"To determine the total number of windows in John's houses, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum the results.

1. **Windows in Bedrooms:**
   - Each house has 3 bedrooms.
   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.
   - Therefore, the number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is \(3 \text{ bedrooms} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows}\).
   - Since John has 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms of both houses is \(6 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 12 \text{ windows}\).

2. **Additional Windows:**
   - Each house has an additional 4 windows not connected to bedrooms.
   - Therefore, the total number of additional windows in one house is 4.
   - For both houses, the total number of additional windows is \(4 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 8 \text{ windows}\).

3. **Total Windows:**
   - Adding the windows from the bedrooms and the additional windows gives us the total number of windows.
   - Total windows = windows in bedrooms + additional windows = \(12 + 8 = 20\).

Thus, the total number of windows between the houses is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"To find out how much change the cashier gives back, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items the mother bought. The items and their respective costs are:

- Cocoa: $4.20
- Laundry: $9.45
- Pasta: $1.35

First, we add these amounts together:

\[ 4.20 + 9.45 + 1.35 \]

Let's add these step by step:

\[ 4.20 + 9.45 = 13.65 \]
\[ 13.65 + 1.35 = 15.00 \]

So, the total cost of the items is $15.00. The mother pays with $20.00. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:

\[ 20.00 - 15.00 = 5.00 \]

Therefore, the change the cashier gives back is $5.00."
"First, let's determine the number of stitches for each part of the sweater:

- The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
- The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body, which is \( \frac{900}{10} = 90 \) stitches.
- The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is \( 2 \times 90 = 180 \) stitches.

Now, let's add up the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette:
\[ 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 \]

The total number of stitches for the whole sweater is 1800. Therefore, the number of stitches for the two sleeves combined is:
\[ 1800 - 1170 = 630 \]

Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches for each sleeve is:
\[ \frac{630}{2} = 315 \]

So, each sleeve takes 315 stitches. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 315 \]"
"First, we calculate the total cost for the tomato seeds. Mrs. Rylan bought 20 packets of tomato seeds, and each packet costs $40. Therefore, the total cost for the tomato seeds is:

"First, let's determine how many cards had the letter A on them. Since \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the cards had the letter A, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of cards with letter A} = \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \]

Next, we find out how many cards remained after removing the cards with the letter A:

\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 80 - 32 = 48 \]

Then, we calculate how many of these remaining cards had the letter B on them. Since \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the remaining cards had the letter B, we have:

\[ \text{Number of cards with letter B} = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]

Now, we find out how many cards remained after removing the cards with the letter B:

\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 48 - 24 = 24 \]

Next, we calculate how many of these remaining cards had the letter C on them. Since \( \frac{5}{8} \) of the remaining cards had the letter C, we have:

\[ \text{Number of cards with letter C} = \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \]

Finally, we find out how many cards had the letter D on them. This is the number of remaining cards after removing the cards with the letters A, B, and C:

\[ \text{Number of cards with letter D} = 24 - 15 = 9 \]

So, the number of cards that had the letter D on them is:

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To determine the total time Matthew will take to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we need to calculate the time for each type of hole separately and then sum them up.

First, calculate the time to dig 30 small holes:
- Time to dig one small hole = 3 minutes
- Time to dig 30 small holes = 3 minutes/hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes

Next, calculate the time to dig 15 large holes:
- Time to dig one large hole = 10 minutes
- Time to dig 15 large holes = 10 minutes/hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes

Now, sum the time for both types of holes:
- Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

Finally, convert the total time from minutes to hours:
- Total time in hours = 240 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours

The final numerical answer is 4 hours."
"To determine the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we can start by defining their current ages. Let's denote Mico's current age as \( M \) and Marco's current age as \( R \). According to the problem, the sum of their current ages is 20. This can be written as:

\[ M + R = 20 \]

In 10 years, Mico's age will be \( M + 10 \) and Marco's age will be \( R + 10 \). The sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

\[ (M + 10) + (R + 10) \]

We can simplify this expression by combining like terms:

\[ M + R + 10 + 10 = M + R + 20 \]

Since we know from the problem statement that \( M + R = 20 \), we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[ 20 + 20 = 40 \]

Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, which translates to \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. This can be written as \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

First, we substitute the expression for \( R \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Next, we expand and simplify the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old. To verify, we can calculate Ruby's current age:
\[ R = 6S = 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

In 9 years, Sam will be \( 6 + 9 = 15 \) years old, and Ruby will be \( 36 + 9 = 45 \) years old. Checking the condition that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
\[ 45 = 3 \times 15 \]
This is true, so our solution is correct.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, we calculate the cost of the popsicles. Peter purchased 20 popsicles at $0.25 each, so the total cost for the popsicles is:
\[ 20 \times 0.25 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the ice cream bars. Peter purchased 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each, so the total cost for the ice cream bars is:
\[ 4 \times 0.50 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the total amount Peter paid, we add the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars:
\[ 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Peter paid is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of spots a mamba has. Since a cobra has 70 spots and a mamba has half as many spots as a cobra, a mamba has:

\[ \text{Spots per mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and all the mambas. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, so the total number of spots for the cobras is:

\[ \text{Total spots for cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots, so the total number of spots for the mambas is:

\[ \text{Total spots for mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Now, we find the combined total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas:

\[ \text{Total spots combined} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of this combined total:

\[ \text{Half the number of spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 2450 \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of people who will be eating the pizza.

- There are 12 team members.
- There are 3 coaches.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so \(12 \text{ team members} \times 2 \text{ guests/team member} = 24 \text{ guests}\).

Adding these together, the total number of people is:
\[ 12 \text{ team members} + 3 \text{ coaches} + 24 \text{ guests} = 39 \text{ people} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Each pizza serves 3 people, so we divide the total number of people by the number of people each pizza can serve:
\[ \frac{39 \text{ people}}{3 \text{ people/pizza}} = 13 \text{ pizzas} \]

Each pizza costs $15, so the total cost for 13 pizzas is:
\[ 13 \text{ pizzas} \times 15 \text{ dollars/pizza} = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 195 \]"
"To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to calculate the total length used by the topaz gemstones and then find out how much space is left for the sterling silver beads.

1. **Calculate the total length used by the topaz gemstones:**
   - Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long.
   - Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace.
   - Therefore, the total length used by the topaz gemstones is:
     \[
     8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches}
     \]

2. **Calculate the remaining length for the sterling silver beads:**
   - The total length of the necklace is 25 inches.
   - The length used by the topaz gemstones is 8 inches.
   - Therefore, the remaining length for the sterling silver beads is:
     \[
     25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of sterling silver beads:**
   - Each sterling silver bead is 0.25 inches long.
   - The remaining length for the sterling silver beads is 17 inches.
   - Therefore, the number of sterling silver beads is:
     \[
     \frac{17 \text{ inches}}{0.25 \text{ inches/bead}} = 68 \text{ beads}
     \]

Thus, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace. The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot altogether, we need to calculate the number of stories each wrote in both weeks and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of stories each wrote in the second week:
- Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week and doubled that in the second week, so she wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories in the second week.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week and doubled that in the second week, so he wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories in the second week.
- Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week and doubled that in the second week, so she wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories in the second week.

Next, we sum up the total number of stories written by each of them over the two weeks:
- Alani wrote \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories in total.
- Braylen wrote \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories in total.
- Margot wrote \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories in total.

Finally, we add up the total number of stories written by all three:
\[60 + 120 + 180 = 360\]

So, the total number of stories they wrote altogether is \(\boxed{360}\)."
"First, we need to determine the current age of Ann's brother. Since Ann is 9 years old and her brother is twice her age, we can calculate her brother's age as follows:

\[ \text{Brother's current age} = 2 \times \text{Ann's age} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we need to find out how old her brother will be in 3 years. We do this by adding 3 years to his current age:

\[ \text{Brother's age in 3 years} = \text{Brother's current age} + 3 = 18 + 3 = 21 \]

So, Ann's brother will be 21 years old in 3 years. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we first need to calculate the total number of stars and then subtract the number of stars in the rows with 8 and 6 stars.

1. Calculate the total number of stars:
   - Three rows of 8 stars: \(3 \times 8 = 24\)
   - Two rows of 6 stars: \(2 \times 6 = 12\)
   - Let the number of rows of 5 stars be \(x\). Then the total number of stars is \(5x\).

2. The total number of stars on the flag is 76. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   24 + 12 + 5x = 76
   \]
   Simplify the left side:
   \[
   36 + 5x = 76
   \]
   Subtract 36 from both sides:
   \[
   5x = 40
   \]
   Divide both sides by 5:
   \[
   x = 8
   \]

So, the number of rows of 5 stars is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"First, we need to calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight of 80 flagstones is:

\[ 80 \times 75 = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how many trucks are required to transport 6000 pounds, given that each truck can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds. We do this by dividing the total weight by the capacity of one truck:

\[ \frac{6000}{2000} = 3 \]

Since the division results in a whole number, 3 trucks are needed to transport 6000 pounds. Therefore, the number of trucks needed is:

\[ 3 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"First, we need to determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, we can calculate the speed of the slow lane car as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of slow lane car} = \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it took the car in the fast lane to travel 480 miles. We can use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the fast lane:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{fast lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at a constant speed of 30 miles/hour and it is covering the same distance of 480 miles, we can calculate the time it took for the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance using the same formula:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{slow lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

\[ 16 \text{ hours} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Izzy's medals} = \text{Ali's medals} - 5 = 22 - 5 = 17 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:

\[ \text{Total medals of Ali and Izzy} = \text{Ali's medals} + \text{Izzy's medals} = 22 + 17 = 39 \]

According to the problem, the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out. This means that the total number of medals given out is 10 times the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have:

\[ \text{Total medals given out} = 10 \times \text{Total medals of Ali and Izzy} = 10 \times 39 = 390 \]

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is:

\[ \boxed{390} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available:

- Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars.
- There are 8 packets.

Next, let's determine how many chocolate bars the adults will get:

- There are 4 adults.
- Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars.

So, the total number of chocolate bars for the adults is:
\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars/adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, we can find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children:

\[ 40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

There are 8 children, and we need to distribute the remaining 16 chocolate bars equally among them:

"First, let's determine the total time Susan works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total time in minutes is:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Susan takes a 30-minute break, so the actual time she spends working is:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} - 30 \text{ minutes} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how much money Susan earns in 150 minutes. She earns $5 every 10 minutes. To find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes, we divide 150 by 10:

\[ 150 \text{ minutes} \div 10 \text{ minutes/interval} = 15 \text{ intervals} \]

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, the total amount of money she earns is:

"First, let's determine the initial points for each player:

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Next, we check if any of the players get an extra point in the fourth round. According to the rules, a player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points.

- Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so Mike gets an extra point.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so Jim does not get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so Tony gets an extra point.

Now, we add the extra points to their initial points:

- Mike's new total is \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
- Jim's new total remains \(18\) points.
- Tony's new total is \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

Finally, we calculate the total points for all three players:

\[22 + 18 + 43 = 83\]

The total points for all three players after the extra points had been distributed is \(\boxed{83}\)."

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day by the household.
2. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week by the household.
3. Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

First, let's calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day by the household. Since each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal and there are 5 members, and they eat rice at lunch and dinner, the total consumption per day is:
\[ 5 \text{ people} \times 0.2 \text{ kg/meal/person} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 2 \text{ kg/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week:
\[ 2 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ kg/week} \]

Now, we determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last:

"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target.

First, let's list the days he sold bread and the number of crates sold each day:
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates
- Over the weekend: 20 crates

Now, we sum the crates sold from Tuesday to Thursday and the crates sold over the weekend:
\[ 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 \]

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he did not sell any bread on those days. Therefore, the total number of crates sold in the week is 65.

Sam's target was to sell 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off by, we subtract the number of crates he sold from his target:
\[ 120 - 65 = 55 \]

"To calculate the total amount John pays for driving a year, we need to break down the costs into two parts: the cost per mile driven and the monthly bonus.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven in a year:
- John drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back, so he drives 60 miles each day.
- He goes to work 5 days a week, so he drives 60 miles * 5 days = 300 miles per week.
- He works 50 weeks a year, so he drives 300 miles * 50 weeks = 15,000 miles per year.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the miles driven:
- He is charged $2 per mile, so the cost for the miles driven is 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000.

Now, let's calculate the total bonus he gives his driver in a year:
- He gives a $150 bonus per month, so the total bonus for the year is $150 * 12 months = $1,800.

Finally, let's add the cost of the miles driven and the total bonus to find the total amount he pays in a year:
- Total cost = Cost of miles driven + Total bonus = $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the folding process and how the pages are printed.

1. **Folding the Paper**: When a piece of paper is folded vertically, it creates two layers. This means that each piece of paper can be used to print two pages.
2. **Printing Layout**: The pages are printed in a specific order: page 1 on the left back, page 2 on the left front, page 32 on the right back, and page 31 on the right front. This means that each piece of paper is used to print two pages, one on each side of the fold.

Since the tabloid is 32 pages long, we can calculate the number of pieces of paper needed as follows:
- Each piece of paper prints 2 pages.
- Therefore, for 32 pages, we need \( \frac{32}{2} = 16 \) pieces of paper.

So, the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid is 16.

1. **Determine the number of books sold in the first year:**
   - Elise sold 45 books this year.
   - She sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year.
   - Therefore, the number of books sold in the first year is \( 2 \times 45 = 90 \) books.

2. **Calculate the total number of books sold in the first two years:**
   - Total books sold in the first year: 90 books.
   - Total books sold in the current year: 45 books.
   - Total books sold in the first two years: \( 90 + 45 = 135 \) books.

3. **Determine the total number of books sold over the three years:**
   - Total books in the collection: 250 books.
   - Total books sold in the first two years: 135 books.
   - Total books sold in the third year: \( 250 - 135 = 115 \) books.

4. **Calculate the total number of books sold in the second year:**
   - Total books sold in the first two years: 135 books.
   - Total books sold in the third year: 115 books.
   - Total books sold in the second year: \( 135 + 115 = 250 - 135 - 45 = 60 \) books.

"To determine how much money Watson made in April, we need to calculate his earnings from his hourly wage and his weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate Watson's daily earnings:
- Watson works 10 hours a day.
- He earns $10 per hour.

\[ \text{Daily earnings} = 10 \, \text{hours/day} \times 10 \, \text{\$/hour} = 100 \, \text{\$/day} \]

Next, let's calculate his weekly earnings:
- Watson works 5 days a week.
- He earns $100 per day.

\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 100 \, \text{\$/day} \times 5 \, \text{days/week} = 500 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Since Watson received a $300 bonus each week if the company performed well, his total weekly earnings when the company performed well are:

\[ \text{Total weekly earnings} = 500 \, \text{\$/week} + 300 \, \text{\$/week} = 800 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Now, let's calculate his total earnings for the month of April. April typically has 30 days.

\[ \text{Number of weeks in April} = \frac{30 \, \text{days}}{5 \, \text{days/week}} = 6 \, \text{weeks} \]

\[ \text{Total earnings for April} = 800 \, \text{\$/week} \times 6 \, \text{weeks} = 4800 \, \text{\$} \]

Therefore, Watson made $4800 in April if the company performed very well for the whole month.

John beats 80% of the 20 people he arm wrestled. To find out how many people he beat, we calculate 80% of 20:

\[ 0.80 \times 20 = 16 \]

This means John beat 16 people. Since he competed against 20 people in total, the number of people he lost to is:

\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 4."
"First, let's determine how many loaves of bread are sold in the morning. Since two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning, we calculate:

\[
\text{Morning sales} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
\]

Next, we find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales:

\[
\text{Loaves left after morning} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
\]

In the afternoon and evening, half of the remaining loaves are sold equally. Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening combined is:

\[
\text{Afternoon and evening sales combined} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
\]

Since the loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[
\text{Afternoon sales} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ loaves}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{5}
\]"
"First, we need to determine how much weight Joey loses in one week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so the weight loss per week is:

\[ \text{Weight loss per week for Joey} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in 1 week, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds. Therefore, to lose the same amount of weight (2 pounds) that Joey loses in 1 week, Sandy will take:

\[ \text{Number of weeks for Sandy} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the savings on the ice cream. The original price of one tub of ice cream is $13, and it is now sold at $11. The discount per tub of ice cream is:

\[ 13 - 11 = 2 \]

So, the discount per tub of ice cream is $2. If you buy 2 tubs of ice cream, the total savings on the ice cream will be:

\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \]

Next, let's calculate the savings on the milk. The discount on one packet of milk is $0.5. If you buy 4 packets of milk, the total savings on the milk will be:

\[ 0.5 \times 4 = 2 \]

Now, we add the savings from the ice cream and the milk to find the total savings:

\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \]

So, the total amount saved if you buy 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine the number of new limbs Helena's serum will cause a person to grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and extra legs that grow based on the given growth rates.

1. **Extra Arms:**
   - The person grows an extra arm every 3 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of times an extra arm grows is calculated by dividing 15 by 3.
   \[
   \frac{15}{3} = 5
   \]
   So, the person grows 5 extra arms in 15 days.

2. **Extra Legs:**
   - The person grows an extra leg every 5 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of times an extra leg grows is calculated by dividing 15 by 5.
   \[
   \frac{15}{5} = 3
   \]
   So, the person grows 3 extra legs in 15 days.

3. **Total New Limbs:**
   - The total number of new limbs is the sum of the extra arms and extra legs.
   \[
   5 \text{ (extra arms)} + 3 \text{ (extra legs)} = 8 \text{ (total new limbs)}
   \]

Therefore, after fifteen days, Helena’s serum will cause a person to grow 8 new limbs."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
\[ 6 \text{ suits} \times \$100 \text{ per suit} = \$600 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
\[ 3 \text{ suitcases} \times \$50 \text{ per suitcase} = \$150 \]

Now, let's determine the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit:
\[ 5 \times \$100 + \$700 = \$500 + \$700 = \$1200 \]

Now, let's sum up the costs of the business suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket:
\[ \$600 + \$150 + \$1200 = \$1950 \]

The total amount Theo wishes to spend on his trip is $6000. He wants to save $2000 for the trip. Therefore, the amount he can spend on the trip, including gifts, is:
\[ \$6000 - \$2000 = \$4000 \]

To find out how much he has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners, we subtract the total cost of the business suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket from the amount he can spend on the trip:
\[ \$4000 - \$1950 = \$2050 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$2050 \]"
"To determine the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum up the results.

First, let's identify the number of people in the family and their daily egg consumption:
- There are 5 people in the family.
- 3 people eat 3 eggs each day.
- The remaining 2 people eat 2 eggs each day.

Calculate the daily egg consumption for the 3 people who eat 3 eggs each:
\[ 3 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ eggs/person/day} = 9 \text{ eggs/day} \]

Calculate the daily egg consumption for the 2 people who eat 2 eggs each:
\[ 2 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ eggs/person/day} = 4 \text{ eggs/day} \]

Now, add the daily egg consumption of both groups to find the total daily egg consumption:
\[ 9 \text{ eggs/day} + 4 \text{ eggs/day} = 13 \text{ eggs/day} \]

Next, calculate the total egg consumption for a week (7 days):
\[ 13 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 91 \text{ eggs} \]

Therefore, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week."

- Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn.
- Trent is 5 years older than Jane.

First, calculate Jane's age:
\[ \text{Jane's age} = \text{Quinn's age} - 3 = 30 - 3 = 27 \]

Next, calculate Trent's age:
\[ \text{Trent's age} = \text{Jane's age} + 5 = 27 + 5 = 32 \]

So, Trent is 32 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 32 \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the current population of Chile based on the given information. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera's current age is 46 years.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old six years ago.
   - Therefore, Noah's current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

2. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Let \(P\) be the current population of Chile.
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was \(P / 2\).

3. **Use the given information about the population six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times the age of Noah.
   - Six years ago, Noah was 20 years old.
   - Therefore, the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

4. **Set up the equation for the population six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was \(P / 2 = 60000\).

5. **Solve for the current population \(P\):**
   \[
   P / 2 = 60000
   \]
   \[
   P = 60000 \times 2
   \]
   \[
   P = 120000
   \]

The current population of Chile is \(\boxed{120000}\)."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining the terms on the left side:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 3D + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{6D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve for \( D \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 7:
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 30 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha initially invited:

- Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people.
- Martha invited 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people.

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we need to account for the people who couldn't come due to illness and those with previous commitments:

- 8 people couldn't come due to illness.
- 1/4 of the 8 people with illness had previous commitments, which is \(8 \div 4 = 2\) people.

Therefore, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Finally, the number of people who showed up for the party is the total number of people invited minus the number who couldn't come:

\[24 - 10 = 14\]

"First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is in the shape of a rectangular prism, and the volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth (height) = 5 feet

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 5 \]

Now, let's calculate the volume:

\[ V = 24 \times 5 = 120 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to determine the cost to fill the pool. The cost is given as $0.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = \text{Volume} \times \text{Cost per cubic foot} \]

Substituting the volume and the cost per cubic foot:

\[ C = 120 \times 0.1 \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost:

\[ C = 12 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

3. The number of nongendered children is \(\frac{1}{10}\) of the number of boys. Therefore, the number of nongendered children is \(\frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3\).

To find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children together:

\[ \text{Total children} = \text{Number of boys} + \text{Number of girls} + \text{Number of nongendered children} \]
\[ \text{Total children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 \]

So, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles.

The ratio 1:3 means for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires. If there are 45 electric wires, we can find the number of electric poles by dividing the number of wires by 3.

Let's calculate the number of electric poles:
\[
\text{Number of electric poles} = \frac{\text{Number of electric wires}}{3} = \frac{45}{3} = 15
\]

So, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

"First, let's determine the total number of people at the party at the beginning. There were 25 men and 15 women, so the total number of people was:

\[ 25 + 15 = 40 \]

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. Therefore, the number of people who left is:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

This means that the number of people who stayed at the party is:

\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \]

We are given that 22 men stayed at the party. Let's denote the number of women who stayed as \( W \). Since the total number of people who stayed is 30, we can write the equation:

\[ 22 + W = 30 \]

Solving for \( W \):

\[ W = 30 - 22 = 8 \]

So, the number of women who stayed at the party is 8. Therefore, the number of women who left is:

\[ 15 - 8 = 7 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine the total number of pencils Jam has. We know that Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. Let's denote the number of pencils in each box as \( x \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]

To find the value of \( x \), we solve the equation step by step:

1. Subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
   \[ 3x = 24 \]

2. Divide both sides by 3:
   \[ x = 8 \]

So, each box contains 8 pencils. Now, we can calculate the total number of pencils Jam has:

\[ 3 \times 8 + 2 = 24 + 2 = 26 \]

Jam has 26 pencils. Her sister Meg has 46 pencils. To find the total number of pencils they have together:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Next, we need to determine how many boxes are required to store all 72 pencils. Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to account for the weakening of the coffee due to the cooling and the addition of cream.

First, let's determine how many ice cubes Shannon uses to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we can calculate the number of ice cubes as follows:

\[ \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \]

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, the total weakening due to the ice cubes is:

\[ \text{Total weakening due to ice cubes} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters} \]

Next, we need to account for the weakening due to the addition of cream. The problem states that any added liquid weakens the coffee. Since Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, this adds an additional weakening of 15 milliliters.

Therefore, the total weakening of the coffee is the sum of the weakening due to the ice cubes and the weakening due to the cream:

\[ \text{Total weakening} = 60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters} \]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is \(\boxed{75}\) milliliters weaker when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream."
"If 5 people leave with 7 new records between them, and each person can trade 2 old records for 1 new record, then the total number of new records traded out is 7. Since each new record traded out comes from 2 old records, the total number of old records brought in is \(7 \times 2 = 14\).

The final numerical answer is 14."
"First, let's determine the number of junior and senior programmers.

Given that the total number of employees is 100 and the number of junior programmers is \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the total number of employees, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:
\[
\text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
\]

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers is:
\[
\text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60
\]

Next, we know that each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total amount paid to junior programmers per month is:
\[
\text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000
\]

The senior programmers are paid $400 more than the junior programmers, so each senior programmer is paid:
\[
\text{Payment to each senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400
\]

Therefore, the total amount paid to senior programmers per month is:
\[
\text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000
\]

Finally, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers:
\[
\text{Total payment to all programmers} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000

"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the number of people on the bus becomes \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on, so the number of people on the bus becomes \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).

We are given that at the third stop, there were 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( 14 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 14 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school: \(24 - 2 = 22\) lollipops left.
3. He passes 14 lollipops to his friends: \(22 - 14 = 8\) lollipops left.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which means he buys \(2 \times 14 = 28\) lollipops: \(8 + 28 = 36\) lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night: \(36 - 3 = 33\) lollipops.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning: \(33 - 2 = 31\) lollipops.

So, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is 31.

"To determine how long it will take to fully charge the cell phone from 60% to 100%, we first need to calculate the percentage of charging required. Since the phone is currently at 60% and needs to reach 100%, it needs to charge by 40 percentage points.

Given that the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the total time required to charge by 40 percentage points as follows:

\[ \text{Time required} = 40 \text{ percentage points} \times 3 \text{ minutes/percentage point} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Since the question asks for the time in hours, we convert 120 minutes to hours:

\[ 120 \text{ minutes} = \frac{120}{60} \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \]"

"First, let's calculate the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip where they spent $80. For every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. So, for $80 spent, they would earn:

\[ \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ rewards} \]

Each reward is worth $1 off their next purchase. So, they earned 4 rewards, which means they can get $4 off their next purchase.

Next, let's calculate the rewards they earned from their current shopping trip where they spent $43. For every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. So, for $43 spent, they would earn:

\[ \frac{43}{20} = 2.15 \]

Since they can only earn whole rewards, they would earn 2 rewards. This means they can get $2 off their next purchase.

However, they used their rewards and applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. So, the $2 rewards were reduced by $4 (since the coupon took twice the amount of rewards off the price).

Now, let's calculate the actual amount they paid after applying the rewards and the coupon:

1. Subtract the rewards from the total amount spent:
\[ 43 - 2 = 41 \]

2. Subtract the amount taken off by the coupon:
\[ 41 - 4 = 37 \]

Therefore, the customer paid \(\boxed{37}\) dollars on this shopping trip."

Job A:
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours per year: 2000
- Total annual income before tax: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- State tax rate: 20%
- State tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net pay for Job A: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Next, let's calculate the net pay for Job B.

Job B:
- Annual income before any taxes: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax rate on net income: 10%
- Tax on net income: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay for Job B: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

\[ \$12 \times (1 - 0.25) = \$12 \times 0.75 = \$9 \]

So, the value of her 8 shares after the second year is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$9/\text{share} = \$72 \]

Therefore, the final value of all of Maria's shares is:

\[ \$72 \]"
"First, let's determine how many hot dogs Thomas ate. Since Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, we can calculate the number of hot dogs Thomas ate as follows:

\[ \text{Thomas's hot dogs} = 3 \times \text{Luke's hot dogs} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Next, we need to find out how many hot dogs John ate. John ate half the amount that Thomas ate, so:

\[ \text{John's hot dogs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Thomas's hot dogs} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke. Luke ate 2 hot dogs, and John ate 3 hot dogs, so:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's hot dogs} - \text{Luke's hot dogs} = 3 - 2 = 1 \]

Therefore, John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 1 \]"
"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). Consequently, the number of students in the smallest group will be \( x - 10 \).

Given that the total number of students is 200, we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of students in all three groups:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two equal groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60.

\[
\boxed{60}

"Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \) and the number of chickens as \( H \). According to the problem, the total number of animals is 60, and there are twice as many chickens as cows. This gives us the following equations:

\[ H + C = 60 \]
\[ H = 2C \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( C \):

\[ 2C + C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:

\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of legs. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:

\[ \text{Total legs} = (2 \times H) + (4 \times C) = (2 \times 40) + (4 \times 20) = 80 + 80 = 160 \]

So, the total number of legs the animals have is:

\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week. After 4 weeks, he would have added \(4 \times 1 = 4\) balls. Therefore, he would have started juggling with \(3 + 4 = 7\) balls.

However, when he walks on stage, he slips and drops 3 balls. This leaves him with \(7 - 3 = 4\) balls.

Two of the dropped balls are caught by people in the crowd, and one is lost completely. This means that the number of balls Josh is left with to juggle is still 4.

So, the final numerical answer is:
4"
"First, let's determine the weights of the other animals based on the information given:

1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. A blue beetle weighs the same as a pink frog, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
3. A green toad weighs the same as a pink frog, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
4. A yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than a pink frog, so the yellow snake weighs \(50 + 10 = 60\) pounds.
5. A red bird weighs 20 pounds less than a pink frog, so the red bird weighs \(50 - 20 = 30\) pounds.

Now, let's calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, including the container itself:

- Weight of the pink frog: 50 pounds
- Weight of the blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Weight of the green toad: 50 pounds
- Weight of the yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Weight of the red bird: 30 pounds
- Weight of the container: 20 pounds

Adding these weights together:

\[ 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 \]

So, the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is:

\[
\boxed{260}

"First, we need to determine the number of baby outfits Laurel received at her baby shower. Since she received twice the amount of outfits she was given by her friend, we calculate:

\[ 24 \times 2 = 48 \]

Next, we add the outfits given by her friend and the outfits given by her mom to the outfits she received at her baby shower:

\[ 24 + 48 + 15 \]

Now, we perform the addition step-by-step:

\[ 24 + 48 = 72 \]
\[ 72 + 15 = 87 \]

Therefore, the total number of baby outfits Laurel has for her baby is:

\[ 87 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many meters Tyson runs per day after taking his coach's advice.
2. Calculate the total distance Tyson runs in a month.
3. Since June has 30 days, we will multiply the daily distance by 30.

First, let's find out how many meters Tyson runs per day after taking his coach's advice. The coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters than he currently runs. Since Tyson currently runs 5000 meters per day, the additional distance he should run is:

\[ \text{Additional distance} = 5000 \times \frac{1}{5} = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

So, the new daily distance Tyson runs is:

\[ \text{New daily distance} = 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters} \]

Next, we calculate the total distance Tyson runs in a month. Since June has 30 days, the total distance he runs in June is:

\[ \text{Total distance in June} = 6000 \times 30 = 180000 \text{ meters} \]

Therefore, the total distance Tyson covered in June is:

\[ \boxed{180000} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of each juice box:

- Juice Box A costs $4.
- Juice Box B costs $5 more than Juice Box A, so Juice Box B costs $4 + $5 = $9.
- Juice Box C costs $7 more than Juice Box A, so Juice Box C costs $4 + $7 = $11.

Now, to find out how much more Juice Box C costs than Juice Box B, we subtract the cost of Juice Box B from the cost of Juice Box C:

$11 - $9 = $2.

So, Juice Box C is $2 more expensive than Juice Box B. The final numerical answer is 2."
"To calculate the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have, we need to consider the number of legs contributed by each type of table.

For the 40 tables with 4 legs each:
\[ 40 \text{ tables} \times 4 \text{ legs/table} = 160 \text{ legs} \]

For the 50 tables with 3 legs each:
\[ 50 \text{ tables} \times 3 \text{ legs/table} = 150 \text{ legs} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of legs:
\[ 160 \text{ legs} + 150 \text{ legs} = 310 \text{ legs} \]

So, the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is 310."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Jenny buys in a week:
\[ \text{Total cookies} = 1 \text{ bag} \times 36 \text{ cookies/bag} = 36 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of cookies Jenny puts in her son's lunch box over the week:
\[ \text{Cookies for son's lunch box} = 4 \text{ cookies/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 20 \text{ cookies} \]

Now, let's calculate the number of cookies her husband eats over the week:
\[ \text{Cookies for husband} = 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 7 \text{ cookies} \]

Now, we can find out how many cookies are left for Jenny to eat by subtracting the cookies given to her son and the cookies eaten by her husband from the total number of cookies:
\[ \text{Cookies left for Jenny} = 36 \text{ cookies} - 20 \text{ cookies} - 7 \text{ cookies} = 9 \text{ cookies} \]

So, the number of cookies Jenny eats is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the shirts without any discount. Davos bought 2 shirts, each costing $30.

\[ \text{Total cost without discount} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Next, we need to calculate the discount amount. The discount is 40%, so we need to find 40% of $60.

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 60 \times \frac{40}{100} = 60 \times 0.40 = 24 \]

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the total cost without discount to find out how much Davos paid.

\[ \text{Total cost with discount} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 36 \]"
"First, let's calculate the daily revenue from tractors when they were making them:
- They sold 10 tractors a day.
- They made $100 per tractor.

So, the daily revenue from tractors was:
\[ 10 \text{ tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate the daily revenue from silos now that they make them:
- They sell 5 silos a day.
- They make $220 per silo.

So, the daily revenue from silos is:
\[ 5 \text{ silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day} \]

Now, we need to find the percentage increase in daily revenue from making silos compared to making tractors:
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New revenue} - \text{Old revenue}}{\text{Old revenue}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\$1100 - \$1000}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{\$100}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage more they are making per day now is:
\[ 10\% \]"
"To calculate how much money Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to first determine her monthly expenses and then multiply that by 12 (the number of months in a year).

1. **Food Cost per Month:**
   - Food costs $25 per week.
   - There are 4 weeks in a month.
   - Therefore, the monthly cost of food is \( 25 \times 4 = \$100 \).

2. **Treats Cost per Month:**
   - Treats cost $20 per month.
   - Therefore, the monthly cost of treats is \( \$20 \).

3. **Medicine Cost per Month:**

"First, let's determine the number of plant pots needed for the roses. Since the number of plant pots needed for the roses is twice the number needed for the daisies, and 30 plant pots are needed for the daisies, the number of plant pots needed for the roses is:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of plant pots needed for both the daisies and the roses:

\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \]

April had already bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many plant pots she has left over, we subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number of plant pots she already bought:

\[ 100 - 90 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of plant pots April has left over is:

\[ 10 \]"
"Let's denote the amount of money Andrea saved as \( S \).

According to the problem, Andrea started with $36. She then spent some money on a sweater that cost $11 and gave her brother $4. The remaining money after these expenditures is what she had saved.

So, the equation representing the situation is:
\[ S = 36 - 11 - 4 \]

Now, let's calculate the value of \( S \):
\[ S = 36 - 11 - 4 = 21 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Andrea saved is \( 21 \).

"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming.

John spends 6 hours boating. He spends half that time swimming, which is:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time spent on boating and swimming is:
\[ 6 + 3 = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total time he spent watching the shows. He watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is:
\[ 9 + 6 = 15 \text{ hours} \]

We know that this 15 hours represents 30% of the total time he spent on his vacation. Let \( T \) be the total time spent on the vacation. Then:
\[ 0.30T = 15 \]
\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John spent 40% of his total time sightseeing. Therefore, the time spent sightseeing is:
\[ 0.40 \times 50 = 20 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Annabelle will earn from her first job. She earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours, so her earnings from the first job are:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Annabelle will earn from her second job. She earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours, so her earnings from the second job are:
\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's find the total amount of money Annabelle will have after working at both jobs. She already has $80 in her savings, so her total savings will be:
\[ 80 + 200 + 75 = 355 \text{ dollars} \]

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the toy cars Dean bought. Since each toy car costs $2 and he bought 6 of them, the total cost for the toy cars is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the teddy bears Dean bought. Since each teddy bear costs $1 and he bought 5 of them, the total cost for the teddy bears is:
\[ 5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's find the total amount Dean spent on the toy cars and teddy bears:
\[ 12 + 5 = 17 \text{ dollars} \]

Dean initially had $28, so after spending $17, the amount of money he has left is:
\[ 28 - 17 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

Dean's mother then gives him an extra $10. Adding this to the $11 he has left, the total amount of money Dean has now is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost for the activities Morgan wants to do:

- Mini-golf: $5
- Arcade tokens: $5
- Go-karts: $10 per ride, and she wants to ride twice, so $10 * 2 = $20

Now, let's add up these costs:
$5 (mini-golf) + $5 (arcade tokens) + $20 (go-karts) = $30

Morgan's total budget is $90. After accounting for the $30 spent on the activities, the remaining budget is:
$90 - $30 = $60

Since the question asks how many friends she can invite, and assuming that the remaining $60 is for food, drinks, or other expenses, we need to determine how many friends can be invited. However, the question does not specify how much each friend will cost. Without this information, we can only determine how much money is left for other expenses, not how many friends can be invited.

Therefore, based on the information provided, the remaining budget is $60, but we cannot determine how many friends can be invited without knowing the cost per friend."
"First, let's calculate how much Marisa spends on lollipops each day. Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and she buys 4 lollipops each day. So, the cost per day is:

\[ 4 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 100 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, 100 cents is equivalent to 1 dollar. So, Marisa spends $1 each day on lollipops.

Next, we need to determine how much money Marisa saves each day. Since she gets $5 as pocket money every day and spends $1 on lollipops, the amount she saves each day is:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars} - 1 \text{ dollar} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much she saves over 5 days. Since she saves $4 each day, over 5 days she saves:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Since he took half of his change and spent it on gumballs, the total amount of money he had initially was twice the amount he spent on gumballs:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Billy started with $10, so the amount of money he spent on candy is:
\[ 10 - 4 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of the candy is $1.5 per pound. To find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we divide the total amount spent on candy by the cost per pound:
\[ \frac{6}{1.5} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy. The final numerical answer is:

To find \( S \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 45 + 5 = 2S \]
\[ 50 = 2S \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ \frac{50}{2} = S \]
\[ 25 = S \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"First, let's calculate the distance of the entire trip from the first city to the third city and back to the first city.

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city back to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the second and third city trip, which is \(100 - 50 = 50\) miles.

So, the total distance for one complete round trip (first to second, then second to third, and finally third to first) is:
\[75 + 100 + 50 = 225 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[225 \times 3 = 675 \text{ miles}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance traveled in one day by the service interval:
\[\frac{675}{18000} = \frac{675 \div 75}{18000 \div 75} = \frac{9}{240} = \frac{3}{80}\]

To find out how many days it goes between services, we take the reciprocal of \(\frac{3}{80}\), which is \(\frac{80}{3}\). Calculating this gives:
\[\frac{80}{3} \approx 26.67\]

Since the train cannot go a fraction of a day between services, we round up to the next whole number. Therefore, the train goes between services every 27 days.

The final numerical answer is:
\[27\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of stuffing required for each type of dog bed and then calculate the total amount needed for the specified number of beds.

First, let's find out how much stuffing a collie bed requires. The collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. A Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds of stuffing, and a chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing. The average is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we know:
- A chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing.
- A collie bed requires 5 pounds of stuffing.

Next, we calculate the total stuffing needed for the specified number of beds:
- Mark needs to make 4 chihuahua beds. The total stuffing for the chihuahua beds is:
\[
4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]
- Mark needs to make 3 collie beds. The total stuffing for the collie beds is:
\[
3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds to find the total amount of stuffing Mark needs:
\[
8 + 15 = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the total amount of stuffing Mark needs is:
\[
\boxed{23}

"First, we need to calculate the time John spent driving to his friend's house. The distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, and he drives at a speed of 70 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time taken to drive to his friend's house is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} = \frac{200 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{200}{70} \text{ hours} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 2.857 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time John spent on the detour. The detour added 10 miles to his trip, so the total distance for the detour is:

\[ 200 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 210 \text{ miles} \]

The speed during the detour is 70 mph, so the time taken for the detour is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we need to calculate the time John spent driving home. The distance home is 240 miles, and he drives at a speed of 80 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{home}} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we add up all the times to get the total trip time:

\[ \text{Total Time} = \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} + \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} + \text{Time}_{\text{home}} = \frac{20}{7} + 3 + 3 \]

To add these times together, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 7 and 1 is 7, so we convert 3 and 3 to fractions with denominator 7:

\[ 3 = \frac{21}{7} \]
\[ 3 = \frac{21}{7} \]

So the total time is:

\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{20}{7} + \frac{21}{7} + \frac{21}{7} = \frac{20 + 21 + 21}{7} = \frac{62}{7} \approx 8.857 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \frac{62}{7} \text{ hours} \]"

The final numerical answer is 18."
"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass, we start by calculating the total points she has already scored on her first two tests.

First test score: 15 points
Second test score: 18 points

Total points from the first two tests:
\[ 15 + 18 = 33 \]

Jane needs a total of at least 42 points across all three tests. Let \( x \) represent the score she needs on her third test. The equation to find \( x \) is:
\[ 33 + x \geq 42 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the inequality:
\[ x \geq 42 - 33 \]
\[ x \geq 9 \]

Therefore, the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass is 9.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 9 \]"
"Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as \( C \). According to the problem, \( C = 3 \).

The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is \( 4C - 5 \). Substituting \( C = 3 \) into this equation, we get:
\[ 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7. \]
So, 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting.

The number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \).

Now, we know the total number of customers and shoplifters:
\[ C + 7 = 3 + 7 = 10. \]

The total number of people kicked out of the Walmart is 50. Therefore, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:
\[ 50 - (C + 7) = 50 - 10 = 40. \]

So, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is \( 40 \).

"To determine how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we need to first find out how many points Erin had after scoring 14 points.

Given:
- Sara scored 8 points.
- Erin now has three times more points than Sara.

First, calculate the points Erin has now:
\[ \text{Erin's points now} = 3 \times \text{Sara's points} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Erin scored 14 points after reaching 24 points. Therefore, the points Erin had before scoring the 14 points are:
\[ \text{Erin's points before} = \text{Erin's points now} - \text{points scored} = 24 - 14 = 10 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. Each picture frame costs $20 and an additional 20% for etching. The total cost for one picture frame is:

\[ \text{Cost of one picture frame} = \$20 + (20\% \times \$20) = \$20 + \$4 = \$24 \]

Since there are 44 seniors, the total cost for all picture frames is:

\[ \text{Total cost for picture frames} = 44 \times \$24 = \$1056 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the pins. Two seniors will receive pins, and each pin costs $5:

\[ \text{Total cost for pins} = 2 \times \$5 = \$10 \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the cords for the officers. One-fourth of the seniors are officers, so:

\[ \text{Number of officers} = \frac{44}{4} = 11 \]

Each cord costs $12, so the total cost for the cords is:

\[ \text{Total cost for cords} = 11 \times \$12 = \$132 \]

Finally, we sum up all the costs to find the total amount spent on the senior gifts:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$1056 + \$10 + \$132 = \$1198 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \$1198 \]"
"To determine the total cost for Ethan if he makes his own hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the savings from the DIY option and then subtract that from the original cost.

The original cost of the wallpaper is $400. The DIY option saves 20% of this cost. First, we calculate 20% of $400:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.20 \times 400 = 80 \]

This means Ethan saves $80 by making his own wallpaper. Therefore, the total cost for Ethan if he makes his own wallpaper is:

\[ 400 - 80 = 320 \]

So, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 320 \]"

   \]

4. **Total Pairs Sold Before Returns:**
   Adding the pairs sold over the three days:
   \[
   14 \text{ (Friday)} + 28 \text{ (Saturday)} + 14 \text{ (Sunday)} = 56 \text{ pairs}
   \]

5. **Returns:**
   Six pairs were returned because they didn't fit.

6. **Total Pairs Sold After Returns:**
   Subtracting the returned pairs from the total pairs sold:

"First, let's determine the number of faulty pieces of equipment. Since 40% of the total number of pieces were faulty, we can calculate the number of faulty pieces as follows:

\[ \text{Number of faulty pieces} = 40\% \times \text{Total number of pieces} \]

Let's denote the total number of pieces as \( N \). Therefore, the number of faulty pieces is:

\[ \text{Number of faulty pieces} = 0.4N \]

The number of functioning pieces would then be:

\[ \text{Number of functioning pieces} = N - 0.4N = 0.6N \]

The total cost of the equipment is $400,000. Since the faulty pieces are returned, the company only pays for the functioning pieces. The cost of the functioning pieces is:

\[ \text{Cost of functioning pieces} = 0.6N \times \frac{400000}{N} \]

Since the cost per piece is proportional to the total cost, we can simplify this to:

\[ \text{Cost of functioning pieces} = 0.6 \times 400000 = 240000 \]

Thus, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is:

\[ \boxed{240000} \]"
"To determine how much milk Mary collects every day, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. **Total number of sheep**: Mary has 30 sheep.
2. **Half of the sheep**: Since half of the sheep provide 1 kg of milk each, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{30}{2} = 15 \text{ sheep}
   \]
3. **Milk from half of the sheep**: Each of these 15 sheep provides 1 kg of milk per day. Therefore, the total milk from these 15 sheep is:
   \[
   15 \times 1 \text{ kg} = 15 \text{ kg}
   \]
4. **Other half of the sheep**: The other half of the sheep (also 15 sheep) provides 2 kg of milk each per day. Therefore, the total milk from these 15 sheep is:
   \[
   15 \times 2 \text{ kg} = 30 \text{ kg}
   \]
5. **Total milk collected per day**: Adding the milk from both halves of the sheep, we get:
   \[
   15 \text{ kg} + 30 \text{ kg} = 45 \text{ kg}
   \]

Thus, the total amount of milk Mary collects every day is:

"Mrs. Sherman made a dozen bread rolls, which is equal to 12 rolls. She gave one roll to each of her 6 children, so she gave away 6 rolls. This leaves her with 12 - 6 = 6 rolls. She then broke each of the remaining 6 rolls into 8 pieces and fed them to the chickens. Therefore, the total number of pieces of rolls she fed to the chickens is 6 rolls * 8 pieces per roll = 48 pieces.

The final numerical answer is 48."
"First, we need to determine how many pupils like blue. Since half of the class likes blue, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of pupils who like blue} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Next, we find out how many pupils are left after accounting for those who like blue:

\[
\text{Remaining pupils} = 40 - 20 = 20
\]

One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green. So, we calculate the number of pupils who like green:

\[
\text{Number of pupils who like green} = \frac{20}{4} = 5
\]

The rest of the pupils like yellow. To find the number of pupils who like yellow, we subtract the number of pupils who like green from the remaining pupils:

\[
\text{Number of pupils who like yellow} = 20 - 5 = 15
\]

Thus, the number of pupils who like the color yellow is:

\[
\boxed{15}

"First, we need to determine how many apples Lucy sold on Monday. Given that she sold all the apples she picked on Monday and received $56 from selling them at $4 per piece, we can calculate the number of apples sold on Monday as follows:

\[
\text{Number of apples sold on Monday} = \frac{\$56}{\$4/\text{apple}} = 14 \text{ apples}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many apples Lucy picked on Tuesday and Wednesday. According to the problem, on Tuesday, she picked 12 apples. On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday:

\[
\text{Number of apples picked on Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ apples}
\]

Now, we can calculate the total number of apples picked over the three days by summing the apples picked on each day:

\[
\text{Total number of apples} = \text{Apples picked on Monday} + \text{Apples picked on Tuesday} + \text{Apples picked on Wednesday}
\]
\[
\text{Total number of apples} = 14 + 12 + 24 = 50

"To determine how many socks Lindsay has missed, we first need to calculate the total number of socks she has washed.

A pair of socks consists of 2 socks. Lindsay washes 10 pairs, so the number of socks from the pairs is:
\[ 10 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ socks per pair} = 20 \text{ socks} \]

She also washes 15 loose socks. So, the total number of socks she has washed is:
\[ 20 \text{ socks from pairs} + 15 \text{ loose socks} = 35 \text{ socks} \]

Lindsay started with 50 socks. To find out how many socks she has missed, we subtract the number of socks she has washed from the total number of socks:
\[ 50 \text{ socks} - 35 \text{ socks} = 15 \text{ socks} \]

Therefore, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is:
\[ 15 \]"

"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including the interest, and then divide that by five.

The formula to calculate the total amount to be paid, including interest, is:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} \times (1 + \text{Interest Rate})^{\text{Time}} \]

Here, the principal (P) is $3,650, the interest rate (r) is 10% or 0.10, and the time (t) is 5 months. Since the interest rate is given as an annual rate, we need to adjust it for the time period. However, since the interest is compounded monthly, we can use the formula directly with the given values.

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 \times (1 + 0.10)^5 \]

First, calculate \( (1 + 0.10)^5 \):
\[ (1 + 0.10)^5 = 1.10^5 \approx 1.61051 \]

Now, multiply this by the principal:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 \times 1.61051 \approx 5874.4115 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the total amount Karan has to pay is approximately $5874.41.

Next, we need to divide this total amount by the number of months (5) to find the monthly payment:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{5874.4115}{5} \approx 1174.8823 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is approximately $1174.88.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we calculate the distance Cho hiked. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Cho, the speed is 14 kilometers per hour and the time is 8 hours. So, the distance Cho hiked is:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{h} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, we calculate the distance Chloe hiked. The speed for Chloe is 9 kilometers per hour and the time is 5 hours. So, the distance Chloe hiked is:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{h} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked, we subtract the distance Chloe hiked from the distance Cho hiked:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of silver and gold pesos Anna has.

Axel has 50 silver pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Axel has 80 gold pesos. Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so:
\[ 80 + 40 = 120 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of silver pesos they have together:
\[ 50 \text{ (Axel's silver pesos)} + 100 \text{ (Anna's silver pesos)} = 150 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of gold pesos they have together:
\[ 80 \text{ (Axel's gold pesos)} + 120 \text{ (Anna's gold pesos)} = 200 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Finally, let's find the total number of pesos they have together by adding the total silver pesos and the total gold pesos:

"First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make with her supplies. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she can make 3 pitchers, the total number of cups is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups/pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to determine the revenue from selling all 36 cups of lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue is:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1/\text{cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to find out how much it costs her to make the lemonade. She spent $18 to buy the supplies, so the cost is:

\[ \$18 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Millie sells all of the lemonade, and she sells an average of 4 cups per hour. Therefore, the profit per hour is:

\[ \frac{\$18}{4 \text{ hours}} = \$4.50/\text{hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially as \( L \).

According to the problem, he sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5} L = 12.8
\]

To find \( L \), we need to solve for \( L \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
L = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, let's perform the multiplication:

\[
L = 12.8 \times 2.5
\]

\[
L = 32

"First, we need to determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 50\% \times 52 = 0.50 \times 52 = 26 \]

Since the choir is evenly split between boys and girls, the number of boys is also 26. Therefore, the total number of female members in the choir is:

\[ \text{Number of female members} = \text{Number of girls} = 26 \]

On the day of the performance, only the female members are performing. However, half of these female members can't make it to the show because their bus breaks down. So, the number of female members who can't make it is:

\[ \text{Number of female members who can't make it} = \frac{1}{2} \times 26 = 13 \]

This means the number of female members who do make it to the performance is:

\[ \text{Number of female members who make it} = 26 - 13 = 13 \]

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

\[ \text{Total number of people who sang} = \text{Number of female members who make it} + \text{Number of teachers} = 13 + 3 = 16 \]

The final numerical answer is:

Next, let's calculate the cost for Dasha if she buys tickets. Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2. Therefore, each ride costs $4. For 9 rides, Dasha would need 9 * $4 = $36 worth of tickets.

Now, let's compare the total costs:
- David's total cost: $30
- Dasha's total cost: $36

The amount of money David saves by buying the ride bracelet instead of buying tickets is the difference between Dasha's total cost and David's total cost:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many popsicles Betty and Sam each have based on the given ratio and total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. Together, they have a total of 165 popsicles.

First, we find the sum of the parts of the ratio:
\[ 5 + 6 = 11 \]

This means that the total number of popsicles (165) is divided into 11 equal parts. To find the number of popsicles in one part, we divide the total number of popsicles by 11:
\[ \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can find out how many popsicles Betty and Sam have individually:
- Betty has \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \) popsicles.
- Sam has \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

"First, let's calculate the monthly cost of the streaming services after the 20% savings for bundling.

The normal cost for Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, so the total cost for both is:
\[ 10 + 10 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

With a 20% savings on bundling, the savings amount is:
\[ 20 \times \frac{20}{100} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the cost after the savings is:
\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the streaming services per month:
\[ 10 \text{ (Netflix)} + 16 \text{ (Hulu and Disney Plus)} = 26 \text{ dollars} \]

Tim's cable package costs $60 per month. Therefore, the amount of money he saves by cancelling his cable package and switching to streaming services is:

"First, let's convert all the time spent into the same unit. We'll use minutes for this calculation.

- Time spent writing a song: 4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes
- Time spent recording: half of the time spent writing = 240 / 2 = 120 minutes
- Time spent editing: 90 minutes

Now, let's calculate the total work time in minutes:
- Total work time = Time spent writing + Time spent recording + Time spent editing
- Total work time = 240 + 120 + 90 = 450 minutes

Next, we calculate the percentage of the total work time that was spent editing:
- Percentage spent editing = (Time spent editing / Total work time) * 100
- Percentage spent editing = (90 / 450) * 100 = 0.2 * 100 = 20%

The final numerical answer is 20%."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of books Wendy wants to place in the shelving system.

First, we calculate the total number of slots in the shelving system. Since the shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns, the total number of slots is:
\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

Next, we need to find out how many books Wendy wants to place. According to the problem, she wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in the shelving system. Let's denote the number of books in the shelving system as \( B \). Therefore, the number of books Wendy wants to place is:
\[ 2B + 20 \]

Since the shelving system has 36 slots, we set \( B = 36 \):
\[ 2B + 20 = 2 \times 36 + 20 = 72 + 20 = 92 \]

Thus, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for a quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for:
- 3 cups of flour
- 1 cup of milk

For a quadruple batch, the amounts are:
- Flour: \( 3 \text{ cups} \times 4 = 12 \text{ cups} \)
- Milk: \( 1 \text{ cup} \times 4 = 4 \text{ cups} \)

Next, we need to determine how many bags of flour and bottles of milk are required.

Flour is sold in 2-cup bags:
- \( \frac{12 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups per bag}} = 6 \text{ bags} \)

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles:
- \( \frac{4 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups per bottle}} = 2 \text{ bottles} \)

Finally, we calculate the difference between the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk:
- \( 6 \text{ bags} - 2 \text{ bottles} = 4 \)

Therefore, Mark has to buy 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the energy savings, we first need to calculate the energy consumption of the air conditioner under the original and reduced usage conditions.

1. **Original Usage:**
   - Power consumption: 900 watts
   - Usage time: 8 hours per day
   - Daily energy consumption: \( 900 \, \text{watts} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watt-hours} \)
   - Convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours: \( 7200 \, \text{watt-hours} \div 1000 = 7.2 \, \text{kilowatt-hours} \)
   - Daily energy consumption in kilowatt-hours: 7.2 kWh

2. **Reduced Usage:**
   - Reduced usage time: 8 hours - 5 hours = 3 hours per day
   - Daily energy consumption: \( 900 \, \text{watts} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watt-hours} \)
   - Convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours: \( 2700 \, \text{watt-hours} \div 1000 = 2.7 \, \text{kilowatt-hours} \)
   - Daily energy consumption in kilowatt-hours: 2.7 kWh

3. **Energy Savings per Day:**
   - Savings per day: \( 7.2 \, \text{kilowatt-hours} - 2.7 \, \text{kilowatt-hours} = 4.5 \, \text{kilowatt-hours} \)

4. **Energy Savings in 30 Days:**
   - Total savings in 30 days: \( 4.5 \, \text{kilowatt-hours/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kilowatt-hours} \)

The final numerical answer is 135 kilowatt-hours."
"First, let's calculate the total number of stripes on all the zebras Jane counted.

- Two zebras with 17 stripes each: \(2 \times 17 = 34\) stripes
- One zebra with 36 stripes: \(36\) stripes
- One zebra with half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes: \(36 / 2 = 18\) stripes

Now, let's add up all the stripes:
\[34 + 36 + 18 = 88\]

There are a total of 3 zebras, so to find the average number of stripes per zebra, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras:
\[88 / 3 = 29.3333...\]

"First, let's determine the initial number of corns Allan has. According to the problem, there is twice as much corn as cannolis. Given that Allan initially has 40 cannolis, we can calculate the initial number of corns as follows:

\[ \text{Initial number of corns} = 2 \times \text{Initial number of cannolis} = 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

Next, Allan bought 60 more cannolis at the store. Therefore, the new number of cannolis is:

\[ \text{New number of cannolis} = \text{Initial number of cannolis} + 60 = 40 + 60 = 100 \]

Now, Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he had after buying the additional cannolis. So, the number of corns he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of corns bought} = \text{New number of cannolis} - 40 = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Therefore, the new number of corns Allan has is:

\[ \text{New number of corns} = \text{Initial number of corns} + \text{Number of corns bought} = 80 + 60 = 140 \]

Finally, to find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house, we add the new number of corns and the new number of cannolis:

\[ \text{Combined total} = \text{New number of corns} + \text{New number of cannolis} = 140 + 100 = 240 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we can break down the information given:

1. Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day.
2. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. This means he walked 5,000 steps on his walks to and from school.
3. He also did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.
4. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take to reach his goal of 10,000 steps.

First, we calculate the total number of steps Elliott had taken before his jog:
\[ 5,000 \text{ (walks to and from school)} + 1,000 \text{ (short walk with friend)} = 6,000 \text{ steps} \]

Since his goal is 10,000 steps and he had 2,000 steps left after his jog, the number of steps he took during his jog is:
\[ 10,000 - 6,000 - 2,000 = 2,000 \text{ steps} \]

So, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is:
\[ \boxed{2000} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total number of words in the book. The book is 45 pages long and averages 200 words per page. Therefore, the total number of words in the book is:

\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it will take Toby to read the entire book. Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute. Therefore, the time it takes to read the book is:

\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby plans to leave as soon as he finishes the book and it takes him 10 minutes to get to the airport. Therefore, the total time Toby will spend from starting to read until he reaches the airport is:

\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby has 60 minutes until he needs to be at the airport. Therefore, the number of minutes early Toby will be is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is sold in a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. Sally bought 2 pounds of taffy.

For the first pound, the cost is $3.
For the second pound, the cost is $3 - $1.50 = $1.50 (since it's half off).

So, the total cost for the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50 and the magnets cost $0.25 each. Sally bought 4 magnets.

The total cost for the seashells and magnets is $1.50 + 4 * $0.25 = $1.50 + $1.00 = $2.50.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items Sally bought:
Total cost = Cost of taffy + Cost of seashells and magnets
Total cost = $4.50 + $2.50 = $7.00.

Sally's parents gave her $10 to spend. So, the amount of money Sally has left is:
Money left = Initial amount - Total cost
Money left = $10 - $7.00 = $3.00.

The final numerical answer is $3.00."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the two packs of fireworks. The first pack costs $400, and the second pack costs twice as much, which is $800. Adding these together gives:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost of the two packs of fireworks. A 20% discount means Tim pays 80% of the total cost. So, we calculate 80% of $1200:

\[ 1200 \times 0.80 = 960 \]

Now, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted cost of the fireworks:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is:

\[ \boxed{1110} \]"
"Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies a night. Over 30 days, she will eat:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. We know that 5% of the candles are dangerous and have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. Additionally, 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode. Therefore, 1% of the candles are dangerous and do not have the defect.

First, let's find out how many candles are dangerous:
\[ \text{Number of dangerous candles} = 5\% \text{ of } 50000 = 0.05 \times 50000 = 2500 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these dangerous candles also have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. Since 5% of the candles are dangerous and have the defect, we calculate:
\[ \text{Number of dangerous candles that smell like wet dog} = 5\% \text{ of } 2500 = 0.05 \times 2500 = 125 \]

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is:

"First, we need to determine the discount price for each blouse. The regular price of each blouse is $20, and there is a 30% discount.

The discount amount per blouse is calculated as:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Regular Price} \times \text{Discount Percentage} = 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]

So, the price of each blouse after the discount is:
\[ \text{Discounted Price} = \text{Regular Price} - \text{Discount Amount} = 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so the total cost for the discounted blouses is:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \text{Discounted Price} \times \text{Number of Blouses} = 14 \times 4 = 56 \]

"Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees as \( A_{\text{tall}} \), from the shortest trees as \( A_{\text{short}} \), and from the average trees as \( A_{\text{avg}} \).

From the problem, we know:
- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, so \( A_{\text{tall}} = 30 \).
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, so \( A_{\text{short}} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \).
- Joanne gathers \( A_{\text{avg}} \) apples from the average trees.

Her sister gathers:
- Twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
- Three times as many apples from the shortest trees, so \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
- No apples from the average trees, so \( 0 \) apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne and her sister is 500. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total apples gathered as:
\[ A_{\text{tall}} + A_{\text{short}} + A_{\text{avg}} + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 30 + 15 + A_{\text{avg}} + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Simplifying the left side:
\[ 150 + A_{\text{avg}} = 500 \]

Solving for \( A_{\text{avg}} \):
\[ A_{\text{avg}} = 500 - 150 \]
\[ A_{\text{avg}} = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{350} \]"
"Let's denote the number of camels as \( C \) and the number of dromedaries as \( D \).

From the problem, we have two equations:
1. The total number of heads: \( C + D = 180 \)
2. The total number of humps: \( 2C + D = 304 \)

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, we can express \( C \) in terms of \( D \) from the first equation:
\[ C = 180 - D \]

Next, we substitute \( C = 180 - D \) into the second equation:
\[ 2(180 - D) + D = 304 \]
\[ 360 - 2D + D = 304 \]
\[ 360 - D = 304 \]
\[ -D = 304 - 360 \]
\[ -D = -56 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

To find the number of camels, we substitute \( D = 56 \) back into the equation \( C = 180 - D \):
\[ C = 180 - 56 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

To verify, we check the total number of humps:
\[ 2C + D = 2(124) + 56 = 248 + 56 = 304 \]

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

The final numerical answer is:

   - Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the first 4 days: \( 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \).

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - Tom traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days.
   - Distance traveled in the next 2 days: \( 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \).

3. **The next day:**
   - Tom didn't travel at all.
   - Distance traveled on the next day: \( 0 \text{ km} \).

4. **Second week:**
   - Tom traveled 300 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the second week: \( 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \).

"To determine how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to find the difference in elevation between Oliver and Stanley's comb.

Stanley's comb is at an elevation of 10,000 feet (where Stanley was standing initially) and then it fell 4,000 feet to a ledge below. Therefore, the comb is at an elevation of:
\[ 10,000 \text{ feet} - 4,000 \text{ feet} = 6,000 \text{ feet} \]

Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb at 6,000 feet, we subtract Oliver's elevation from the comb's elevation:
\[ 6,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 3,000 \text{ feet} \]

"First, let's determine the total number of bird feeders Lillian has. She builds 3 and buys 3 more, so she has a total of 3 + 3 = 6 bird feeders.

Next, we need to calculate the number of birds that each type of feeder attracts. The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each, and the bird feeders Lillian made attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, which means they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

Now, we can calculate the total number of birds that can be expected to visit the garden each day. Since there are 3 store-bought feeders and 3 bird feeders Lillian made, the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders is 3 * 20 = 60 birds, and the total number of birds attracted by the bird feeders Lillian made is 3 * 30 = 90 birds.

Adding these together, the total number of birds expected to visit the garden each day is 60 + 90 = 150 birds.

"First, let's determine the cost of the soup. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. Since the bagel costs $4, we can calculate the cost of the soup as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of soup} = \text{Cost of bagel} + 0.25 \times \text{Cost of bagel} \]
\[ \text{Cost of soup} = 4 + 0.25 \times 4 \]
\[ \text{Cost of soup} = 4 + 1 \]
\[ \text{Cost of soup} = 5 \]

Next, we know the cake costs half the price of the bagel. Since the bagel costs $4, the cake costs:

\[ \text{Cost of cake} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cost of bagel} \]
\[ \text{Cost of cake} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 \]
\[ \text{Cost of cake} = 2 \]

Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards, so he sells 2/3 of them. The number of cards he sells is \( \frac{2}{3}x \). He sells each card for $1.5, so the total amount of money he earns from selling the cards is \( 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}x = x \).

According to the problem, after selling the cards, Kenny has $50 in spending cash and the remaining $50 to buy the ticket to the amusement park, which costs $100. This means the total amount of money he has after selling the cards is $100. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x = 100 \]

So, Kenny started with 100 cards. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{100}

"First, let's determine how many hotdogs the caterer initially prepared. Since half of the 40 guests would have two hotdogs each, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of guests who would have two hotdogs} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

This means that 20 guests would have two hotdogs each, so the caterer prepared:

\[
20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ hotdogs}
\]

However, since 40 guests showed up and everyone wanted a second hotdog, the caterer needs to provide an additional 20 hotdogs to satisfy the remaining 20 guests. Therefore, the total number of hotdogs needed is:

\[
40 + 20 = 60 \text{ hotdogs}
\]

The caterer initially prepared 40 hotdogs, so the number of hotdogs that were not enough to satisfy everyone is:

\[
60 - 40 = 20 \text{ hotdogs}
\]

Thus, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:

\[
20
\]

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{20}

"First, let's determine the number of letters in Indras' sister's name. We know that Indras' name has 6 letters. Half of the letters in Indras' name is:

\[
\frac{6}{2} = 3
\]

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name, so:

\[
3 + 4 = 7
\]

Now, to find the total number of letters in both names, we add the number of letters in Indras' name to the number of letters in her sister's name:

\[
6 + 7 = 13
\]

So, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is:

\[
\boxed{13}

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- The pot and pans set costs $120.00.
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so the total for the utensils is $5.00 * 5 = $25.00.

Adding these together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[ 120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00 \]

Next, we need to calculate the discount amount. The items are 20% off, so we calculate 20% of $165.00:
\[ 0.20 \times 165.00 = 33.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Charlotte has to pay:
\[ 165.00 - 33.00 = 132.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 132.00 \]"

"First, we need to determine how much gas is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we can calculate the amount of gas per container as follows:

\[ \text{Gas per container} = \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5 \text{ containers}} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Josey needed \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container. Therefore, the amount of gas Josey needed is:

\[ \text{Gas needed by Josey} = \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to convert gallons to pints. Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we can convert \(\frac{3}{4}\) gallons to pints as follows:

\[ \text{Gas needed by Josey in pints} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints per gallon} = \frac{3 \times 8}{4} = \frac{24}{4} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount of money George spent:**
   George spent $5, but he had 1% of his money left after the purchase. This means he spent 99% of his money.
   \[
   0.99 \times 5 = 4.95 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   So, George spent $4.95.

2. **Calculate the cost of the chips George bought:**
   George bought 3 bags of chips. Each bag of chips costs 40 cents, which is $0.40.
   \[
   3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   So, the chips cost $1.20.

3. **Determine the amount of money spent on candy bars:**
   Since George spent $4.95 in total and $1.20 on chips, the amount spent on candy bars is:
   \[
   4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of candy bars George bought:**
   Each candy bar costs 75 cents, which is $0.75.

"First, let's determine the amount of onions Antoine uses. The recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, and he doubles that amount:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00 \text{ per pound} = \$8.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box is $2.00:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00 \text{ per box} = \$4.00 \]

The total cost for the ingredients is the sum of the cost of the onions and the beef stock:

"First, let's determine the time it takes for Wayne to drive to the theater. According to the problem, it takes Wayne 4 minutes to drive to the theater.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes for Bernadette to drive to the theater. The problem states that the drive from Bernadette’s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne’s hotel. Therefore, the time it takes for Bernadette to drive to the theater is:
\[ 4 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to drive to the theater, Bernadette should leave 5 minutes earlier than that to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Therefore, Bernadette should leave:
\[ 4 \text{ minutes} - 5 \text{ minutes} = -1 \text{ minute} \]

Since leaving 1 minute before Wayne would still mean she arrives 5 minutes before him, Bernadette should leave 1 minute before Wayne to ensure she arrives 5 minutes before him.

Thus, Bernadette should leave 1 minute earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first.

"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to determine the width of the room. We know the area of the room and the length, so we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

Given:
- Area = 360 square feet
- Length = 3 yards

First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard = 3 feet, the length in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Now we can find the width using the area formula:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{Width} \]

Solving for the width:

\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can calculate the perimeter of the rectangle using the formula:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

So, the perimeter of the room is 98 feet."
"First, let's calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

So, the total number of beads Elizabeth bought is:
\[ 1 \text{ pack of red} + 2 \text{ packs of clear} = 1 \times 20 + 2 \times 20 = 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ beads} \]

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

So, the total number of beads Margareth bought is:

"First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven. Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour. Therefore, the total temperature increase from the oven is:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, let's calculate the temperature decrease due to the window. Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Therefore, the total temperature decrease from the window is:

\[ \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 3 \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 6 \text{ degrees} \]

Now, we can find the final temperature by starting with the initial temperature and adding the temperature increase from the oven and then subtracting the temperature decrease from the window:

\[ 40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the house's final temperature is:

"First, let's convert all times to minutes for easier calculation:
- Jon's swim time: 40 minutes
- Jon's bike ride time: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 60 + 20 = 80 minutes
- Jon's run time: 50 minutes

Now, let's calculate James's times:
- James's swim time: Jon's swim time minus 10% of Jon's swim time
  \[
  \text{James's swim time} = 40 - (0.10 \times 40) = 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ minutes}
  \]
- James's bike ride time: Jon's bike ride time plus 5 minutes
  \[
  \text{James's bike ride time} = 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes}
  \]
- James's run time: We need to find this.

The total time for Jon is:
\[
\text{Jon's total time} = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes}
\]

Let James's run time be \( x \) minutes. Then James's total time is:
\[
\text{James's total time} = 36 + 85 + x = 121 + x \text{ minutes}
\]

We know that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[
121 + x = 170 + 10
\]
\[
121 + x = 180
\]
\[
x = 180 - 121
\]
\[
x = 59

"First, we need to determine how many miles the horse runs. The horse runs at a speed of 32 miles per hour for 30 minutes, which is half an hour. Therefore, the distance the horse runs is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 32 \, \text{MPH} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 16 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of hay the horse eats. For every mile the horse runs, it eats 1/2 a bail of hay. Therefore, for 16 miles, the horse eats:

\[ \text{Hay consumed} = 16 \, \text{miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \, \text{bail/mile} = 8 \, \text{bails} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the hay. Since each bail of hay costs $3, the total cost for 8 bails is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 \, \text{bails} \times 3 \, \text{\$/bail} = 24 \, \text{\$} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which amount to:

\[ \text{Total money Michael has} = 6 \times 5 = 30 \, \text{\$} \]

After buying the hay, the change Michael has is:

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 21 - 15 - P = 2 \]
\[ 6 - P = 2 \]
\[ P = 6 - 2 \]
\[ P = 4 \]

So, the regular price of the popcorn is $4.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the original cost per balloon.
2. Calculate the new cost per balloon after the price increase.
3. Compute the total cost for 170 balloons at the new price.

**Step 1: Determine the original cost per balloon.**

The total cost for 20 balloons was $900. Therefore, the cost per balloon was:
\[ \text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the new cost per balloon after the price increase.**

The cost per balloon increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:

"To find the average speed of the car during the entire trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance for each segment of the trip:
- For the first segment, the car travels at 60 mph for 2 hours. The distance is \(60 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles}\).
- For the second segment, the car travels at 30 mph for 1 hour. The distance is \(30 \text{ mph} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 30 \text{ miles}\).

The total distance traveled is \(120 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 150 \text{ miles}\).

The total time taken for the trip is \(2 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} = 3 \text{ hours}\).

The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time:
\[

So, the car's average speed during the trip is \(50 \text{ mph}\)."
"First, let's determine the value of the sapphires Jenna traded. Jenna traded 3 sapphires, and each sapphire is worth $800. Therefore, the value of the sapphires she traded is:

\[ 3 \text{ sapphires} \times \$800 \text{ per sapphire} = \$2400 \]

Next, we need to determine how many sapphires Jenna has left after the trade. Initially, she had 8 sapphires and traded 3, so she has:

\[ 8 - 3 = 5 \text{ sapphires} \]

Now, we calculate the total value of the sapphires Jenna has left:

\[ 5 \text{ sapphires} \times \$800 \text{ per sapphire} = \$4000 \]

Jenna also received 2 rubies in the trade. Each ruby is worth $1200, so the value of the rubies she received is:

"First, we need to find the total number of puppies. Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, so the total number of puppies is:
\[ 8 + 12 = 20 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. Jennifer's dog has 3 spotted puppies and Brandon's dog has 4 spotted puppies, so the total number of spotted puppies is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we use the formula for percentage:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of Spotted Puppies}}{\text{Total Number of Puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 \]

Calculating the fraction:
\[ \frac{7}{20} = 0.35 \]

Then, converting to a percentage:
\[ 0.35 \times 100 = 35\% \]

So, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is:
\[ 35\% \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 35 \]"
"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of the feed.

1. **Sugar Cubes:**
   - Each box weighs 1 pound.
   - He buys 2 boxes.
   - Total weight of sugar cubes = 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

2. **Carrots:**
   - Each bag weighs 12 pounds.
   - He buys 4 bags.
   - Total weight of carrots = 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

3. **Hay:**
   - Each bale weighs 75 pounds.
   - He buys 42 bales.
   - Total weight of hay = 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

4. **Oats:**
   - Each sack weighs 65 pounds.
   - He buys 20 sacks.
   - Total weight of oats = 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

Now, we sum the weights of all the feed items to find the total weight:
\[ \text{Total weight} = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 \text{ pounds} \]

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find the number of trips needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since partial trips are not possible):
\[ \text{Number of trips} = \left\lceil \frac{4500}{2250} \right\rceil = \left\lceil 2 \right\rceil = 2 \]

Therefore, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate her weekly earnings and then multiply by four.

First, let's calculate her weekly earnings from aluminum cans:
- Each aluminum can is worth 2 cents.
- She drinks 3 aluminum cans a week.

Weekly earnings from aluminum cans = 3 cans/week * 2 cents/can = 6 cents/week.

Next, let's calculate her weekly earnings from plastic bottles:
- Each plastic bottle is worth 3 cents.
- She drinks 5 plastic bottles a week.

Weekly earnings from plastic bottles = 5 bottles/week * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents/week.

Now, let's find her total weekly earnings by adding the earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles:
- Total weekly earnings = 6 cents/week (from cans) + 15 cents/week (from bottles) = 21 cents/week.

Finally, to find her total earnings for a four-week month, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4:
- Total earnings for four weeks = 21 cents/week * 4 weeks = 84 cents.

"First, we need to convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the shark's length is given in feet, we will convert the remoras' length from inches to feet.

1 foot = 12 inches

The length of each remora is 6 inches, which is:
\[ \frac{6 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 0.5 \text{ feet} \]

Since there are 2 remoras, the combined length of the remoras is:
\[ 2 \times 0.5 \text{ feet} = 1 \text{ foot} \]

Now, we need to find what percentage of the shark's body length (10 feet) is the combined length of the remoras (1 foot). The formula to calculate the percentage is:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Length of remoras}}{\text{Length of shark}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1 \text{ foot}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

"To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion. Let's define the sets as follows:

- Let \( D \) be the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- Let \( P \) be the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

From the problem, we know:
- \( |D| = 9 \) (the number of kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |P| = 6 \) (the number of kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |D \cap P| = 3 \) (the number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)

We need to find the number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both. This can be calculated using the principle of inclusion and exclusion:

\[
|D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P|
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
|D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12
\]

So, 12 kids are allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both. To find the number of kids who are not allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids allergic to either or both from the total number of kids in the class:

- Heather buys 2 packs, so the cost before any discounts is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) dollars.

Now, let's apply the ""buy one get one free"" offer. Since she is buying 2 packs, she will get 2 packs for free. Therefore, she only needs to pay for 2 packs, which is still $8.00.

Next, we apply the $2.00 coupon to the $8.00 cost:

- The total cost after applying the coupon is \(8 - 2 = 6\) dollars.

Now, we need to find the cost per razor. Since each pack contains 4 razors, 2 packs contain \(2 \times 4 = 8\) razors.

Finally, we calculate the cost per razor by dividing the total cost by the number of razors:

- The cost per razor is \(\frac{6}{8} = 0.75\) dollars.

To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100:

- \(0.75 \times 100 = 75\) cents.

So, the final numerical answer is 75 cents."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total height of the human pyramid by summing the heights of all the cheerleaders involved. We know that 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall, and the 10th cheerleader is 60 inches tall.

First, let's calculate the total height of the 9 cheerleaders who are 64 inches tall:
\[ 9 \times 64 = 576 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we add the height of the 10th cheerleader who is 60 inches tall:
\[ 576 + 60 = 636 \text{ inches} \]

The human pyramid consists of 4 girls on the bottom, 3 girls on top of the 4, and 2 girls on top of the 3, with the shortest girl at the top. This means the pyramid has a total of:
\[ 4 + 3 + 2 = 9 \text{ girls} \]

The total height of the human pyramid is 636 inches. To convert this height into feet, we use the conversion factor that 1 foot = 12 inches:
\[ \frac{636}{12} = 53 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 53 \text{ feet} \]"
"Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour. Since she works for 8 hours each day, the number of minutes she walks each day is:

\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ minutes/hour} = 40 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Over 5 days, the total number of minutes she has walked is:

\[ 40 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 200 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Brett's age in four years:**
   - Brett is currently 14 years old.
   - In four years, Brett will be \( 14 + 4 = 18 \) years old.

2. **Set up the equation for Angela's age in four years:**
   - According to the problem, in four years Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now.
   - Brett is currently 14 years old, so three times his current age is \( 3 \times 14 = 42 \).
   - Therefore, in four years, Angela will be 42 years old.

3. **Determine Angela's current age:**
   - If Angela will be 42 years old in four years, her current age is \( 42 - 4 = 38 \).

So, Angela is currently 38 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
38"
"To determine how much money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of his morning and afternoon rides separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the cost of the morning rides:
- Paul drives in the morning twice a day.
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- He drives for 14 days.

The total number of morning rides in 14 days is:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ morning rides} \]

The total cost for the morning rides is:
\[ 28 \text{ rides} \times 6 \text{ dollars/ride} = 168 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the afternoon rides:
- Paul drives in the afternoon twice a day.
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- He drives for 14 days.

The total number of afternoon rides in 14 days is:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ afternoon rides} \]

The total cost for the afternoon rides is:
\[ 28 \text{ rides} \times 2 \text{ dollars/ride} = 56 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we sum the costs of the morning and afternoon rides to find the total amount spent:
\[ 168 \text{ dollars} + 56 \text{ dollars} = 224 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is:
\[ \boxed{224} \]"
"First, let's determine how many oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Next, we need to find out how many oranges Brianne brought. Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, we add the total number of oranges brought by both Brianne and Ashley:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Each Greek orange pie requires three oranges. To find out how many pies they can make, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed per pie:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ oranges}}{3 \text{ oranges/pie}} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 40 \]"
"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let's denote the number of guests by \( n \).

**Cost at the first venue:**
- The flat fee is $200.
- Food for each guest costs $5.
- Therefore, the total cost at the first venue is:
  \[
  \text{Cost}_1 = 200 + 5n
  \]

**Cost at the second venue:**
- The cost per guest is $25.
- Food for each guest is already included in the price.
- Therefore, the total cost at the second venue is:
  \[
  \text{Cost}_2 = 25n
  \]

We need to find the number of guests \( n \) for which the costs are equal:
\[
200 + 5n = 25n
\]

To solve for \( n \), we first isolate \( n \) on one side of the equation:
\[
200 + 5n = 25n
\]
Subtract \( 5n \) from both sides:
\[
200 = 20n
\]
Divide both sides by 20:
\[
n = 10
\]

Thus, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \( 10 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \( D \). According to the problem, Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects. Additionally, David found half of what Bodhi found, so if Bodhi found \( B \) insects, then David found \( \frac{B}{2} \) insects. We know the total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (D + 7) + D + B = 43 \]

Since \( D = \frac{B}{2} \), we can substitute \( B \) with \( 2D \) in the equation:

\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ D = 9 \]

Now that we know David found 9 insects, we can find out how many insects Lily found. Since Lily found 7 more than David:

\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

So, Lily found 16 insects. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to calculate the total amount of yarn used by both of them and then convert that into yards.

Mariah used \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a skein of yarn, and her grandma used \(\frac{1}{2}\) of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein of yarn, we can calculate the amount of yarn used by each as follows:

- Mariah used \(\frac{1}{4} \times 364\) yards.
- Her grandma used \(\frac{1}{2} \times 364\) yards.

Let's calculate these values:

- Mariah's yarn usage: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 364 = 91\) yards.
- Her grandma's yarn usage: \(\frac{1}{2} \times 364 = 182\) yards.

Now, we add the two amounts together to find the total amount of yarn used:

\[ 91 + 182 = 273 \]

So, Mariah and her grandma used a total of 273 yards of yarn."
"First, let's calculate the number of gifts Cherrie buys for her 5 friends. Two of her friends want 5 gifts each, and the other three friends want 2 gifts each.

For the two friends who want 5 gifts each:
\[ 2 \text{ friends} \times 5 \text{ gifts per friend} = 10 \text{ gifts} \]

For the three friends who want 2 gifts each:
\[ 3 \text{ friends} \times 2 \text{ gifts per friend} = 6 \text{ gifts} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of gifts for her friends:
\[ 10 \text{ gifts} + 6 \text{ gifts} = 16 \text{ gifts} \]

Cherrie also decides to get 10 more random gifts as a surprise. So, we add these to the total:
\[ 16 \text{ gifts} + 10 \text{ gifts} = 26 \text{ gifts} \]

Therefore, the total number of gifts Cherrie bought is:
\[ 26 \]"
"First, let's determine the width of the rug. Since the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair and the chair is 3 feet wide, the width of the rug is:

\[ \text{Width of the rug} = \text{Width of the chair} + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the length of the couch. The problem states that the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Since the width of the rug is 8 feet, twice the width of the rug is:

\[ 2 \times \text{Width of the rug} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the length of the couch is:

\[ \text{Length of the couch} = 2 \times \text{Width of the rug} + 2 = 16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet} \]

So, the length of the couch is 18 feet."
"Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( S \). Suzie bought four packs of gum in total, with two packs being strawberry gum. Therefore, the cost of the strawberry gum is \( 2S \).

She also bought one pack of grape gum, which cost $2. She bought one small pack of green apple gum, which cost half as much as the grape gum, so it cost \( \frac{2}{2} = $1 \).

The total cost of all the gum is given as $7. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the total cost:

\[ 2S + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2S + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:

\[ 2S = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ S = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many 2 x 4 pieces Frederick can buy with $24. Each 2 x 4 costs $4.

\[ \text{Number of 2 x 4 pieces} = \frac{\$24}{\$4} = 6 \]

Next, let's determine how many 2 x 8 pieces Frederick can buy with $24. Each 2 x 8 costs $6.

\[ \text{Number of 2 x 8 pieces} = \frac{\$24}{\$6} = 4 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of popsicle sticks he can get from each type of wood.

For 2 x 4 pieces:
\[ \text{Total sticks from 2 x 4} = 6 \times 200 = 1200 \]

For 2 x 8 pieces:
\[ \text{Total sticks from 2 x 8} = 4 \times 400 = 1600 \]

Since Frederick wants to buy the cheapest lumber, he should buy the 2 x 4 pieces. Therefore, the most popsicle sticks he can make is from the 2 x 4 pieces.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1200 \]"
"To determine the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his sled dogs, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
2. Determine the number of pairs of legs (since each pair of snowshoes is for one pair of legs).
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of pairs of legs.

First, we know that each dog has 4 legs and there are 6 dogs:
\[ 4 \text{ legs/dog} \times 6 \text{ dogs} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Since each pair of snowshoes covers one pair of legs, we need to find out how many pairs of legs there are:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs/pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs of legs} \]

Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, so the total cost for 12 pairs of snowshoes is:
\[ 12 \text{ pairs} \times 12 \text{ dollars/pair} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of Janet's current bus trips. She takes two bus trips each day and does this five days a week. Therefore, the number of bus trips she takes in a week is:

\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 10 \text{ trips/week} \]

Each bus trip costs her $2.20, so the total cost for her bus trips in a week is:

\[ 10 \text{ trips/week} \times \$2.20/\text{trip} = \$22.00 \text{ per week} \]

Next, we compare this to the cost of buying a weekly bus pass, which is $20. The savings from buying the bus pass instead of paying for individual trips each week is:

\[ \$22.00 - \$20.00 = \$2.00 \]

So, Janet would save $2.00 by buying a weekly bus pass."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Farm's Cows and Sheep:**
   - The farm has 30 cows.
   - The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has \(2 \times 30 = 60\) cows.

2. **Zoo's Cows and Sheep:**
   - The zoo has 20 sheep.
   - The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has \(\frac{20}{2} = 10\) sheep.

3. **Total Animals:**
   - The farm has 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.
   - The zoo has 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.
   - Combined, the farm and zoo have 40 + 80 = 120 animals.

"To determine how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we start by understanding the relationship between the quantities bought by Sophia and Rose. According to the problem, Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.

Given:
- Rose bought 12 onions.
- Rose bought 4 potatoes.

Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as \( S_o \) and the number of potatoes Sophia bought as \( S_p \).

From the problem, we know:
\[ 4 \times (S_o + S_p) = 12 + 4 \]

First, we calculate the total number of onions and potatoes Rose bought:
\[ 12 + 4 = 16 \]

Now, we set up the equation:
\[ 4 \times (S_o + S_p) = 16 \]

To find \( S_o + S_p \), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ S_o + S_p = \frac{16}{4} = 4 \]

Thus, Sophia bought a total of 4 onions and potatoes. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we first need to calculate the total number of calories he needs to burn to lose 30 pounds. Given that he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose one pound, the total calories he needs to burn to lose 30 pounds is:

\[ 3500 \text{ calories/pound} \times 30 \text{ pounds} = 105000 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to determine the number of days from December 31st to July 19th. We can break this down into months:

- December: 31 days
- January: 31 days
- February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
- March: 31 days
- April: 30 days
- May: 31 days
- June: 30 days
- July (up to July 19th): 19 days

Adding these together gives:

\[ 31 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 221 \text{ days} \]

Now, to find the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to maintain, we divide the total calories he needs to burn by the number of days:

\[ \frac{105000 \text{ calories}}{221 \text{ days}} \approx 475.64 \text{ calories/day} \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, Andy needs to maintain a daily calorie deficit of approximately 476 calories each day to reach his goal."

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, the house cost three times as much as the lot, so we can write:

\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

To find \( L \), we divide both sides by 4:

\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000 \]

Now that we know the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):

Total cost = Number of packs × Cost per pack
Total cost = 8 × $4
Total cost = $32

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the canvas bags. Tara sold each of the 40 canvas bags (8 packs × 5 bags per pack) for $8 each.

Total revenue = Number of bags sold × Selling price per bag
Total revenue = 40 × $8
Total revenue = $320

Now, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

"First, let's determine the number of quarts each person can pick per hour:

- Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.
- Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
- Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick \(5 \times 2 = 10\) quarts per hour.
- Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than does Kathy, so Ricky can pick \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, let's add up the quarts picked per hour by all four individuals:

\[ 6 \text{ (Tony)} + 5 \text{ (Bobby)} + 10 \text{ (Kathy)} + 8 \text{ (Ricky)} = 29 \]

"To determine how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we first need to find out how many cups of raisins she will have for the oatmeal cookies after dividing the bag equally among the three items (oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix).

The total amount of raisins is 27 cups. If she divides the raisins equally among the three items, each item will get:
\[ \frac{27 \text{ cups}}{3} = 9 \text{ cups} \]

Since each batch of oatmeal cookies requires \(\frac{3}{4}\) of a cup of raisins, the number of batches of oatmeal cookies she can make is:
\[ \frac{9 \text{ cups}}{\frac{3}{4} \text{ cups per batch}} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 12 \]

So, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"First, let's calculate Ada's daily electric consumption before and after adding the new device.

**Before adding the new device:**
- Daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour
- Cost per kilowatt per hour: $1.50

Daily cost before = 12 kilowatts/hour * $1.50/kilowatt/hour = $18.00

**After adding the new device:**
- Daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour + 2 kilowatts per hour = 14 kilowatts per hour
- Cost per kilowatt per hour: $1.50

Daily cost after = 14 kilowatts/hour * $1.50/kilowatt/hour = $21.00

Next, we calculate the weekly costs.

**Weekly cost before:**
- Weekly cost = Daily cost * 7 days
- Weekly cost before = $18.00/day * 7 days = $126.00

**Weekly cost after:**
- Weekly cost = Daily cost * 7 days
- Weekly cost after = $21.00/day * 7 days = $147.00

Finally, we find the difference between the weekly costs before and after adding the new device.

Difference = Weekly cost after - Weekly cost before
Difference = $147.00 - $126.00 = $21.00

The difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is $21.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which one person paints and then scale it up for 5 people.

1. One person can paint half a house in 5 days. Therefore, one person can paint a whole house in 10 days.
2. The rate of one person painting a house is \(\frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}}\).
3. If 5 people are working together, their combined rate is \(5 \times \frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{2 \text{ days}}\).
4. This means that 5 people can paint a whole house in 2 days.
5. Since there are 24 hours in a day, 2 days is equal to \(2 \times 24 = 48\) hours.

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

The final numerical answer is:
48"
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of sofas and chairs Ophelia has:**
   - Ophelia has 20 sofas.
   - Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. Let \( C_O \) represent the number of chairs Ophelia has.
   - Therefore, \( C_O = S_O + 2 \), where \( S_O \) is the number of sofas Ophelia has.
   - Given \( S_O = 20 \), we can calculate \( C_O \):
     \[
     C_O = 20 + 2 = 22
     \]

2. **Determine the number of chairs Jenna has:**
   - Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. Let \( C_J \) represent the number of chairs Jenna has.
   - Therefore, \( C_J = 3 \times C_O \).
   - Given \( C_O = 22 \), we can calculate \( C_J \):
     \[
     C_J = 3 \times 22 = 66
     \]

3. **Determine the number of sofas Jenna has:**
   - Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. Let \( S_J \) represent the number of sofas Jenna has.
   - Therefore, \( S_J = C_J - 2 \).
   - Given \( C_J = 66 \), we can calculate \( S_J \):
     \[
     S_J = 66 - 2 = 64
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of sofas and chairs:**
   - Total sofas = \( S_O + S_J \)
   - Total chairs = \( C_O + C_J \)
   - Substituting the values we found:
     \[
     \text{Total sofas} = 20 + 64 = 84
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total chairs} = 22 + 66 = 88

"To determine how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had not purchased the headphone set, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the cost of the headphone set.
2. Calculate the total amount Tom would have spent if he had not bought the headphone set.
3. Calculate how many CDs Tom could have bought with the remaining amount.

First, we know that Tom paid $48 in total and that the CD cost $4. Therefore, the cost of the headphone set is:
\[ 48 - 4 = 44 \]

If Tom had not bought the headphone set, he would have had:
\[ 48 - 44 = 4 \]
dollars left to spend on CDs. Since each CD costs $4, the number of CDs he could have bought with $4 is:
\[ \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

So, Tom would have been able to buy 1 more CD if he had not bought the headphone set. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we need to account for the hours he worked out each week, taking into consideration the exceptions.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

**First Stop:**
- 8 people get off the bus.
- The number of people who get on the bus is 5 times the number who got off, which is \(5 \times 8 = 40\).

So, the number of people on the bus after the first stop is:
\[ 48 - 8 + 40 = 80 \]

**Second Stop:**
- 21 people get off the bus.
- The number of people who get on the bus is 3 times fewer than those who got off, which means they get on 3 times more than those who got off, so \(3 \times 21 = 63\).

So, the number of people on the bus after the second stop is:
\[ 80 - 21 + 63 = 122 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, Jame's current age is \( 27 - 5 = 22 \) years.

2. **Determine the cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 22 + 8 = 30 \) years old.
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \).
   - Therefore, Jame's cousin will be \( 60 - 5 = 55 \) years old in 8 years.

3. **Determine the cousin's current age:**
   - If Jame's cousin will be 55 in 8 years, then the cousin's current age is \( 55 - 8 = 47 \) years.

4. **Calculate the age difference between Jame and his cousin:**
   - Jame is currently 22 years old.
   - Jame's cousin is currently 47 years old.

"Let's break down the information given:

- The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400.
- The computer costs $1,100.
- The printer costs $400 less than the computer, so the printer costs $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the computer and the printer:
- Cost of the computer: $1,100
- Cost of the printer: $700
- Total cost of the computer and the printer: $1,100 + $700 = $1,800

Since the total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400, we can find the total cost of the 2 monitors by subtracting the total cost of the computer and the printer from the total cost:
- Total cost of the computer and the printer: $1,800
- Total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer: $2,400
- Total cost of the 2 monitors: $2,400 - $1,800 = $600

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the total cost of the 2 monitors by 2:
- Total cost of the 2 monitors: $600
- Cost of one monitor: $600 / 2 = $300

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is $300.

The final numerical answer is:
300"
"To find out how many seashells each girl brought, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of boys and girls.
2. Calculate the total number of seashells brought by the boys.
3. Calculate the total number of seashells brought by the girls.

First, since there are 20 kids in total and they are divided into two equal groups of girls and boys, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

Next, each boy brought back 60 seashells. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is:
\[ 10 \text{ boys} \times 60 \text{ seashells/boy} = 600 \text{ seashells} \]

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. So, the total number of seashells brought by the girls is:
\[ 600 \text{ seashells} + 4 \times 600 \text{ seashells} = 600 \text{ seashells} + 2400 \text{ seashells} = 3000 \text{ seashells} \]

Since there are 10 girls, the number of seashells each girl brought is:
\[ \frac{3000 \text{ seashells}}{10 \text{ girls}} = 300 \text{ seashells/girl} \]

Thus, the number of seashells brought by each girl is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"

3. The thickness of the third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm.
4. The thickness of the fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm.

Now, we sum the thicknesses of all four books:
\[31 + 50 + 45 + 62\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[31 + 50 = 81\]
\[81 + 45 = 126\]
\[126 + 62 = 188\]

1. **Total Monthly Savings Target**: $1125

2. **Assume April has 30 days**: 
   - First half of April: 15 days
   - Second half of April: 15 days

3. **Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves in the first half of April**:
   - In the second half of April, Elvis saves \( 2x \) per day.

4. **Total savings in the second half of April**:
   - Total savings in the second half = \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \)

5. **Total savings in the first half of April**:
   - Total savings in the first half = \( 15x \)

6. **Total savings in April**:
   - Total savings = Savings in the first half + Savings in the second half
   - \( 15x + 30x = 45x \)

7. **Set up the equation to solve for \( x \)**:
   - \( 45x = 1125 \)

8. **Solve for \( x \)**:

"To determine the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Rewriting**: Elise writes the entire alphabet twice.
   - The alphabet has 26 letters.
   - Therefore, writing it twice means \(26 \times 2 = 52\) letters.

2. **Second Rewriting**: Elise writes half of the alphabet once.
   - Half of the alphabet is \(26 / 2 = 13\) letters.
   - Therefore, writing half of the alphabet once means \(13\) letters.

3. **Third Rewriting**: Elise rewrites everything she has already written.
   - This includes the two full alphabets and the half alphabet.
   - The total number of letters already written is \(52 + 13 = 65\).

"First, let's determine how long it takes Ray to swim a mile when the water is warm.

Given:
- When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.
- When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold.

Let's calculate the time it takes to swim a mile in warm water:
- Twice the time it takes in cold water is \(2 \times 16 = 32\) minutes.
- Adding 2 minutes to this gives \(32 + 2 = 34\) minutes.

So, it takes Ray 34 minutes to swim a mile in warm water.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water:
- In cold water, it takes \(16 \times 3 = 48\) minutes to swim 3 miles.
- In warm water, it takes \(34 \times 3 = 102\) minutes to swim 3 miles.

Finally, to find out how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day compared to a cold day, we subtract the time taken in cold water from the time taken in warm water:

Next, we add the cost of the foot-long fish sub and the six-inch cold-cut combo sub to find the total cost:

\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \]

So, the total cost for lunch today at Subway is $160."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes in all the buttons.

First, we know that there are 21 buttons in total. Out of these, 7 buttons have 2 holes each. So, the number of holes in these 7 buttons is:
\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ holes} \]

The rest of the buttons have 4 holes each. Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 of them have 2 holes, the number of buttons that have 4 holes is:
\[ 21 - 7 = 14 \text{ buttons} \]

The number of holes in these 14 buttons is:
\[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \text{ holes} \]

Now, we add the number of holes from both types of buttons to get the total number of holes:
\[ 14 + 56 = 70 \text{ holes} \]

So, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is:
\[ 70 \]"
"First, we need to determine the volume of Zack's locker. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we calculate:

\[ \text{Volume of Zack's locker} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Volume of Timothy's locker} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 = 12 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we need to find the volume of Peter's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we calculate:

\[ \text{Volume of Peter's locker} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Volume of Zack's locker} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ cubic inches} \]

So, the volume of Peter's locker is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, let's determine the daily recommended cups of coffee for Octavia. Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, if the daily recommended cups of coffee is \( R \), then Octavia drinks \( \frac{R}{2} \) cups of coffee.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks. Therefore, Juan drinks \( 10 \times \frac{R}{2} = 5R \) cups of coffee.

According to Juan's doctor, Juan's coffee intake should be reduced to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. Since Juan is currently drinking \( 5R \) cups of coffee, we need to find out how many cups he must reduce to reach the daily recommendation of 4 cups.

The reduction in coffee intake for Juan is:
\[ 5R - 4 \]

To find the exact number of cups Juan must reduce, we need to know the value of \( R \), the daily recommended cups of coffee. However, since the problem does not provide the value of \( R \), we can express the reduction in terms of \( R \).

The reduction in cups of coffee that Juan must make is:
\[ 5R - 4 \]

Since the problem does not provide the value of \( R \), we cannot determine a specific numerical answer. However, if we assume the daily recommended cups of coffee \( R \) is such that the reduction can be calculated, the final answer in terms of \( R \) is:
\[ 5R - 4 \]

If we assume a specific value for \( R \) (for example, if \( R = 8 \) cups), then:
\[ 5 \times 8 - 4 = 40 - 4 = 36 \]

So, the reduction in cups of coffee that Juan must make is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]

Without a specific value for \( R \), the general answer is:
\[ \boxed{5R - 4} \]"
"To find the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then add them together.

- Therefore, the total number of hamsters is \(3 \times 10 = 30\).

Next, we calculate the number of guinea pigs:
- There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each.
- Therefore, the total number of guinea pigs is \(3 \times 5 = 15\).

Now, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs to find the total number of rodents:
- The total number of rodents is \(30 + 15 = 45\).

So, the pet shop had a total of 45 rodents."
"First, let's determine the weights of Susan and Bob.

Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark. Since Mark weighs 150 pounds, Susan's weight is:
\[ 150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds} \]

Bob weighs twice as much as Susan. Since Susan weighs 130 pounds, Bob's weight is:
\[ 2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we can find the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob. The average weight is calculated by summing their weights and dividing by the number of people (which is 3 in this case):
\[ \text{Average weight} = \frac{150 + 130 + 260}{3} = \frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 180 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the angle the sun makes with the ground after moving for 10 hours and the angle the pyramid makes with the ground.

Initially, the sun is at the tip of the pyramid, which is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground. The sun moves upward at a rate of 5 degrees per hour. Over 10 hours, the sun will move upward by:

\[ 5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the angle the sun makes with the ground after 10 hours will be the sum of the initial angle and the angle it has moved upward:

\[ 32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 82 \]"
"To determine how much James spends on candles, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the ages of the two sons.
2. Calculate the total number of candles needed.
3. Determine how many packs of candles are required.
4. Calculate the total cost.

First, we know that one son is 12 years old and the other is 4 years younger. Therefore, the second son is:
\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of candles needed for both sons:
\[ 12 + 8 = 20 \text{ candles} \]

Since each pack contains 5 candles, we need to determine how many packs are required to get at least 20 candles:
\[ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \text{ packs} \]

Each pack costs $3, so the total cost for 4 packs is:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \]

Therefore, the total amount James spends on candles is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the pages read in the first week and add it to the pages read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week. She read for 15 minutes each night for 7 nights, so the total reading time in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pages she can read in 105 minutes. Since she can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, we first find out how many 1.5-minute intervals are in 105 minutes:
\[ \frac{105 \text{ minutes}}{1.5 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 70 \text{ intervals} \]

Since she reads 2 pages in each 1.5-minute interval, the total number of pages read in the first week is:
\[ 70 \text{ intervals} \times 2 \text{ pages/interval} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

Now, we know that in the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many sandwiches Cody ate. Cody ate a third of the 12 sandwiches:

\[
\text{Sandwiches eaten by Cody} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
\]

Next, we calculate how many sandwiches Trevor ate. Trevor ate a quarter of the 12 sandwiches:

\[
\text{Sandwiches eaten by Trevor} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3
\]

Now, we add the number of sandwiches eaten by Cody and Trevor to find the total number of sandwiches they ate together:

\[
\text{Total sandwiches eaten} = 4 + 3 = 7
\]

Finally, we subtract the total number of sandwiches eaten from the original number of sandwiches to find out how many sandwiches are left:

\[
\text{Sandwiches left} = 12 - 7 = 5
\]

The final numerical answer is:

\[
5

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equation based on the information given.

Let \( S \) be Shiloh's current age, and let \( N \) be his nephew's current age. According to the problem, Shiloh is currently 44 years old, so \( S = 44 \).

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( S + 7 \). At that time, his nephew's age will be \( N + 7 \). The problem states that in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Substituting \( S = 44 \) into the equation, we get:

\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Simplifying the left side:

\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Next, we divide both sides by 3:

\[ 17 = N + 7 \]

Then, we subtract 7 from both sides to solve for \( N \):

\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the total amount of money Sharon received from the tooth fairy.

1. For the first tooth, the tooth fairy left $5.00.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy left $1.00 each.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy left half the amount of $1.00, which is $0.50 each.

Let's calculate the total amount step by step:

- For the first tooth: $5.00
- For the next three teeth: $1.00 each, so $1.00 * 3 = $3.00
- For the last two teeth: $0.50 each, so $0.50 * 2 = $1.00

Now, we sum up all the amounts:

\[ 5.00 + 3.00 + 1.00 = 9.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is $9.00.

\[
\boxed{9.00}

"To find out how many goals all three teenagers scored, we need to determine the number of goals each teenager scored based on the information provided.

1. We know that Richie scored 80 goals.
2. According to the problem, Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. Therefore, we can calculate the number of goals Mark scored as follows:
   \[
   \text{Goals scored by Mark} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 20 = 80 - 20 = 60
   \]
3. The problem also states that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. Therefore, we can calculate the number of goals Anna scored as follows:
   \[
   \text{Goals scored by Anna} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 45 = 80 - 45 = 35
   \]

Now, we sum the goals scored by all three teenagers:
\[
\text{Total goals} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} + \text{Goals scored by Mark} + \text{Goals scored by Anna} = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175
\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[

\[ 21 \text{ lemonades} \times 4 \text{ dollars/lemonade} = 84 \text{ dollars} \]

Liam claimed to have made $63. To find out how many more dollars Mitchell made than Liam, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings:
\[ 84 \text{ dollars} - 63 \text{ dollars} = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 21 \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Peter spends each day. Since he has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week (7 days), he spends:

\[ \frac{70}{7} = 10 \text{ dollars per day} \]

Next, we calculate how much money Peter spends on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. This is 4 days, so he spends:

\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Since each wooden action figure costs $5, the number of wooden action figures he buys is:

\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \text{ wooden action figures} \]

After spending $40 on wooden action figures, Peter has:

\[ 70 - 40 = 30 \text{ dollars left} \]

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Sunday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. The number of plastic action figures he can buy with the remaining $30 is:

\[ \frac{30}{2} = 15 \text{ plastic action figures} \]

Adding the wooden and plastic action figures together, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is:

The error is:
\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage error is:
\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

Now, we need to apply this 4% error to the temperature of 520 degrees to find the correct temperature setting.

The error in degrees for 520 degrees is:
\[ 520 \times \frac{4}{100} = 520 \times 0.04 = 20 \]

"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch both movies, we need to add the duration of the first movie to the duration of the second movie.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Converting this to minutes:
1 hour = 60 minutes
So, 1 hour and 30 minutes = 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting this to minutes:
2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes
So, 2 hours and 5 minutes = 120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes.

90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is 215 minutes."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we first need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and then subtract that from Herb's price.

Herb's house price = $76,000

30% of Herb's house price = 0.30 * $76,000 = $22,800

Juan's house price = Herb's house price - 30% of Herb's house price
Juan's house price = $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

Now, we add the prices of both houses to find the combined value:

Combined value = Herb's house price + Juan's house price
Combined value = $76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200

The final numerical answer is $129,200."
"First, let's determine the number of cups and dishes Judy initially bought.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups.

She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.

At the event, her friend brought 40 cups. Since Judy initially bought 12 cups, her friend brought \(40 - 12 = 28\) more cups than Judy bought.

Her friend also brought 20 more dishes than Judy's initial purchase of 24 dishes. Therefore, her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend.

Judy's total cups: \(12 + 28 = 40\) cups.
Judy's total dishes: \(24 + 44 = 68\) dishes.

The total number of utensils (cups and dishes) brought by both is:

"First, let's determine the cost of one box of contacts after the 10% discount. The original price of one box is $100.00. A 10% discount on $100.00 is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Discount} = 100.00 \times \frac{10}{100} = 10.00 \]

So, the price of one box after the discount is:

\[ \text{Discounted Price} = 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

Since Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost for 2 boxes is:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost per pair of contacts. Since each box contains 90 single use contacts and each pair consists of 2 contacts, the number of pairs per box is:

\[ \text{Pairs per Box} = \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

Therefore, the cost per pair of contacts is:

\[ \text{Cost per Pair} = \frac{180.00}{45} = 4.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 4.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total hours Jill worked.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so:
\[ \text{Total hours Jill worked} = 2 + 1 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total hours John worked.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so:
\[ \text{Hours John worked on Saturday} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so:
\[ \text{Hours John worked on Sunday} = 3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Adding these together gives the total hours John worked:
\[ \text{Total hours John worked} = 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the total earnings for both Jill and John.

Jill's earnings:
\[ \text{Earnings for Jill} = 3 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$30 \]

John's earnings:
\[ \text{Earnings for John} = 7 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$70 \]

Finally, we find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill:
\[ \text{Difference in earnings} = \$70 - \$30 = \$40 \]

"First, let's calculate the total calories burned by Hannah during her workout.

For the aerobics:
- She spends 2 hours doing aerobics.
- Aerobics burn 500 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from aerobics = 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.

For the running:
- She spends 1 hour running.
- Running burns 600 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from running = 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.

Now, let's add the calories burned from both activities to get the total calories burned:
- Total calories burned = 1000 calories (from aerobics) + 600 calories (from running) = 1600 calories.

Next, we need to determine how much water Hannah needs to drink. She needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns.

To find out how much water she needs to drink for 1600 calories:
- For 200 calories, she drinks 100 ml of water.
- For 1600 calories, she drinks \( \frac{1600 \text{ calories}}{200 \text{ calories}} \times 100 \text{ ml} = 8 \times 100 \text{ ml} = 800 \text{ ml} \).

"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the note, the number of red jelly beans is 1% less than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \). Similarly, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of the red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \), we find:
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
- The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \).
- The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \).

The difference between the number of green and red jelly beans is:
\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 30 \]"
"To find the average of the three measurements of Jared's typing speed, we first need to determine the typing speeds for each of the three tests.

1. Initial speed: 47 WPM
2. Speed after lessons: 52 WPM
3. Speed after further increase: 52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM

Now, we calculate the average of these three speeds. The formula for the average is:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum of the speeds}}{\text{Number of speeds}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{47 + 52 + 57}{3}
\]

First, we find the sum of the speeds:

\[
47 + 52 + 57 = 156
\]

Next, we divide the sum by the number of speeds (which is 3):

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{156}{3} = 52
\]

So, the average of the three measurements is 52 WPM."

"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees, and the other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees. The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees and \( 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees. The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The measure of the largest angle in the triangle is \(\boxed{90}\) degrees."
"First, we need to determine the total amount of money Colby has in cents. We can do this by converting each type of coin to cents and then summing them up.

- Quarters: 8 quarters * 25 cents/quarter = 200 cents
- Dimes: 6 dimes * 10 cents/dime = 60 cents
- Nickels: 14 nickels * 5 cents/nickel = 70 cents
- Pennies: 15 pennies * 1 cent/penny = 15 cents

Now, we add up all the cents:
200 cents (from quarters) + 60 cents (from dimes) + 70 cents (from nickels) + 15 cents (from pennies) = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we divide the total amount of money Colby has by the cost of one gumball to find out how many gumballs he can buy:
345 cents / 5 cents/gumball = 69 gumballs

"To determine how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade over 6 hours, we need to calculate his earnings for each period separately and then sum them up.

First, for the first 4 hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.

The total number of cups sold in the first 4 hours is:
\[ 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

The total earnings from the first 4 hours are:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = \$30 \]

"First, we need to determine the total number of rotations the tires go through in a month. Given that the car drives 400 miles a month and the tires rotate 725 times for every 2 miles, we can calculate the total rotations per month as follows:

\[ \text{Rotations per mile} = \frac{725}{2} \]
\[ \text{Rotations per month} = 400 \times \frac{725}{2} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of rotations per month:

\[ \text{Rotations per month} = 400 \times 362.5 = 145000 \]

Now, we need to find out how many months the tires can last before they need to be replaced. We know that each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations. Since there are four tires on the car, the total number of rotations the car can make before the tires need to be replaced is:

\[ \text{Total rotations per car} = 10,440,000 \times 4 = 41,760,000 \]

Now, we calculate the number of months the tires can last:

\[ \text{Months} = \frac{41,760,000}{145000} \]

Finally, we convert the number of months into years:

\[ \text{Years} = \frac{\text{Months}}{12} \]

Let's perform the calculations:

\[ \text{Months} = \frac{41,760,000}{145000} = 288 \]
\[ \text{Years} = \frac{288}{12} = 24 \]

So, the tires need to be replaced after 24 years. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the cost of each pump in cents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of washes Jackie can get from one bottle of shampoo.
2. Determine the cost per wash.
3. Convert the cost per wash into cents.

First, we know that the bottle gives 120 washes with 2 pumps. Since Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, she will get 120 washes from one bottle.

The cost of the bottle is $24.00. To find the cost per wash, we divide the total cost by the total number of washes:

\[
\text{Cost per wash} = \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ washes}} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per wash}
\]

Since we need the cost in cents, we convert dollars to cents (1 dollar = 100 cents):

\[
0.20 \text{ dollars} = 0.20 \times 100 \text{ cents} = 20 \text{ cents}
\]

Therefore, the cost of each pump is 20 cents.

"First, we need to calculate the discounted price of the shirt and the shorts. The shirt originally costs $25, and there is a 30% off sale.

The discount on the shirt is:
\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]

So, the discounted price of the shirt is:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

The shorts originally cost $35, and there is also a 30% off sale.

The discount on the shorts is:
\[ 35 \times 0.30 = 10.50 \]

So, the discounted price of the shorts is:
\[ 35 - 10.50 = 24.50 \]

Next, we add the discounted prices of the shirt and the shorts to find the total cost of the outfit:
\[ 17.50 + 24.50 = 42.00 \]

"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the funding into two parts: the initial 5 months and the extended 5 months.

1. **Initial Funding:**
   - John receives $100,000 for the first 5 months.
   - Cost for the first 5 months = $100,000.

2. **Extended Funding:**
   - The research takes 10 times the initial 5 months, which means it takes 10 * 5 = 50 months in total.
   - The first 5 months are already accounted for, so the extended period is 50 - 5 = 45 months.
   - The funding for each month after the first 5 months is 50% more than the initial $100,000 / 5 = $20,000 per month.
   - Therefore, the funding per month for the extended period is $20,000 * 1.5 = $30,000 per month.
   - Total cost for the extended 45 months = 45 * $30,000 = $1,350,000.

3. **Total Cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost for the first 5 months + Cost for the extended 45 months
   - Total cost = $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000.

The total cost of John's research is $1,450,000."
"To determine the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to calculate the meat consumption for each player and then sum these amounts.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each weighing 1 ounce. Therefore, the second player ate \(8 \times 1 = 8\) ounces of meat.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces of meat.
4. The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Now, we sum the meat consumption of the first three players:
\[ 6 \text{ ounces} + 8 \text{ ounces} + 16 \text{ ounces} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Thus, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is \(\boxed{30}\)."

"First, let's determine how many pieces of gum Jim chews during the school day. Since the school day lasts 8 hours and he chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours, he chews:
\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ pieces of gum during the school day.} \]

Additionally, he chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, so he chews:
\[ 1 + 1 = 2 \text{ pieces of gum outside of school.} \]

So, the total number of pieces of gum Jim chews during the day is:
\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pieces of gum.} \]

Initially, Jim has a 20-pack of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, the number of pieces of gum left is:
\[ 20 - 6 = 14 \text{ pieces of gum.} \]

Next, Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister right before bed. So, he gives away:
\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ pieces of gum.} \]

"To determine Ashley's internet connection speed in megabits per hour (Mb/h), we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the internet speed from kilobits per second (kb/s) to megabits per second (Mb/s).
2. Convert the speed from megabits per second to megabits per hour.

First, we know that:
- Ashley's internet speed is 20 kb/s.
- 1 Mb = 1000 kb.

So, to convert kb/s to Mb/s, we divide the kilobits per second by 1000:
\[ 20 \, \text{kb/s} = \frac{20}{1000} \, \text{Mb/s} = 0.02 \, \text{Mb/s} \]

Next, to convert Mb/s to Mb/h, we need to consider that there are 3600 seconds in an hour:
\[ 0.02 \, \text{Mb/s} \times 3600 \, \text{s/h} = 72 \, \text{Mb/h} \]

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed in Mb per hour is:

"To calculate the total number of cars towed by the tow truck over the week, we can break down the problem into two parts: the first three days and the last four days.

For the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day. Therefore, the total number of cars pulled in the first three days is:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

For the remaining four days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day than it did on the first three days. Since it pulled 10 cars each day on the first three days, it pulled:
\[ 10 \text{ cars} - 4 \text{ cars} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]
Therefore, the total number of cars pulled in the last four days is:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Adding the number of cars pulled over the first three days and the last four days gives us the total number of cars towed that week:
\[ 30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars} \]

So, the total number of cars towed that week is:
\[ \boxed{54} \]"
"First, we need to convert Adam's current height from inches to feet to compare it with the required height. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, Adam's height in feet is:

\[ 40 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{40}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The minimum height required to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. Therefore, Adam needs to grow:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Adam grows 2 inches per year, which is equivalent to \(\frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6}\) feet per year. To find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet, we divide \(\frac{2}{3}\) by \(\frac{1}{6}\):

\[ \frac{2}{3} \div \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Therefore, Adam will be tall enough to ride the roller coaster in 4 years. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 cars James sold:
\[ \text{Total cost of cars} = 10 \times \$25,000 = \$250,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount the company paid to acquire these cars:
\[ \text{Cost to acquire the cars} = 30\% \times \$250,000 = 0.30 \times \$250,000 = \$75,000 \]

Now, we find the total profit from selling the cars:
\[ \text{Total profit} = \text{Total cost of cars} - \text{Cost to acquire the cars} = \$250,000 - \$75,000 = \$175,000 \]

James gets a 10% commission on the profits:
\[ \text{James's commission} = 10\% \times \$175,000 = 0.10 \times \$175,000 = \$17,500 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$17,500 \]"
"First, let's determine how many riders can stay upright on a wave over 30 feet. According to the information, only 25% of the riders can stay upright. If there are 100 riders, then:

\[ \text{Riders who can stay upright} = 25\% \times 100 = 0.25 \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 25 riders are women. We know that 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women. Therefore:

\[ \text{Women who can stay upright} = 60\% \times 25 = 0.60 \times 25 = 15 \]

To find the number of men who can stay upright, we subtract the number of women who can stay upright from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

\[ \text{Men who can stay upright} = 25 - 15 = 10 \]

So, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, let's determine the price of the gold jewel. Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000 and the price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

\[
\text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600
\]

Next, we need to find the price of the silver jewel. The problem states that the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of the gold jewel. Therefore, we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

\[
\text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
\]

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by summing the prices of the diamond jewel, the gold jewel, and the silver jewel:

\[
\text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800

"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between him and Bob.

First, let's find the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap. Since Bob is driving at 55 mph and Tom is driving at 70 mph, the difference in their speeds is:
\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is closing the 75-mile gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. To find the time it takes for Tom to close this gap, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the maximum cost per class and then find out how many classes he can attend without exceeding this cost.

First, let's denote the total cost of the 10 classes as \( C \). The total cost is given as $60. If the cost per class exceeds $10, his parents will not sign him up again. Therefore, we need to find the maximum number of classes \( n \) such that the cost per class is not more than $10.

The cost per class if he attends \( n \) classes is:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{n} \]

We need this cost to be less than or equal to $10:
\[ \frac{60}{n} \leq 10 \]

To find \( n \), we solve the inequality:
\[ 60 \leq 10n \]
\[ n \geq 6 \]

This means Manny can miss up to \( 10 - 6 = 4 \) classes and still be within the $10 per class limit.

Thus, the number of classes Manny can miss before his parents don't sign him up again is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we first need to find out how many customers each of them processes in a day.

Given:
- Jewel processes 50 customers per day.
- Julie processes twice as many customers as Jewel per day.

First, calculate the number of customers Julie processes per day:
\[ \text{Customers processed by Julie per day} = 2 \times \text{Customers processed by Jewel per day} = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Next, calculate the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel in one day:
\[ \text{Total customers processed per day} = \text{Customers processed by Julie per day} + \text{Customers processed by Jewel per day} = 100 + 50 = 150 \]

Now, calculate the total number of customers processed in a week (7 days):
\[ \text{Total customers processed per week} = \text{Total customers processed per day} \times 7 = 150 \times 7 = 1050 \]

The total weekly production for the two is:

"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the hole:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 3 \]

Now, let's calculate the volume:

\[ V = 72 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to determine the total time it will take Bob to dig this volume of earth. We know that it takes him 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) in seconds is:

\[ T = \text{volume} \times \text{time per cubic foot} \]

Substituting the volume and the time per cubic foot:

\[ T = 72 \times 3 \]

Now, let's calculate the total time:

\[ T = 216 \text{ seconds} \]

To convert the time into minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Alisa}} = 12 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4.5 \, \text{hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Alisa}} = 54 \, \text{miles} \]

For Stanley:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Stanley}} = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2.5 \, \text{hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Stanley}} = 25 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we add the distances together to find the total distance biked by both:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Alisa}} + \text{Distance}_{\text{Stanley}} \]
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 54 \, \text{miles} + 25 \, \text{miles} \]
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 79 \, \text{miles} \]

"To determine the total time Bill will take to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay separately, and then sum these times.

First, let's calculate the time to dig through the soil:
- Bill digs at a rate of 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He needs to dig 24 feet of soil.

\[
\text{Time to dig through soil} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, let's calculate the time to dig through the clay:
- Bill digs at a rate of half of 4 feet per hour, which is 2 feet per hour, through clay.
- He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.

\[
\text{Time to dig through clay} = \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours}
\]

Now, we sum the times to get the total time to dig the well:

\[
\text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours}
\]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the final price Clara paid for the pomegranates on Tuesday.

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

She got a $2 discount, so the final price Clara paid is:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the final price Sheila paid for the pomegranates on Wednesday.

The price per pomegranate on Wednesday is $30, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount is:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final price Sheila paid is:
\[ 600 - 60 = 540 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila:
\[ 540 - 398 = 142 \text{ dollars} \]

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:
\[ \boxed{142} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the sales from green hats in the first month:**
   - The sales from red hats in the first month were $400.
   - The sales from green hats in the first month were twice the sales from red hats.
   - Therefore, the sales from green hats in the first month = $400 * 2 = $800.

2. **Calculate the total sales for the first month:**
   - Total sales in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
   - Total sales in the first month = $400 + $800 = $1200.

3. **Determine the sales from green hats in the second month:**
   - The sales from green hats in the second month were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month.
   - Therefore, the sales from green hats in the second month = $1200 * 3/4 = $900.

4. **Calculate the total sales for the second month:**
   - Total sales in the second month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
   - Since the sales from red hats in the second month are not given, we assume they are the same as in the first month, which is $400.
   - Therefore, the total sales in the second month = $400 + $900 = $1300.

5. **Calculate the total sales for the two months:**
   - Total sales for the two months = Total sales in the first month + Total sales in the second month
   - Total sales for the two months = $1200 + $1300 = $2500.

The final numerical answer is $2500."
"To determine how much James paid for the horse-drawn carriage, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total time hired:**
   - James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM.
   - Total time hired = 9 PM - 5 PM = 4 hours.

2. **Account for the free hour:**
   - James gets 1 hour free.
   - Effective paid hours = Total time hired - Free hour = 4 hours - 1 hour = 3 hours.

3. **Calculate the cost for each paid hour:**
   - The first paid hour costs $15.
   - Each subsequent hour costs twice the previous hour's cost.
   - Cost for the first hour = $15.
   - Cost for the second hour = 2 * $15 = $30.
   - Cost for the third hour = 2 * $30 = $60.

4. **Sum the costs of the paid hours:**
   - Total cost = Cost of the first hour + Cost of the second hour + Cost of the third hour
   - Total cost = $15 + $30 + $60 = $105.

Therefore, the total amount James paid is $105."
"To determine how many dollars were withheld from Sally’s wage, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Sally has in her bank account at the end of the week.
2. Subtract the amount of money she should have in her bank account if she had received her full weekly wage.
3. The result will be the amount of money withheld from her wage.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Sally's bank account at the end of the week is $420.
2. If Sally had received her full weekly wage of $300, her bank account would have been $200 (initial amount) + $300 (wage) = $520.
3. The amount withheld from her wage is $520 (expected end amount) - $420 (actual end amount) = $100.

So, the amount of money withheld from Sally’s wage is $100.

"First, let's determine how many deviled egg halves Lori needs in total. Since each of her 16 guests will eat 3 deviled egg halves, the total number of deviled egg halves needed is:

\[ 16 \text{ guests} \times 3 \text{ deviled egg halves/guest} = 48 \text{ deviled egg halves} \]

Next, we need to find out how many whole eggs are required. Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, the number of whole eggs needed is:

\[ \frac{48 \text{ deviled egg halves}}{2 \text{ deviled egg halves/whole egg}} = 24 \text{ whole eggs} \]

Now, we need to convert the number of whole eggs into dozens. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, the number of dozens of eggs needed is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ whole eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozen} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \text{Total days required} = \frac{\text{Total pages}}{\text{Pages per day}} = \frac{200 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ pages/day}} = 20 \text{ days} \]

Since the assignment is to be completed within 30 days, we can find out how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading by subtracting the total days required from the deadline:
\[ \text{Days before deadline} = 30 \text{ days} - 20 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ days} \]

So, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline."
"To determine the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to calculate the initial cost of the plane and the monthly costs for renting a hanger and fuel, then sum these up for a full year.

1. **Initial Cost of the Plane:**
   - The plane costs $150,000.

2. **Monthly Costs:**
   - James pays $5000 a month to rent a hanger.
   - He spends twice as much on fuel per month, which is \(2 \times 5000 = 10000\) dollars.

3. **Total Monthly Cost:**
   - The total monthly cost is the sum of the hanger rental and fuel costs: \(5000 + 10000 = 15000\) dollars.

4. **Annual Cost:**
   - To find the annual cost, we multiply the total monthly cost by 12 (the number of months in a year): \(15000 \times 12 = 180000\) dollars.

5. **Total Cost for the First Year:**
   - The total cost for the first year includes the initial cost of the plane plus the annual cost of maintenance: \(150000 + 180000 = 330000\) dollars.

Therefore, the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is **330000 dollars**."
"First, let's determine the cooking times for each item based on the information provided.

1. It took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice.
2. It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice. Therefore, the cooking time for pork is:
   \[
   30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
   \]
3. The cooking time for beans is half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is:
   \[
   30 \text{ minutes} + 50 \text{ minutes} = 80 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   Therefore, the cooking time for beans is:

We know that:
1. Sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs.
2. Sheep have 1 head and geese have 1 head.
3. The total number of animal legs is 70.
4. The total number of animal heads is 20.

From the information given, we can set up the following equations:
\[ 4S + 2G = 70 \]
\[ S + G = 20 \]

We can solve these equations step by step. First, we can simplify the first equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( 2S + G = 35 \)
2. \( S + G = 20 \)

We can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate \( G \):
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep is \( S = 15 \).

"To determine the number of good days left in the month, we need to first verify the total number of good, bad, and neutral days based on the information provided.

Christina had twelve good days in total over the thirty days. She had eight bad days, and the rest were neutral. The total number of days is thirty, so the number of neutral days can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Neutral days} = 30 - (\text{Good days} + \text{Bad days}) = 30 - (12 + 8) = 10 \]

Next, we need to check the distribution of good, bad, and neutral days over the thirty days:
- The first eight days were good.
- The next eight days were bad.
- The last eight days were neutral.

This distribution matches the total number of good, bad, and neutral days:
- Good days: 8 (first eight days) + 4 (next eight days) = 12
- Bad days: 8 (second eight days) + 4 (last eight days) = 8
- Neutral days: 8 (third eight days) = 10

Now, we are given the next three days of the month:
- The next three days were good, neutral, and good.

This means:
- The fourth set of eight days (the last three days plus the next three days) will have:
  - 3 good days (from the next three days)
  - 1 neutral day (from the next three days)
  - 4 neutral days (from the last eight days)

"First, let's determine the number of toys James needs initially. He currently has 4 toys for 4 dogs, so he needs 4 more toys for the 8 new dogs that have arrived. This means he needs 4 toys for the 8 new dogs.

\[ \text{Toys needed for 8 new dogs} = 4 \]

After buying the toys, there are twice as many more dogs than when he left. This means there are now 16 dogs in total (8 new dogs + the original 8 dogs).

\[ \text{Total dogs now} = 8 + 8 = 16 \]

So, James needs 16 toys for the 16 dogs.

\[ \text{Toys needed for 16 dogs} = 16 \]

When James came back again, 3 dogs were gone, so he no longer needed those toys. This means he only needs the toys for the remaining 13 dogs.

\[ \text{Toys needed for 13 dogs} = 13 \]

Now, we sum up all the toys he needs:

\[ \text{Total toys needed} = 4 + 16 + 13 = 33 \]

"To solve this problem, we can set up a proportion based on the given information. If 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, then we can find out how many hash browns (let's call this number \( x \)) can be made from 96 potatoes by setting up the following equation:

\[
\frac{6 \text{ potatoes}}{36 \text{ hash browns}} = \frac{96 \text{ potatoes}}{x \text{ hash browns}}
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{96 \text{ potatoes} \times 36 \text{ hash browns}}{6 \text{ potatoes}}
\]

\[
x = \frac{3456 \text{ hash browns}}{6}
\]

\[
x = 576 \text{ hash browns}
\]

So, you can make 576 hash browns out of 96 potatoes."
"First, we need to calculate the total weight that Jack and the 8 other adults will be carrying in the elevator.

Jack's weight: 80 kg
Weight of 8 other adults: 8 adults * 80 kg/adult = 640 kg

Total weight: Jack's weight + Weight of 8 other adults
Total weight = 80 kg + 640 kg = 720 kg

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg. To find out by how much they will exceed the maximum load, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight:

Exceeding weight = Total weight - Maximum load
Exceeding weight = 720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg

The final numerical answer is 20 kg."
"Let's denote the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has as \( C \).

According to the problem:
- Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so if Max has \( M \) cookies, then Katarina has \( M - 5 \).
- Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so \( M = C + 12 \).
- Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so if Max has \( M \) cookies, then Summer has \( M + 23 \).
- Katarina has 68 cookies, so \( M - 5 = 68 \).

From the equation \( M - 5 = 68 \), we can solve for \( M \):
\[ M = 68 + 5 = 73 \]

Now, we know Max has 73 cookies. Using the relationship \( M = C + 12 \), we can solve for \( C \):
\[ 73 = C + 12 \]
\[ C = 73 - 12 = 61 \]

So, the Cookie Monster has 61 cookies. Now we can find out how many cookies Summer has:
\[ M + 23 = 73 + 23 = 96 \]

Now we have the number of cookies each person has:
- Katarina: 68 cookies
- Max: 73 cookies
- Cookie Monster: 61 cookies
- Summer: 96 cookies

To find the total number of cookies, we sum these amounts:
\[ 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298 \]

The total number of cookies they have is \(\boxed{298}\)."
"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, so the extension is \( 0.5x \) cm.

She also adds 20 cm to the bottom of the dress with a lace trim.

The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides:

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Now, divide both sides by 1.5:

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} \]

\[ x = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 80 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time Chris spent mowing half of his lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half in ""rabbit"" mode.

First, let's convert the times to a consistent unit. Since the final answer needs to be in minutes, we'll keep the times in minutes:
- ""Turtle"" mode: 60 minutes
- ""Rabbit"" mode: 40 minutes

Chris mows half of his lawn in each mode. Therefore, the time spent mowing half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Similarly, the time spent mowing half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode is:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

To find the total time spent mowing the entire lawn, we add the time spent in ""turtle"" mode and ""rabbit"" mode:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time John and Jack have already spent walking.

- Time to get to the corner where the library is: 6 minutes
- Time to get to the fire station from the corner: 13 minutes

Total time spent walking so far:
\[ 6 + 13 = 19 \text{ minutes} \]

They have 30 minutes in total to get to school. To find out how much longer they have to get to school without being late, we subtract the time they have already spent from the total time they have:

\[ 30 - 19 = 11 \text{ minutes} \]

So, they have 11 more minutes to get to school without being late."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of fruit Catherine bought:

- Apples: 1 kilo at $4 per kilo = $4
- Bananas: 2 kilos at $2 per kilo = 2 * $2 = $4
- Oranges: 2 kilos at $3 per kilo = 2 * $3 = $6

Now, let's add up the total cost:

Total cost = Cost of apples + Cost of bananas + Cost of oranges
Total cost = $4 + $4 + $6 = $14

So, Catherine pays a total of $14."
"First, let's determine how many cookies Celinda bakes. Since Celinda bakes twice as many cookies as Greta, and Greta bakes 30 cookies, we can calculate the number of cookies Celinda bakes as follows:

\[ \text{Cookies baked by Celinda} = 2 \times \text{Cookies baked by Greta} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Next, we find the total number of cookies baked by both Greta and Celinda:

\[ \text{Total cookies baked} = \text{Cookies baked by Greta} + \text{Cookies baked by Celinda} = 30 + 60 = 90 \]

Then, we account for the cookies that Greta and Celinda eat while the cookies are cooling. They eat 10 cookies, so we subtract these from the total:

\[ \text{Cookies left in the box} = \text{Total cookies baked} - \text{Cookies eaten} = 90 - 10 = 80 \]

Therefore, the number of cookies in the box is:

\[ 80 \]"
"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( Tr \). According to the problem, one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so we can write the first equation as:

\[ T = Tr + 7 \]

We also know that the combined ages of the twins and the triplets is 44, so we can write the second equation as:

\[ T + T + Tr + Tr + Tr = 44 \]

Simplifying the second equation, we get:

\[ 2T + 3Tr = 44 \]

Now we substitute the first equation \( T = Tr + 7 \) into the second equation:

\[ 2(Tr + 7) + 3Tr = 44 \]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[ 2Tr + 14 + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr = 30 \]
\[ Tr = 6 \]

Now that we know the age of one of the triplets is 6, we can find the age of the twin using the first equation:

\[ T = Tr + 7 \]
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, the age of one of the twins is 13. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 13 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time John needs to complete his homework. He has:

- 40 minutes of reading homework
- 20 minutes of history homework

Adding these together:

\[ 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, 3 hours is equal to:

\[ 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the time John needs to complete his homework from the total time he has before dinner:

\[ 180 - 80 = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

So, John has 100 minutes to nap. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 100 \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the lollipops and candies Manolo bought.

Given:
- Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20.
- Each lollipop costs $0.40.

Calculate the total cost of the lollipops:
\[ 5 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.40 \text{ per lollipop} = \$2.00 \]

Now, subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of the candies:
\[ \$3.20 - \$2.00 = \$1.20 \]

Since the cost of four candies is $1.20, we can find the cost of one candy:
\[ \frac{\$1.20}{4 \text{ candies}} = \$0.30 \text{ per candy} \]

Now, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies:
- The cost of 10 lollipops is:
\[ 10 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.40 \text{ per lollipop} = \$4.00 \]

- The cost of 10 candies is:
\[ 10 \text{ candies} \times \$0.30 \text{ per candy} = \$3.00 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost:
\[ \$4.00 + \$3.00 = \$7.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$7.00 \]"
"First, let's determine how many coins Rong has saved in ten years. Since Rong saves 20 coins every month, in ten years (which is 120 months), he will have saved:

\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Next, we need to find out how many coins Neil saves per month. Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong per month. Therefore, Neil saves:

\[ 20 \text{ coins} + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \text{ coins} \right) = 20 \text{ coins} + 8 \text{ coins} = 28 \text{ coins/month} \]

In ten years (120 months), Neil will have saved:

\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Now, to find the total number of coins they have together after ten years, we add the coins saved by Rong and Neil:

\[ 2400 \text{ coins} + 3360 \text{ coins} = 5760 \text{ coins} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 5760 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Since each vaccine costs $20 and John needs 2 vaccines, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \]

Next, let's denote the cost of the heartworm check as \( H \). According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as \( T \). Therefore, we have:
\[ H = 0.6T \]
Since the total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check, we can write:
\[ T = 40 + H \]
Substituting \( H = 0.6T \) into the equation for \( T \), we get:
\[ T = 40 + 0.6T \]
To find \( T \), we need to solve this equation. Subtract \( 0.6T \) from both sides:
\[ T - 0.6T = 40 \]
\[ 0.4T = 40 \]
Divide both sides by 0.4:
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.4} = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To determine the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum these costs.

First, let's find the cost of one banana. Given that one apple costs $0.5 and one banana costs twice as much as one apple:
\[ \text{Cost of one banana} = 2 \times 0.5 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of one orange. Oranges cost three times as much as a banana:
\[ \text{Cost of one orange} = 3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost for the fruits in one crate:
- The crate contains 5 bananas, so the total cost for bananas is:
\[ 5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]
- The crate contains 12 apples, so the total cost for apples is:
\[ 12 \times 0.5 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]
- The crate contains 7 oranges, so the total cost for oranges is:
\[ 7 \times 3 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we sum the costs of all the fruits to find the total price of the crate:
\[ 5 + 6 + 21 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the price for such a crate of fruit is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of each colored square on the comforter.

- The number of red squares is given as 14.
- The number of blue squares is 4 more than the number of red squares, so it is \(14 + 4 = 18\).
- The number of green squares is 6 more than the number of blue squares, so it is \(18 + 6 = 24\).
- The number of white squares is 12 fewer than the number of green squares, so it is \(24 - 12 = 12\).

Now, let's find the total number of squares on the comforter by summing up the squares of each color:
\[ 14 \text{ (red)} + 18 \text{ (blue)} + 24 \text{ (green)} + 12 \text{ (white)} = 68 \text{ squares} \]

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is equal to the total number of squares. Therefore, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 68 \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of chairs needed for the function. We know that there are 42 adults and 15 babies, so the total number of people attending is:

\[ 42 + 15 = 57 \]

Next, we need to find out how many chairs are currently available. We know that the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs. Therefore, the number of regular chairs is:

\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

So, the total number of chairs currently available is:

\[ 40 \text{ (regular chairs)} + 8 \text{ (high chairs)} = 48 \text{ chairs} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more chairs are needed. Since 57 chairs are needed and only 48 chairs are available, the number of additional chairs required is:

\[ 57 - 48 = 9 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

Therefore, the number of great grand-babies at the family reunion is 27."
"First, we need to calculate how much Greta puts into her retirement account. She puts 50% of her $2400.00 paycheck into her retirement account.

\[ \text{Amount put into retirement} = 2400 \times \frac{50}{100} = 2400 \times 0.5 = 1200 \]

Next, we calculate how much she uses for her monthly car payment. She uses 20% of her $2400.00 paycheck for her car payment.

\[ \text{Amount for car payment} = 2400 \times \frac{20}{100} = 2400 \times 0.2 = 480 \]

Now, we subtract the amounts she puts into her retirement account and the amount she uses for her car payment from her total paycheck to find out how much money she has left to spend.

"First, let's determine the capacity of Gordy's truck. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, we can calculate Gordy's truck capacity as follows:

\[ \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = 4000 + 800 = 4800 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that the combined capacity of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks is 11,600 pounds. Let's denote Gary's truck capacity by \( G \). Therefore, we can write the equation for the total capacity as:

\[ 4000 + 4800 + G = 11600 \]

Now, we solve for \( G \):

\[ 8800 + G = 11600 \]
\[ G = 11600 - 8800 \]
\[ G = 2800 \]

So, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry. We know that each female ate 3 dumplings and there were 6 females. Therefore, the total number of dumplings eaten by the females is:

\[ 6 \text{ females} \times 3 \text{ dumplings/female} = 18 \text{ dumplings} \]

Next, we need to find out how many dumplings each male ate. According to the problem, each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female. Since each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate:

\[ 3 \text{ dumplings} + 1 \text{ dumpling} = 4 \text{ dumplings} \]

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is:

\[ 8 \text{ males} \times 4 \text{ dumplings/male} = 32 \text{ dumplings} \]

To find the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry, we add the dumplings eaten by the females and the dumplings eaten by the males:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money the firefighters have left to raise and then calculate how many additional hours they need to work to reach their goal.

1. The total goal is $6300.
2. After 3 hours, they have raised $2100.
3. Therefore, the amount left to raise is $6300 - $2100 = $4200.
4. They need to raise $4200 in equal amounts per hour.
5. Since they have already raised for 3 hours, they have 3 hours left to raise the remaining $4200.

To find out the total number of hours they need to work to reach their goal, we add the 3 hours they have already worked to the 3 hours they need to work to reach their goal:

Total hours = 3 (already worked) + 3 (remaining to work) = 6 hours.

"To find the percent of the river's total water that is used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the percentage of water used by the city for industrial purposes.
2. Subtract the industrial usage percentage from 100% to find the non-industrial usage percentage.

First, we know that Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. Out of this 40%, 80% is used for industrial purposes. Therefore, the percentage of water used by the city for industrial purposes is:
\[ 40\% \times 80\% = 40\% \times 0.80 = 32\% \]

Next, to find the percentage of water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the industrial usage percentage from 100%:
\[ 100\% - 32\% = 68\% \]

So, the percent of the river's total water that is used by the city for non-industrial purposes is:
\[ 68\% \]

"First, let's determine the production rate for each type of ice cream.

For chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for chocolate ice cream is \( \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

For vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for vanilla ice cream is \( \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Next, we calculate the total production for 48 hours.

For chocolate ice cream:
- At a rate of 50 quarts per hour, in 48 hours, the factory would produce \( 50 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts} \).

For vanilla ice cream:
- At a rate of 12.5 quarts per hour, in 48 hours, the factory would produce \( 12.5 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts} \).

Finally, we add the total quarts of chocolate and vanilla ice cream produced in 48 hours:

- Croissants: 5 croissants * $3.00 each = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls * $2.50 each = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches * $4.00 each = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 blueberry muffins * $1.00 each = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost before the discount:

Total cost before discount = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Marcus gets a 10% discount on his purchase. To find the discount amount:

Discount amount = 10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final bill:

Final bill = Total cost before discount - Discount amount = $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

So, Marcus' total bill is $45.00."
"First, let's determine the cost of the ice cream deal. For every 2 scoops bought, Erin gets 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50.

The cost for 2 scoops is:
\[ 2 \times 1.50 = 3.00 \]

Since she gets 1 scoop free for every 2 scoops bought, the total number of scoops she can get for $6.00 is calculated by first determining how many sets of 2 scoops she can buy with $6.00.

The number of sets of 2 scoops she can buy is:
\[ \frac{6.00}{3.00} = 2 \]

So, she can buy 2 sets of 2 scoops, which means she can buy 4 scoops of ice cream and get 2 scoops free. Therefore, the total number of scoops she can get is:
\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much candy Ginger eats in two weeks. Since there are 14 days in two weeks and Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy each day, we can calculate the total amount of candy Ginger eats as follows:

\[ \text{Ginger's candy eaten} = 4 \, \text{pieces/day} \times 14 \, \text{days} = 56 \, \text{pieces} \]

Since Ginger started with 100 pieces of candy, after two weeks, Ginger will have:

\[ \text{Ginger's remaining candy} = 100 \, \text{pieces} - 56 \, \text{pieces} = 44 \, \text{pieces} \]

Next, let's calculate how much candy Amy eats in two weeks. Since Amy eats 3 pieces of candy each day, we can calculate the total amount of candy Amy eats as follows:

\[ \text{Amy's candy eaten} = 3 \, \text{pieces/day} \times 14 \, \text{days} = 42 \, \text{pieces} \]

Since Amy started with 100 pieces of candy, after two weeks, Amy will have:

\[ \text{Amy's remaining candy} = 100 \, \text{pieces} - 42 \, \text{pieces} = 58 \, \text{pieces} \]

Now, to find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger after two weeks, we subtract the amount of candy Ginger has from the amount of candy Amy has:

\[ \text{Difference} = 58 \, \text{pieces} - 44 \, \text{pieces} = 14 \, \text{pieces} \]

So, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger after two weeks. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 14 \]"

"First, let's calculate the total cost James incurred for picking the blueberries. The cost to go picking is a fixed $20, and the cost per pound is $1.5. He picked 30 pounds, so the cost for the blueberries is:

\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.5 \text{ per pound} = \$45 \]

Adding the fixed cost of going picking, the total cost for James is:

\[ \$20 + \$45 = \$65 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the same 30 pounds of blueberries at the store. The store price is $2.5 per pound, so the total cost at the store is:

\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.5 \text{ per pound} = \$75 \]

To find out how much James saved compared to buying at the store, we subtract the cost James paid from the cost he would have paid at the store:

\[ \$75 - \$65 = \$10 \]

So, James saved $10 by picking the blueberries himself. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the original price of each computer. The company planned to buy each computer for $700, but the price increased by 10%. Therefore, the new price of each computer is:

\[ \text{New Price} = \text{Original Price} + (\text{Original Price} \times \text{Percentage Increase}) \]
\[ \text{New Price} = 700 + (700 \times 0.10) \]
\[ \text{New Price} = 700 + 70 \]
\[ \text{New Price} = 770 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of money paid for 500 computers at the new price of $770 each:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Number of Computers} \times \text{New Price per Computer} \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 500 \times 770 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of taps Helga makes with both her feet over the 5-minute period, considering the different tap rates when her arms are raised and when they are at her sides.

First, let's calculate the number of taps when her arms are at her sides:
- Right foot tap rate: 300 taps per minute
- Left foot tap rate: 250 taps per minute
- Total taps per minute when arms are at her sides: \(300 + 250 = 550\) taps per minute
- Total time with arms at her sides: \(5 - 2 = 3\) minutes
- Total taps with arms at her sides: \(550 \times 3 = 1650\) taps

Next, let's calculate the number of taps when her arms are raised:
- Right foot tap rate: 200 taps per minute
- Left foot tap rate: 200 taps per minute
- Total taps per minute when arms are raised: \(200 + 200 = 400\) taps per minute
- Total time with arms raised: 2 minutes
- Total taps with arms raised: \(400 \times 2 = 800\) taps

Now, we add the total taps from both scenarios:
- Total taps with arms at her sides: 1650 taps
- Total taps with arms raised: 800 taps

"First, let's calculate the total cost if Ron fixes the pothole himself.

1. The cost of fixing the pothole with asphalt: 3 buckets * $25 per bucket = $75.
2. The fine for unauthorized road maintenance: $120.

So, the total cost if Ron fixes the pothole himself is $75 (asphalt) + $120 (fine) = $195.

Ron would lose $450 if the pothole causes damage to his car if it's not fixed. Therefore, the money saved by fixing the pothole is the difference between the potential damage and the cost of fixing it himself.

Money saved = $450 (potential damage) - $195 (cost of fixing it himself) = $255.

The final numerical answer is $255."

"First, let's determine the total number of slices of pizza ordered. Since there are 5 people (Bryce and his four friends) and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate how many slices Bryce and two of his friends ate. They ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizzas:
\[ 2 \times 12 \times \frac{2}{3} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Then, we calculate how many slices the remaining two friends ate. They ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizzas:
\[ 2 \times 12 \times \frac{3}{4} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Now, we find the total number of slices eaten by all five people:
\[ 16 + 18 = 34 \]

Finally, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices to find out how many slices are left:
\[ 60 - 34 = 26 \]

So, the number of slices of pizza left is:

"First, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 8 feet and 4 inches to inches as follows:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} + 4 \text{ inches} = 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, Topher's shoe is 100 inches long. According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( x \) inches. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \( 10 \) inches. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"

"To find the percentage of blue spools of thread, we first need to determine the total number of spools of thread and the number of blue spools.

Candy has:
- 15 light blue spools
- 45 dark blue spools
- 40 light green spools
- 50 dark green spools

The total number of spools is:
\[ 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150 \]

The total number of blue spools (light blue and dark blue) is:
\[ 15 + 45 = 60 \]

To find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplifying the fraction:
\[ \frac{60}{150} = \frac{2}{5} \]

1. Calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will chew in 30 days.
2. Determine how many packs of gum are required based on the total number of pieces.

First, we calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will chew in 30 days:
\[ \text{Total pieces of gum} = \text{Pieces per day} \times \text{Number of days} \]
\[ \text{Total pieces of gum} = 4 \times 30 = 120 \]

Next, we determine how many packs of gum are needed. Since each pack contains 15 pieces of gum:
\[ \text{Number of packs} = \frac{\text{Total pieces of gum}}{\text{Pieces per pack}} \]
\[ \text{Number of packs} = \frac{120}{15} = 8 \]

Therefore, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

First, since the total number of students in the two classes is 80 and each class has the same number of students, we can find the number of students in each class by dividing the total number of students by 2:

\[ \text{Number of students in each class} = \frac{80}{2} = 40 \]

Next, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. Therefore, the number of girls in each class is:

\[ \text{Number of girls in each class} = 40 \times \frac{40}{100} = 40 \times 0.4 = 16 \]

Now, to find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class:

\[ \text{Number of boys in each class} = 40 - 16 = 24 \]

So, the number of boys in each class is 24. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 24 \]"
"Initially, Mara had 2 slices of cake on the plate. She added 3 more slices, so the total number of slices became:

\[2 + 3 = 5\]

Next, Mara tripled the number of slices she currently has:

\[5 \times 3 = 15\]

Then, she ate 2 slices:

\[15 - 2 = 13\]

Finally, her friend stole 5 slices:

\[13 - 5 = 8\]

So, the number of cake slices that remained on the plate is:

\[\boxed{8}\]"
"To determine how many animals Melissa will groom each day, we first need to calculate the total number of animals she has to groom this week. We can do this by adding the number of each type of animal:

- Dogs: 8
- Cats: 5
- Birds: 3
- Horses: 12

Total number of animals = 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28

Melissa has 7 days in a week to complete this grooming. To find out how many animals she will groom each day, we divide the total number of animals by the number of days:

\[ \text{Animals groomed per day} = \frac{28}{7} = 4 \]

So, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week. The final numerical answer is:

4"
"First, let's calculate the total cost Mark incurred. He bought 3 packs at $1800 each, so the total cost is:
\[ 3 \times 1800 = 5400 \]

Next, let's calculate the total value of the cards Mark received. He got one card worth $4000, another card worth $1000, and 30 cards each worth $50. The total value of these cards is:
\[ 4000 + 1000 + 30 \times 50 = 4000 + 1000 + 1500 = 6500 \]

The profit Mark made is the total value of the cards minus the total cost:
\[ 6500 - 5400 = 1100 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 1100 \]"
"To determine how much Jake's family will save by choosing the second amusement park over the first, we need to calculate the total cost for each park and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total cost for the first amusement park:
- The cost for 2 adults at the first park is \(2 \times 26 = 52\) dollars.
- The cost for 2 children at the first park is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the first amusement park is \(52 + 24 = 76\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the second amusement park:
- The cost for 2 adults at the second park is \(2 \times 14 = 28\) dollars.
- The cost for 2 children at the second park is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the second amusement park is \(28 + 20 = 48\) dollars.

Now, we find the savings by subtracting the total cost of the second park from the total cost of the first park:
- The savings is \(76 - 48 = 28\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:

The final numerical answer is $350."
"First, let's determine how many marbles Carl has. According to the problem, Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. Since Sean has 56 marbles, we can calculate the number of marbles Carl has as follows:

\[ \text{Number of marbles Carl has} = 4 \times \text{Number of marbles Sean has} = 4 \times 56 \]

Next, we calculate the number of marbles Carl has:

\[ 4 \times 56 = 224 \]

Now, let's determine how many marbles Cal has. The problem states that Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. Therefore, we can express the number of marbles Cal has in terms of the number of marbles Sean has:

\[ \text{Number of marbles Sean has} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of marbles Cal has} \]

Given that Sean has 56 marbles, we can solve for the number of marbles Cal has:

\[ 56 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of marbles Cal has} \]

To find the number of marbles Cal has, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ \text{Number of marbles Cal has} = 56 \times 2 = 112 \]

Finally, we need to find the combined number of marbles that Carl and Cal have:

\[ \text{Combined number of marbles} = \text{Number of marbles Carl has} + \text{Number of marbles Cal has} = 224 + 112 \]

Adding these together:

\[ 224 + 112 = 336 \]

Thus, the combined number of marbles that Carl and Cal have is:

\[ \boxed{336} \]"
"To determine how many more groups are needed, we first need to find out how many students would be in each group if the activity is divided into 12 groups.

Given:
- Total number of students = 54
- Total number of groups required = 12

To find the number of students per group when divided into 12 groups:
\[ \text{Number of students per group} = \frac{54}{12} = 4.5 \]

Since the number of students per group must be a whole number, it's clear that 12 groups of 54 students each is not possible. Therefore, we need to find the smallest number of groups that can accommodate all 54 students with each group having an equal number of students.

To find the number of groups that can be formed with 54 students, we need to find the divisors of 54. The divisors of 54 are: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, and 54.

Since we are forming 12 groups and need to find out how many more groups are needed to form, we need to determine the smallest number of groups that can accommodate 54 students. The smallest number of groups that can accommodate 54 students is 54 groups (each with 1 student).

Given that we already have 12 groups, we need to find out how many more groups are needed to form 54 groups:
\[ 54 - 12 = 42 \]

Thus, the number of additional groups needed is:
\[ \boxed{42} \]"
"To determine the total number of chairs Candy can rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate step by step.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during a single weekday and a single weekend day:
- During weekdays, 60 chairs are rented each day.
- During weekends, 100 chairs are rented each day.

Next, we need to find out how many weekdays and weekend days are in a 4-week month:
- There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a single week.
- Therefore, in a 4-week month, there are \(5 \times 4 = 20\) weekdays and \(2 \times 4 = 8\) weekend days.

Now, we can calculate the total number of chairs rented during a 4-week month:
- Chairs rented during weekdays: \(60 \text{ chairs/day} \times 20 \text{ days} = 1200 \text{ chairs}\)
- Chairs rented during weekends: \(100 \text{ chairs/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ chairs}\)
- Total chairs rented in one 4-week month: \(1200 \text{ chairs} + 800 \text{ chairs} = 2000 \text{ chairs}\)

Since we are considering two 4-week months, we multiply the total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month by 2:
- Total chairs rented in two 4-week months: \(2000 \text{ chairs/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 4000 \text{ chairs}\)

Thus, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is:
\[
\boxed{4000}

"To determine how many bananas Gunther found in the pile, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the number of bananas step by step.

1. Initially, Gunther had 48 bananas.
2. Arnold stole half of the bananas:
   \[
   \text{Bananas stolen by Arnold} = \frac{48}{2} = 24
   \]
   \[
   \text{Bananas left} = 48 - 24 = 24
   \]
3. The next day, Gunther added 25 bananas:
   \[
   \text{Bananas after Gunther added 25} = 24 + 25 = 49
   \]
4. The next evening, Arnold stole another 12 bananas:
   \[
   \text{Bananas left} = 49 - 12 = 37
   \]
5. On the third day, Gunther added another 6 bananas:
   \[
   \text{Bananas after Gunther added 6} = 37 + 6 = 43
   \]

Therefore, the number of bananas Gunther found in the pile is 43."
"To find out how much each roommate will pay per year for electricity, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the monthly cost per roommate.
2. Calculate the annual cost per roommate.

First, we know that the total monthly cost for electricity is $100. Since there are 4 roommates, we divide the monthly cost by the number of roommates to find out how much each roommate pays each month:

\[
\text{Monthly cost per roommate} = \frac{100}{4} = 25
\]

Next, to find the annual cost per roommate, we multiply the monthly cost per roommate by the number of months in a year (12):

\[
\text{Annual cost per roommate} = 25 \times 12 = 300
\]

So, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity.

\[

"First, let's determine the total number of glasses and plates Jeff initially sent.

Jeff sent 8 dozen glasses. Since one dozen equals 12, the total number of glasses sent is:
\[ 8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ glasses} \]

Jeff also sent 4 dozen plates. The total number of plates sent is:
\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ plates} \]

Next, we need to account for the number of glasses and plates that were broken and returned. Jeff received 10 broken glasses and 6 broken plates.

The number of glasses Jeff has now is:
\[ 96 - 10 = 86 \text{ glasses} \]

The number of plates Jeff has now is:
\[ 48 - 6 = 42 \text{ plates} \]

To find the total number of glasses and plates Jeff has now, we add the remaining glasses and plates together:
\[ 86 + 42 = 128 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many small stickers Lorraine trades for large buttons. She starts with 30 small stickers and trades 90% of them:

\[ 30 \times 0.90 = 27 \text{ small stickers} \]

Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons from trading 27 small stickers.

Next, we need to determine how many large stickers she trades for large buttons. She starts with 40 large stickers and trades 50% of them:

\[ 40 \times 0.50 = 20 \text{ large stickers} \]

Since each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons, and a large button is worth three small buttons, each large sticker is worth 1 large button. Therefore, trading 20 large stickers for large buttons gives her 20 large buttons.

Now, we need to determine how many small stickers she has left after trading 27 small stickers. She started with 30 small stickers and traded 27:

\[ 30 - 27 = 3 \text{ small stickers} \]

She trades the remaining 3 small stickers for large buttons. Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 3 small buttons from trading 3 small stickers. Each small button is worth \(\frac{1}{3}\) of a large button, so 3 small buttons are worth:

\[ 3 \times \frac{1}{3} = 1 \text{ large button} \]

Adding the 1 large button she got from trading the small stickers to the 20 large buttons she already had from trading the large stickers, she now has:

\[ 20 + 1 = 21 \text{ large buttons} \]

Therefore, the total number of buttons Lorraine has by the end is:

\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"To determine the total number of matches Joey played in one week, we need to add up the matches he played on each day of the week mentioned.

- On Monday, Joey played 2 matches.
- On Friday, Joey played 1 match.
- On Saturday, Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday. Since he played 2 matches on Monday, on Saturday he played \(2 \times 2 = 4\) matches.

Now, we sum the matches played each day:
\[ 2 \text{ (Monday)} + 1 \text{ (Friday)} + 4 \text{ (Saturday)} = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of matches Joey played in one week is 7.

\[

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x \). The total number of votes cast is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is \( x + 2x = 3x \).

We know the total number of people on the council is 33, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x \):
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Thus, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Extra-small (XS) shirts**: 11 students need size extra-small.
2. **Small (S) shirts**: Twice as many students need size small as extra small. Therefore, the number of students needing size small is \(2 \times 11 = 22\).
3. **Medium (M) shirts**: Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size medium is \(22 - 4 = 18\).
4. **Large (L) shirts**: Half as many students need size large as size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size large is \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\).
5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts**: Six more students need size extra-large than large. Therefore, the number of students needing size extra-large is \(9 + 6 = 15\).

Now, we sum up all the students to find the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order:
\[ 11 \text{ (XS)} + 22 \text{ (S)} + 18 \text{ (M)} + 9 \text{ (L)} + 15 \text{ (XL)} = 75 \]

So, the total number of shirts Krissa ordered is 75."
"To calculate the final price after a 5% discount on a $140 item, we first need to determine the amount of the discount and then subtract it from the original price.

The discount amount is calculated as:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Original Price} \times \frac{\text{Discount Percentage}}{100} \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 140 \times \frac{5}{100} = 140 \times 0.05 = 7 \]

Now, subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the final price:
\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount Amount} \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 140 - 7 = 133 \]

So, the final price after the discount is $133."
"To find the total number of hours the 20 playlists will last, we can follow these steps:

\[ \text{Total number of songs} = \text{Number of playlists} \times \text{Number of songs per playlist} \]
\[ \text{Total number of songs} = 20 \times 300 = 6000 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of hours:
\[ \text{Total number of hours} = \text{Total number of songs} \times \text{Length of each song} \]
\[ \text{Total number of hours} = 6000 \times 10 = 60000 \]

So, the 20 playlists will last a total of 60,000 hours."
"First, let's calculate the number of people who think horse #2 will win. 

20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win:
\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \text{ people} \]

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ people} \]

Now, 60% of the remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win:
\[ 0.60 \times 40 = 24 \text{ people} \]

The rest of the people think horse #12 will win. To find out how many people that is, we subtract the number of people who think horse #7 will win from the remaining people:
\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \text{ people} \]

So, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is:

"To find the total number of puppies Jana has, we can work backwards from the information given.

We know that one third of the Pomeranian puppies are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. Therefore, the total number of Pomeranian puppies (let's call this number \( P \)) can be found by solving the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{3}P = 6 \]

Multiplying both sides by 3 gives:
\[ P = 6 \times 3 = 18 \]

So, there are 18 Pomeranian puppies. Since these Pomeranian puppies represent two thirds of all the puppies Jana has, we can find the total number of puppies \( T \) by solving the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{3}T = 18 \]

To find \( T \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{3}{2} \):
\[ T = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 27 \]

Therefore, Jana has 27 puppies in total.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The first house needs \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the second house, so the first house needs \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases.
- The third house needs double the first house, so the third house needs \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) cases.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{5}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{5} \):
\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{5} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. The third house needs double the first house, which is:
\[ 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = 2 \times \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate Tanya's earnings for the two days, we need to break down her earnings for each day and then sum them up.

**Monday:**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She also earns an additional $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Monday:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} \times 5 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 20 \times 5 \times 15 = \$1500 \]

Next, calculate the additional earnings for Monday:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} > 3 \text{ classes} \]
\[ \text{Additional earnings} = \$5 \]

So, Tanya's total earnings for Monday are:
\[ \$1500 + \$5 = \$1505 \]

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She does not earn the additional $5 per day since she does not teach more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Wednesday:
\[ 2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 2 \times 2 \times 15 = \$60 \]

Since she does not teach more than 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5 per day.

So, Tanya's total earnings for Wednesday are:
\[ \$60 \]

Now, sum up the earnings for both days:
\[ \$1505 + \$60 = \$1565 \]

Therefore, Tanya earned a total of \$1565 for these two days of teaching.

\[ \text{Remaining pencils} = 50 - 25 = 25 \]

Next, Anthony gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Pencils given to Charlie} = \frac{3}{5} \times 25 = 15 \]

After giving 15 pencils to Charlie, the number of pencils Anthony kept is:

\[ \text{Pencils Anthony kept} = 25 - 15 = 10 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 10 \]"
"To determine how long Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time he spends driving to the museum, the time he spends at the museum, and the time he spends driving back home.

First, let's calculate the time spent driving to the museum. The distance to the museum is 150 miles and Jack drives at a speed of 75 mph. The time spent driving to the museum is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time spent driving to the museum is:

\[ \text{Time to museum} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Since the trip back home is the same distance and at the same speed, the time spent driving back home is also 2 hours.

Next, we add the time spent at the museum, which is 6 hours, to the time spent driving to and from the museum. Therefore, the total time Jack is gone from home is:

\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time to museum} + \text{Time at museum} + \text{Time back home} \]
\[ \text{Total time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 10 \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total number of wheels required for the cars and motorcycles.

For the cars:
Henry needs 4 wheels for each car, and he has 57 cars.
\[ 4 \text{ wheels/car} \times 57 \text{ cars} = 228 \text{ wheels} \]

For the motorcycles:
Henry needs 2 wheels for each motorcycle, and he has 73 motorcycles.
\[ 2 \text{ wheels/motorcycle} \times 73 \text{ motorcycles} = 146 \text{ wheels} \]

Now, we add the wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles to find the total number of wheels required:
\[ 228 \text{ wheels} + 146 \text{ wheels} = 374 \text{ wheels} \]

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left after assembling all the toys, we subtract the total number of wheels required from the number of wheels Henry has:
\[ 650 \text{ wheels} - 374 \text{ wheels} = 276 \text{ wheels} \]

So, the number of wheels left is:
\[ 276 \]"
"To calculate the price after a 20% discount, first find the amount of the discount and then subtract it from the original price.

The discount amount is 20% of $1000, which can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 1000 \times \frac{20}{100} = 1000 \times 0.20 = 200 \]

Now, subtract the discount amount from the original price:
\[ \text{Price After Discount} = 1000 - 200 = 800 \]

So, you have to pay $800 for the laptop after the discount."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

Mike has a total of 600 movies. A third of these are in various series, so:
\[ \text{Number of series movies} = \frac{600}{3} = 200 \]

This means the remaining movies are:
\[ \text{Remaining movies} = 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Out of these remaining 400 movies, 40% are older movies, so:
\[ \text{Number of older movies} = 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \]

This leaves the rest of the remaining movies as non-series, non-older movies:
\[ \text{Number of non-series, non-older movies} = 400 - 160 = 240 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of replacing the movies. The cost of the series movies is $6 each, and the cost of the non-series, non-older movies is $10 each, while the older movies cost $5 each.

The cost for the series movies is:
\[ \text{Cost of series movies} = 200 \times 6 = 1200 \]

The cost for the non-series, non-older movies is:
\[ \text{Cost of non-series, non-older movies} = 240 \times 10 = 2400 \]

The cost for the older movies is:
\[ \text{Cost of older movies} = 160 \times 5 = 800 \]

Adding these costs together gives the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 1200 + 2400 + 800 = 4400 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 4400 \]"
"To calculate the total amount Winston spent on fruit, we need to multiply the number of pounds of each type of fruit by their respective prices and then sum the totals.

6 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $12.00

For plums:
8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = $8.00

For apricots:
6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Now, we add the totals for each type of fruit:
$12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

So, Winston spent $38.00 on fruit."
"First, let's calculate the distance the Llesis family drove. They drove for 6 hours at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.

\[ \text{Distance driven} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 50 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to determine the hiking speed. The problem states that the hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half the driving speed.

\[ \text{Hiking speed} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 \, \text{miles/hour} - 5 \, \text{miles/hour} = 25 \, \text{miles/hour} - 5 \, \text{miles/hour} = 20 \, \text{miles/hour} \]

Given that they hiked for 1.5 hours, we can now calculate the distance they hiked.

\[ \text{Distance hiked} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 20 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, to find the total distance to their vacation spot, we add the distance driven and the distance hiked.

\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance driven} + \text{Distance hiked} = 300 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 330 \, \text{miles} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumps on as \( E_e \) and the number of berries she collects as \( B_e \). Ava jumps on \( E_a = E_e + 8 \) enemies and collects \( B_a = B_e + 3 \) berries. Emma's score is calculated as \( 10E_e + 5B_e \). Ava's score is calculated as \( 10E_a + 5B_a + 30 \times 4 \).

Substituting the values for Ava's score, we get:
\[ \text{Ava's score} = 10(E_e + 8) + 5(B_e + 3) + 120 = 10E_e + 80 + 5B_e + 15 + 120 = 10E_e + 5B_e + 215. \]

Emma's score is:
\[ \text{Emma's score} = 10E_e + 5B_e. \]

The difference in their scores is:
\[ \text{Difference} = (10E_e + 5B_e + 215) - (10E_e + 5B_e) = 215. \]

So, the difference between their two scores is 215 points. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of each of the other two pizzas. We know the total cost of the four pizzas is 64 dollars, and two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars each. Let's denote the cost of each of the other two pizzas as \( x \).

First, we calculate the total cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each:
\[ 30 + 30 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we subtract this amount from the total cost to find the combined cost of the other two pizzas:
\[ 64 - 60 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the remaining cost by 2 to find the cost of each of these pizzas:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, each of the other two pizzas cost 2 dollars. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of rides on a regular day:**
   - Chase and Rider ride their bikes thrice a day on regular days.
   - Therefore, the number of rides on a regular day is 3.

2. **Calculate the number of rides on the two special days:**
   - On the two special days, they ride twice the usual number of times.
   - Twice the usual number of rides is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) rides per day.

3. **Calculate the total number of rides for the regular days:**
   - There are 3 regular days in a week.
   - The total number of rides on regular days is \(3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ rides/day} = 9 \text{ rides}\).

4. **Calculate the total number of rides for the special days:**
   - There are 2 special days in a week.
   - The total number of rides on special days is \(2 \text{ days} \times 6 \text{ rides/day} = 12 \text{ rides}\).

5. **Calculate the total number of rides for the entire week:**
   - The total number of rides in a week is the sum of the rides on regular days and the rides on special days.
   - Total rides in a week = \(9 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 21 \text{ rides}\).

Therefore, the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is 21."
"Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as \( w \) and the number of orange fish he bought as \( o \). We know that the total number of fish he bought from the pet store is \( o + w = 17 \).

After adding these fish to his pond, the total number of orange fish became \( 3 + o \) and the total number of white fish became \( 4 + w \). According to the problem, after adding the new fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish. This gives us the equation:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( o + w = 17 \)
2. \( 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \)

Let's solve the second equation first:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]
\[ 3 + o = 8 + 2w \]
\[ o - 2w = 5 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( o + w = 17 \)
2. \( o - 2w = 5 \)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use elimination. First, we can eliminate \( o \) by subtracting the second equation from the first:
\[ (o + w) - (o - 2w) = 17 - 5 \]
\[ o + w - o + 2w = 12 \]
\[ 3w = 12 \]
\[ w = 4 \]

Now that we have \( w = 4 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( o \):
\[ o + 4 = 17 \]
\[ o = 13 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish and 13 orange fish. The number of white fish Bob bought at the store is \( \boxed{4} \)."
"First, let's calculate how many miles Andy drives to work each day. Since the one-way distance is 5 miles and he goes to work and back, the round trip distance is:

\[ 5 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 10 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the total distance Andy drives from Monday to Friday:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 50 \text{ miles/week} \]

Now, we need to determine how many gallons of gas Andy consumes in a week. Given that his car's fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon, the number of gallons consumed per week is:

\[ \frac{50 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons/week} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost of the gas consumed in a week. If the price of gas is $3 per gallon, the cost per week is:

\[ 5 \text{ gallons} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie received from her aunt.

Carrie received ten twenties, which means she received:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Carrie also received 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount from the quarters is:
\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Carrie received is:
\[ 200 + 35 = 235 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much money Carrie spent. She spent all the quarters, which is $35, and 3/5 of the twenties. The amount spent on the twenties is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = \frac{3 \times 200}{5} = \frac{600}{5} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

"First, we need to determine the temperature difference that needs to be prevented to avoid the pipes freezing. The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. Given that the temperature during the night is 33 degrees colder than during the day, we can calculate the night temperature as follows:

\[ \text{Night temperature} = \text{Day temperature} - 33 \]
\[ \text{Night temperature} = 45 - 33 = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

Since the pipes will freeze if the temperature drops below 32 degrees, we need to find out how much the temperature needs to be raised to 32 degrees or above. The difference between the night temperature and the freezing point is:

\[ \text{Temperature increase needed} = 32 - \text{Night temperature} \]
\[ \text{Temperature increase needed} = 32 - 12 = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs are needed to raise the temperature by 20 degrees, we divide the total temperature increase needed by the temperature increase per log:

\[ \text{Number of logs needed} = \frac{\text{Temperature increase needed}}{\text{Temperature increase per log}} \]
\[ \text{Number of logs needed} = \frac{20}{5} = 4 \]

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the hourly wages for both Billy and Sally, and then determine the total earnings for 20 hours for each. Finally, we will find the difference in their earnings.

First, let's determine Billy's hourly wage at each stage:
1. **Initial wage**: $10 per hour.
2. **After 2 months**: $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.
3. **On his first anniversary**: $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate Billy's total earnings for 20 hours:
- For the first 2 months (20 hours each month), his wage is $10.50 per hour.
- For the remaining 20 hours, his wage is $11.50 per hour.

Total earnings for Billy:
\[ 20 \text{ hours} \times 2 \text{ months} \times \$10.50/\text{hour} + 20 \text{ hours} \times \$11.50/\text{hour} \]
\[ = 40 \times 10.50 + 20 \times 11.50 \]
\[ = 420 + 230 \]
\[ = \$650 \]

Next, let's determine Sally's hourly wage:
- Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's initial wage.
- Billy's initial wage is $10 per hour.
- Therefore, Sally's starting wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate Sally's total earnings for 20 hours:
\[ 20 \text{ hours} \times \$10.50/\text{hour} \]
\[ = 20 \times 10.50 \]
\[ = \$210 \]

Finally, let's find the difference in their earnings:

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 1240 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:

- Puppies: 3
- Koalas: 5
- Zebras: 2
- Frogs: 4

Total stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Let's denote the number of stuffed goats Bubbles wants to buy as \( x \).

After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30%. Therefore, the equation representing this situation is:

\[ \frac{x}{14 + x} = 0.30 \]

To solve for \( x \), we can rearrange the equation:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total hours Kris has already played.

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks have \(2 \times 7 = 14\) days. So, the total hours played in the first 2 weeks is:
\[ 14 \text{ days} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/day} = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Next, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total hours played in the next week is:
\[ 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/day} = 14 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's add the hours played in the first 2 weeks and the next week:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} + 14 \text{ hours} = 21 \text{ hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. Therefore, the number of hours she still needs to play is:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} - 21 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 9 \]"
"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled by the first car:
- The first car travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance traveled by the first car is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled by the second car:
- The second car travels at an average speed of 70 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance traveled by the second car is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_2 = 70 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled by the two cars:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_2 - \text{Distance}_1 = 140 \, \text{miles} - 120 \, \text{miles} = 20 \, \text{miles}
\]

Thus, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car. The final numerical answer is:
\[
20
\]"
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the ring before the premium is added. The cost of the diamond is $600 and the cost of the gold is $300. So, the total cost before the premium is:

\[ 600 + 300 = 900 \]

Next, we need to calculate the premium. The premium is 30% of the total cost before the premium. To find 30% of $900, we multiply $900 by 0.30:

\[ 900 \times 0.30 = 270 \]

Now, we add the premium to the total cost before the premium to find the final amount James paid:

\[ 900 + 270 = 1170 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1170 \]"
"First, let's calculate the pass rates for each grade:

- For third graders: \( \frac{340}{500} = 0.68 \) or 68%
- For fourth graders: \( \frac{40}{100} = 0.40 \) or 40%
- For fifth graders: The pass rate is twice that of fourth graders, so \( 2 \times 0.40 = 0.80 \) or 80%

Next, we calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students:

- Third graders: 340
- Fourth graders: 40
- Fifth graders: 400

Total number of students: \( 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 \)

Total number of students who passed: \( 340 + 40 + 400 = 780 \)

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students:

\[ \text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{780}{1000} = 0.78 \]

So, the school's overall pass rate is 78%.

The final numerical answer is:
78"
"First, let's determine how many glass chips Milo has in total. Since each bag contains 72 chips and he has two bags, the total number of chips is:

\[ 72 \text{ chips/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we need to find out how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make every square inch, the number of square inches he can make is:

\[ \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips/square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. To find out how many inches long he can make his mosaic, we use the fact that the area of the mosaic is the product of its length and height. Let's denote the length of the mosaic by \( L \) inches. The area of the mosaic is given by:

\[ \text{Area} = L \times \text{height} = L \times 3 \text{ inches} \]

Since the area of the mosaic is 12 square inches, we can set up the equation:

\[ L \times 3 = 12 \]

Solving for \( L \):

\[ L = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

16 students each drank 2 quarts of tea:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Now, let's add the quarts of tea consumed by all the students:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

We know that there are 10 quarts of tea left from the party. Therefore, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we convert the total quarts to gallons:
\[ \frac{48}{4} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"Dale initially had 100 candies and sold 150, which means he is short by 50 candies (150 - 100 = 50). After ordering 100 more candies, the total number of candies he has is 100 (initial) + 100 (new order) = 200 candies. To find out how many candies he still needs to sell, we subtract the total number of candies he has from the number of candies he needs to sell, which is 200 (total he has) - 150 (already sold) = 50 candies.

Therefore, Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students on campus at the end of each month and then determine the total number of additional students who joined by the end of May.

Starting with 10 students at the beginning of the year, the number of students doubles every month.

- At the end of January: \(10 \times 2 = 20\) students
- At the end of February: \(20 \times 2 = 40\) students
- At the end of March: \(40 \times 2 = 80\) students
- At the end of April: \(80 \times 2 = 160\) students
- At the end of May: \(160 \times 2 = 320\) students

Now, we calculate the total number of additional students who joined by the end of May:

- Additional students in January: \(20 - 10 = 10\)
- Additional students in February: \(40 - 20 = 20\)
- Additional students in March: \(80 - 40 = 40\)
- Additional students in April: \(160 - 80 = 80\)
- Additional students in May: \(320 - 160 = 160\)

Summing these additional students:
\[10 + 20 + 40 + 80 + 160 = 310\]

Therefore, the number of additional students who would have joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year, is 310."
"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we first need to determine the total number of branches he climbed during the week.

Given that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs and he made $105 during the week, we can calculate the total number of branches he climbed by dividing the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\text{Total money made}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} \]

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = 420 \]

Since this was the total for the week, and there are 7 days in a week, we can find the average number of branches climbed per day by dividing the total branches by the number of days:

\[ \text{Branches climbed per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches climbed}}{\text{Number of days in a week}} = \frac{420}{7} \]

\[ \text{Branches climbed per day} = 60 \]

So, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 60 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose initially picks:

- For the first 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals.
- For the next 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals.
- For the next 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals.
- For the last 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals.

Adding these together gives the total number of petals initially picked:
\[15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\] petals.

Next, Rose drops 1 of each type of flower:
- She drops 1 of the 5-petal flowers, which means she drops \(1 \times 5 = 5\) petals.
- She drops 1 of the 6-petal flowers, which means she drops \(1 \times 6 = 6\) petals.
- She drops 1 of the 4-petal flowers, which means she drops \(1 \times 4 = 4\) petals.
- She drops 1 of the 7-petal flowers, which means she drops \(1 \times 7 = 7\) petals.

The total number of petals dropped is:
\[5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\] petals.

Subtracting the dropped petals from the initial total gives the number of petals remaining in the vase:
\[101 - 22 = 79\] petals.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean to make S'mores. John makes 9 S'mores and DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so together they make:

\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \text{ S'mores} \]

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they use 18 marshmallows in total. They started with 35 marshmallows and dropped 3 on the ground, so the number of marshmallows left is:

\[ 35 - 18 - 3 = 14 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Now, we need to determine how many S'mores they can make with the remaining 14 marshmallows. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they can make:

\[ 14 \text{ S'mores} \]

Since John and DeSean are sharing the remaining marshmallows equally, each of them can have:

\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ S'mores} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 7 \]"
"First, let's determine the play times for each person:

- Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter.
- One friend can play for half as long as Jack, which is \(20 \div 2 = 10\) minutes.
- Another friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which is \(20 \times 1.5 = 30\) minutes.
- The third friend is significantly worse and can play for half as long as Jack, which is \(20 \div 2 = 10\) minutes.

Now, let's calculate the total play time for all four friends combined:
- Jack plays for 20 minutes.
- The first friend plays for 10 minutes.
- The second friend plays for 30 minutes.
- The third friend plays for 10 minutes.

Total play time = \(20 + 10 + 30 + 10 = 70\) minutes.

Since they play for 4 hours, we need to convert 4 hours into minutes:
\[4 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 240 \text{ minutes}.\]

Now, we need to determine how many quarters are used in 240 minutes of play time. Since Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter, the number of quarters used is:
\[\frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters}.\]

Therefore, the total amount of money used is:
\[12 \text{ quarters} \times 1 \text{ dollar/quarter} = 12 \text{ dollars}.\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"Let's denote the amount of each ingredient Tanya uses as follows:
- Let \( S \) be the amount of salt.
- Let \( O \) be the amount of oil.
- Let \( F \) be the amount of fragrance.
- Let \( C \) be the amount of citrus zest.
- Let \( G \) be the amount of sugar.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S = G \) (same amount of salt as sugar)
2. \( O = 2S \) (twice as much oil as salt)
3. \( F = C \) (same amount of fragrance as citrus zest)
4. \( S = C \) (same amount of salt as citrus zest)

Since \( S = C \) and \( F = C \), we can say \( S = F = C \).

The total amount of ingredients in the jar is 10 ounces. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total amount of ingredients as:
\[ S + O + F + C + G = 10 \]

Substituting the relationships into the equation:
\[ S + 2S + S + S + S = 10 \]
\[ 6S = 10 \]
\[ S = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \]

Since \( O = 2S \):
\[ O = 2 \times \frac{5}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \]

Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \(\frac{10}{3}\) ounces. Converting this to a decimal, we get approximately 3.33 ounces, but the exact answer is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{10}{3}} \]"
"To determine how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the cost of the goats:
- John buys 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $500.

\[
\text{Total cost of goats} = 3 \times 500 = 1500
\]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the cows:
- John buys 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.

\[
\text{Total cost of cows} = 2 \times 1500 = 3000
\]

Now, we sum the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows to find the total amount of money John spent:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 1500 + 3000 = 4500
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[

"First, let's determine how many cars Joe initially has. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. The number of cars he sells is:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

After selling 8 cars, Joe has:

\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \text{ cars} \]

Then, Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

After giving away 16 cars, Joe has:

\[ 32 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, the final number of cars Joe remains with is:

"First, we need to determine how much money the students raised. The total amount raised by the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of this amount comes from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much each student raised. There are 20 students, and the total amount raised by the students is $125,000. So, the amount each student raised is:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

Thus, each student raised \(\boxed{6250}\) dollars."
"To calculate the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days in minutes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the time Sandy walked on the first day.
2. Determine the time Sandy walked on the second day.
3. Convert the total time from hours to minutes.

First, Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day.

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she did on the first day. Therefore, the time she walked on the second day is:
\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total time in hours:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time from hours to minutes:
\[ 12 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days in minutes is:
\[ \boxed{720} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of cars in the parking lot during the lunch break before any left. Hunter initially counted 50 cars, and during the first break, he saw 20 more cars. Therefore, the total number of cars in the parking lot before the lunch break is:

\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \]

During the lunch break, half of the cars left the parking lot. So, the number of cars that left is:

\[ \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Therefore, the number of cars remaining in the parking lot during the lunch break is:

\[ 70 - 35 = 35 \]

So, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is:

\[ \boxed{35} \]"

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now we know PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards. Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

So, the number of cards Becca has is 153.

"First, let's determine the number of each color of eggs Cindy has:

- Cindy has 5 green eggs.
- She has twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she has \(2 \times 5 = 10\) blue eggs.
- She has one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so she has \(10 - 1 = 9\) pink eggs.
- She has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she has \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\) yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs:

- Green eggs: 5

"First, let's calculate the shipping cost. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound plus $0.08 per mile.

The cost for the weight of the book is:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.35/\text{pound} = \$1.40 \]

The cost for the distance is:
\[ 20 \text{ miles} \times \$0.08/\text{mile} = \$1.60 \]

So, the total shipping cost is:
\[ \$1.40 + \$1.60 = \$3.00 \]

Next, we calculate the refundable amount from Amazon. Since Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, the refundable amount is:
\[ 32 \text{ dollars} \times 0.75 = \$24.00 \]

Now, we calculate the total cost Milly will incur:
\[ \text{Cost of the book} + \text{Shipping cost} = 32 \text{ dollars} + 3 \text{ dollars} = \$35.00 \]

Finally, the amount of money Milly will lose is the total cost minus the refundable amount:

"To determine the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then sum them up.

1. **Time spent on TikTok videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week.
   - Each video is 4 minutes long.
   - Therefore, the time spent on TikTok videos each week is \(18 \times 4 = 72\) minutes.
   - For a month with four weeks, the time spent on TikTok videos is \(72 \times 4 = 288\) minutes.

2. **Time spent writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 2 hours is \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes.
   - For a month with four weeks, the time spent writing songs is \(120 \times 4 = 480\) minutes.

3. **Time spent on makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup.
   - For a week, the time spent on makeup is \(15 \times 6 = 90\) minutes.
   - For a month with four weeks, the time spent on makeup is \(90 \times 4 = 360\) minutes.

Now, we sum up the time spent on all activities:

First, let's identify the base cost and the additional cost for the items Angela needs.

1. **Base Cost Calculation:**
   - The base cost for the installation is $129.00.
   - Angela needs 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures.
   - The base cost already includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures.
   - Therefore, Angela needs to add:
     - \(6 - 4 = 2\) additional mirrors.
     - \(2 - 1 = 1\) additional chandelier.
     - \(20 - 10 = 10\) additional pictures.

2. **Additional Cost Calculation:**
   - The cost for each additional item is $15.00.
   - The additional cost for the mirrors is \(2 \times 15 = 30\) dollars.
   - The additional cost for the chandeliers is \(1 \times 15 = 15\) dollars.
   - The additional cost for the pictures is \(10 \times 15 = 150\) dollars.
   - The total additional cost is \(30 + 15 + 150 = 215\) dollars.

3. **Total Cost Calculation:**
   - The total cost is the base cost plus the additional cost.
   - Total cost = $129.00 + $215.00 = $344.00.

Therefore, the total cost for Angela is $344.00."
"First, let's determine how much money Eva has saved. According to the problem, Eva has saved $20.00.

Next, we calculate how much money Anthony has saved. The problem states that Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva. Therefore, we add $10.00 to Eva's savings:
\[ 20.00 + 10.00 = 30.00 \]
So, Anthony has saved $30.00.

Now, we need to find out how much money Roy has saved. The problem states that Roy has saved 40% more in money earned by chores than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we calculate:
\[ 0.40 \times 30.00 = 12.00 \]
So, Roy has saved $12.00 more than Anthony. Adding this to Anthony's savings gives:
\[ 30.00 + 12.00 = 42.00 \]
Therefore, Roy has saved $42.00.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 42.00 \]"
"To determine how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to work through the relationships given step by step.

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei. Therefore, Saskay can lift a mountain \(12 \times 1 = 12\) inches.
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay. Therefore, Kagiyami can lift a mountain \(4 \times 12 = 48\) inches.
4. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami. Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain \(10 \times 48 = 480\) inches.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert 480 inches to feet:

\[ 480 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 40 \]

"To find the total distance Mason has traveled, we need to calculate the distance he covers during each part of his journey and then sum these distances.

The formula to calculate distance is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

First, we calculate the distance he travels in the first part of his journey:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance he travels in the second part of his journey:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we sum the distances from both parts of the journey to find the total distance:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the total distance Mason has traveled is:
\[ 80 \, \text{miles} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total distance traveled by the kangaroos:**
   - Let the distance across the highway be \( D \).
   - Let the speed of each kangaroo be \( v \).
   - Since it takes 3 kangaroos 18 hours to travel the distance \( D \), the total distance \( D \) can be calculated as:
     \[
     D = 3v \times 18 = 54v
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of each turtle:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of each turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).

3. **Calculate the time it takes for four turtles to travel the distance \( D \):**
   - Let \( t \) be the time it takes for four turtles to travel the distance \( D \).
   - The total distance \( D \) can also be expressed as:
     \[
     D = 4 \times \left(\frac{v}{2}\right) \times t = 2vt
     \]
   - Since we know \( D = 54v \), we can set up the equation:
     \[
     54v = 2vt
     \]
   - Solving for \( t \):
     \[
     t = \frac{54v}{2v} = \frac{54}{2} = 27
     \]

Therefore, it will take four turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{27}

"First, let's determine how many dishes each person made based on the information provided.

Kora made 20 dishes.

Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory made:
\[ 20 + 20 = 40 \text{ dishes} \]

Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made:
\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ dishes} \]

Now, to find the total number of dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora together, we add the number of dishes each made:
\[ 20 + 40 + 80 = 140 \]

So, the total number of clay dishes they all made together is:
\[ 140 \]"
"First, let's determine the final price of the laptop after the trade-in discount. The original price of the laptop is $600, and the trade-in discount is $200. Therefore, the final price of the laptop is:

\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means she currently has:

\[ 400 - 50 = 350 \]

Erika has received money from three sources: her part-time job, her mom, and her savings in her purse. Let's denote the amount of money she has in her purse as \( x \). The total amount of money she has is the sum of her part-time job earnings, her mom's contribution, and her savings:

\[ 150 + 80 + x = 350 \]

Now, we can solve for \( x \):

\[ 230 + x = 350 \]
\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

So, Erika has $120 in her purse. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of slices Adam gets from the large apples. Since each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces and Adam slices 3 large apples, the total number of slices from the large apples is:
\[ 3 \text{ apples} \times 5 \text{ slices/apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of slices Adam gets from the small apples. Since each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces and Adam slices 5 small apples, the total number of slices from the small apples is:
\[ 5 \text{ apples} \times 3 \text{ slices/apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's find the total number of slices Adam has after slicing all the apples:
\[ 15 \text{ slices (from large apples)} + 15 \text{ slices (from small apples)} = 30 \text{ slices} \]

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:
\[ 30 \text{ slices} - 15 \text{ slices} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 15 \]"
"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to have to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to calculate the current daily milk production and then find out how much additional milk is needed.

The current daily milk production from 3 cows is:
\[ 5 \text{ liters/cow/day} \times 3 \text{ cows} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The additional milk needed is:
\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed to produce the additional 10 liters of milk is:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow/day}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs to have 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the remaining length of each glue stick and then sum these lengths.

\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, let's calculate the total cost of the packs of water balloons. Craig buys 3 packs of water balloons at $3 each, so:

\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's find the total cost of the squirt guns and water balloons combined:

\[ 12 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find out how much money Craig has left, we subtract the total cost of the squirt guns and water balloons from the initial amount of money he had:

"First, let's determine the number of socks Jack has. According to the problem, Jack collected twice as many dishes as he had socks. If Jack collected 60 dishes, then he had:

\[ \text{Number of socks Jack has} = \frac{\text{Number of dishes Jack has}}{2} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

Next, we need to find out how many socks Peter has. The problem states that Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. Therefore:

\[ \text{Number of socks Peter has} = 2 \times \text{Number of socks Jack has} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together. Jack has 60 dishes and 30 socks, and Peter has 60 socks and 0 dishes (since the problem does not mention any dishes Peter has). Therefore, the total number of socks and dishes is:

\[ \text{Total number of socks} = 30 + 60 = 90 \]
\[ \text{Total number of dishes} = 60 + 0 = 60 \]
\[ \text{Total number of socks and dishes} = 90 + 60 = 150 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many students are good at math, we need to consider the information given:

- There are 20 students in total.
- 5 students are good at math only.
- 8 students perform well in English only.
- The rest are good at both math and English.

First, we calculate the number of students who are good at both math and English. Since the total number of students is 20, and we know the number of students who are good at math only and those who perform well in English only, we can find the number of students who are good at both by subtracting the sum of students who are good at math only and those who perform well in English only from the total number of students.

Let's denote:
- \( M \) as the number of students good at math.
- \( E \) as the number of students good at English.
- \( B \) as the number of students good at both math and English.

From the problem, we know:
- \( M = 5 \) (students good at math only)
- \( E = 8 \) (students good at English only)
- The rest are good at both math and English.

The number of students good at both math and English is:
\[ B = 20 - (5 + 8) = 20 - 13 = 7 \]

Now, to find the total number of students good at math, we need to add the students who are good at math only to the students who are good at both math and English:
\[ M = 5 + 7 = 12 \]

Thus, the total number of students good at math is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time required for one group to perform, including the time for getting on and off stage, and the intermission.

The time for one group is:

- 6 minutes to perform
- 2 minutes to exit the stage
- 10 minutes intermission

Adding these times together:
\[ 2 + 6 + 2 + 10 = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

The total duration of the concert is 2 hours, which is equivalent to:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

To find out how many groups can perform, we divide the total concert time by the time required for one group:
\[ \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:

"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years with simple interest, we can use the formula for simple interest:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Given:
- Principal (\(P\)) = $300
- Rate (\(R\)) = \(\frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225\%\)
- Time (\(T\)) = 3 years

First, we calculate the simple interest:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 225\% \times 3 \]

Since the rate is given as a percentage, we convert it to a decimal by dividing by 100:

\[ 225\% = 2.25 \]

So,

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 2.25 \times 3 = 2025 \]

The total amount after 3 years is the sum of the principal and the simple interest:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Simple Interest} = 300 + 2025 = 2325 \]

Therefore, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:

\[ \boxed{2325} \]"

"First, let's determine the number of goats sold from each farm.

From Farm X, Mr. Smith sold 10 goats.

From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats as from Farm X, which means he sold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) goats.

Now, let's calculate the number of goats remaining in each farm.

Initially, Farm X had 55 goats. After selling 10 goats, the number of goats left in Farm X is:
\[ 55 - 10 = 45 \]

Initially, Farm Y had 45 goats. After selling 20 goats, the number of goats left in Farm Y is:
\[ 45 - 20 = 25 \]

To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the remaining goats from Farm X and Farm Y:
\[ 45 + 25 = 70 \]

Therefore, the total number of goats left in the two farms altogether is:
\[ 70 \]"
"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
2. Divide the total amount spent on shoes by the total number of pairs bought.

James buys 2 pairs of shoes each month. There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of pairs of shoes he buys in a year is:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair of shoes, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs bought:
\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

So, the average amount James pays for each pair of shoes is:

"To determine the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built each year and then sum them up.

1. In the first year, the town builds 12 homes.
2. In the second year, the town builds three times the number of homes built in the first year. Therefore, the number of homes built in the second year is \(3 \times 12 = 36\).
3. In the third year, the town builds double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total number of homes built in the first two years is \(12 + 36 = 48\). Therefore, the number of homes built in the third year is \(2 \times 48 = 96\).

Now, we sum the number of homes built over the three years:
\[12 + 36 + 96 = 144\]

The total number of homes built over the next three years is \(\boxed{144}\)."
"Let's denote the ages of the individuals as follows:
- Let \( S \) be my sister's age.
- Let \( B \) be my brother's age.
- Let \( M \) be my mom's age.
- Let \( Y \) be my age.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. I am three years younger than my brother: \( Y = B - 3 \).
2. I am two years older than my sister: \( Y = S + 2 \).
3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age: \( M = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all our ages is 87: \( Y + B + S + M = 87 \).

First, we can express \( S \) and \( M \) in terms of \( Y \) and \( B \):
- From \( Y = S + 2 \), we get \( S = Y - 2 \).
- From \( M = 3B - 1 \), we substitute \( B = Y + 3 \) (since \( Y = B - 3 \)) to get \( M = 3(Y + 3) - 1 = 3Y + 9 - 1 = 3Y + 8 \).

Now we substitute \( S \) and \( M \) in the sum of the ages equation:
\[ Y + B + S + M = 87 \]
\[ Y + B + (Y - 2) + (3Y + 8) = 87 \]
\[ Y + B + Y - 2 + 3Y + 8 = 87 \]
\[ 5Y + B + 6 = 87 \]
\[ 5Y + B = 81 \]

Since \( B = Y + 3 \), we substitute \( B \) in the equation:
\[ 5Y + (Y + 3) = 81 \]
\[ 6Y + 3 = 81 \]
\[ 6Y = 78 \]
\[ Y = 13 \]

So, my age is \( 13 \).

"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glue sticks needed.
2. Determine how many packs are required to provide at least that many glue sticks.

First, calculate the total number of glue sticks needed:
\[ 27 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ glue sticks per student} = 54 \text{ glue sticks} \]

Next, determine how many packs of glue sticks are needed. Since glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks by the number of sticks per pack and round up to the nearest whole number (since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs):
\[ \frac{54}{8} = 6.75 \]

Since 6.75 packs means he needs to buy 7 packs to ensure he has enough glue sticks (as he can't buy a fraction of a pack and he wants to have some extra).

Therefore, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 7 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Amount of Water**: The initial amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

2. **After the First Day**: The amount of water doubles. Therefore, the amount of water after the first day is:
   \[
   4000 \text{ gallons} \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **After the Second Day**: The amount of water doubles again. Therefore, the amount of water after the second day is:
   \[
   8000 \text{ gallons} \times 2 = 16000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

4. **After the Third Day**: The volume of water increases by 6000 gallons. Therefore, the amount of water after the third day is:
   \[
   16000 \text{ gallons} + 6000 \text{ gallons} = 22000 \text{ gallons}

So, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point after the third day is 22000 gallons."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of new infections each day and add them to the total number of infected people.

- **Day 0**: Initially, there are 10 infected people.
- **Day 1**: Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others, so the number of new infections is \(10 \times 6 = 60\). Therefore, the total number of infected people after Day 1 is \(10 + 60 = 70\).
- **Day 2**: Now there are 70 infected people, and each of them infects 6 others. So, the number of new infections is \(70 \times 6 = 420\). Therefore, the total number of infected people after Day 2 is \(70 + 420 = 490\).
- **Day 3**: Now there are 490 infected people, and each of them infects 6 others. So, the number of new infections is \(490 \times 6 = 2940\). Therefore, the total number of infected people after Day 3 is \(490 + 2940 = 3430\).

So, the total number of people infected after three days is \(\boxed{3430}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Rafaela received as tips. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate the total as follows:

\[ \text{Total tips for Rafaela} = 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Julieta received as tips. According to the problem, Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To find out how much Julieta received, we calculate 10% of Rafaela's total tips and subtract that from Rafaela's total tips:

\[ \text{10% of Rafaela's total tips} = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]

\[ \text{Total tips for Julieta} = 800 - 80 = 720 \]

Now, to find out how much money Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether, we add their individual totals:

\[ \text{Total tips for Julieta and Rafaela} = 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1520 \]"

"First, let's determine the number of green cars. Since there are 12 red cars and 2 fewer green cars than red cars, we can calculate the number of green cars as follows:

\[ \text{Number of green cars} = \text{Number of red cars} - 2 = 12 - 2 = 10 \]

Next, we calculate the number of blue cars. The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars:

\[ \text{Number of blue cars} = 3 \times \text{Number of green cars} = 3 \times 10 = 30 \]

Now, we can find the total number of red, green, and blue cars:

\[ \text{Total number of red, green, and blue cars} = 12 + 10 + 30 = 52 \]

Given that the total number of cars in the rink is 75, we can find the number of yellow cars by subtracting the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:

\[ \text{Number of yellow cars} = 75 - 52 = 23 \]

So, the number of yellow cars is:

"Let's denote the number of books that Anne has as \( A \). According to the problem, Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has \( A + 25 \) books. Additionally, Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Fawn has \( A + 12 \) books.

The total number of books that Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have together is 85. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ (A + 25) + A + (A + 12) = 85 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 3A + 37 = 85 \]

Next, we solve for \( A \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. Subtract 37 from both sides:
\[ 3A = 48 \]

Then, divide both sides by 3:
\[ A = 16 \]

So, Anne has 16 books. Since Fawn has 12 more books than Anne, we can find the number of books Fawn has by adding 12 to the number of books Anne has:
\[ A + 12 = 16 + 12 = 28 \]

Therefore, Fawn has 28 books. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{28} \]"
"First, we need to determine the weight of the bag of sweet potatoes. Since the bag of sweet potatoes weighs 2 times as much as the bag of potatoes, and the bag of potatoes weighs 5 pounds, we can calculate the weight of the sweet potatoes as follows:

\[ \text{Weight of sweet potatoes} = 2 \times \text{Weight of potatoes} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find the weight of the bag of carrots. The bag of carrots weighs 3 pounds fewer than the bag of sweet potatoes. Therefore, we can calculate the weight of the carrots as follows:

\[ \text{Weight of carrots} = \text{Weight of sweet potatoes} - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the number of pounds of carrots Daisy bought is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of jello cups Greg needs to make. Since there are 30 kids and each kid should have 4 jello cups, the total number of jello cups required is:

"To determine how much Keenan spends per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total monthly cost that Madeline pays.
2. Calculate the total monthly cost that Keenan pays.
3. Determine the weekly cost that Keenan pays.

First, we know that Madeline pays 60% of the $400 monthly cost. So, we calculate Madeline's share as follows:
\[ \text{Madeline's share} = 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the total cost is $400, Keenan's share is:
\[ \text{Keenan's share} = 400 - 240 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much Keenan spends per week. There are approximately 4 weeks in a month, so we divide Keenan's monthly cost by 4:
\[ \text{Keenan's weekly cost} = \frac{160}{4} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"

\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ pieces}
\]

After the first day, the number of pieces remaining is:

\[
60 - 24 = 36 \text{ pieces}
\]

On the second day, Tobias ate 10 pieces, so the number of pieces remaining after the second day is:

\[
36 - 10 = 26 \text{ pieces}
\]

On the third day, Tobias ate \( \frac{7}{13} \) of the remaining 26 pieces:

\[

"To determine how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Use the total revenue to find the cost of the chickens.

First, we calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell. He plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his 300 chickens:
\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \text{ chickens}
\]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling these 180 chickens at $50 per chicken:
\[
180 \times 50 = 9000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, the total cost of the chickens must be the total revenue minus the profit:
\[
9000 - 2000 = 7000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the amount of money Isaias bought the chickens for is:
\[
\boxed{7000}

"First, let's determine how many glasses of lemonade Micah sold. We know that Julie, Micah, and Mitchell together sold 32 glasses of lemonade, and Julie sold 14 glasses. Therefore, the number of glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell together is:

\[ 32 - 14 = 18 \]

Since the boys (Micah and Mitchell) sold an equal number of glasses, we can divide the 18 glasses equally between them:

\[ \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

So, Micah sold 9 glasses of lemonade. Now, we need to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah:

\[ 14 - 9 = 5 \]

Therefore, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah. The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the rope Sarah has. The rope is 20 meters long and costs $2 per meter. Therefore, the total cost of the rope is:

\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times 2 \text{ dollars/meter} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Sarah plans to use the profit from selling the rope to buy a new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter. To find out how many meters of the new rope she can buy, we need to determine how many meters of the original rope she can sell. Since the original rope costs $2 per meter, the number of meters she can sell is:

\[ \frac{40 \text{ dollars}}{2 \text{ dollars/meter}} = 20 \text{ meters} \]

With 20 meters of the original rope, she can buy 20 meters of the new rope. The cost of the new rope is:

\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars/meter} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Sarah spent $40 on the original rope and she uses the profit to buy the new rope, she will have:

\[ 40 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money Sarah will have left over after she buys the new rope is:

"To solve this problem, let's denote Melanie's current age as \( x \).

According to the problem, in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 10 = 18 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 18 - 10 \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, Melanie's current age is 8 years old.

We need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. Let's denote the number of years from now as \( y \). At that time, her age will be \( 8 + y \), and we want this to be three times her current age:
\[ 8 + y = 3 \times 8 \]
\[ 8 + y = 24 \]

Solving for \( y \):
\[ y = 24 - 8 \]
\[ y = 16 \]

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of each item Kelly is purchasing:

1. **Bacon:**
   - Kelly has 5 packs of bacon.
   - The total cost for the bacon is $10.
   - Therefore, the cost per pack of bacon is \( \frac{10}{5} = $2 \).

2. **Chicken:**
   - Kelly has 6 packets of chicken.
   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - Since a pack of bacon costs $2, a packet of chicken costs \( 2 \times 2 = $4 \).
   - Therefore, the total cost for the chicken is \( 6 \times 4 = $24 \).

3. **Strawberries:**
   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries.
   - Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the strawberries is \( 3 \times 4 = $12 \).

4. **Apples:**
   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples.
   - Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   - Since a pack of strawberries costs $4, a pack of apples costs \( \frac{4}{2} = $2 \).
   - Therefore, the total cost for the apples is \( 7 \times 2 = $14 \).

Now, let's sum up the total cost of all the items:
- Total cost of bacon: $10
- Total cost of chicken: $24
- Total cost of strawberries: $12
- Total cost of apples: $14

The total cost of all items is \( 10 + 24 + 12 + 14 = $60 \).

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget:
- Money left = $65 - $60 = $5.

"Let's denote the usual runtime of Elaina's concerts as \( x \) minutes. According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, so the final concert is \( 2x \) minutes long. Additionally, at the end of the final concert, she performs a 15-minute encore. Therefore, the total runtime of the final concert, including the encore, is \( 2x + 15 \) minutes.

We are given that the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. So we can set up the following equation:
\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual runtime of Elaina's concerts is 25 minutes. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many microphones are left after 20% of them are not able to fit in pairs. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Calculate 20% of the total microphones:
   \[
   20\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10
   \]
   So, 10 microphones won't fit in pairs.

2. Subtract the number of microphones that won't fit from the total number of microphones to find out how many microphones can be paired:
   \[
   50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. Since the remaining 40 microphones are to be arranged in pairs, we divide by 2 to find the number of pairs:

"First, let's determine the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants, so we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. We find the number of flowering plants by subtracting the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:

\[ \text{Number of flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25 \]

To find what percent of the total plants are flowering plants, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

- Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she mowed Joe's lawn.
- Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she mowed Joe's lawn.
- Joe paid Tasha $6 for mowing his lawn.

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( x \).

Then:
- The number of times Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn is \( 3x \).
- The number of times Tasha mowed Alba's lawn is \( 5x \).

The total earnings from mowing lawns can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Total earnings from mowing lawns} = 6x + 6(3x) + 6(5x) \]
\[ = 6x + 18x + 30x \]
\[ = 54x \]

To find \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{54}{54} = 1 \]

Now, we can calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns:
\[ 54x = 54 \times 1 = 54 \]

Subtracting the earnings from mowing lawns from the total earnings gives the earnings from lemonade sales:
\[ \text{Earnings from lemonade sales} = 80 - 54 = 26 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"First, let's determine Carl's weight. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, we can calculate Carl's weight as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's weight} = \text{Martin's weight} + 16 \]
\[ \text{Carl's weight} = 55 \, \text{kg} + 16 \, \text{kg} \]
\[ \text{Carl's weight} = 71 \, \text{kg} \]

Next, we calculate Christian's weight, which is 8 kg more than Carl's weight:

\[ \text{Christian's weight} = \text{Carl's weight} + 8 \]
\[ \text{Christian's weight} = 71 \, \text{kg} + 8 \, \text{kg} \]
\[ \text{Christian's weight} = 79 \, \text{kg} \]

Finally, we determine Harry's weight, which is 5 kg less than Christian's weight:

\[ \text{Harry's weight} = \text{Christian's weight} - 5 \]
\[ \text{Harry's weight} = 79 \, \text{kg} - 5 \, \text{kg} \]
\[ \text{Harry's weight} = 74 \, \text{kg} \]

So, the weight of Harry is 74 kg."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours John rents his car out in a month. He rents his car 10 times a month, and each time for 3 hours. So, the total number of hours rented in a month is:

\[ 10 \text{ times/month} \times 3 \text{ hours/time} = 30 \text{ hours/month} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money John earns from renting his car in a month. He gets paid $25 per hour, so:

\[ 30 \text{ hours/month} \times 25 \text{ dollars/hour} = 750 \text{ dollars/month} \]

Now, we need to find out the profit John makes. To do this, we subtract his monthly car payment from his monthly earnings:

\[ 750 \text{ dollars/month} - 500 \text{ dollars/month} = 250 \text{ dollars/month} \]

So, the profit John makes on his car is:

\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"First, let's determine how many notebooks Martha originally had. We know that after buying 5 more notebooks, Martha has a total of 7 notebooks. Therefore, we can calculate the number of notebooks Martha originally had as follows:

\[ \text{Martha's original notebooks} = 7 - 5 = 2 \]

Next, we know that Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha originally had. So, we can calculate the number of notebooks Joseph had as follows:

\[ \text{Joseph's notebooks} = 3 \times \text{Martha's original notebooks} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. We do this by subtracting the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number of notebooks Martha has:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Martha's total notebooks} - \text{Joseph's notebooks} = 7 - 6 = 1 \]

So, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many miles Anis rowed. We know that Anis rowed \(\frac{1}{5}\) times more miles than Dijana. Since Dijana rowed 50 miles, we can calculate the additional miles Anis rowed as follows:

\[
\text{Additional miles Anis rowed} = \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles}
\]

Adding this to the 50 miles Dijana rowed gives us the total distance Anis rowed:

\[
\text{Total miles Anis rowed} = 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles}
\]

Next, we calculate the total distance both Dijana and Anis rowed together:

\[
\text{Total distance} = \text{Distance Dijana rowed} + \text{Distance Anis rowed} = 50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles}
\]

So, the total distance the two of them rowed on that day is:

\[
\boxed{110}

"First, let's determine how many pages each person read over the two days.

Yesterday:
- Denise read 10 pages.
- Daniel read 13 pages.

Today:
- Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.
- Daniel was not able to read any pages today, so he read 0 pages today.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages each person read over the two days:
- Denise's total: \(10 + 18 = 28\) pages.
- Daniel's total: \(13 + 0 = 13\) pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total number of pages Daniel read from the total number of pages Denise read:
\[ 28 - 13 = 15 \]

So, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total amount of soup in terms of adult bowls:**
   - Calvin is an adult, so the pot can fill 4 adult bowls.

2. **Calculate the total number of bowls needed for the family:**
   - Calvin (1 adult) + Calvin's wife (1 adult) + 2 children (2 children) = 4 bowls in total.

3. **Determine the number of bowls that can be filled from the pot:**
   - Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls, it can also fill 8 child's bowls.
   - Therefore, the pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child's bowls.

4. **Calculate the number of leftover bowls after the family has eaten:**
   - The family needs 4 bowls in total.
   - Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls, all 4 bowls will be used up by the family.

"To determine how much material Jo would need to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum the results.

First, let's find out how much material is needed for 20 small masks. We know that 4 small masks require 2 yards of material. Therefore, the amount of material needed for 1 small mask is:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} \]
So, for 20 small masks, the material needed is:
\[ 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's find out how much material is needed for 8 large masks. We know that 3 large masks require 2.25 yards of material. Therefore, the amount of material needed for 1 large mask is:
\[ \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} \]
So, for 8 large masks, the material needed is:
\[ 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we add the material needed for the small masks and the large masks to get the total material required:
\[ 10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards} \]

Therefore, the total amount of material Jo would need to make 20 small and 8 large masks is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To find the average price per ticket, we first need to determine the total number of tickets Fast and the Furious movies that Deepa has seen. Since there are 9 movies and she has seen each one three times, the total number of tickets is:

\[ 9 \text{ movies} \times 3 \text{ times per movie} = 27 \text{ tickets} \]

Deepa has spent a total of $216 on these tickets. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets:

\[ \text{Average price per ticket} = \frac{216}{27} \]

Now, let's perform the division:

"To determine how much free time Harold has left in his day, we need to calculate the total time he spends on his activities and then subtract that from the total hours in a day.

1. Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. He works for 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.
3. He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, let's add up the time spent on these activities:
\[ \text{Total time spent on activities} = \text{Sleep} + \text{Work} + \text{Dog walking} = 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 \text{ hours} \]

A day has 24 hours, so the free time Harold has left is:
\[ \text{Free time} = \text{Total hours in a day} - \text{Total time spent on activities} = 24 - 19 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information provided.

Let \( D \) be Duncan's age eight years ago and \( A \) be Adam's age four years ago.

From the problem, we know:
1. Duncan's current age is 60.
2. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( 60 - 8 = 52 \).
3. Eight years ago, Duncan's age (\( D \)) was two times Adam's age four years ago (\( A \)).
4. Therefore, we can write the equation: \( D = 2A \).

Substituting the value of \( D \) from the first piece of information:
\[ 52 = 2A \]

Solving for \( A \):
\[ A = \frac{52}{2} = 26 \]

So, four years ago, Adam was 26 years old. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his age four years ago:
\[ 26 + 8 = 34 \]

Therefore, Adam will be 34 years old in 8 years.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of red balloons as \( R \) and the number of yellow balloons as \( Y \). According to the problem, \( R = 20 \).

Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon, so the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is \( 2R \). Given that \( R = 20 \), the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \).

The total number of pieces of bologna thrown at all the balloons is 58. Therefore, the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons is \( 58 - 40 = 18 \).

Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, the number of yellow balloons \( Y \) can be found by dividing the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons by 3. So, \( Y = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).

Thus, the number of yellow balloons is \( 6 \).

2. **Wednesday**: Bruce works twice the time he works on Tuesday. Therefore, he works \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.
3. **Thursday**: Bruce works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday. Therefore, he works \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.

Now, we sum the hours worked over the three days:
\[ 5 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 10 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 8 \text{ (Thursday)} = 23 \text{ hours} \]

The total number of hours Bruce works in all these three days is \(\boxed{23}\)."
"To determine how much Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount spent and then divide it by 2.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items they bought:
- The cake costs $11.
- They bought 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons. Since the balloons cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, the cost per balloon is $0.5 / 2 = $0.25. Therefore, the cost for 12 balloons is 12 * $0.25 = $3.
- They bought 2 tubs of ice cream, each costing $7, so the total cost for the ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$11 + \$3 + \$14 = \$28 \]

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to buy these items, the total amount given by their mother is $28. Since they split the money equally, each of them received:
\[ \text{Amount each received} = \frac{\$28}{2} = \$14 \]

Thus, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $14.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class. Since there are 30 students and each student sold an average of 10 lollipops, the total number of lollipops sold is:

\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops. Each lollypop was sold for $0.8, so the total revenue is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollypop} = \$240 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops. Each lollypop was bought for $0.5, so the total cost is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollypop} = \$150 \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ \$240 - \$150 = \$90 \]

So, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cups of chamomile and mint tea Lana brews in each row, and then find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row.

First, let's determine how many cups of chamomile and mint tea Lana brews in total. Since she has 27 cups and she uses 15 of them for cinnamon tea, the remaining cups are for chamomile and mint tea:
\[ 27 - 15 = 12 \]
So, she brews 12 cups of chamomile and mint tea combined. Since she divides these cups into 3 rows with an equal number of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, we can let \( x \) be the number of cups of chamomile tea and \( x \) be the number of cups of mint tea in each row. Therefore, the total number of cups of chamomile and mint tea is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground, given that he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

First, let's break down the time spent on each trip:
- The sloth takes 4 hours to make the trip down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up into his tree.

Since the sloth needs to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we need to find out how many trips he can make in 8 hours.

The time for one complete trip (down and back) is 4 hours. Therefore, in 8 hours, the number of complete trips the sloth can make is:
\[ \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips} \]

Since the sloth needs to collect 24 berries in 8 hours and he can make 2 trips in that time, the number of berries he needs to pick up per trip is:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip} \]

Thus, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip down to the ground is:

"First, we need to determine the amount of water in the tank. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons of water, the tank will have:

\[ \text{Tank capacity} = \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much water will be left in the tank after 6 days, given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. The total amount of water removed from the tank over 6 days is:

\[ \text{Total water removed} = 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

"To determine how many more movies Colby can see, we need to calculate his remaining budget after accounting for the items he has already purchased.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items he has already bought:
- 2 tubs of popcorn: \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars
- 4 boxes of candy: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars
- 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday: \(5 \times 10 = 50\) dollars
- 8 movies on other days: \(8 \times 7 = 56\) dollars

Adding these together gives the total spent:
\[16 + 8 + 50 + 56 = 120\]

Colby starts with $150, so his remaining budget is:
\[150 - 120 = 30\]

Now, we need to determine how many more movies he can see with the remaining $30. Each movie ticket costs $7, so we divide the remaining budget by the cost of one movie ticket:
\[30 \div 7 = 4 \text{ R } 2\]

This means he can see 4 more full movies with the remaining $30, and he will have $2 left over.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine the number of calories in a mini cinnamon roll and a mini blueberry muffin.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, so a mini cinnamon roll, which has 1/3rd of the calories, has:
\[ \frac{600}{3} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, so a mini blueberry muffin, which has 1/3rd of the calories, has:
\[ \frac{450}{3} = 150 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we calculate the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins.

The total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls are:
\[ 200 \text{ mini cinnamon rolls} \times 200 \text{ calories per mini cinnamon roll} = 40000 \text{ calories} \]

The total calories from the mini blueberry muffins are:

243 + 57 = 299
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days is 299.

Next, we calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day by dividing the total by the number of days (5):
\[
\frac{299}{5} = 59.8
\]

Thus, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is:
\[
\boxed{59.8}

"First, we calculate the distance traveled by the bus. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For the bus:
\[ \text{Speed} = 60 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, the distance traveled by the bus is:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \times 5 = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance traveled by the car:
\[ \text{Speed} = 30 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

So, the distance traveled by the car is:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 30 \times 8 = 240 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 300 - 240 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 60 \]"
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to calculate the total number of toys Sophie already had before buying the bouncy balls and then subtract that from the total number of toys she has now.

The total number of toys Sophie had before buying the bouncy balls is the sum of the building blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings:
\[ 31 \text{ (building blocks)} + 8 \text{ (stuffed animals)} + 9 \text{ (stacking rings)} = 48 \text{ toys} \]

Sophie now has a total of 62 toys. To find out how many bouncy balls were in the tube, we subtract the number of toys she had before from the total number of toys she has now:
\[ 62 \text{ (total toys now)} - 48 \text{ (toys before)} = 14 \text{ bouncy balls} \]

So, the number of bouncy balls that came in the tube is 14."
"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old:
   \[
   P + Pa + J = 100
   \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   Pa = J + 10
   \]

3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = Pa + J
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[
Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

So, Peter's age is \( 50 \) years old. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]"
"Initially, Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons, which totals to \(4 \times 2 = 8\) water balloons. Maria also received 2 water balloons, so the total number of water balloons at this point is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Then, her mom gave each person 3 more water balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional water balloons is \(5 \times 3 = 15\).

Adding these to the previous total, the girls had \(10 + 15 = 25\) water balloons in total.

The final numerical answer is 25."
"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes of stuff available for the yard sale.

1. The charity group has 10 people who each donate 5 boxes of stuff. So, the total number of boxes donated is:
   \[
   10 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ boxes/person} = 50 \text{ boxes}
   \]

2. They also have 10 boxes of stuff already. So, the total number of boxes available is:
   \[
   50 \text{ boxes donated} + 10 \text{ boxes already owned} = 60 \text{ boxes}
   \]

Next, we need to determine how many tables are needed to fit all the boxes. They can fit 2 boxes per table.

3. The number of tables needed to fit 60 boxes is:
   \[
   \frac{60 \text{ boxes}}{2 \text{ boxes/table}} = 30 \text{ tables}
   \]

They already own 15 tables.

4. The number of new tables needed is:
   \[
   30 \text{ tables needed} - 15 \text{ tables owned} = 15 \text{ new tables}
   \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
15

"First, we need to calculate the total distance each person spits the seeds.

For Zoey:
- Number of seeds = 40
- Distance per seed = 10 feet
- Total distance = 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet

For Sydney:
- Number of seeds = 35
- Distance per seed = 12 feet
- Total distance = 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet

Next, we find the total distance both spitted:
- Total distance = Zoey's total distance + Sydney's total distance
- Total distance = 400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance by the number of people (2):
- Average total distance = Total distance / Number of people
- Average total distance = 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet

The final numerical answer is 410 feet."
"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the daily, monthly, and total widget production for each machine, and then calculate the revenue from selling those widgets.

First, let's calculate the daily widget production for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: \(60 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 1440 \text{ widgets/day}\)
- WidgetMaster 9000: \(45 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 1080 \text{ widgets/day}\)

Next, let's calculate the monthly widget production for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: \(1440 \text{ widgets/day} \times 30 \text{ days/month} = 43200 \text{ widgets/month}\)
- WidgetMaster 9000: \(1080 \text{ widgets/day} \times 30 \text{ days/month} = 32400 \text{ widgets/month}\)

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling the widgets for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: \(43200 \text{ widgets} \times \$6/\text{widget} = \$259200\)
- WidgetMaster 9000: \(32400 \text{ widgets} \times \$6/\text{widget} = \$194400\)

Finally, let's find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000:
- Difference in revenue: \(\$259200 - \$194400 = \$64800\)

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the total cost of his stay under both options and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost if Cameron pays for a 24-hour stay:
- The initial 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos.
- The additional 12 hours cost 12 * 70 pesos = 840 pesos.
- Therefore, the total cost for a 24-hour stay is 1000 + 840 = 1840 pesos.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Cameron pays for the additional hours after the initial 12 hours:
- The initial 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos.
- The additional 12 hours Cameron stays cost 12 * 70 pesos = 840 pesos.
- Therefore, the total cost for the additional hours is 840 pesos.

Adding these together, the total cost for Cameron's stay is 1000 + 840 = 1840 pesos.

Since the cost in both scenarios is the same (1840 pesos), Cameron would not save any money. The savings would be:
\[ 1840 - 1840 = 0 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{0}

"First, let's determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. So, we calculate twice the amount each goat needs and then subtract 3 pounds:

\[ \text{Hay per sheep} = 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep. There are 15 goats, and each needs 5 pounds of hay:

\[ \text{Total hay for goats} = 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

There are 12 sheep, and each needs 7 pounds of hay:

\[ \text{Total hay for sheep} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the total hay needed for the goats and the sheep gives us the total amount of hay Nate needs:

\[ \text{Total hay needed} = 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 159 \]"
"First, let's calculate John's total earnings for the week:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Hourly wage} \times \text{Hours worked} = 50 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the cost of gas from his total earnings:
\[ \text{Remaining money after gas} = \text{Total earnings} - \text{Cost of gas} = 300 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 250 \, \text{dollars} \]

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so we subtract that from his remaining money:
\[ \text{Money left after deposit} = \text{Remaining money after gas} - \text{Deposit} = 250 \, \text{dollars} - 100 \, \text{dollars} = 150 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, we need to account for the cost of the pencils. Each pencil costs 10 dollars and he buys 5 pencils:
\[ \text{Cost of pencils} = \text{Number of pencils} \times \text{Cost per pencil} = 5 \times 10 \, \text{dollars} = 50 \, \text{dollars} \]

Subtract the cost of the pencils from the money left after the deposit:
\[ \text{Money left after pencils} = \text{Money left after deposit} - \text{Cost of pencils} = 150 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 100 \, \text{dollars} \]

Finally, we need to determine how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with the remaining money:
\[ \text{Number of pens} = \frac{\text{Money left after pencils}}{\text{Cost per pen}} = \frac{100 \, \text{dollars}}{25 \, \text{dollars/pen}} = 4 \, \text{pens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

Next, calculate the total number of children for all 5 schools:
\[ 56 \text{ children/school} \times 5 \text{ schools} = 280 \text{ children} \]

Therefore, the total number of children in the drill is:
\[ 280 \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can obtain from redeeming the coupons. The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. Therefore, the total number of bottles from the coupons is:

\[ 9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles/coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice required for the students. There are 29 pupils, and each student receives 2 bottles of apple juice. Therefore, the total number of bottles needed for the students is:

\[ 29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles/student} = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles obtained from the coupons to find out how many bottles the teacher has left for herself:

\[ 900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

Thus, the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself is:

"To calculate the total charge for Patty's Plumbing, we need to consider the following components:
- A flat fee for the visit: $40
- Labor cost: $35 per hour, for 2.25 hours. Since the labor cost is charged for part of an hour, we will round up to the next whole hour, which is 3 hours. Therefore, the labor cost is $35 * 3 = $105.
- Parts cost: $60

Now, we sum these components to find the total charge:
- Visit fee: $40
- Labor cost: $105
- Parts cost: $60

Total charge = $40 + $105 + $60 = $205

The final numerical answer is $205."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount. James gets 10 new CDs, and each CD costs $15. Therefore, the total cost before the discount is:

\[ 10 \times 15 = 150 \]

Next, we apply the 40% discount to the total cost. A 40% discount means he pays 60% of the original price. So, the total cost after the discount is:

\[ 150 \times 0.60 = 90 \]

James decides to sell 5 of the CDs he doesn't like for $40. The total amount he gets from selling these 5 CDs is $40. To find out how much money he is out, we subtract the amount he gets from selling the CDs from the total amount he spent on the CDs after the discount:

\[ 90 - 40 = 50 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 50 \]"

"First, let's calculate the distance James swims. He swims 60% of the 20-mile lake, which is:

\[ 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes for James to swim 12 miles at a pace of 2 miles per hour:

\[ \text{Time to swim 12 miles} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

After swimming, James rests for half as long as the swimming time. So, the rest time is:

\[ \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

The remaining distance to be swum is:

\[ 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

Since he swims at half the speed after resting, his new swimming speed is:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile/hour} \]

The time it takes to swim the remaining 8 miles at 1 mile per hour is:

\[ \text{Time to swim remaining 8 miles} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Adding up all the times, the total time taken is:

\[ \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours (swimming)} + 3 \text{ hours (rest)} + 8 \text{ hours (swimming)} = 17 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time it took James to get across the lake is:

"To calculate the total commission Cayley will earn, we need to calculate the commission from each newspaper separately and then sum them up.

For the New York Times:
- Commission rate: 10%
- Cost per copy: $5
- Number of copies: 6

The commission from New York Times is calculated as:
\[ \text{Commission from NYT} = 6 \times 5 \times \frac{10}{100} = 6 \times 5 \times 0.10 = 30 \times 0.10 = 3 \]

For the Wall Street Journal:
- Commission rate: 8%
- Cost per copy: $15
- Number of copies: 10

The commission from Wall Street Journal is calculated as:

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 42."
"Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as \( A \), by Bahati as \( B \), and by Dinar as \( D \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( B = A + 20 \)
2. \( B = D + 10 \)
3. \( B + A + D = 45 \)

First, we can express \( D \) in terms of \( A \) using the first two equations:
\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]
Since \( B = A + 20 \), we can substitute \( B \) in the second equation:
\[ A + 20 = D + 10 \]
Solving for \( D \), we get:
\[ D = A + 10 \]

Now we substitute \( B \) and \( D \) in terms of \( A \) into the third equation:
\[ (A + 20) + A + (A + 10) = 45 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]
Subtract 30 from both sides:
\[ 3A = 15 \]
Divide by 3:
\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored \( 5 \) points. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time Vince spent stapling reports.
2. Determine how many 15-minute intervals are in the total time.
3. Calculate the total number of reports based on the number of 15-minute intervals.

First, let's calculate the total time Vince spent stapling reports. He started at 8:00 AM and finished at 11:00 PM. The time from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Next, we convert the total time into minutes:
\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:
\[ 900 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince can staple 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, the total number of reports he stapled is:
\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

Therefore, the total number of reports Vince stapled is:

"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up early.

1. **Total sleep time**: Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Converting this to minutes:
   \[
   8 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Time spent sleepwalking**: Kim sleepwalked from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. The duration of sleepwalking is:
   \[
   2:38 \text{ a.m.} - 2:15 \text{ a.m.} = 23 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Time woke up early**: Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. This means she woke up at:
   \[
   6:00 \text{ a.m.} - 5 \text{ minutes} = 5:55 \text{ a.m.}
   \]
   The time she was awake before sleepwalking and before waking up early is:
   \[
   5:55 \text{ a.m.} - 2:15 \text{ a.m.} = 3 \text{ hours and } 40 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   Converting this to minutes:
   \[
   3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 220 \text{ minutes}

Next, we need to find out how old Shawna's father is. We know that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. Therefore, Shawna's father's age is:

\[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 45 \]"
"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate the number that is 20% less than the number reported by Courtney.

Courtney reported that there were 48 people in attendance. If this number is 20% more than the actual number, we can set up the following equation to find the actual number of people, which we will call \( x \):

\[ 48 = x + 0.20x \]
\[ 48 = 1.20x \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.20:

\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \). According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls. Therefore, we can set \( 2J = 2 \), which implies \( J = 1 \). So, Jeffrey carried 1 ball, Jason carried \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) balls, and Jordan carried \( 4 \times 1 = 4 \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey:
\[ 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Since the three boys picked up and carried all of the balls in one trip, the total number of balls the coach brought to practice is 7.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 7 \]"
"To determine how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the number of holes at the end of the first day.
3. Calculate the number of holes at the end of the third day.
4. Use the information about the number of holes at the end of the third day to find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
- Holes dug on the first day: 10
- Holes dug on the second day: 13
- Holes dug on the third day before filling: 8
- Holes filled on the third day: 2

Total holes by the end of the third day = 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29

Next, we know that the island had four times as many holes by the end of the third day as it did at the end of the first day. Let's denote the number of holes at the end of the first day as \( H_1 \). According to the problem, \( H_1 = 29 / 4 = 7.25 \). Since the number of holes must be a whole number, we need to re-evaluate the context. The problem likely means the total number of holes by the end of the third day is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day, so \( H_1 = 29 / 4 = 7.25 \) should be interpreted as the total number of holes by the end of the third day is 29, and the number of holes at the end of the first day is 7 (since 29 is not divisible by 4, it's likely a misinterpretation, and we use the total number of holes).

Now, let's find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day. The number of holes at the end of the third day is 29, and the number of holes at the end of the fourth day is the number of holes dug on the fourth day. Let's denote the number of holes dug on the fourth day as \( H_4 \). The number of holes at the end of the fourth day is the number of holes at the end of the third day plus the number of holes dug on the fourth day minus the number of holes filled on the fourth day. Since the problem states they found the treasure chest on the fourth day, we can assume they filled no holes on the fourth day. Therefore, the number of holes at the end of the fourth day is the number of holes dug on the fourth day.

So, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[ H_4 = 29 - 7 = 22 \]

Thus, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day is:
\[ \boxed{22} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of corn chips based on the given conditions.

1. Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips.
2. Collins received 15 more corn chips than the number Amora and Lainey received.

First, calculate the number of corn chips Collins received:
\[ \text{Collins' chips} = 70 + 15 = 85 \]

Next, calculate the total number of corn chips by summing the chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:
\[ \text{Total chips} = 70 + 70 + 85 \]

Now, perform the addition:
\[ 70 + 70 = 140 \]
\[ 140 + 85 = 225 \]

Therefore, the total number of corn chips is:
\[ \boxed{225} \]"
"First, we need to determine the cost of the travel tickets. The problem states that the travel tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. The supplies cost $400 in total.

To find 50% of $400, we calculate:
\[ 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

Adding this to the cost of the supplies gives us the total cost of the travel tickets:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

So, the total cost of the travel is $600.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 600 \]"
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( X = S + 5 \)
2. \( S = 4A - 13 \)
3. \( X + S + A = 339 \)

First, we substitute the expressions for \( X \) and \( S \) from the first two equations into the third equation.

Substituting \( X = S + 5 \) and \( S = 4A - 13 \) into \( X + S + A = 339 \):

\[ (4A - 13) + 5 + (4A - 13) + A = 339 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 4A - 13 + 5 + 4A - 13 + A = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Add 21 to both sides:

\[ 9A = 360 \]

Divide both sides by 9:

\[ A = 40 \]

Now, we can find \( S \) using \( S = 4A - 13 \):

\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 147 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the length of each episode**: Each episode is 20 minutes long.
2. **Determine the number of episodes**: There are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. Since each episode is 20 minutes long, the number of episodes is \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) episodes.
3. **Calculate the total time spent watching the show**: If each episode is 20 minutes long and there are 10 episodes, the total time spent watching the show is \( 20 \times 10 = 200 \) minutes.

Therefore, the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show if he watches every episode is 200 minutes.

"To determine the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the distance flown in each segment of the journey and then sum these distances.

1. **First Segment:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Direction: Norttherly
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \)

3. **Third Segment:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \)

Now, we sum the distances of all three segments to find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes:

\[ 300 \text{ miles} + 36 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 446 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is \( 446 \) miles."
"First, let's determine the total number of brownies Greta had initially.

1. Greta made a batch for herself: 1 dozen brownies.
   \[
   1 \text{ dozen} = 12 \text{ brownies}
   \]

2. At her office, she received 1/2 a dozen brownies.
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \text{ dozen} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ brownies}
   \]

3. At her friends' surprise party, she received 4 dozen brownies.
   \[
   4 \text{ dozen} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ brownies}
   \]

Next, we sum up all the brownies she received:
\[
12 \text{ (initial batch)} + 6 \text{ (from office)} + 48 \text{ (from friends)} = 66 \text{ brownies}
\]

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. We convert this to individual brownies:
\[
1 \frac{1}{2} \text{ dozen} = 1.5 \text{ dozen} = 1.5 \times 12 = 18 \text{ brownies}
\]

Finally, we subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies:
\[
66 \text{ (total brownies)} - 18 \text{ (eaten brownies)} = 48 \text{ brownies}
\]

Thus, the number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is:
\[
\boxed{48}

"First, let's determine the ages of Nani's brother and sister.

Nani's age is 8 years.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so:
\[ \text{Brother's age} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ years} \]

Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani, which means she is 75% of Nani's age:
\[ \text{Sister's age} = 0.75 \times 8 = 6 \text{ years} \]

Now, let's calculate the total age of all three family members:
\[ \text{Total age} = \text{Nani's age} + \text{Brother's age} + \text{Sister's age} \]
\[ \text{Total age} = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 \text{ years} \]

For the racquets strung with polyester string:
\[ 5 \text{ racquets} \times 22 \text{ minutes per racquet} = 110 \text{ minutes} \]

For the racquets strung with a hybrid set:
\[ 4 \text{ racquets} \times 18 \text{ minutes per racquet} = 72 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we sum these times to get the total time:
\[ 45 \text{ minutes} + 110 \text{ minutes} + 72 \text{ minutes} = 227 \text{ minutes} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total cost of the phones John buys, we need to consider the pricing structure and the number of phones he purchases.

1. The first two phones cost the full price of $600 each.
2. Each phone after the first two is half price, which means each of these additional phones costs $600 / 2 = $300.

John buys phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, which totals 4 phones.

- Cost of the first 2 phones: 2 * $600 = $1200
- Cost of the additional 2 phones (each at half price): 2 * $300 = $600

Adding these together gives the total cost:
$1200 + $600 = $1800

So, the total amount John paid for the phones is $1800."
"To find the total number of players in both teams combined, we first need to determine the number of players on Zeke's team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team as follows:

Number of players on Zeke's team = Number of players on Carlton's team + 7
Number of players on Zeke's team = 13 + 7
Number of players on Zeke's team = 20

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams combined, we add the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team:

Total number of players = Number of players on Zeke's team + Number of players on Carlton's team
Total number of players = 20 + 13
Total number of players = 33

"To determine the total number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given that the length of the fence is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 25 \]
\[ P = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know that Robert needs 2 wooden slats for every foot of fencing. Therefore, the total number of wooden slats required is:

\[ \text{Total slats} = \text{Perimeter} \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Total slats} = 50 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Total slats} = 100 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington initially had:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we calculate the number of boxes she gave to her mom and her sister:
\[ 2 \text{ boxes} + 2 \text{ boxes} = 4 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, we find out how many boxes she kept:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} - 4 \text{ boxes} = 8 \text{ boxes} \]

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges, so we need to find out how many boxes that represents:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 \text{ boxes} = 3 \text{ boxes} \]

This means she kept 3 boxes, and thus sold the remaining boxes:
\[ 8 \text{ boxes} - 3 \text{ boxes} = 5 \text{ boxes} \]

Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she sold is:
\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 20 \text{ oranges/box} = 100 \text{ oranges} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 100 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the number of states in the USA. According to the most recent data, the United States has 50 states.

Let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( S_{USA} \). Therefore, \( S_{USA} = 50 \).

According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. Let's denote the number of states in India as \( S_{India} \). Therefore, we can write the equation for the number of states in India as:
\[ S_{India} = \frac{1}{2} S_{USA} + 4 \]

Substituting the value of \( S_{USA} \):
\[ S_{India} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 + 4 \]
\[ S_{India} = 25 + 4 \]
\[ S_{India} = 29 \]

Now, to find the total number of states in both countries together, we add the number of states in India and the number of states in the USA:
\[ \text{Total number of states} = S_{India} + S_{USA} \]
\[ \text{Total number of states} = 29 + 50 \]
\[ \text{Total number of states} = 79 \]

"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Tyler wants to buy. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. Adding these together gives:

\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 41 \]

Next, we need to determine how much more money Tyler needs to buy these items. He has already saved $14, so the additional amount he needs is:

\[ 41 - 14 = 27 \]

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $27, we divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage:

\[ 27 \div 5 = 5.4 \]

Since Tyler can only work in whole hours, he needs to work 6 hours to earn at least $27. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much Sunny earned over the two days, we need to calculate the number of boxes sold for each type of baked good on both days and then compute the total earnings.

First, let's find out how many boxes of apple pie Sunny sold on each day:
- On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie.
- On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, so he sold \(15 - 4 = 11\) boxes of apple pie.

Next, let's find out how many boxes of gingerbread Sunny sold on each day:
- On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold \(10 + 5 = 15\) boxes of gingerbread.
- On Saturday, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread.

Now, let's calculate the total number of boxes sold for each type of baked good over the two days:
- Total gingerbread sold: \(10 + 15 = 25\) boxes.
- Total apple pie sold: \(11 + 15 = 26\) boxes.

Next, we calculate the total earnings from each type of baked good:
- Earnings from gingerbread: \(25 \text{ boxes} \times \$6/\text{box} = \$150\).
- Earnings from apple pie: \(26 \text{ boxes} \times \$15/\text{box} = \$390\).

Finally, we sum the earnings from both types of baked goods to find the total earnings:
\[ \$150 + \$390 = \$540 \]

Thus, the total amount Sunny earned over the two days is \(\boxed{540}\)."
"First, we need to determine the total amount of sunscreen Pamela will use while on vacation.

Pamela re-applies an ounce of sunscreen every hour she is outside. She will be outside 4 hours a day for 8 days. Therefore, the total number of hours she will be outside is:

"To solve this problem, let's define the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother as \( D \) and \( B \) respectively.

Given:
- Emil is currently 19 years old.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.

First, let's determine how many years it will be until Emil turns 24:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \text{ years} \]

When Emil turns 24, his dad's age will be:
\[ D + 5 \]

According to the problem, at that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad:
\[ 24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5) \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ 24 = \frac{D + 5}{2} \]
\[ 48 = D + 5 \]
\[ D = 43 \]

So, Emil's dad is currently 43 years old.

Next, we know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother:
\[ 24 = 2B \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{24}{2} \]
\[ B = 12 \]

So, Emil's brother is currently 12 years old.

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother:
\[ D + B = 43 + 12 = 55 \]

The sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is:

"First, let's determine the amount of crawfish Joe caught each day:

- On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
- On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.
- On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, which is \(\frac{12}{2} = 6\) pounds.

Next, we'll calculate the total amount of crawfish Joe caught over the three days:

\[ 3 \text{ pounds (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ pounds (Friday)} + 6 \text{ pounds (Saturday)} = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to determine how many servings of crawfish he has. Since each serving is 3 pounds, we divide the total amount of crawfish by the amount per serving:

\[ \frac{21 \text{ pounds}}{3 \text{ pounds per serving}} = 7 \text{ servings} \]

"First, let's find out how many students are football players. Since 20% of the class are football players, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 30 = \frac{20}{100} \times 30 = 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are football players. This means the remaining number of students is:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining 24 students are cheerleaders or part of the band. Since 25% of the remaining students are cheerleaders or part of the band, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 24 = \frac{25}{100} \times 24 = 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are either cheerleaders or part of the band. Therefore, the total number of students leaving early is the sum of the football players and the cheerleaders/band members:

"First, we need to determine how many additional plants Pat needs to fill her flower bed. The flower bed is 111 feet long. Each plant is 12 inches wide, which is equivalent to 1 foot (since 12 inches = 1 foot). Therefore, the number of plants that can fit in the flower bed is:

\[ \text{Number of plants} = \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{1 \text{ foot/plant}} = 111 \text{ plants} \]

Next, we need to account for the space between the plants. Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant. The total space taken up by the plants and the spaces between them can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Total space taken by plants and spaces} = 111 \text{ plants} \times 1 \text{ foot/plant} + (111 - 1) \times 1.5 \text{ feet} \]
\[ = 111 \text{ feet} + 110 \times 1.5 \text{ feet} \]
\[ = 111 \text{ feet} + 165 \text{ feet} \]
\[ = 276 \text{ feet} \]

Since the flower bed is only 111 feet long, it is clear that Pat cannot fit 111 plants with 1.5 feet between each plant. We need to find the maximum number of plants that can fit in the 111 feet, considering the 1.5 feet spacing.

Let \( n \) be the number of plants. The total space taken by \( n \) plants and the spaces between them is:

\[ n + (n - 1) \times 1.5 = 111 \]
\[ n + 1.5n - 1.5 = 111 \]
\[ 2.5n - 1.5 = 111 \]
\[ 2.5n = 112.5 \]
\[ n = \frac{112.5}{2.5} \]
\[ n = 45 \]

So, Pat can fit 45 plants in her flower bed. Since Pat already owns 17 plants, she needs to buy:

\[ 45 - 17 = 28 \text{ additional plants} \]

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional plants is:

\[ 28 \times 6 = 168 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Pat will spend at the store is:

\[ \boxed{168} \]"
"To determine how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we first need to find out how many pretzels his brother eats in a day. Since Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, we calculate:

- Cost of sweet potato vines: 2 sweet potato vines * $2.50/vine = $5.00

Total cost for one basket:
$9.00 (petunias) + $5.00 (sweet potato vines) = $14.00

Now, we need to find the total cost for 5 baskets:
$14.00/basket * 5 baskets = $70.00

Therefore, the total amount Katherine will spend is $70.00."
"First, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used by the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, and they are planting 4 sunflowers:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they are planting 10 carnations:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add the soil used by the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

They have a 30-pound bag of soil. Subtract the soil used by the sunflowers and carnations from the total soil:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. Therefore, the number of roses they can plant with the remaining 3 pounds of soil is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"First, we need to calculate how much Jessica sets aside each month for fancy shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly paycheck.

\[ \text{Monthly savings for shoes} = 25\% \times \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times \$2,000.00 = \$500.00 \]

Next, we need to determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy with her monthly savings. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes per month} = \frac{\$500.00}{\$1,000.00} = 0.5 \]

Since Jessica can only buy whole pairs of shoes, she can buy 0 pairs of shoes per month.

To find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year, we need to consider the number of months in a year, which is 12.

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes per year} = 0.5 \times 12 = 6 \]

However, since she can only buy whole pairs, the number of pairs she can buy in a year is:

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes per year} = 0 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 0 \]"
"First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, the time required to peel 90 shrimp is:

\[ \text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to saute 30 shrimp. Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, the time required to saute 90 shrimp is:

\[ \text{Time to saute 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/10 minutes}} = 3 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Emily can either peel or saute shrimp simultaneously, the total time required to peel and saute 90 shrimp is the longer of the two times calculated. In this case, it is 30 minutes.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 30 \text{ minutes} \]"
"First, let's calculate the temperature change during each phase of the air conditioner's operation.

1. **Low setting for 3 hours:**
   - Cooling rate: 2 degrees per hour
   - Time: 3 hours
   - Temperature change: \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ degrees}\)

2. **High setting for 4 hours:**
   - Cooling rate: 3 degrees per hour
   - Time: 4 hours
   - Temperature change: \(3 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ degrees}\)

3. **Off for 2 hours:**
   - No cooling, so the temperature increases by 2 degrees per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Temperature change: \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ degrees}\)

Now, let's sum up the temperature changes:
- Total cooling: \(6 \text{ degrees} + 12 \text{ degrees} = 18 \text{ degrees}\)
- Total warming: \(4 \text{ degrees}\)

The net change in temperature is:
- Net change: \(18 \text{ degrees} - 4 \text{ degrees} = 14 \text{ degrees}\)

Since the air conditioner was off for 2 hours, the room will warm up by 4 degrees during this period. Therefore, the final temperature is 4 degrees higher than the starting temperature.

The room was initially 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature, but since it warmed up by 4 degrees, the final temperature is 10 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's father when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Bill's father saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Since his father was 30 years old when he saw the comet, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw it for the second time.

3. **Determine the age difference between the first and second sightings:**
   - The comet orbits the sun every 75 years, so the second sighting is 75 years after the first sighting.
   - Therefore, Bill was 90 years old 75 years after he was \(x\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.
   - This gives us the equation: \(x + 75 = 90\).

4. **Solve for \(x\):**
   - \(x = 90 - 75 = 15\).

So, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

The final numerical answer is:
15"
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to break down the information given and calculate each category of checks separately.

1. **Electric Bill**: Buford writes a check once per month for the electric bill. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes 12 electric bill checks per year.
2. **Gas Bill**: Buford writes a check once per month for the gas bill. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes 12 gas bill checks per year.
3. **Church**: Buford writes a check twice per month to the church. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes \(2 \times 12 = 24\) church checks per year.
4. **Pest and Lawn Service**: Buford writes a check quarterly (every 3 months) to the pest and lawn service. There are 4 quarters in a year, so he writes 4 pest and lawn service checks per year.

Now, we sum up all the checks:
- Electric bill checks: 12
- Gas bill checks: 12
- Church checks: 24
- Pest and lawn service checks: 4

Total number of checks per year = \(12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52\).

The final numerical answer is 52."
"Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as \( F \). According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4}F \). The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany, so the number of flights to France is \( \frac{1}{4}F \) and the number of flights to Germany is also \( \frac{1}{4}F \).

The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and this is half the number of flights the first plane makes in a day. Therefore, the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day is \( 2 \times 44 = 88 \). So, \( F = 88 \).

Now, we can calculate the number of flights to France by the first plane:
\[ \text{Flights to France} = \frac{1}{4}F = \frac{1}{4} \times 88 = 22. \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 22. \]"
"First, let's determine the duration of each wolf's howl.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so:
\[ \text{Chikote's howl duration} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Igneous howls for as long as Tobias and Chikote combined, so:
\[ \text{Igneous's howl duration} = 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, let's find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls in seconds:
\[ \text{Combined duration} = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 \text{ seconds} \]

To convert the combined duration from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):
\[ \text{Combined duration in minutes} = \frac{120}{60} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Adam's parents gave him. Adam's mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much, which is $6 * 2 = $12. So, the total amount of money given by his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Adam spent $30 on trousers. To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount given by his parents from the amount he spent on trousers.

So, the calculation is:
\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

Therefore, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the age of Wilfred. Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \(A\), \(B\), \(H\), and \(W\) respectively. We know the following:

1. The total age of the children is 20.
2. Akbar is 3 years old, so \(A = 3\).
3. Alessandro is 4 years old, so \(B = 4\).
4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.

First, we can express the total age of the children as:
\[ A + B + H + W = 20 \]

Substituting the known values of \(A\) and \(B\):
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we need to find the average age of the group. The average age is given by:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{A + B + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

According to the problem, Helene's age is twice the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now we substitute \(H = 10\) into the equation \(H + W = 13\):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Therefore, the age of Wilfred is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Walter has collected from his neighbors and the online fund:

- From neighbors: $500
- From online fund: $1500

Total collected so far: $500 + $1500 = $2000

Next, Walter's lawyer will donate three times as much as everyone else donates. To find out how much the lawyer will donate, we need to know how much everyone else has donated. Walter's friend is going to give him $200, which means everyone else has donated a total of $2000 (from neighbors and online fund) + $200 (from friend) = $2200.

The lawyer's donation will be three times the total amount donated by everyone else:

Lawyer's donation = 3 * $2200 = $6600

So, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6600."
"First, we need to determine the total number of cookies. Since there were 100 guests and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies/guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies} \]

The bride decided to give half of the cookies to the church next door. Therefore, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500 \text{ cookies}}{2} = 750 \text{ cookies} \]

Each person in the church next door received 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church next door, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people} \]

So, the number of people in the church next door is:

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the distribution of the watermelon slices among the family members. Let's denote the total volume of the watermelon as \( V \).

Given that there are 2 adults and 4 kids, and each adult's slice is twice as big as each kid's slice, we can represent the volume of each adult's slice as \( 2x \) and the volume of each kid's slice as \( x \).

The total volume of the watermelon is the sum of the volumes of all the slices:
\[ 2(2x) + 4(x) = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

Since the total volume of the watermelon is \( V \), we have:
\[ 8x = V \]

Each adult's slice is \( 2x \), so the total volume of the slices for the adults is:
\[ 2(2x) = 4x \]

To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we calculate:
\[ \frac{4x}{V} \times 100\% \]

Since \( 8x = V \), we can substitute \( V \) with \( 8x \):
\[ \frac{4x}{8x} \times 100\% = \frac{1}{2} \times 100\% = 50\% \]

Therefore, each adult gets 50% of the watermelon. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on inpatient rounds. He has 9 inpatients, and each round takes 20 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent on inpatient rounds is:
\[ 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes per inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on appointments. He has 10 appointments, and each appointment takes 30 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent on appointments is:
\[ 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes per appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's add the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments to find the total time spent on these activities:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 480 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Doctor Jones works for 9 hours at the clinic, we need to convert this time into minutes to compare it with the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments:
\[ 9 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 540 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments from the total time Doctor Jones works:
\[ 540 \text{ minutes} - 480 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we convert the remaining time from minutes to hours:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, the number of hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records is:

"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to complete all the steps and then subtract this total from the desired serving time of 5:00 pm.

1. **Time to make the cake batter:** 20 minutes
2. **Time to bake the cake:** 30 minutes
3. **Time to cool the cake:** 2 hours = 120 minutes
4. **Time to frost the cake:** 10 minutes

Now, let's add up all these times:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Convert 180 minutes into hours and minutes:

Jordan needs 3 hours to complete all the steps. If she wants the cake to be ready by 5:00 pm, we subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm:
\[ 5:00 \text{ pm} - 3 \text{ hours} = 2:00 \text{ pm} \]

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is:
\[ 2:00 \text{ pm} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider the fixed cost of renting the studio and the variable cost based on the number of students and the number of sessions per week.

1. **Fixed Cost**: The cost to rent the studio per session is $25.
2. **Variable Cost**: The cost per student per session is $1.50. With 10 students, the variable cost per session is $1.50 * 10 = $15.
3. **Total Cost per Session**: The total cost per session is the sum of the fixed cost and the variable cost, which is $25 + $15 = $40.
4. **Sessions per Week**: The studio is rented 3 days a week.
5. **Sessions per Month**: Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks, the studio is rented for 3 * 4 = 12 sessions in a month.
6. **Total Earnings per Month**: The total earnings per month are the total cost per session multiplied by the number of sessions per month, which is $40 * 12 = $480.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"To find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we first need to determine the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes.

Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars. Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes is:
\[ \text{Chocolate bars per box (Peter)} = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]

Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars. Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes is:
\[ \text{Chocolate bars per box (Martha)} = \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

Now, to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we subtract the number of chocolate bars per box for Martha from the number of chocolate bars per box for Peter:

"First, let's determine the number of female porcupines in the park. Given that the population of porcupines is 50 and the number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population, we can calculate the number of female porcupines as follows:

\[ \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the number of babies born each month is:

\[ \text{Number of babies born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120 \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[ \text{Total number of babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440 \]

The initial population of porcupines is 50. After a year, the total number of porcupines in the park will be the initial population plus the total number of babies born in a year:

\[ \text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the cost to fill the swimming pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet.
2. Multiply the volume by 5.9 to convert it to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost to fill the pool at $0.10 per gallon.

First, let's calculate the volume of the pool. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:
\[ V = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions:
- Width = 14 feet
- Length = 25 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

Substituting these values into the formula:
\[ V = 14 \times 25 \times 4 \]

Now, let's perform the multiplication:
\[ V = 14 \times 25 = 350 \]
\[ V = 350 \times 4 = 1400 \]

So, the volume of the pool is 1400 cubic feet.

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. We know that 1 cubic foot is approximately 7.48 gallons. Therefore, the volume in gallons \( V_{\text{gallons}} \) is:
\[ V_{\text{gallons}} = 1400 \times 7.48 \]

Let's calculate this:
\[ V_{\text{gallons}} = 1400 \times 7.48 = 10472 \]

Now, we need to find the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:
\[ \text{Cost} = 10472 \times 0.10 \]

Let's calculate the cost:
\[ \text{Cost} = 10472 \times 0.10 = 1047.20 \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is $1047.20.

The final numerical answer is:

Next, we need to find the number of yellow sticks. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. Since there are 14 blue sticks, the number of yellow sticks is:

\[ 14 - 3 = 11 \]

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together:

\[ 9 + 14 + 11 = 34 \]

So, the total number of sticks they have is:

\[ 34 \]"
"First, we calculate the distance Matteo traveled. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Matteo:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 55 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance Shandy traveled:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} = 45 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the distance Matteo traveled from the distance Shandy traveled:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many laps each person can run:

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) laps.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps.

Now, we need to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Laps Bethany can run} - \text{Laps Quinn can run} = 10 - 5 = 5 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days and then subtract this from the tank's total capacity.

First, let's determine the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day:

- Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity on the first day.
- The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, so Wanda pumped \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons on the first day.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda, so she pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons on the first day.

Next, let's determine the amount of water pumped on the second day:

- Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day, so she pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons on the second day.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day, so she pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons on the second day.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank over the two days:

- Total water pumped by Wanda: \( 4500 + 3000 = 7500 \) gallons.
- Total water pumped by Ms. B: \( 3375 + 1125 = 4500 \) gallons.
- Total water pumped into the tank: \( 7500 + 4500 = 12000 \) gallons.

Finally, we subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity to find out how much water is remaining:

- Remaining water: \( 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \) gallons.

The final numerical answer is 6000 gallons."
"Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as \( C \).

First, we know that the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour for 5 hours. This means that after 5 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ C \times (1 - 0.09)^5 = C \times 0.91^5 \]

Next, for the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour. So, after another 3 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ C \times 0.91^5 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = C \times 0.91^5 \times 0.93^3 \]

We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ C \times 0.91^5 \times 0.93^3 = 0.28 \times C \]

We can cancel \( C \) from both sides of the equation (assuming \( C \neq 0 \)):
\[ 0.91^5 \times 0.93^3 = 0.28 \]

Now, we need to calculate the value of \( 0.91^5 \times 0.93^3 \):
\[ 0.91^5 \approx 0.656 \]
\[ 0.93^3 \approx 0.817 \]
\[ 0.91^5 \times 0.93^3 \approx 0.656 \times 0.817 \approx 0.534 \]

Since we know that \( 0.91^5 \times 0.93^3 = 0.28 \), we can conclude that the initial charge \( C \) was:
\[ C = \frac{0.28}{0.91^5 \times 0.93^3} \approx \frac{0.28}{0.534} \approx 0.524 \]

Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately \( 0.524 \) or 52.4%.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{52.4\%} \]"
"First, let's calculate Janet's total weekly earnings. She earns $10 per hour from her job and $15 per hour from tips, so her total hourly earnings are:

\[ 10 + 15 = 25 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Since she works 40 hours a week, her weekly earnings are:

\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ dollars per week} \]

Next, we need to determine how much she needs to save to buy the car. The down payment for the car is $10,000. She wants to save 20% of this amount:

\[ 10000 \times 0.20 = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take for her to save $2000 at a rate of $1000 per week. We do this by dividing the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:

\[ \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

So, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment for the car. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased:

- Peaches: 3 peaches * $0.50/peach = $1.50
- Pears: 4 pears * $0.50/pear = $2.00
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00/kiwi = $2.00
- Apples: 5 apples * $0.75/apple = $3.75

Now, let's sum up the cost of these fruits:

Total cost of purchased fruits = $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar has $10 to spend, so the remaining amount he can spend on plums is:

Remaining amount = $10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since each plum costs $0.25, the number of plums he can buy is:

Number of plums = $0.75 / $0.25/plum = 3 plums

So, the final numerical answer is 3."
"First, we need to determine the total number of pieces of sweets Anne purchased. Since she bought a box containing 15 packs and each pack has 60 pieces, we calculate the total number of pieces as follows:

\[
15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 900 \text{ pieces}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many packs Anne gave to her friends. Since she kept 2 packs, the number of packs she gave away is:

\[
15 \text{ packs} - 2 \text{ packs} = 13 \text{ packs}
\]

These 13 packs are given to her 10 friends equally. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide the number of packs given away by the number of friends:

\[
13 \text{ packs} \div 10 \text{ friends} = 1.3 \text{ pieces per friend}
\]

Thus, each of her friends received 1.3 pieces of sweets. The final numerical answer is:

\[
1.3
\]"
"To calculate the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating compounded price increases:

\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (1 + \text{Rate})^{\text{Number of Years}} \]

Given:
- Initial Price = $120
- Rate = 5% = 0.05
- Number of Years = 3

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 139 \]

So, the price of carrots after three years would be $139."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many selfies and portraits Olivia uploaded to her albums. We know that she uploaded a total of 72 pictures into 8 albums, with 3 albums dedicated to selfies and 2 albums dedicated to portraits. This means the remaining albums are for other types of pictures.

First, let's find out how many albums are not for selfies or portraits:
\[ 8 \text{ total albums} - 3 \text{ selfies albums} - 2 \text{ portraits albums} = 3 \text{ other albums} \]

Since the 3 albums for selfies and 2 albums for portraits account for 5 albums, the remaining 3 albums must be for other types of pictures. However, the question only asks for the number of selfies and portraits, so we can ignore the other 3 albums for now.

Next, we need to determine how many pictures are in each type of album. Since the same number of pictures were put into each of the 8 albums, we can find the number of pictures per album by dividing the total number of pictures by the total number of albums:
\[ \frac{72 \text{ pictures}}{8 \text{ albums}} = 9 \text{ pictures per album} \]

Now, we can calculate the number of selfies and portraits:
- Number of selfies = Number of selfies albums \(\times\) Pictures per album
\[ 3 \text{ selfies albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures per album} = 27 \text{ selfies} \]
- Number of portraits = Number of portraits albums \(\times\) Pictures per album
\[ 2 \text{ portraits albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures per album} = 18 \text{ portraits} \]

Therefore, the total number of selfies and portraits is:
\[ 27 \text{ selfies} + 18 \text{ portraits} = 45 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 45 \]"
"To determine how long James spends reading, we first need to find out how many minutes it takes him to read one page. Since it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can calculate the time it takes to read one page by dividing 10 minutes by 3 pages:

\[ \text{Time per page} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} \approx 3.33 \text{ minutes per page} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages. We do this by multiplying the time it takes to read one page by 18:

\[ \text{Time to read 18 pages} = 18 \text{ pages} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, James spends 60 minutes reading. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 60 \]"
"To determine the current number of guests in the hotel, we need to follow the sequence of events and perform the necessary calculations step by step.

1. **Initial number of guests**: The hotel was completely booked with 100 guests.
2. **Guests who checked out early**: 24 guests checked out early.
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76
   \]
   So, after the early checkouts, there are 76 guests remaining.
3. **Guests who checked out late**: 15 guests checked out late.
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61
   \]
   So, after the late checkouts, there are 61 guests remaining.
4. **Guests who checked in in the afternoon**: Twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout.
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30
   \]
   So, 30 new guests checked in.
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91
   \]
   So, after the new guests checked in, there are 91 guests.
5. **Guests who checked in after dinner**: 7 more people checked in.
   \[
   91 + 7 = 98
   \]
   So, after the additional guests checked in, there are 98 guests.

The final number of guests in the hotel is \(\boxed{98}\)."
"To determine the total number of bananas John picks, we need to calculate the number of bananas picked each day and then sum them up.

1. On Wednesday, John picks 4 bananas.
2. On Thursday, John picks 6 bananas.
3. On Friday, John picks triple the number of bananas he picked on Wednesday. Since he picked 4 bananas on Wednesday, on Friday he picks \(3 \times 4 = 12\) bananas.

Now, we sum the bananas picked over the three days:
\[ 4 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 6 \text{ (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ (Friday)} = 22 \]

So, the total number of bananas John has is:
\[ 22 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of easy, average, and difficult questions in the quiz.

- Total number of questions: 60
- Easy questions: 40% of 60 = 0.40 * 60 = 24 questions
- Average and difficult questions combined: 60 - 24 = 36 questions
- Since the average and difficult questions are equally divided, there are 36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct. Therefore, the number of easy questions she is sure to get correct is:
\[ 75\% \text{ of } 24 = 0.75 \times 24 = 18 \]

Aries is sure to get half of the average and difficult questions correct. Therefore, the number of average and difficult questions she is sure to get correct is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \text{ of } 18 = 9 \]

Adding these together, the total number of questions Aries is sure to get correct is:
\[ 18 \text{ (easy)} + 9 \text{ (average)} + 9 \text{ (difficult)} = 36 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 36 \]"
"First, let's determine the price of a large stuffed animal. Since each small stuffed animal costs $4 and large stuffed animals cost three times as much, the price of a large stuffed animal is:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( L \). According to the problem, the number of small stuffed animals sold is twice the number of large stuffed animals sold, so the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2L \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as the sum of the earnings from the large stuffed animals and the small stuffed animals. The earnings from the large stuffed animals are \( 12L \) dollars, and the earnings from the small stuffed animals are \( 4 \times 2L = 8L \) dollars. The total earnings are given as $120, so we can set up the following equation:
\[ 12L + 8L = 120 \]
\[ 20L = 120 \]
\[ L = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

Since the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2L \), we have:
\[ 2L = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine the total number of sandwiches eaten by the family in one week, we first need to calculate the daily total and then multiply by the number of days in a week.

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, the wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and the son eats 2 sandwiches per day. Therefore, the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by the family is:
\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \text{ sandwiches per day} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of sandwiches eaten in one week is:
\[ 11 \times 7 = 77 \text{ sandwiches} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total earnings from the cookies and cupcakes.

Suzanne sold 80 cookies at $1 each, so the earnings from the cookies are:
\[ 80 \text{ cookies} \times \$1/\text{cookie} = \$80 \]

Next, she sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each, so the earnings from the cupcakes are:
\[ 60 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$4/\text{cupcake} = \$240 \]

Now, let's add the earnings from the cookies and cupcakes to find the total earnings:
\[ \$80 + \$240 = \$320 \]

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each for helping her, so the total amount given to her sisters is:
\[ 2 \times \$10 = \$20 \]

To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we subtract the amount given to her sisters from her total earnings:
\[ \$320 - \$20 = \$300 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$300 \]"
"The Smith twins found a total of 30 + 30 = 60 eggs. Since all the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends, the number of eggs found by their friends is 100 - 60 - 10 = 30 eggs. 

The final numerical answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the daily ore mining capacity of one dwarf with a steel pickaxe and then scale it up to 40 dwarves working for 30 days.

1. One dwarf with a bare hands can mine 12 pounds of ore per day.
2. One dwarf with an iron pickaxe can mine twice as much as a bare hands dwarf, which is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) pounds of ore per day.
3. One dwarf with a steel pickaxe can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. Therefore, the ore mining capacity with a steel pickaxe is \(24 + (24 \times 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36\) pounds of ore per day.

Now, we need to calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month (30 days).

The daily ore mining capacity for 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes is \(36 \times 40 = 1440\) pounds of ore per day.
The total ore mined in 30 days is \(1440 \times 30 = 43200\) pounds of ore.

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to use the information that the prices are proportional. We can set up a proportion based on the given information:

- The first package with 2 sandwiches costs $3.
- The second package with 4 sandwiches costs $6.
- The third package with 8 sandwiches costs an unknown amount, which we will call \( x \).

Since the prices are proportional, the ratio of the number of sandwiches to the cost should be the same for all packages. We can write the proportion as:

\[
\frac{2 \text{ sandwiches}}{3 \text{ dollars}} = \frac{4 \text{ sandwiches}}{6 \text{ dollars}} = \frac{8 \text{ sandwiches}}{x \text{ dollars}}
\]

We can use the first two parts of the proportion to find the cost of the third package. Notice that the second package has twice as many sandwiches as the first package and the cost is also twice as much. Therefore, the third package, which has four times as many sandwiches as the first package, should cost four times as much as the first package.

So, we can calculate the cost of the third package as follows:

\[
x = 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost \(\boxed{12}\) dollars."
"First, we need to determine the net cost of the new bedroom set after Tom sells his old one. Tom buys the new bedroom set for $3000 and sells his old one for $1000. Therefore, the net cost of the new bedroom set is:

\[ 3000 - 1000 = 2000 \]

Next, Tom has to pay 10% of this net cost per month. To find out how much he has to pay per month, we calculate 10% of $2000:

\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the amount Tom has to pay per month is:

\[ \boxed{200} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst due to the gust of wind. Sally initially had 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst.

\[ \text{Red balloons that burst} = 25 \times \frac{40}{100} = 25 \times 0.4 = 10 \]

So, the number of red balloons remaining is:

\[ \text{Remaining red balloons} = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Next, Sally accidentally released half of the yellow balloons. She initially had 12 yellow balloons.

\[ \text{Yellow balloons released} = 12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons remaining is:

\[ \text{Remaining yellow balloons} = 12 - 6 = 6 \]

Sally found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining balloons.

\[ \text{Blue balloons added} = 8 \times \frac{75}{100} = 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \]

So, the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school is the sum of the remaining red, yellow, and the added blue balloons.

\[ \text{Total balloons} = \text{Remaining red balloons} + \text{Remaining yellow balloons} + \text{Blue balloons added} \]
\[ \text{Total balloons} = 15 + 6 + 6 = 27 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider all the scenarios and their probabilities.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of the substitute teacher collecting the homework: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of having to turn in homework in this scenario: 50% or 0.50

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having the normal teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of getting an extension from the normal teacher: 40% or 0.40
   - Probability of not getting an extension from the normal teacher: 60% or 0.60
   - Probability of Marcus convincing the teacher his dog ate the assignment: 20% or 0.20
   - Probability of not convincing the teacher: 80% or 0.80

Now, let's calculate the overall probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework:

- **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
  - Probability of having to turn in homework: 50% or 0.50

- **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
  - Probability of not getting an extension: 60% or 0.60
  - Probability of having to turn in homework: 100% or 1.00 (since he doesn't get an extension and can't convince the teacher)

Now, we combine these probabilities:

- Probability of having to turn in homework in the substitute teacher scenario: 50% or 0.50
- Probability of having to turn in homework in the normal teacher scenario: 60% or 0.60 (since 60% of the time he doesn't get an extension and 40% of the time he gets an extension, but we're only considering the 60% where he doesn't get an extension)

So, the total probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework is:

\[ 0.50 + 0.60 = 1.10 \]

However, this total probability exceeds 100%, which is not possible. This indicates that we need to consider the overlap in the scenarios where he doesn't get an extension from the normal teacher and the substitute teacher. Since the scenarios are mutually exclusive (he can't have both a substitute teacher and the normal teacher at the same time), we can simply add the probabilities directly:

\[ 0.50 + 0.60 = 1.10 \]

This means the probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework is 110%, which is not possible in reality. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct approach is to consider the probability of not having to turn in the homework:

- Probability of not having to turn in homework in the substitute teacher scenario: 50% or 0.50
- Probability of not having to turn in homework in the normal teacher scenario: 40% or 0.40 (since 60% of the time he doesn't get an extension)

So, the total probability of not having to turn in his homework is:

\[ 0.50 + 0.40 = 0.90 \]

Therefore, the probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework is:

\[ 1 - 0.90 = 0.10 \]

Converting this to a percentage:

\[ 0.10 \times 100 = 10\% \]

Thus, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:

\[

"First, we need to determine the total number of seats that are not occupied by graduates and faculty. The Fine Arts Center has a capacity of 6000 seats. After accounting for the 950 seats for graduates and 300 seats for faculty, the number of available seats is:

\[ 6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750 \]

Next, we need to split these 4750 available seats equally among the 950 graduates. To find out how many tickets each graduate will receive, we divide the number of available seats by the number of graduates:

\[ \frac{4750}{950} = 5 \]

Therefore, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of soda bottles Richard will place along the driveway.
2. Determine the total time it will take to place the candy in each bottle.

First, we calculate the number of soda bottles. The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to place a bottle every 3 feet. Therefore, the number of bottles is:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we calculate the total time it will take to place the candy in each bottle. Since it takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next and place the candy, and he needs to do this 7 times (from the first bottle to the second, second to the third, and so on, until the seventh bottle to the eighth), the total time is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the Parmesan cheese:
- The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound.
- Mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound.
- Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese.
- The cost for the Parmesan cheese is \( 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$11/\text{pound} = \$22 \).

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mozzarella cheese:
- Mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound.
- Mozzarella cheese is 3 pounds.
- The cost for the mozzarella cheese is \( 3 \text{ pounds} \times \$6/\text{pound} = \$18 \).

Now, let's find the total cost of the cheese Amor bought:
- Total cost = Cost of Parmesan cheese + Cost of mozzarella cheese
- Total cost = \$22 + \$18 = \$40.

Amor started with $50. To find out how much money she has left after buying the cheese, we subtract the total cost from her initial amount:

"First, let's calculate the total amount Jim borrowed during his college years. Since it took him 4 years to finish college and he got $50,000 in loans per year, the total amount of loans he took out is:

\[ 4 \text{ years} \times \$50,000 \text{ per year} = \$200,000 \]

Next, let's determine his income after graduating from college. His income tripled, so his new income is:

\[ \$50,000 \times 3 = \$150,000 \]

Now, let's calculate the income he would have earned if he had not gone to college. His original income was $25,000 per year, so the income he missed out on over the 4 years is:

\[ 4 \text{ years} \times \$25,000 \text{ per year} = \$100,000 \]

The total amount of money Jim would need to earn to cover both the loan repayment and the income he missed out on is the sum of the loan amount and the income he missed out on:

\[ \$200,000 + \$100,000 = \$300,000 \]

Now, we need to determine how long it would take for Jim to earn $300,000 at his new income of $150,000 per year. We can calculate this by dividing the total amount by his new annual income:

\[ \frac{\$300,000}{\$150,000 \text{ per year}} = 2 \text{ years} \]

So, it would take Jim 2 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the income he lost while in school. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total square feet of fabric Jim needs to buy, we first need to calculate the dimensions of each piece of fabric he requires. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each piece of fabric is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

First, calculate the dimensions of one piece of fabric:
- Length: \( 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \)
- Width: \( 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \)

Next, calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
\[ \text{Area of one piece} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[ \text{Total area} = 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then sum them up.

First, we know the number of letters delivered on Monday:
\[ \text{Monday} = 425 \]

Next, we calculate the number of letters delivered on Tuesday. According to the problem, Tuesday's delivery is 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery:
\[ \text{Tuesday} = \frac{1}{5} \times 425 + 17 \]
\[ \text{Tuesday} = 85 + 17 = 102 \]

Then, we calculate the number of letters delivered on Wednesday. The problem states that Wednesday's delivery is 5 more than twice Tuesday's delivery:
\[ \text{Wednesday} = 2 \times 102 + 5 \]
\[ \text{Wednesday} = 204 + 5 = 209 \]

Now, we sum the deliveries from Monday to Wednesday:
\[ \text{Total} = \text{Monday} + \text{Tuesday} + \text{Wednesday} \]
\[ \text{Total} = 425 + 102 + 209 \]
\[ \text{Total} = 736 \]

The total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is:

"To find out how much Johnny's dad lost on average that day, we need to calculate the total amount lost and then divide it by the number of races.

1. **First Race:**
   Johnny's dad lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   Johnny's dad won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. Since he lost $5 in the first race, twice that amount is $10, and $1 more than that is $11. Therefore, he won $11 in the second race.

3. **Third Race:**
   Johnny's dad lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. Since he won $11 in the second race, 1.5 times that amount is $16.50. Therefore, he lost $16.50 in the third race.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost:
- First race: $5
- Second race: $0 (he won)
- Third race: $16.50

Total amount lost = $5 + $0 + $16.50 = $21.50

To find the average amount lost per race, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races:
\[ \text{Average loss per race} = \frac{\$21.50}{3} = \$7.16666667 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the average loss per race is $7.17.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{7.17} \]"
"To find the total number of people in South America, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country and then by the number of people living in each city.

Given:
- Number of countries in South America = 26
- Number of cities in each country = 5
- Number of people living in each city = 1000

The total population can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Total Population} = \text{Number of Countries} \times \text{Number of Cities per Country} \times \text{Number of People per City} \]

"First, we need to convert all measurements to the same unit for easier comparison. Let's use inches.

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, Xavier's height in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Xavier grew 3 inches, so his current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole's initial height was 50 inches. Cole grew 2 inches, so his current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier’s height now is:

"Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( 420 \).

"To determine the number of hours each painter worked, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of days the painters worked:**
   - There are 3 weeks of work.
   - Each week has 7 days.
   - Therefore, the total number of days is \(3 \times 7 = 21\) days.

2. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by the team:**
   - Each day, the team worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day.
   - Therefore, the total number of hours worked by the team is \( 21 \times \frac{3}{8} \).

3. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by the team:**
   \[
   21 \times \frac{3}{8} = \frac{21 \times 3}{8} = \frac{63}{8} = 7.875 \text{ hours}

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, Rory retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x + 4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now that we know \( x = 6 \), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

So, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation year by year from 2007 to 2010.

The formula for depreciation is:
\[ P = P_0 \times (1 - r)^t \]
where:
- \( P \) is the price of the car after \( t \) years,
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price of the car,
- \( r \) is the annual depreciation rate,
- \( t \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 20000 \) dollars,
- \( r = 0.21 \),
- \( t = 2010 - 2007 = 3 \) years.

Now, we substitute the values into the formula:
\[ P = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ P = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]

Calculating \( (0.79)^3 \):
\[ (0.79)^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.491009 \]

Now, we multiply this by the initial price:
\[ P = 20000 \times 0.491009 = 9820.18 \]

Rounding to the nearest dollar, the price of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \boxed{9820} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of English books. Since half of the 50 books are written in English, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of English books} = \frac{50}{2} = 25
\]

Next, we calculate the number of German books. Since 10% of the books are written in German, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of German books} = 10\% \times 50 = 0.10 \times 50 = 5
\]

Now, to find the number of Spanish books, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:

\[
\text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - (\text{Number of English books} + \text{Number of German books}) = 50 - (25 + 5) = 50 - 30 = 20
\]

So, the number of Spanish books is 20. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much James pays for insurance a year after his accident, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the increased monthly cost due to the accident.
2. Determine the annual cost based on the increased monthly cost.

First, let's calculate the increased monthly cost:
- The normal monthly cost is $120.
- The increase is 60% of the normal cost.

\[ \text{Increase} = 120 \times \frac{60}{100} = 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the increased monthly cost is:
\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Next, we calculate the annual cost:
- The increased monthly cost is $192.
- There are 12 months in a year.

\[ \text{Annual cost} = 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, the amount James pays a year is:

"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time for the meal is the sum of the times for both parts, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Next, we isolate \( D \) by subtracting 18 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Then, we solve for \( D \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's part as follows:

\[ Betsy's \ part = D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes. The final numerical answer is:

   Each set of 2 pounds of butter costs the price of 1 pound of butter. Since the price of butter is $4.00 per pound:
   \[
   \text{Cost per set} = 1 \text{ pound} \times \$4.00/\text{pound} = \$4.00
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost for 3 sets:**
   Multiply the cost per set by the number of sets:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 3 \text{ sets} \times \$4.00/\text{set} = \$12.00
   \]

Therefore, the total cost Dennis will incur to purchase 6 pounds of butter under the promotion is:
\[
\boxed{12}

"First, let's calculate the total number of guests Kayla invited:

- Kayla's classmates: 25
- Girls in her dance class: 7
- Family members: 13
- Total guests invited: 25 + 7 + 13 = 45

Next, we need to account for the 4 people who could not come:

- Total guests who will attend: 45 - 4 = 41

Now, we need to calculate the cost. The base fee for renting the theater is $125, and there is an additional fee of $6 for each additional guest beyond the initial 20 guests.

- Additional guests beyond the initial 20: 41 - 20 = 21
- Additional cost: 21 * $6 = $126

Finally, we add the base fee to the additional cost to get the total cost:

- Total cost: $125 + $126 = $251

The final numerical answer is $251."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Maggie had $60 initially.
2. Riza also had $60 initially.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money:
\[ \text{Amount spent by Maggie} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \]
So, the amount of money Maggie has left is:
\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \]

Riza spent one-third of her money:
\[ \text{Amount spent by Riza} = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \]
So, the amount of money Riza has left is:
\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \]

Now, we add the remaining amounts of money that Maggie and Riza have:
\[ 45 + 40 = 85 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money that Maggie and Riza have left is:
\[ \boxed{85} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats:
\[ 10 + 4 = 14 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Together, the first and second monkeys eat:
\[ 10 + 14 = 24 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. Therefore, the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day is:
\[ \frac{315}{7} = 45 \text{ bananas each day} \]

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we subtract the number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day:
\[ 45 - 24 = 21 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Thus, the third monkey eats:
\[ \boxed{21} \text{ bananas each day} \]"
"Teddy finished half of the first 500-piece puzzle, which means Teddy placed 500 / 2 = 250 pieces of the first puzzle. Teddy also finished the second 500-piece puzzle, which means Teddy placed 500 pieces of the second puzzle. Therefore, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is 250 + 500 = 750 pieces. 

The final numerical answer is 750."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the roses Jenny bought. She bought 15 roses, and since roses cost $2 each, the cost for the roses is:
\[ 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of the dozen roses. Since a dozen roses cost $15, and she bought 15 roses, she bought 1.25 dozen roses (since 15 roses is 1.25 dozen). However, since the florist only sells roses by the dozen, she would need to buy 2 dozen roses to get 15 roses. The cost for 2 dozen roses is:
\[ 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which totals:
\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the cost of the roses is $30, she does not have enough money to buy 15 roses. Therefore, she cannot buy the roses with the money she has, and the question about the change in quarters is not applicable in this scenario.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total money Terry makes from selling milkshakes:
\[ 6 \text{ milkshakes} \times \$5.50 \text{ per milkshake} = 6 \times 5.50 = \$33.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the total money Terry makes from selling burger platters:
\[ 9 \text{ burger platters} \times \$11 \text{ per burger platter} = 9 \times 11 = \$99.00 \]

Then, let's calculate the total money Terry makes from selling sodas:
\[ 20 \text{ sodas} \times \$1.50 \text{ per soda} = 20 \times 1.50 = \$30.00 \]

Now, let's add up all the money Terry makes from selling milkshakes, burger platters, and sodas:
\[ \$33.00 + \$99.00 + \$30.00 = \$162.00 \]

So, the total amount of money Terry makes is:

"To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the arrival and departure times of each train and then find out when Paul's train arrives.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays in the station for 20 minutes.
   - Departure time: 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves (30 minutes after 30 minutes = 60 minutes).
   - Stays in the station for a quarter of the first train's stay time (20 minutes / 4 = 5 minutes).
   - Departure time: 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives 60 minutes after the second train leaves (65 minutes).
   - Leaves immediately after it arrives, so it stays in the station for 0 minutes.
   - Departure time: 65 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves (65 minutes + 20 minutes = 85 minutes).
   - Stays in the station for the same amount of time as the first train (20 minutes).
   - Departure time: 85 + 20 = 105 minutes.

Paul's train is the fourth train, which arrives at 85 minutes. Since Paul arrives at the station at 0 minutes, he will wait for 85 minutes.

The final numerical answer is:
85"
"First, let's calculate how many toothpicks Melanie has already saved. She saves 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks:

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie needs a total of 200 toothpicks. She has already saved 120 toothpicks, so she still needs:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks, we divide the number of toothpicks she still needs by the number of toothpicks she saves each week:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 8 \]"
"First, let's determine the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. The original price of the watch is $2000, and he bought it at 75% of its original price.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers bought the watch for} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price. The original price was $2000, and the friend bought it for $1800.

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

To find the percentage discount:

\[ \text{Percentage discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is 10%.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs over a period of 4 hours. Given that each spring creates one jellyfish per second, we can break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.

1. **Determine the number of jellyfish created by one spring in one hour:**
   - There are 60 seconds in one minute and 60 minutes in one hour.
   - Therefore, there are \(60 \times 60 = 3600\) seconds in one hour.
   - Since one spring creates one jellyfish per second, in one hour, one spring will create \(3600\) jellyfish.

2. **Determine the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - Since one spring creates 3600 jellyfish in one hour, in 4 hours, one spring will create \(3600 \times 4 = 14400\) jellyfish.

3. **Determine the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates 14400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create \(14400 \times 5 = 72000\) jellyfish in 4 hours.

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs working at the same rate in 4 hours is 72000.

\[

"To find Frankie's score, we can use the information given in the question. According to the problem, Frankie's score is 15 more than twice Binkie's score. Binkie's score is given as 90.

First, we calculate twice Binkie's score:
\[ 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Next, we add 15 to this result to find Frankie's score:
\[ 180 + 15 = 195 \]

So, Frankie's score is 195.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 195 \]"
"First, let's determine the total distance James walked. He walked halfway to the store, which is 2 miles, and then walked back home, which is another 2 miles. Therefore, the total distance he walked is:

\[ 2 \text{ miles} + 2 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour. To find out how long it took him to walk 4 miles, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, the total time it took James to reach the store is 1 hour."
"First, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually.

Jenny buys 10 bunches of bananas, and each bunch has an average of 4 bananas. Therefore, the total number of bananas she buys is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Since each banana costs $0.80, the total cost if she bought the bananas individually would be:
\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches.

Jenny buys 10 bunches, and each bunch costs $3.00. Therefore, the total cost if she bought the bananas in bunches is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

Now, to find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we subtract the total cost of buying in bunches from the total cost of buying individually:
\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

So, Jenny saved:
\[ \boxed{2} \text{ dollars} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) and the amount of fence Harry gets as \( H \). According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so we can write:

\[ H = S + 60 \]

Since the total amount of fence is 100 feet, we also have:

\[ S + H = 100 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Subtract 60 from both sides:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"To determine how many inches a crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to find the growth rate per year. The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, so the growth rate per year is:

\[
\text{Growth rate per year} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year}
\]

Now, to find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we multiply the growth rate per year by 13:

\[
\text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of each type of bike sold.
2. Calculate the total earnings from each type of bike.
3. Sum the earnings from all types of bikes.

First, let's find out how many of each type of bike were sold:

- Total bikes sold = 300
- Number of Trekking bikes sold = 50% of 300 = \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \)
- Number of BMX bikes sold = 15% of 300 = \( 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \)
- Number of MTB bikes sold = Total bikes sold - Trekking bikes sold - BMX bikes sold = \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 65 \)

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike:

- Price of one MTB = $500
- Price of one BMX = Half the price of an MTB = \( \frac{500}{2} = 250 \)
- Price of one Trekking bike = $450

Now, we calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:

- Earnings from MTB bikes = Number of MTB bikes sold \(\times\) Price of one MTB = \( 65 \times 500 = 32500 \)
- Earnings from BMX bikes = Number of BMX bikes sold \(\times\) Price of one BMX = \( 45 \times 250 = 11250 \)
- Earnings from Trekking bikes = Number of Trekking bikes sold \(\times\) Price of one Trekking bike = \( 150 \times 450 = 67500 \)

Finally, we sum the earnings from all types of bikes to find the total earnings:

- Total earnings = Earnings from MTB bikes + Earnings from BMX bikes + Earnings from Trekking bikes = \( 32500 + 11250 + 67500 = 111250 \)

So, Marcel earned $111,250 from selling bicycles during that month.

The final numerical answer is:
111250"
"To determine how many bales of hay are left in the field after a 6-hour workday, we need to calculate the number of bales made and the number of bales picked up by the truck over that period.

First, let's calculate the number of bales made by the farmer in 6 hours:
- The farmer makes 5 bales per hour.
- Over 6 hours, the farmer makes \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \) bales.

Next, let's calculate the number of bales picked up by the truck in 6 hours:
- The truck picks up 3 bales per hour.
- Over 6 hours, the truck picks up \( 3 \times 6 = 18 \) bales.

Now, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer to find the number of bales left in the field:
- Bales left = Bales made - Bales picked up
- Bales left = \( 30 - 18 = 12 \)

Therefore, the number of bales of hay left in the field is 12."
"To determine how many hours a week John spends learning, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of periods John has to attend each day:**
   - A normal student has 6 periods.
   - John has 2 extra classes, so he has \(6 + 2 = 8\) periods each day.

2. **Calculate the total time spent in class each day:**
   - Each class is 40 minutes long.
   - John has 8 periods each day, so he spends \(8 \times 40 = 320\) minutes in class each day.

3. **Calculate the total time spent in class each week:**
   - John goes to class 5 days a week, so he spends \(320 \times 5 = 1600\) minutes in class each week.

4. **Calculate the extra learning time John spends on Saturday and Sunday:**
   - John spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday.
   - The total weekly minutes are 1600, so the extra learning time is \(\frac{1600}{16} = 100\) minutes.

5. **Calculate the total time spent learning each week:**
   - The total time spent learning each week is the sum of the time spent in class and the extra learning time.
   - This is \(1600 + 100 = 1700\) minutes.

6. **Convert the total time spent learning from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so the total time spent learning in hours is \(\frac{1700}{60} = \frac{1700 \div 20}{60 \div 20} = \frac{85}{3} \approx 28.33\) hours.

Therefore, the total number of hours John spends learning each week is \(\frac{85}{3}\) or approximately 28.33 hours.

\[
\boxed{\frac{85}{3}}

"First, we need to determine the initial height from which Nathan drops the ball. Since the ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony and each story is 24 feet high, the height from which the ball is dropped is:

\[ 3 \text{ stories} \times 24 \text{ feet/story} = 72 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how high the ball bounces on its first bounce. The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height. Therefore, the height after the first bounce is:

\[ 72 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we need to find out how high the ball bounces on its second bounce. The ball again bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its height after the first bounce. Therefore, the height after the second bounce is:

\[ 48 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height the ball goes on its second bounce is:

\[ 32 \text{ feet} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 32 \]"
"First, let's convert all heights to inches for easier calculation. The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child is:

\[ 6 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 72 \text{ inches} \]

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so:

\[ 72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches} \]

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so:

\[ 74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches} \]

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so:

\[ 69 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height of the fourth child is 72 inches."
"To determine the earnings from selling 2000 apples at a rate of $5 per bag, we first need to find out how many bags were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can calculate the number of bags sold as follows:

\[ \text{Number of bags sold} = \frac{\text{Total number of apples sold}}{\text{Number of apples per bag}} = \frac{2000}{10} = 200 \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags sold by the price per bag:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of bags sold} \times \text{Price per bag} = 200 \times 5 = 1000 \]

So, the orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of the meat, so it left \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms. This means that \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms were left after the velociraptors.
3. The lazy Allosaurus then ate the remaining 270 kilograms, which is \( \frac{x}{4} \).

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 4:
\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

Therefore, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 kilograms.

The final numerical answer is:
1080"
"First, we need to calculate the total area of the walls that Tony needs to paint. The room has four walls: two north-south walls and two east-west walls.

The area of the north and south walls is:
\[ 2 \times (10 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The area of the east and west walls is:
\[ 2 \times (5 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 40 \text{ square feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Adding these areas together gives the total area to be painted:
\[ 160 \text{ square feet} + 80 \text{ square feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ square feet}}{20 \text{ square feet per gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost of the paint. Since each gallon costs $12, the total cost is:
\[ 12 \text{ gallons} \times 12 \text{ dollars per gallon} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the probabilities step by step.

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Ellen starts with 12 sodas.
   - She shakes 3 sodas, leaving 9 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.
   - Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 8 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.
   - Ellen's brother takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 7 unshaken sodas and 2 shaken sodas.

2. **Remaining Sodas:**
   - 7 unshaken sodas.
   - 2 shaken sodas.

3. **Probability Calculation:**
   - Ellen's friend will get a shaken soda if they are given one of the 2 remaining shaken sodas.
   - The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left.
   - Total sodas left = 7 (unshaken) + 2 (shaken) = 9 sodas.
   - Probability = \(\frac{2}{9}\).

4. **Convert to Percentage:**
   - To convert the probability to a percentage, multiply by 100.
   - \(\frac{2}{9} \times 100 \approx 22.22\%\).

Therefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is approximately \(22.22\%\)."

"To determine how many people Billy helps with their taxes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.
2. Determine the number of days Billy works.
3. Calculate the total number of hours Billy works.
4. Determine the total number of people he helps.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.**

- March has 31 days.
- April 19th is included in the count.

Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days

"To determine how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes to slide down each slide and then find the difference.

For the biggest slide:
- Length: 300 feet
- Speed: 60 feet/minute

Time to slide down the biggest slide:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Length}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

For the second biggest slide:
- Length: 240 feet
- Speed: 80 feet/minute

Time to slide down the second biggest slide:

"To determine the total number of hours Bobby spends on his lunches and breaks over 5 days, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, calculate the total time spent on breaks and lunch per day:
- Lunch time per day: 30 minutes
- Break time per day: 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes

Total time per day = Lunch time + Break time
Total time per day = 30 minutes + 30 minutes = 60 minutes

Next, calculate the total time spent over 5 days:
Total time over 5 days = Total time per day * Number of days
Total time over 5 days = 60 minutes/day * 5 days = 300 minutes

Finally, convert the total time from minutes to hours:
Total time in hours = Total time in minutes / 60
Total time in hours = 300 minutes / 60 = 5 hours

So, the total number of hours Bobby spends on his lunches and breaks after 5 days is 5 hours."
"First, let's determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate the distance Micah ran as follows:

\[ \text{Distance Micah ran} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know the total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles. We can find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

\[ \text{Distance Ahito ran} = 52 - (8 + 28) = 52 - 36 = 16 \text{ miles} \]

So, Ahito ran 16 miles. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 16 \]"
"First, let's calculate the initial charge and the return:

Initial charge: $85.00
Returned item: $15.00

After the return, the charge on the credit card is:
\[ 85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the items she bought after the discounts:

1. Frying pan on sale for 20% off $20.00:
\[ 20.00 \times (1 - 0.20) = 20.00 \times 0.80 = 16.00 \]

2. Set of towels on sale for 10% off $30.00:
\[ 30.00 \times (1 - 0.10) = 30.00 \times 0.90 = 27.00 \]

Now, let's add the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels to the remaining balance on the credit card:

\[ 70.00 + 16.00 + 27.00 = 113.00 \]

So, the new balance on her credit card is:

"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem:
- A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{J}{5} \).
- A third of the large jellyfish change color under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{J}{5} = \frac{J}{15} \).
- When the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color. Therefore, \( \frac{J}{15} = 6 \).

We can solve for \( J \) as follows:
\[ \frac{J}{15} = 6 \]
\[ J = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ J = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we start by noting that 40% of the school population consists of 240 boys. Let's denote the total number of students in the school as \( T \).

Given that 40% of \( T \) is equal to 240 boys, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.40 \times T = 240 \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 600 \]

So, the total number of students in the school is 600. Now, to find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = T - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 600 - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days in June.
2. Determine the total number of miles Soledad plans to hike in June.
3. Calculate the number of miles Soledad plans to hike per day.
4. Determine the difference between the planned miles per day and the required miles per day.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days in June.**
June has 30 days.

**Step 2: Determine the total number of miles Soledad plans to hike in June.**
Soledad plans to hike 9,300 miles in June.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of miles Soledad plans to hike per day.**
To find the number of miles Soledad plans to hike per day, we divide the total miles by the number of days:
\[ \text{Miles per day planned} = \frac{9,300 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 310 \text{ miles/day} \]

**Step 4: Determine the difference between the planned miles per day and the required miles per day.**
Soledad is thinking of walking twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. Therefore, the number of miles she plans to hike per day is:
\[ \text{Miles per day planned} = 125 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

Now, we find the difference between the planned miles per day and the required miles per day:
\[ \text{Additional miles per day needed} = 310 \text{ miles/day} - 250 \text{ miles/day} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

Soledad must hike 60 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

Initially, Tate has:
- 4 male guppies
- 7 female guppies
- 3 male goldfishes
- 5 female goldfishes

After buying more fish, Tate has:
- 4 (initial male guppies) + 2 (additional male guppies) = 6 male guppies
- 7 (initial female guppies) + 1 (additional female guppy) = 8 female guppies
- 3 (initial male goldfishes) + 2 (additional male goldfishes) = 5 male goldfishes
- 5 (initial female goldfishes) + 3 (additional female goldfishes) = 8 female goldfishes

Now, let's calculate the total number of male and female fishes:
- Total male fishes = 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfishes) = 11 male fishes
- Total female fishes = 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfishes) = 16 female fishes

Finally, to find out how many more female fishes than male fishes Tate has, we subtract the total number of male fishes from the total number of female fishes:

"To determine how many miles Brian will walk in seven days, we start by understanding the relationship between the distances walked by Sofie and Brian.

Given:
- Sofie walks 10 miles every day.
- In 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian will in 7 days.

First, calculate the total distance Sofie will walk in 7 days:
\[ \text{Sofie's total distance} = 10 \, \text{miles/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 70 \, \text{miles} \]

According to the problem, this distance is twice the distance Brian will walk in 7 days:
\[ \text{Sofie's total distance} = 2 \times \text{Brian's total distance} \]

Let \( B \) represent the total distance Brian will walk in 7 days. Then:
\[ 70 \, \text{miles} = 2B \]

To find \( B \), solve for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{70 \, \text{miles}}{2} = 35 \, \text{miles} \]

"To determine how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers and then find out how many toys the fifth worker needs to produce to meet the order requirements.

First, let's calculate the production rate of the first two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 6 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(6 \times 2 = 12\) toys per hour.

Next, let's calculate the production rate of the next two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 4 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(4 \times 2 = 8\) toys per hour.

Now, let's find the total production rate of the first four workers:
- The first two workers together produce 12 toys per hour.
- The next two workers together produce 8 toys per hour.
- Therefore, the total production rate of the first four workers is \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

The total number of toys produced by the first four workers in a 10-hour shift is:
- \(20 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 200 \text{ toys}\).

The toy manufacturer received an order for 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, they still need 20 toys to ship the order. This means that the number of toys produced by the first four workers is:
- \(400 - 20 = 380 \text{ toys}\).

Since the first four workers produced 200 toys in the 10-hour shift, the fifth worker must have produced:
- \(380 - 200 = 180 \text{ toys}\).

To find out how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours in the shift:
- \(180 \text{ toys} \div 10 \text{ hours} = 18 \text{ toys/hour}\).

Thus, the fifth worker produces \(\boxed{18}\) toys per hour."

"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline as \( A \) (since they painted the same number). Therefore, the total number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline is \( 2A \).

Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah. Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Sarah as \( S \). Then, the number of eggs painted by Camden is \( S + 12 \). Therefore, we can write the equation for the total eggs painted by Camden and Sarah as:
\[ S + (S + 12) = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]
So, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

Now, we know the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total number of eggs painted by Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah as:
\[ 2A + 9 + 21 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]
So, Arnold and Madeline each painted 13 eggs.

Now, we need to find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold. Since Camden painted 21 eggs and Arnold painted 13 eggs, the difference is:
\[ 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons. This can be calculated as:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200}{8} = 25 \]

Each group of 8 crayons will be placed in a box, and each box weighs 8 ounces. Since there are 25 groups, there will be 25 boxes, each weighing 8 ounces. The total weight of the boxes is:

\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \times 8 = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, and Nik has 200 crayons, so the total weight of the crayons is:

\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \times 1 = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together gives:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the total weight in pounds is:

\[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

Now, we need to determine how many planks John can get from these 16 logs. Since he cuts 5 planks from each log:

\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

Finally, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling these planks. Since each plank is sold for $1.2:

\[ 80 \text{ planks} \times 1.2 \text{ dollars/plank} = 96 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 96 \]"
"First, let's determine how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns half of what her brother earns, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Valerie's salary} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

Given that Valerie earns $5000 per month, we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[ 5000 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

To find the brother's salary, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ \text{Brother's salary} = 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Now, we know Valerie's brother earns $10000 per month. Next, we need to find out how much their mother earns. The problem states that their mother earns twice their combined salary. First, we calculate their combined salary:

\[ \text{Combined salary} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} = 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Their mother earns twice this combined salary:

\[ \text{Mother's salary} = 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \]

Finally, to find the total amount of money they all have together, we add up their individual salaries:

\[ \text{Total amount} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} + \text{Mother's salary} = 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

So, the total amount of money they all have together is $45000.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 45000 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time spent by Grandma on the beach and on the sidewalk, and then calculate the total time for the entire 3-mile walk.

First, let's denote the speed of Grandma on the beach as \( v \) miles per minute. Therefore, the speed on the sidewalk is \( 2v \) miles per minute.

Given that Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes, we can calculate her speed on the beach:
\[ v = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Next, we calculate the time spent on the sidewalk. Since the distance on the sidewalk is 1 mile and her speed on the sidewalk is \( 2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \) miles per minute, the time spent on the sidewalk is:
\[ \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we know the total time spent on the beach is 40 minutes and the time spent on the sidewalk is 10 minutes. Therefore, the total time for the entire 3-mile walk is:
\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's determine how much Jane has saved so far. She has saved $4 each week for 8 weeks, so:

\[ 4 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 8 \, \text{weeks} = 32 \, \text{dollars} \]

Jane's goal is to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she has already saved from her goal:

\[ 60 \, \text{dollars} - 32 \, \text{dollars} = 28 \, \text{dollars} \]

Jane saves $4 each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28, we divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings:

\[ \frac{28 \, \text{dollars}}{4 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 7 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 7 \]"

\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

Finally, there is 1 tree with 3 blue birds, so:

\[ 1 \times 3 = 3 \]

Now, we add up all the blue birds from each tree:

\[ 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 \]

Therefore, the total number of blue birds in the trees is:

\[ 32 \]"
"First, let's determine how many marbles Bob currently has. We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen is equal to 24 marbles, we can set up the following equation to find out how many marbles Bob currently has:

\[ \text{Current number of marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

Subtracting 24 from both sides of the equation gives:

\[ \text{Current number of marbles} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles. Now, if Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, the number of marbles he will have is:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 26 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the second mug of water such that after Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle, the resulting mixture can be drunk.

Let's denote the temperature of the second mug of water as \( T \) degrees.

First, we calculate the temperature of the water left in the 33-degree mug after pouring out 4 ounces. Since the temperature of the water is uniform throughout the mug, the temperature of the remaining water in the mug will still be 33 degrees.

Next, we calculate the temperature of the water left in the second mug after pouring out 1 ounce. The temperature of the remaining water in the second mug will still be \( T \) degrees.

Now, we need to find the average temperature of the water in the water bottle after Donny pours the water. The total volume of water in the water bottle is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug).

The temperature of the water in the water bottle will be the weighted average of the temperatures of the water from the two mugs. The formula for the weighted average temperature is:

\[
\text{Average Temperature} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5}
\]

For Donny to be able to drink the water, the average temperature must be at least 40 degrees. Therefore, we set up the inequality:

\[
\frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40
\]

Simplify the left side of the inequality:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the fraction:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( T \):

\[
T \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the second mug of water is 68 degrees.

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{68}

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of animals added to the farm over the course of three weeks and then add this to the initial number of animals.

First, let's determine the number of days in three weeks:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cows added by Milkie Cows Limited over these 21 days:
\[ 20 \text{ cows/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 420 \text{ cows} \]

Then, we calculate the number of chickens added by Broilers Limited over these 21 days:
\[ 10 \text{ chickens/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ chickens} \]

Now, we add the initial number of animals to the number of animals added:
\[ \text{Initial cows} + \text{Cows added} = 50 \text{ cows} + 420 \text{ cows} = 470 \text{ cows} \]
\[ \text{Initial chickens} + \text{Chickens added} = 20 \text{ chickens} + 210 \text{ chickens} = 230 \text{ chickens} \]

Finally, we add the total number of cows and chickens to get the total number of animals on the farm:
\[ 470 \text{ cows} + 230 \text{ chickens} = 700 \text{ animals} \]

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is:
\[ \boxed{700} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount:

Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs cost:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Since Russell is ordering 4 packs, he will receive a 10% discount on the total cost. The discount amount is:
\[ 40 \times 0.10 = 4 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell is getting in total. Since each pack contains 9 bagels and he is ordering 4 packs, the total number of bagels is:
\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \]

To find the cost per bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels:
\[ \frac{36}{36} = 1 \]

So, the cost per bagel is $1.00. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1 \]"
"First, let's determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. According to the question, Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, we calculate:

\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 1 less than 3 is 2 scoops, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. The question states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, 1 less than 3 scoops is 2 scoops, and 3 less than 6 potatoes is 3 potatoes. Therefore, 2 scoops of mashed potatoes require 3 potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes are required for 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 2 scoops require 3 potatoes, 18 scoops would require:

\[ \frac{18}{2} \times 3 = 9 \times 3 = 27 \]

So, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 27 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days. He eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days:

\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggs he eats in the next 30 days. He increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day for 30 days:

\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, let's find the total number of eggs he eats in 60 days:

\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

To find out how many dozens of eggs this is, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs):

\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozen} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we first need to determine the number of red jellybeans and then subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans.

\[ \text{Number of red jellybeans} = 2 \times 17 = 34 \]

Next, calculate the total number of green and red jellybeans:
\[ \text{Total number of green and red jellybeans} = 17 + 34 = 51 \]

Finally, subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans to find the number of blue jellybeans:
\[ \text{Number of blue jellybeans} = 60 - 51 = 9 \]

The number of blue jellybeans is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To determine the total number of lemons Tim collects in a decade, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of lemons collected from one tree in a decade.
2. Multiply the number of lemons from one tree by the number of trees Tim grows.

First, since each tree yields 6 lemons per year, in a decade (which is 10 years), each tree will yield:
\[ 6 \text{ lemons/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 60 \text{ lemons} \]

Next, since Tim grows 5 trees, the total number of lemons collected from all 5 trees in a decade is:
\[ 60 \text{ lemons/tree} \times 5 \text{ trees} = 300 \text{ lemons} \]

Therefore, the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the initial number of men and women on the bus based on the given ratio and total number of passengers. The ratio of men to women is 5:9, and the total number of passengers is 84.

First, let's denote the number of men as \(5x\) and the number of women as \(9x\). According to the ratio, the total number of passengers is the sum of men and women:
\[5x + 9x = 84\]
\[14x = 84\]
\[x = 6\]

Now, we can find the initial number of men and women:
- Number of men = \(5x = 5 \times 6 = 30\)
- Number of women = \(9x = 9 \times 6 = 54\)

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:

"To determine how many sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to first calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day and then multiply by 3.

From the information given:
- Each bouquet of sunflowers costs $8 and contains 12 sunflowers.
- Faraday earned $56 from selling bouquets per day.

First, we calculate the number of bouquets sold per day:
\[ \text{Number of bouquets sold per day} = \frac{\text{Earnings from bouquets per day}}{\text{Cost of one bouquet}} = \frac{56}{8} = 7 \text{ bouquets per day} \]

Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold per day is:
\[ \text{Number of sunflowers sold per day} = \text{Number of bouquets sold per day} \times 12 = 7 \times 12 = 84 \text{ sunflowers per day} \]

Now, to find the total number of sunflowers sold over 3 days:
\[ \text{Total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days} = \text{Number of sunflowers sold per day} \times 3 = 84 \times 3 = 252 \]

So, the total number of sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 3 days is:
\[ 252 \]"
"First, let's determine how many rocks Adam can buy with his $100. Each rock costs $5, so:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that both tickets are winners.

First, let's denote the probability of winning with the first ticket as \( P(W_1) \). According to the problem, \( P(W_1) = 0.20 \).

The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning with the second ticket, \( P(W_2) \), is:
\[ P(W_2) = 3 \times P(W_1) = 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60 \]

Since the events are independent (the outcome of one ticket does not affect the outcome of the other), the probability that both tickets are winners is the product of their individual probabilities:
\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = P(W_1) \times P(W_2) = 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

"To determine how many more bottles of juice Hortex needs to produce to meet the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total daily energy demand for 2300 people.
2. Determine how many bottles are needed to meet this demand.
3. Subtract the current daily production from the required production to find out how many more bottles are needed.

First, we calculate the total daily energy demand for 2300 people. Since each juice can cover 20% of a person's daily energy demand, we need to find out how many bottles are required to cover 100% of the energy demand for 2300 people.

\[ \text{Total bottles needed} = \frac{2300 \text{ people} \times 100\%}{20\%} = \frac{2300}{0.2} = 11500 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we know that the company currently produces 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles are needed, we subtract the current production from the required production:

\[ \text{Additional bottles needed} = 11500 - 4200 = 7300 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of babies dressed in purple and blue, and then calculate the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple.

First, let's find out how many babies are dressed in purple and how many are dressed in blue:
- Total babies = 8
- Babies dressed in purple = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- Babies dressed in blue = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we need to find out how many babies wear bows:
- Babies wearing bows among the blue-wearers = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 2 = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.6667 \) (rounding to the nearest whole number, 1 baby)
- Babies wearing bows among the purple-wearers = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is \( 1 + 2 = 3 \).

Now, we need to find the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. This is given by the number of purple-wearers wearing bows divided by the total number of babies wearing bows:
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of purple-wearers wearing bows}}{\text{Total number of babies wearing bows}} = \frac{2}{3} \]

To convert this probability to a percentage:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 100 \approx 66.67\% \]

Therefore, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is approximately \( 66.67\% \).

The final numerical answer is:

   \text{Area sold} = \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ square meters}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Price per square meter} = \frac{50}{40} = 1.25 \text{ dollars per square meter}
   \]

2. After a month, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30:
   \[
   \text{Area sold} = \frac{80}{4} = 20 \text{ square meters}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Price per square meter} = \frac{30}{20} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per square meter}
   \]

3. The remaining land was sold for $3 per square meter:
   \[
   \text{Remaining area} = 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ square meters}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Price per square meter} = 3 \text{ dollars per square meter}
   \]

Now, let's calculate the total money earned from each sale:

1. From the first sale:
   \[
   \text{Total money} = 40 \text{ square meters} \times 1.25 \text{ dollars per square meter} = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. From the second sale:
   \[
   \text{Total money} = 20 \text{ square meters} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars per square meter} = 30 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. From the remaining land:
   \[
   \text{Total money} = 20 \text{ square meters} \times 3 \text{ dollars per square meter} = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Finally, sum up all the money earned from the sales:
\[
\text{Total money} = 50 + 30 + 60 = 140 \text{ dollars}
\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{140}

"To find Geb's age, we first need to calculate half of Haley's age and then subtract 10 from that value.

Haley's age = 26 years

Half of Haley's age = 26 / 2 = 13 years

Geb is 10 less than half of Haley's age, so:

Geb's age = 13 - 10 = 3 years

The final numerical answer is 3."
"To determine how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of face masks used per outing:**
   - Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out.
   - Therefore, for each outing, he uses 2 face masks.

2. **Determine the number of face masks used per day:**
   - Tyrion goes out three times a day.
   - For each outing, he uses 2 face masks.
   - Therefore, for each day, he uses \(3 \text{ outings/day} \times 2 \text{ masks/outing} = 6 \text{ masks/day}\).

3. **Determine the number of face masks used in 2 days:**
   - For 2 days, he uses \(2 \text{ days} \times 6 \text{ masks/day} = 12 \text{ masks}\).

Thus, the total number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days is 12."
"First, let's determine the total number of eggs Cole hid in the yard. Since a dozen is equal to 12, 3 dozen eggs is calculated as follows:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we'll calculate the number of eggs each person found:
- Lamar found 5 eggs.
- Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ eggs} \]
- Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so:
\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ eggs} \]
- Mei found half as many as Charlie, so:
\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we'll sum the number of eggs found by Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei:
\[ 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 \text{ eggs} \]

Finally, to find out how many eggs are still hidden in the yard, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden:
\[ 36 - 27 = 9 \text{ eggs} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 9 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of apartments in the first two complexes:
- Each of the first two complexes has 200 apartments.
- Therefore, the total number of apartments in the first two complexes is \(200 + 200 = 400\) apartments.

Next, we calculate the number of apartments in the third complex, which is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two complexes:
- The combined total of the first two complexes is 400 apartments.
- 60% of 400 apartments is \(0.60 \times 400 = 240\) apartments.
- Therefore, the third complex has \(400 + 240 = 640\) apartments.

Now, we calculate the total number of apartments across all three complexes:
- The total number of apartments is \(400 + 640 = 1040\) apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each complex. Therefore, the total number of collections per week is:
- \(1040 \text{ apartments} \times 3 \text{ collections per week} = 3120 \text{ collections per week}\).

John gets paid $0.40 per collection. Therefore, his weekly earnings are:
- \(3120 \text{ collections per week} \times \$0.40 \text{ per collection} = \$1248\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{1248}

"To calculate the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we need to determine the number of fruits produced each year and then sum them up.

1. **5-year-old tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old tree**: Produces \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
3. **7-year-old tree**: Produces \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
4. **8-year-old tree**: Produces \(10 \times 50 - 200 = 500 - 200 = 300\) fruits.
5. **9-year-old tree**: Produces 0 fruits.
6. **10-year-old tree**: Produces \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, we sum the fruits produced each year:

\[ 50 + 150 + 350 + 300 + 0 + 1000 = 1850 \]

The total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is \(\boxed{1850}\)."

"Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters, the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters, and the red rope as \( R \) centimeters.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we substitute \( B \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ R = 4(Y - 7) \]

Next, we substitute \( B \) and \( R \) into the third equation:
\[ 4(Y - 7) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]

Add 35 to both sides:
\[ 6Y = 72 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now, we can find \( B \) and \( R \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \]
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

The length of the red rope is \( 20 \) centimeters.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine how much money Rissa and Ronnie were given initially:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = $15\).

2. **Let \(x\) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister.**
   - After giving \(x\) dollars to their sister, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original amount.
   - Therefore, \(15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15\).

3. **Solve for \(x\):**
   \[
   15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
   \]
   \[
   15 - x = 12
   \]
   \[
   x = 15 - 12
   \]
   \[
   x = 3
   \]

4. **Determine how much money Rissa has left:**
   - Rissa originally had $15 and gave $3 to her sister.
   - Therefore, Rissa is left with \(15 - 3 = 12\) dollars.

5. **Determine how much money Ronnie has left:**
   - Ronnie originally had $5 and did not give any money to his sister.
   - Therefore, Ronnie is left with $5.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Paint Used**: The mural uses 12 pints of paint in total.

2. **Distribution of Paint**:
   - Let the amount of red paint be \( R \) pints.
   - Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, the amount of white paint is also \( R \) pints, and the amount of purple paint is also \( R \) pints.
   - The amount of yellow paint is half the mural, so it is \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) pints.

3. **Equation for Total Paint**:
   - The total amount of paint is the sum of the red, white, purple, and yellow paint.
   - Therefore, \( R + R + R + 6 = 12 \).

4. **Solve for \( R \)**:
   - Combine like terms: \( 3R + 6 = 12 \).
   - Subtract 6 from both sides: \( 3R = 6 \).
   - Divide by 3: \( R = 2 \).

So, the number of pints of red paint used is \( 2 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. The area of one bedroom is given by the product of its length and width:

\[ \text{Area of one bedroom} = 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

\[ \text{Total area of bedrooms} = 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so the area of the living room is:

\[ \text{Area of living room} = 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

\[ \text{Total area of the house} = 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

So, the total area of the house is:

"To find out how many puffs of clouds Alice counts from Monday to Friday, we need to calculate the number of puffs for each day and then sum them up.

- **Monday**: Alice counts 3 puffs.
- **Tuesday**: She counts double the number of clouds from Monday, which is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs.
- **Wednesday**: She counts double the number of clouds from Tuesday, which is \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs.
- **Thursday**: She counts double the number of clouds from Wednesday, which is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs.
- **Friday**: She counts double the number of clouds from Thursday, which is \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs.

Now, we sum the puffs from each day:
\[ 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 \]

Let's add these numbers step by step:
\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]
\[ 9 + 12 = 21 \]
\[ 21 + 24 = 45 \]
\[ 45 + 48 = 93 \]

So, at the end of the week, Alice will have counted a total of 93 puffs of clouds.

"First, let's determine the number of pods in the special size box. The special size box has 20% more pods than the regular box, which has 100 pods.

20% of 100 pods is calculated as:
\[ 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ pods} \]

So, the special size box has:
\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The cost of the special size box is the same as the regular box, which is $12. We need to find out how many dishwashing cycles can be run with $1 if 1 pod is used per cycle.

The cost per pod is:
\[ \frac{12}{100} = 0.12 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

With $1, the number of pods that can be bought is:
\[ \frac{1}{0.12} = \frac{100}{12} = \frac{25}{3} \approx 8.33 \]

Since you can only run a whole number of cycles with a whole number of pods, you can run 8 cycles with $1.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"First, we determine the number of 20 dollar bills Thomas initially withdraws from the bank. Since he withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills}
\]

Next, Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home. Therefore, the number of bills he has left is:

\[
50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills}
\]

Thomas then uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. The number of bills he uses is:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

So, the number of bills he has left is:

\[
40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

Thomas then triples his money. Since each bill is worth $20, the total amount of money he has is:

\[
20 \times 20 \times 3 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, Thomas converts all his money to 5 dollar bills. The number of 5 dollar bills he has is:

\[
\frac{1200}{5} = 240 \text{ bills}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
240

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Half Goals:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half Goals:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals in the second half.
   - Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, so Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals in the second half.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Team A's total goals: \(4 \text{ (first half)} + 2 \text{ (second half)} = 6\).
   - Team B's total goals: \(2 \text{ (first half)} + 8 \text{ (second half)} = 10\).

4. **Total Goals Scored in the Match:**
   - The total number of goals scored in the match is the sum of the goals scored by Team A and Team B, which is \(6 + 10 = 16\).

The final numerical answer is 16."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chalk the teacher has left and then calculate how many days he can continue using only 20% of the chalk each day before he has to recycle it.

1. **Initial Chalk Length**: The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
2. **Chalk Used on Monday**: The teacher used 45% of the chalk by the end of Monday. So, the chalk used on Monday is:
   \[
   5 \times 0.45 = 2.25 \text{ inches}

"First, let's determine how many face masks Mike bought. According to the problem, Mike bought 5 face masks.

Next, we need to calculate how many face masks Johnny bought. The problem states that Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike. We can express this mathematically as:

\[ \text{Number of masks Johnny bought} = 3 \times (\text{Number of masks Mike bought}) + 2 \]

Substituting the number of masks Mike bought (which is 5) into the equation:

\[ \text{Number of masks Johnny bought} = 3 \times 5 + 2 \]

Now, perform the multiplication and addition:

\[ \text{Number of masks Johnny bought} = 15 + 2 = 17 \]

So, Johnny bought 17 face masks. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 17 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of teeth that the dentist fixes. According to the problem, the dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills. Since he drills 4 teeth, the number of teeth capped is:

\[ 4 + 7 = 11 \]

So, the total number of teeth fixed by the dentist is the sum of the teeth drilled and the teeth capped:

\[ 4 + 11 = 15 \]

Now, we need to find what percentage of James' teeth (which is 30) are fixed. The percentage can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 50 \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the milk that Mr. Marcellus initially purchased. The company sold 4000 gallons of milk at $3.5 per gallon. Therefore, the total cost is:

\[ 4000 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = \$14000 \]

Next, we need to determine how much of this milk had passed the expiry date. Mr. Marcellus returned 2/5 of the milk. So, the amount of milk that was returned is:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \text{ gallons} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

Since the company sold the milk at $3.5 per gallon, the refund amount for the returned milk is:

\[ 1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = \$5600 \]

Therefore, the amount Mr. Marcellus got in refunds is:

\[ \boxed{5600} \]"
"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, we substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5(C + 7)) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5(C + 7)}{3} \]
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old. To verify, we can substitute \( C = 20 \) back into the equations to find \( W \):
\[ W = 5(C + 7) = 5(20 + 7) = 5 \times 27 = 135 \]
\[ C + 25 = 20 + 25 = 45 \]
\[ \frac{1}{3}W = \frac{1}{3} \times 135 = 45 \]

Both equations are satisfied, confirming that Colin is currently 20 years old. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, we need to determine how much money Bob spends on books in total. We know that he spends $27,000 in total.

Next, we need to find out how many books Bob can buy with $27,000. We know that he can buy 100 books for $500. To find out how many books he can buy with $27,000, we can set up the following proportion:

\[ \text{Number of books} = \frac{\text{Total money}}{\text{Money for 100 books}} \times 100 \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ \text{Number of books} = \frac{27000}{500} \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Number of books} = 54 \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Number of books} = 5400 \]

Now, Bob has $27,000 to buy books and can buy 5400 books in total. Since he has three schools, we need to divide the total number of books by 3 to find out how many books he can buy per school:

\[ \text{Books per school} = \frac{5400}{3} \]

\[ \text{Books per school} = 1800 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 1800 books per school."

"First, we need to calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed by Kate's 6 friends. Each friend eats 6 slices of cheese pizza, so the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed is:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed by Kate's 6 friends. Each friend eats 4 slices of pepperoni pizza, so the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed is:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we need to determine how many whole cheese pizzas Kate needs to buy. Since each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, the number of cheese pizzas needed is:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Similarly, we need to determine how many whole pepperoni pizzas Kate needs to buy. Since each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, the number of pepperoni pizzas needed is:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 + 3 = 6 \]

So, the total number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To calculate the total miles Sam ran this week, we need to add up the miles he ran on each day.

- On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day. So for these three days, he ran \(3 \times 3 = 9\) miles.
- On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. So for these two days, he ran \(5 \times 2 = 10\) miles.

Adding these together, the total miles Sam ran this week is \(9 + 10 = 19\) miles.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many snowballs Jay can effectively build over time, accounting for the snowballs that melt.

Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour. Since 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, we need to calculate the net number of snowballs he can build in 15 minutes.

In 15 minutes:
- Snowballs built: 20 / 60 * 15 = 5 snowballs
- Snowballs melted: 2

So, the net number of snowballs built in 15 minutes is:
5 - 2 = 3 snowballs

Now, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are required to reach 60 snowballs.

Let's calculate the number of 15-minute intervals needed:
60 snowballs / 3 snowballs per 15 minutes = 20 intervals

Since each interval is 15 minutes, the total time required is:
20 intervals * 15 minutes per interval = 300 minutes

To convert 300 minutes into hours:
300 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

The final numerical answer is 5."
"If John is currently 28 years old and he is twice as old as Jim when the Digimon series came out, we can determine Jim's age at that time by dividing John's age by 2. 

So, Jim's age at that time was \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \) years old.

Since the question asks for Jim's current age, and no information is given about the passage of time since the series came out, we can assume Jim is also 14 years old now.

The final numerical answer is 14."
"First, let's determine how many slices each person ate:

- Doxa ate 1 slice.
- Her sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, so her sister ate \(1 + 1 = 2\) slices.
- Her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister, so her brother ate \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices.

Now, let's add up the slices eaten by Doxa, her sister, and her brother:

- Doxa: 1 slice
- Sister: 2 slices
- Brother: 3 slices

Total slices eaten = \(1 + 2 + 3 = 6\)

"Let's break down the problem day by day to find out how many bandages were used and how many were left at the end of each day.

**First Day:**
- They used 38 bandages.
- They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
- Total bandages at the end of the first day: \(38 - 38 + 50 = 50\).

**Second Day:**
- They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
- Total bandages at the end of the second day: \(50 - 28 = 22\).

**Third Day:**
- They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered \(2 \times 50 = 100\) bandages.
- They used half a pack, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.
- Total bandages at the end of the third day: \(22 - 25 + 100 = 97\).

According to the problem, they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means there was a discrepancy in the calculation. Let's recheck the bandages used and ordered on the third day:

- They ordered 100 bandages and used 25, so they should have \(100 - 25 = 75\) bandages left.
- Since they ended up with 78 bandages, it means they must have had 78 bandages at the start of the third day.

Now, let's calculate the initial number of bandages they had on the first day. We know they had 78 bandages at the end of the third day, and we can work backwards:

- At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages.
- Before using 25 bandages on the third day, they had \(78 + 25 = 103\) bandages.
- Before ordering 100 bandages on the third day, they had \(103 - 100 = 3\) bandages.
- Before using 28 bandages on the second day, they had \(3 + 28 = 31\) bandages.
- Before using 38 bandages on the first day, they had \(31 + 38 = 69\) bandages.

So, they started with 69 bandages on the first day.

The final numerical answer is:
69"
"First, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut. May's hair length decreased from 10 inches to 8 inches, which means she had a haircut of 10 - 8 = 2 inches. The cost for the haircut is $30 per inch, so the cost for the haircut is 2 * $30 = $60.

Next, we add the cost of the hair color, which is $40.

Therefore, the total cost for the haircut and color is $60 (haircut) + $40 (color) = $100.

The final numerical answer is 100."
"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to consider her regular pay and the additional attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her regular pay:
- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- She works 6 days a week.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

So, her daily pay is \(7.5 \times 1.5 = 11.25\) dollars.
Her weekly pay is \(11.25 \times 6 = 67.5\) dollars.

Since there are exactly 4 weeks in April, her total pay for April is \(67.5 \times 4 = 270\) dollars.

Additionally, since she had complete attendance for the month, she receives an extra $10 for each week, which amounts to \(10 \times 4 = 40\) dollars.

Therefore, her total earnings for April are \(270 + 40 = 310\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
310"
"To calculate how much money Jason earned, we need to multiply the number of times he performed each task by the amount of money he earns for each task, and then sum these amounts.

Here are the calculations:

- For doing laundry: Jason did laundry once, and he earns $3.00 for each laundry task. So, $3.00 * 1 = $3.00.
- For cleaning his room: Jason cleaned his room once, and he earns $1.50 for each cleaning task. So, $1.50 * 1 = $1.50.
- For taking the trash out: Jason took the trash out twice, and he earns $0.75 for each trash-out task. So, $0.75 * 2 = $1.50.
- For emptying the dishwasher: Jason emptied the dishwasher 6 times, and he earns $0.50 for each dishwasher task. So, $0.50 * 6 = $3.00.

Now, we sum these amounts to find the total earnings:

$3.00 (from laundry) + $1.50 (from cleaning room) + $1.50 (from taking trash) + $3.00 (from emptying dishwasher) = $9.00.

So, Jason earned a total of $9.00 in the two-week period."
"First, we need to determine the amount of blood in one shark. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and each whale has 40 gallons of blood, we can calculate the blood volume in one shark as follows:

\[ \text{Blood volume in one shark} = 3 \times 40 \text{ gallons} = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have together. Since each shark has 120 gallons of blood, ten sharks will have:

\[ \text{Total blood volume for ten sharks} = 10 \times 120 \text{ gallons} = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:

\[ 1200 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day, we need to add up all the groups of people who entered.

1. In the morning, 50 people entered.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people.

Now, we sum these numbers to find the total number of people who entered the restaurant:

\[
50 \text{ (morning)} + 40 \text{ (10:00)} + 80 \text{ (twice 10:00)} + 150 \text{ (evening)} = 320

So, the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day is 320."
"Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, which means she bought 5 * 5 = 25 red pens. She bought twice the amount of black pens, so she bought 2 * 5 = 10 packs of black pens. This means she bought 10 * 5 = 50 black pens. Therefore, the total number of pens Alain has is 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens.

The final numerical answer is 75."
"First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600. Therefore, the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[
\text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to find the cost per bottle of cognac. The problem states that the cognac costs 50% more per bottle than the scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[
\text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 \times 1.5 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as he does of scotch. Since he buys 10 bottles of scotch, he buys:

\[
2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac}
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the cognac:

\[
\text{Total cost of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we add the total cost of the scotch and the total cost of the cognac to find the total amount John spends:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars}

"To determine the total number of trees Mr. Julius planted over the two days, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted on the first day:
- Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
- He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which means he planted \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

So, the total number of trees planted on the first day is:
\[20 \text{ (White Oak)} + 40 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 60 \text{ trees}\]

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted on the second day:
- Mr. Julius planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day, which means he planted \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
- He planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day. The number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the first day was 40, so \(\frac{1}{4}\) more than 40 is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10\). Therefore, he planted \(40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

So, the total number of trees planted on the second day is:
\[30 \text{ (White Oak)} + 50 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 80 \text{ trees}\]

Finally, the total number of trees planted over the two days is:
\[60 \text{ (first day)} + 80 \text{ (second day)} = 140 \text{ trees}\]

Thus, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is \(\boxed{140}\)."

To find \( x \), we first subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8 \]
\[ 4x = 32 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ \frac{4x}{4} = \frac{32}{4} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is \( 8 \).

"First, let's determine the number of fish with red stripes. Since one-third of the fish have red stripes, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of fish with red stripes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

Next, we need to find out how many fish are left after accounting for the fish with red stripes. This is:

\[
\text{Remaining fish} = 66 - 22 = 44

Now, we need to find out how many of these remaining fish have blue stripes. Since 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of fish with blue stripes} = \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
\]

Finally, to find the total number of fish that have either red or blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes:

\[
\text{Total number of fish with red or blue stripes} = 22 + 20 = 42

"First, let's calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had:

- Two eyeshadow palettes, each with four colors: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors
- Three makeup sets, each with six colors: \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors

So, the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had is:
\[8 + 18 = 26\]

Next, her sister steals one of the palettes, which means Amy loses 4 colors:
\[26 - 4 = 22\]

Then, Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since each makeup set has 6 colors, half of 6 colors is:
\[6 / 2 = 3\]

So, Amy uses up 3 colors from the makeup set, which means she loses 3 colors:
\[22 - 3 = 19\]

Therefore, the number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is:

"First, let's determine Mattison's height in inches:
\[ \text{Mattison's height} = 60 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we calculate the height of Mattison's two-story house:
\[ \text{Height of the house} = 7 \times \text{Mattison's height} = 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we determine the height of the floor to the ceiling on the first floor:
\[ \text{Height of the first floor} = 3 \times \text{Mattison's height} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

To find the height of the second floor, we subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the house:
\[ \text{Height of the second floor} = \text{Height of the house} - \text{Height of the first floor} = 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height of the roof from the floor of the second floor is the height of the second floor:
\[ \text{Height of the roof from the floor of the second floor} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate how many shells team Alphas found. They found 40% of the 700 shells.

\[ \text{Shells found by Alphas} = 0.40 \times 700 = 280 \]

Next, we need to find out how many shells are left after team Alphas have found their share.

\[ \text{Remaining shells} = 700 - 280 = 420 \]

Team The finders then found 60% of the remaining shells.

\[ \text{Shells found by The finders} = 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \]

Finally, to find out how many shells team Gogetters found, we subtract the shells found by Alphas and The finders from the total number of shells.

\[ \text{Shells found by Gogetters} = 700 - 280 - 252 = 168 \]

So, the number of shells that team Gogetters found is 168."
"Let's denote the number of miles the last dog needs to walk as \( x \).

The total number of miles the four dogs need to walk per day is the sum of the miles each dog needs:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 + x \]

According to the problem, the average number of miles the dogs need to walk per day is 3 miles. Since there are 4 dogs, the total number of miles they need to walk per day is:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \]

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 + x = 12 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ 8 + x = 12 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 12 - 8 \]
\[ x = 4 \]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine Trinity's profit, we first need to calculate the selling price of the magazines and then subtract the cost price from it.

Trinity bought the magazines at $72 each. She sells them at 11/8 of the price she bought them. So, the selling price (SP) can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{SP} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8} \]

Let's calculate the selling price:

\[ \text{SP} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8} = 9 \times 11 = 99 \]

The selling price of each magazine is $99. The cost price (CP) of each magazine is $72. The profit (P) is calculated as:

\[ \text{P} = \text{SP} - \text{CP} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{P} = 99 - 72 = 27 \]

So, Trinity's profit is $27 per magazine. If we are to provide the final numerical answer, it is:

\[ 27 \]"
"To find the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed per day for each setting and then multiply by the number of days it was used at that setting.

1. **Low setting:**
   - Removes 1 liter of water per day.
   - Brian used it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed at low setting: \(1 \, \text{liter/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3 \, \text{liters}\).

2. **Medium setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the low setting.
   - Therefore, it removes \(2 \times 1 = 2\) liters of water per day.
   - Brian used it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed at medium setting: \(2 \, \text{liters/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 6 \, \text{liters}\).

3. **High setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting.
   - Therefore, it removes \(2 \times 2 = 4\) liters of water per day.
   - Brian used it for 5 days.
   - Total water removed at high setting: \(4 \, \text{liters/day} \times 5 \, \text{days} = 20 \, \text{liters}\).

Now, we sum up the total water removed from all settings:
\[3 \, \text{liters} + 6 \, \text{liters} + 20 \, \text{liters} = 29 \, \text{liters}\]

The total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in his basement is \(\boxed{29}\) liters."

"First, we need to determine the capacity of Ali's class. According to the information provided, Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students.

Next, we need to find out the capacity of John's classes. Since each of John's classes has \( \frac{1}{8} \) the capacity of Ali's class, we calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:
\[
\text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{120}{8} = 15 \text{ students}
\]

John has two classes, so the total capacity of John's school is:
\[
\text{Total capacity of John's school} = 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ students}
\]

Now, we add the capacities of both schools to find the combined capacity:
\[
\text{Combined capacity} = \text{Capacity of Ali's school} + \text{Total capacity of John's school} = 120 + 30 = 150
\]

The combined capacity of both schools is:
\[

"First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen will owe his sister, including the 2% interest.

The interest is 2% of $300:
\[ \text{Interest} = 300 \times \frac{2}{100} = 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen will owe is:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, we calculate how much Stephen will pay over the 11 months. He will pay $25 per month for 11 months:
\[ \text{Total Payment for 11 Months} = 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

The remaining amount, which will be paid in the twelfth month, is the total amount minus the amount paid over the 11 months:
\[ \text{Remaining Amount} = 306 - 275 = 31 \]

Therefore, the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is:
\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"To determine how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of diaper changes per day for both children.
2. Determine how many diaper changes Jordan's wife handles.
3. Subtract the number of diaper changes handled by Jordan's wife from the total number of diaper changes to find out how many Jordan changes.

First, the total number of diaper changes per day for both children is:
\[ 2 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ diaper changes per child} = 10 \text{ diaper changes per day} \]

Next, since Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ diaper changes}}{2} = 5 \text{ diaper changes per day} \]

Therefore, the number of diaper changes Jordan makes per day is:
\[ 10 \text{ diaper changes per day} - 5 \text{ diaper changes per day} = 5 \text{ diaper changes per day} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, so the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is given as 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find the value of \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, we calculate the length of the longer piece as follows:

\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

"To find Sally's mean score, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Sum all the scores**: Add up all the scores Sally received.
2. **Count the number of scores**: Determine how many scores there are.
3. **Calculate the mean**: Divide the sum of the scores by the number of scores.

Let's start with the first step:

The scores are: 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, and 60.

Sum of the scores:
\[ 50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 \]

Adding these step-by-step:
\[ 50 + 80 = 130 \]
\[ 130 + 80 = 210 \]
\[ 210 + 60 = 270 \]
\[ 270 + 40 = 310 \]
\[ 310 + 90 = 400 \]
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \]
\[ 500 + 70 = 570 \]
\[ 570 + 60 = 630 \]

So, the sum of the scores is 630.

Next, we count the number of scores. There are 9 scores in total.

Now, we calculate the mean by dividing the sum of the scores by the number of scores:
\[ \text{Mean} = \frac{\text{Sum of the scores}}{\text{Number of scores}} = \frac{630}{9} \]

Perform the division:

"To find the percentage of the distance Michael has covered, we first need to calculate the total distance he travels in 3 days.

Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr. There are 24 hours in a day, so in 3 days, the total number of hours is:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 72 \text{ hours} \]

The total distance Michael travels in 72 hours at 50 km/hr is:
\[ 50 \text{ km/hr} \times 72 \text{ hours} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

The distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. To find the percentage of the total distance that Michael has covered, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{\text{Distance covered}}{\text{Total distance}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 0.6 \times 100 = 60\% \]

"First, let's determine the number of grapes used by Madeline. She ate 6 grapes.

Next, we calculate the number of grapes used by her brother to make the grape juice. Her brother used up 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so:
\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ grapes} \]

Now, we find the total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother:
\[ 6 + 30 = 36 \text{ grapes} \]

Their mother then used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. Each pie recipe calls for 12 grapes, so the total number of grapes used for the pies is:
\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ grapes} \]

Since the total number of grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and their mother is the sum of the grapes they used, we can set up the following equation to find the initial number of grapes:

Next, we calculate the yearly cost by multiplying the weekly cost by the number of weeks in a year (52 weeks):
\[ 10.00 \times 52 = 520.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year is:
\[ \boxed{520.00} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms. Since it takes 15 minutes per classroom, the total time required is:

\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert the total time into hours because the workday is given in hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 1200 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

The custodian works 8 hours per day. To find out how many days it will take to complete the cleaning, we divide the total hours required by the hours worked per day:

\[ 20 \text{ hours} \div 8 \text{ hours/day} = 2.5 \text{ days} \]

Since the custodian has 5 days to complete the cleaning, they will have 2.5 days to clean all the classrooms, which is within the given timeframe.

Now, to find out what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning classrooms, we need to calculate the total time spent cleaning per day and then find the percentage of that time relative to the 8-hour workday.

Since the total time required is 20 hours and they have 5 days to complete it, the average time spent cleaning per day is:

\[ 20 \text{ hours} \div 5 \text{ days} = 4 \text{ hours/day} \]

To find the percentage of the day spent cleaning, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent cleaning per day}}{\text{Total hours in a workday}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{4 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning classrooms is:

\[ 50\% \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 50 \]"
"First, let's determine the capacity of each shelf:

- Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase:

\[
10 \text{ (middle shelf 1)} + 10 \text{ (middle shelf 2)} + 20 \text{ (bottom shelf)} + 15 \text{ (top shelf)} = 55 \text{ books}
\]

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:

\[
\frac{110 \text{ books}}{55 \text{ books per bookcase}} = 2 \text{ bookcases}
\]

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books. The final numerical answer is:

\[
2

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought. Since she bought five dozens of eggs and each dozen costs $2.40, the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 5 \times \$2.40 = \$12.00 \]

Next, let's determine the total number of eggs Rose bought. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:

\[ \text{Total number of eggs} = 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we need to calculate how much Rose will earn by selling the eggs. She sells the eggs at a rate of $1 for every 3 eggs. Therefore, the total earnings can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \frac{60 \text{ eggs}}{3 \text{ eggs per dollar}} = \$20.00 \]

Finally, to find Rose's profit, we subtract the total cost from the total earnings:

\[ \text{Profit} = \$20.00 - \$12.00 = \$8.00 \]

So, Rose's profit is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine the number of white hats Skyler has, we can follow these steps:

1. **Total Hats**: Skyler has 100 hats in total.

2. **Red Hats**: Half of the hats are red.
   \[
   \text{Number of red hats} = \frac{100}{2} = 50
   \]

3. **Remaining Hats After Red Hats**: After removing the red hats, we have:
   \[
   100 - 50 = 50 \text{ hats remaining}
   \]

4. **Blue Hats**: 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue.
   \[
   \text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]

5. **White Hats**: The rest of the hats are white. We subtract the number of red and blue hats from the total remaining hats.
   \[
   \text{Number of white hats} = 50 - 30 = 20
   \]

Thus, the number of white hats Skyler has is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"First, let's determine the cost of the beef jerky when it is $3.00 off. The original price of the bag is $18.00, so the discounted price is:

\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many sticks of beef jerky are in the bag. Since each bag contains 30 sticks, we can calculate the cost per stick by dividing the discounted price by the number of sticks:

\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

The cost per stick is $0.50, which is equivalent to 50 cents. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \text{50 cents} \]"
"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to calculate how many questions she answered correctly on the first test.

The first test has 70 questions, and she gets 60% of them correct:
\[ 70 \times 0.60 = 42 \]
So, Audrey got 42 questions correct on the first test.

To pass 6th grade, she needs to correctly answer 70% of the total questions. The total number of questions across both tests is:
\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]
So, she needs to correctly answer:
\[ 110 \times 0.70 = 77 \]
questions in total to pass.

Since she already got 42 questions correct on the first test, the number of questions she needs to get correct on the second test is:
\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions correct on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 35 \]"
"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \). According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. \( B = 5S - 4 \)
2. The total number of ice cubes is \( S + B = 116 \)

We can substitute the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:

\[ S = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes \( S \), we can find the number of blueberry cubes \( B \) using the first equation:

\[ B = 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is \( 96 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 96 \]"
"To calculate the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of games Ara has played in four years.
2. Calculate the total points scored by multiplying the number of games by her average score per game.

First, Ara has been playing 40 games every year for 4 years:
\[ 40 \text{ games/year} \times 4 \text{ years} = 160 \text{ games} \]

"To determine how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we can break down the problem into the steps based on the given averages.

1. **Cars Sold from Phone Calls:**
   - For every 25 telephone calls, Jason gets 1 customer to come to the dealership.
   - To find out how many customers he needs to get to sell 15 cars, we use the ratio:
     \[
     \text{Customers needed} = \frac{15 \text{ cars}}{1 \text{ customer per 25 calls}} = 15 \times 25 = 375 \text{ customers}
     \]

2. **Customers to Dealership:**
   - For every 2 customers, 1 customer buys a car.
   - To find out how many customers he needs to get to the dealership to have 375 customers buy cars, we use the ratio:
     \[
     \text{Customers to dealership} = \frac{375 \text{ customers}}{2 \text{ customers per car}} = 187.5 \text{ customers}
     \]
   - Since the number of customers must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 188 customers.

3. **Telephone Calls to Dealership Customers:**
   - For every 2 customers, 1 customer comes to the dealership.
   - To find out how many telephone calls are needed to get 188 customers to the dealership, we use the ratio:
     \[
     \text{Telephone calls needed} = \frac{188 \text{ customers}}{2 \text{ customers per call}} = 94 \text{ calls}
     \]

Therefore, Jason needs to make 94 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of flashlights. There are 4 people in the house, so there are 4 flashlights for them to carry. Additionally, there are 2 flashlights per room. Since there are 8 rooms, the total number of flashlights is:

\[ 4 \text{ (for the people)} + 2 \times 8 \text{ (for the rooms)} = 4 + 16 = 20 \text{ flashlights} \]

Next, let's determine the number of candles. There are 8 rooms, and half of them (4 rooms) have small candles and the other half (4 rooms) have medium candles. Each small candle is used in one room, and each medium candle is used in one room. Therefore, the total number of candles is:

\[ 4 \text{ (small candles)} + 4 \text{ (medium candles)} = 8 \text{ candles} \]

Now, we add the number of flashlights and candles to find the total number of candles and flashlights used:

Therefore, the total number of items Dominick saw is \( 20 \) (helmets) + \( 10 \) (robots) + \( 40 \) (footballs) = \( 70 \) items.

The final numerical answer is 70."
"First, we need to determine how many hours Tim spends dealing with calls in a single day. Since he spends 6 hours each day at work and it takes him 15 minutes to deal with each call, we need to convert the hours into minutes to make the calculation easier. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 360 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calls he can handle in one day. Since it takes him 15 minutes to handle one call, we divide the total minutes he works in a day by the time it takes to handle one call:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ minutes/day}}{15 \text{ minutes/call}} = 24 \text{ calls/day} \]

Now, to find out how many calls he deals with during a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of calls he handles in one day by the number of days in the week:

\[ 24 \text{ calls/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 120 \text{ calls/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much longer it will take for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish, we need to calculate the drying time for both scenarios and then find the difference.

For the old varnish:
- It takes 7 minutes for one painting to dry.
- For 6 paintings, the total drying time is \(7 \text{ minutes/painting} \times 6 \text{ paintings} = 42 \text{ minutes}\).

For the new varnish:
- It takes 12 minutes for one painting to dry.
- For 6 paintings, the total drying time is \(12 \text{ minutes/painting} \times 6 \text{ paintings} = 72 \text{ minutes}\).

Now, we find the difference in drying times:
- The difference is \(72 \text{ minutes} - 42 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}\).

So, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry as it would with the old varnish.

"To find the total number of popped kernels, we will break down the problem into the different time intervals and calculate the number of kernels that pop in each interval.

1. **First 30 seconds:**
   - 20 kernels pop.

2. **Next 30 seconds:**
   - The rate triples the initial rate.
   - Initial rate = 20 kernels / 30 seconds = \(\frac{20}{30} = \frac{2}{3}\) kernels per second.
   - Rate in the next 30 seconds = \(3 \times \frac{2}{3} = 2\) kernels per second.
   - Number of kernels that pop = \(2 \times 30 = 60\).

3. **Next 30 seconds:**
   - The rate quadruples the initial rate.
   - Initial rate = \(\frac{2}{3}\) kernels per second.
   - Rate in the next 30 seconds = \(4 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{3}\) kernels per second.
   - Number of kernels that pop = \(\frac{8}{3} \times 30 = 80\).

4. **Final 30 seconds:**
   - The rate halves the previous rate.
   - Rate in the final 30 seconds = \(\frac{8}{3} \div 2 = \frac{8}{3} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{4}{3}\) kernels per second.
   - Number of kernels that pop = \(\frac{4}{3} \times 30 = 40\).

5. **Residual heat:**
   - A quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds pop from residual heat.

"To determine how many lemons Tim will need, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. **Calculate the total amount of lemon juice needed:**
   - Tim needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade, and each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice.
   - Therefore, he needs \(4 \text{ gallons} \times 1 \text{ cup/gallon} = 4 \text{ cups of lemon juice}\).

2. **Calculate the lemon juice needed for the extra tart lemonade:**
   - Tim needs to make an extra gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart as the other gallons.
   - Since the other gallons are not specified to be twice as tart, we assume the extra gallon is just an additional gallon of regular lemonade.
   - Therefore, he needs an additional 1 cup of lemon juice for the extra gallon.

3. **Calculate the total lemon juice needed:**
   - Total lemon juice needed = 4 cups (for the 4 gallons) + 1 cup (for the extra gallon) = 5 cups.

4. **Calculate the number of lemons needed:**
   - Each cup of lemon juice requires 6 lemons.
   - Therefore, for 5 cups of lemon juice, Tim will need \(5 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 30 \text{ lemons}\).

"To find the number of red blocks, we first need to determine the number of blue and yellow blocks.

Given:
- The tower has 4 blue blocks.
- There are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks.
- Let the number of red blocks be \( R \).
- The total number of blocks is 32.

First, calculate the number of yellow blocks:
\[ \text{Number of yellow blocks} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue blocks} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

Now, we can set up an equation to find the number of red blocks:
\[ \text{Number of blue blocks} + \text{Number of yellow blocks} + \text{Number of red blocks} = 32 \]
\[ 4 + 8 + R = 32 \]

Solve for \( R \):
\[ 12 + R = 32 \]
\[ R = 32 - 12 \]
\[ R = 20 \]

So, the number of red blocks is 20.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"
"To determine how far Elvis is from his house, we need to calculate the distance he traveled west and the distance he traveled east, and then find the net distance from his starting point.

First, calculate the distance traveled west:
- Elvis drives west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles.

Next, calculate the distance traveled east:
- Elvis drives east for 8 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles.

Now, find the net distance from his starting point:
- The net distance is the difference between the distance traveled east and the distance traveled west.
- Net distance = Distance traveled east - Distance traveled west = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles.

Therefore, Elvis is 54 miles from his house now.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the value of the boat after three years of depreciation, we need to calculate the depreciation year by year.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 30% in the first year.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation amount} = 9000 \times 0.30 = 2700
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after first year} = 9000 - 2700 = 6300
   \]

2. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 30% in the second year, but this depreciation is applied to the value at the end of the first year.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation amount} = 6300 \times 0.30 = 1890
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after second year} = 6300 - 1890 = 4410
   \]

3. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 20% in the third year, but this depreciation is applied to the value at the end of the second year.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation amount} = 4410 \times 0.20 = 882
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after third year} = 4410 - 882 = 3528
   \]

Thus, the value of the boat after three years is \(\boxed{3528}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of orange and yellow candies based on the given information:

- The number of red candies is 54.
- The number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies, so it is \(2 \times 54 = 108\).
- The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies, so it is \(\frac{54}{2} = 27\).

Now, let's calculate the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies:

- Red candies: 54
- Orange candies: 108
- Yellow candies: 27

Adding these together gives the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies:

\[ 54 + 108 + 27 = 189 \]

The total number of candies in the bag is 232. To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:

"To determine how many pounds of feed are left after a week, we need to calculate the total amount of feed consumed by Dexter's pigs over that period.

First, let's find out how much feed one pig eats in a day:
- Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day.
- Therefore, one pig eats \(4 \times 2 = 8\) pounds of feed per day.

Next, we calculate the total feed consumption for all five pigs in one day:
- Since there are five pigs, the total feed consumption per day is \(8 \times 5 = 40\) pounds.

Now, we determine the total feed consumption over a week (7 days):
- The total feed consumption in a week is \(40 \times 7 = 280\) pounds.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. To find out how much feed is left after a week, we subtract the total feed consumed in a week from the total feed ordered:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Street**: There are 5 children.
2. **Second Street**: Each of the 5 children is joined by another child. Therefore, the number of children becomes \(5 + 5 = 10\).
3. **Third Street**: Each of the 10 children is joined by another 2 children. Therefore, the number of children becomes \(10 + (10 \times 2) = 10 + 20 = 30\).

On the third street, the original 5 children then give up and leave the group. So, we subtract these 5 children from the total of 30 children.

The final number of children following the truck is \(30 - 5 = 25\).

The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total time Charisma spends on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum them up.

1. **Meditation Time:**
   - Charisma meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes at night.
   - Total meditation time per day = 15 minutes + 15 minutes = 30 minutes.
   - Since she meditates 5 days a week, the weekly meditation time is 30 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 150 minutes/week.
   - Over 4 weeks, the total meditation time is 150 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 600 minutes.

2. **Yoga Time:**
   - Charisma practices yoga for 1 hour (60 minutes) 5 days a week.
   - Weekly yoga time = 60 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 300 minutes/week.
   - Over 4 weeks, the total yoga time is 300 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1200 minutes.

"To determine the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars of his honey and jam mix, we need to calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar and then the total cost for 10 jars. After that, we can find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

First, let's calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar:
- Passion fruit: 2 pounds at $6 per pound = 2 * $6 = $12
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds at $8 per pound = 1.5 * $8 = $12
- Special honey: 2 pounds at $10 per pound = 2 * $10 = $20

The total cost for one jar is:
$12 (passion fruit) + $12 (jackfruit) + $20 (honey) = $44

Now, let's calculate the total cost for 10 jars:
$44 * 10 = $440

Tim sells each jar for $50, so the total revenue from selling 10 jars is:
$50 * 10 = $500

Finally, the profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
$500 (revenue) - $440 (cost) = $60

Therefore, the profit Tim makes selling 10 jars is $60."

Total spent = $3.50 + $15.00 + $8.50 = $27.00

Janet's parents gave her $40. To find out how much she has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the amount given by her parents:

Amount left = $40.00 - $27.00 = $13.00

So, the final numerical answer is $13.00."
"To determine how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of days Josh works in one week.
2. Determine the number of cars he services in one week.
3. Calculate his weekly earnings.
4. Multiply his weekly earnings by 2 to find out how much he makes in 2 weeks.

First, let's calculate the number of days Josh works in one week. He is open every day of the week except Sunday and Wednesday. There are 7 days in a week, so he works:
\[ 7 - 2 = 5 \text{ days per week} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cars he services in one week. Since he services 3 cars a day, in 5 days he services:
\[ 3 \text{ cars/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 15 \text{ cars/week} \]

Now, we determine his weekly earnings. He gets paid $4 per car, so his weekly earnings are:
\[ 15 \text{ cars/week} \times 4 \text{ dollars/car} = 60 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Finally, to find out how much he makes in 2 weeks, we multiply his weekly earnings by 2:
\[ 60 \text{ dollars/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Josh makes $120 in 2 weeks. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"First, let's determine the initial number of cookies Randy has:
- Oatmeal cookies: 9
- Chocolate chip cookies: 4
- Sugar cookies: 5

Randy ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor:
- Oatmeal cookies: 9 - 1 = 8
- Chocolate chip cookies: 4 - 1 = 3
- Sugar cookies: 5 - 1 = 4

He then ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch:
- Oatmeal cookies: 8 - 2 = 6

He gave 2 sugar cookies to his friends:
- Sugar cookies: 4 - 2 = 2

Now, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner:
- Oatmeal cookies: 6 + 4 = 10
- Chocolate chip cookies: 3 + 4 = 7
- Sugar cookies: 2 + 4 = 6

Finally, let's calculate the total number of cookies Randy has now:
- Total cookies: 10 (oatmeal) + 7 (chocolate chip) + 6 (sugar) = 23

The final numerical answer is 23."
"To determine how much money Matthew would earn, we need to break down his collection into two equal parts and calculate the earnings from each part separately.

Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers, so each part would contain:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ toy soldiers} \]

The buyer is willing to pay $5 per toy for the first 6 toy soldiers and $7 per toy for the other 6 toy soldiers.

First, calculate the earnings from the first 6 toy soldiers:
\[ 6 \text{ toy soldiers} \times \$5/\text{toy} = \$30 \]

Next, calculate the earnings from the other 6 toy soldiers:
\[ 6 \text{ toy soldiers} \times \$7/\text{toy} = \$42 \]

Now, add the earnings from both parts to find the total amount Matthew would earn:
\[ \$30 + \$42 = \$72 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$72 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate returns, the dog continues to dig 6 holes a day, but Nate starts filling in 9 holes a day. The net effect is that 3 holes are filled each day (since 9 holes are filled minus 6 holes are dug):

\[ 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/day} = 3 \text{ holes/day filled} \]

Now, we need to determine how many days it will take to fill in all 84 holes. Since 3 holes are filled each day, the number of days required to fill in all the holes is:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

To find out how many weeks it takes, we divide the number of days by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, we need to determine the average enrollment at Butler High School. Given that Butler High School enrolls an average of \(\frac{3}{4}\) as many students as Norman High School, we can calculate the enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

\[
\text{Enrollment at Butler High School} = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Enrollment at Norman High School}
\]

Given that the enrollment at Norman High School is 4000 students, we substitute this value into the equation:

\[
\text{Enrollment at Butler High School} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 = 3000
\]

Next, we need to find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School. We do this by subtracting the enrollment at Butler High School from the enrollment at Norman High School:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Enrollment at Norman High School} - \text{Enrollment at Butler High School}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Difference} = 4000 - 3000 = 1000
\]

Therefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School. The final numerical answer is:

\[
1000
\]"
"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies the Adams family has made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made.

Total cookies made = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies made - (Rainbow cookies + Oatmeal cookies)

Let's calculate the number of chocolate chip cookies:

Chocolate chip cookies = 7995 - (2595 + 3075)
Chocolate chip cookies = 7995 - 5670
Chocolate chip cookies = 2325

So, the number of chocolate chip cookies made is 2325."
"First, let's determine the number of each item Igor gathered by accident:

- Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many. So, Igor gathered \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes.
- Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes, but Igor gathered two more than the number requested. So, Igor gathered \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes.
- Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, and Igor picked up the correct number of beakers, so he gathered 7 beakers.

Now, let's calculate the total number of items Igor gathered:
- Test tubes: 8
- Beakers: 7
- Petri dishes: 16

The total number of items gathered is:
\[ 8 + 7 + 16 = 31 \]

Dr. Grumpus wanted a total of 29 items placed on the lab bench. Since the total number of items gathered is 31, the number of items that were lost is:
\[ 31 - 29 = 2 \]

Therefore, the number of beakers that Igor lost is 2.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of screws required for all the tables.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. Therefore, the number of screws needed for one table is:
\[ 4 \text{ legs/table} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 8 \text{ screws/table} \]

James is assembling 4 tables, so the total number of screws needed for all the tables is:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws/table} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the number of screws he has:
\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

Thus, the number of screws James will have left over is:
\[ 8 \]"
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we first need to determine how many eggs are in the second basket. According to the problem, the second basket has twice as many eggs as the first basket.

The first basket has 10 eggs. Therefore, the second basket has:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, to find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we add the number of eggs in the first basket to the number of eggs in the second basket:
\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \]

So, the total number of eggs in both baskets is:
\[ 30 \]"
"First, let's determine how much money each person raised individually.

Alexandra raised $430.

Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so:
\[ \text{Kim's amount} = 430 + 320 = 750 \]

Next, we need to find out how much Sarah raised. We know that Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, and Sarah raised $300, so:
\[ \text{Maryam's amount} = 300 + 400 = 700 \]

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money raised by adding the amounts raised by Alexandra, Kim, Sarah, and Maryam:
\[ \text{Total amount} = 430 + 750 + 300 + 700 \]

Adding these amounts together:
\[ 430 + 750 = 1180 \]
\[ 1180 + 300 = 1480 \]
\[ 1480 + 700 = 2180 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they all raised is:
\[ \boxed{2180} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speeds of Aaron and Vanessa and then use that information to find out how long Vanessa took to run her part of the race.

First, let's denote the distance Aaron ran as \(d_A\) miles and the distance Vanessa ran as \(d_V\) miles. According to the problem, Vanessa ran 4 miles, so \(d_V = 4\) miles.

Since Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, we have:
\[d_V = 2d_A\]
\[4 = 2d_A\]
\[d_A = 2 \text{ miles}\]

Next, let's denote Aaron's speed as \(v_A\) miles per minute and Vanessa's speed as \(v_V\) miles per minute. Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, we have:
\[v_A = 2v_V\]

We know that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Therefore, we can write:
\[v_A = \frac{d_A}{16}\]
\[2v_V = \frac{2}{16}\]
\[2v_V = \frac{1}{8}\]
\[v_V = \frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute}\]

Now, we need to find out how long it took Vanessa to run her 4 miles. Using her speed, we have:
\[v_V = \frac{d_V}{t_V}\]
\[\frac{1}{16} = \frac{4}{t_V}\]
\[t_V = 4 \times 16\]
\[t_V = 64 \text{ minutes}\]

So, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{64}

"First, we need to calculate how much line is needed for the current dock length. The caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. With 200 feet of dock, the required line is:

\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Currently, the caretaker has 6 feet of new line. To find out how much more line is needed, we subtract the amount of line he already has from the total amount needed:

\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

So, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"To determine how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of reservations per night:**
   Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations a night.

2. **Determine the number of reservations per week:**
   Since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, the number of reservations per week is:
   \[
   6 \text{ reservations/night} \times 2 \text{ nights/week} = 12 \text{ reservations/week}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of meals and wine per reservation:**
   Each reservation includes 2 meals at $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine.
   \[
   \text{Cost per reservation} = (2 \times 5) + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total revenue per week:**
   Multiply the cost per reservation by the number of reservations per week.
   \[
   \text{Total revenue per week} = 15 \text{ dollars/reservation} \times 12 \text{ reservations/week} = 180 \text{ dollars/week}
   \]

Therefore, the total amount Tom's restaurant makes in a week is:
\[
\boxed{180}

"First, we need to determine the total selling price of the 50 watermelons. The vendor made a profit of 25% on the cost price of $80.

To find the profit amount, we calculate 25% of $80:
\[ \text{Profit} = 0.25 \times 80 = 20 \]

Adding this profit to the original cost price gives us the total selling price:
\[ \text{Total Selling Price} = 80 + 20 = 100 \]

Now, to find the selling price per watermelon, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:
\[ \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{100}{50} = 2 \]

So, each watermelon was sold for $2.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's determine James's current age. We know that Dora will be 12 years old in 3 years, so Dora is currently 9 years old. Since James is now twice as old as Dora, James is currently \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

Next, we need to determine how old John is now. We know that John had James when he was 19 years old, and James is currently 18 years old. Therefore, John is currently \(19 + 18 = 37\) years old.

Now, we need to find out how old John's youngest son is. John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old, so the youngest son is currently \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old. In 3 years, the youngest son will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in that time.

First, let's find out how many oranges each can peel in one minute:
- Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in one minute, she peels \( \frac{1}{3} \) of an orange.
- Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in one minute, she peels \( \frac{1}{4} \) of an orange.

Next, we calculate how many oranges each can peel in one hour (60 minutes):
- In one hour, Ana peels \( 60 \times \frac{1}{3} = 20 \) oranges.
- In one hour, Jane peels \( 60 \times \frac{1}{4} = 15 \) oranges.

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane in one hour:
- The difference is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \).

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400, and Mark gets it at 80% off. This means he pays 20% of the original price.

\[ \text{Discounted price of the radiator} = 400 \times \frac{20}{100} = 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of hiring the mechanic. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.

\[ \text{Cost of hiring the mechanic} = 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator after the discount to the cost of hiring the mechanic to find the total amount Mark paid.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 230 \]"
"Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( K \).

We know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

From the first piece of information, we can write the equation:
\[ C + K = 20 \]

From the second piece of information, we know that chickens have 2 legs each and cows have 4 legs each, so we can write the equation:
\[ 2C + 4K = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

To solve this system, we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ C + 2K - C - K = 15 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 20 - 15 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is 5. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of slices available from the 7 pizzas. Since each pizza is cut into 8 slices, we can calculate the total number of slices as follows:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to divide the total number of slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends, which makes a total of 4 people. So, we divide the total number of slices by 4:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Thus, each of them can have \(\boxed{14}\) slices."
