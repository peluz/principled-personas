"First, let's determine how many eggs Janet has left after eating and using some for baking.

Janet starts with 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 eggs for baking muffins. So, the number of eggs she has left is:

\[ 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 \]

Janet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg. Therefore, the amount she makes every day is:

\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 18 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of fiber required for both the blue and white fibers and then sum them up.

1. The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.
2. The robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber, which means it takes \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) bolt of white fiber.

Now, we add the bolts of blue and white fiber together:
\[ 2 \text{ bolts (blue)} + 1 \text{ bolt (white)} = 3 \text{ bolts} \]

So, the total number of bolts required is 3.

\[
\boxed{3}

"First, we need to calculate the new value of the house after the repairs and the increase in value.

The initial value of the house is $80,000. Josh adds $50,000 in repairs, so the total cost before the increase is:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

The value of the house increases by 150%. To find the increase in value, we calculate 150% of $130,000:
\[ 130,000 \times 1.5 = 195,000 \]

Adding this increase to the total cost gives the new value of the house:
\[ 130,000 + 195,000 = 325,000 \]

The profit Josh made is the new value of the house minus the total cost:
\[ 325,000 - 130,000 = 195,000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 195,000 \]"
"James runs 3 sprints each day, and each sprint is 60 meters. Therefore, in one day, he runs:

\[ 3 \text{ sprints/day} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 180 \text{ meters/day} \]

Since he runs 3 times a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:

\[ 180 \text{ meters/day} \times 3 \text{ days/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 540."
"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she gives her flock in the morning and afternoon.

Wendi gives each chicken 3 cups of feed per day. With a flock of 20 chickens, the total feed given in the morning and afternoon is:

\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

In the morning, she gives 15 cups of feed, and in the afternoon, she gives 25 cups of feed. So, the total feed given in the morning and afternoon is:

\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

The total feed given in the morning and afternoon is 40 cups. Since the total feed required for the day is 60 cups, the amount of feed needed for the final meal is:

\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:

\[ 20 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of 16 glasses, considering the pricing structure.

1. The first glass costs $5.
2. Every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $5 * 0.60 = $3.

So, for every pair of glasses, the cost is $5 + $3 = $8.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can pair them up into 8 pairs (16 / 2 = 8).

The total cost for 8 pairs of glasses is 8 * $8 = $64.

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses.

\[
\boxed{64}
\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of sheep in each city based on the given relationships and the number of sheep in Seattle.

1. Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. Therefore, Charleston has \(4 \times 20 = 80\) sheep.
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Therefore, Toulouse has \(2 \times 80 = 160\) sheep.

Now, we sum the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle:
\[160 + 80 + 20 = 260\]

The final numerical answer is 260."
"To determine the total time Carla needs to download the 200 GB file, we need to break down the process into parts and calculate the time for each part.

1. **First 40% of the download:**
   - 40% of 200 GB is \(0.40 \times 200 = 80\) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \(80 \div 2 = 40\) minutes.

2. **Windows update installation:**
   - This takes 20 minutes.

3. **Restarting the download:**
   - After the update, Carla has to start the download from the beginning, which means she has to download the first 80 GB again.
   - The time to download the first 80 GB again is the same as the time to download the first 80 GB, which is 40 minutes.

4. **Remaining 60% of the download:**
   - 60% of 200 GB is \(0.60 \times 200 = 120\) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 120 GB is \(120 \div 2 = 60\) minutes.

Now, we sum up all the times:
- Time for the first 40%: 40 minutes
- Time for the Windows update: 20 minutes
- Time to download the first 40% again: 40 minutes
- Time for the remaining 60%: 60 minutes

Total time = \(40 + 20 + 40 + 60 = 160\) minutes.

The final numerical answer is 160 minutes."
"First, let's calculate the distance John traveled during the initial 3 hours at 60 mph:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during this time.

Then, he drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph:
\[ \text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]

After that, he drives for the remaining 3.5 hours at 80 mph:
\[ \text{Distance} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 3.5 \, \text{hours} = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, let's add up the distances:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 180 \, \text{miles} + 15 \, \text{miles} + 280 \, \text{miles} = 475 \, \text{miles} \]

Since John started 180 miles away from home, the distance he is from home at the end of those 4 hours is:
\[ \text{Distance from home} = 475 \, \text{miles} - 180 \, \text{miles} = 295 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 295 \]"
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break it down into regular hours and overtime hours.

First, we calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours at her regular rate:
\[ \text{Regular earnings} = 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \]

Next, we calculate her earnings for the 5 overtime hours at her overtime rate. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate:
\[ \text{Overtime rate} = 1.2 \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$12/\text{hour} \]
\[ \text{Overtime earnings} = 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

Now, we add the regular earnings and the overtime earnings to find her total earnings for the week:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \]

So, Eliza's total earnings for the week are:
\[ \$460 \]"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the number of downloads for each month and then sum them up.

1. **First Month Downloads:**
   The program had 60 downloads in the first month.

2. **Second Month Downloads:**
   The number of downloads in the second month was three times the downloads in the first month.
   \[
   \text{Second Month Downloads} = 3 \times 60 = 180
   \]

3. **Third Month Downloads:**
   The number of downloads in the third month was reduced by 30% from the second month.
   \[
   \text{Reduction} = 30\% \times 180 = 0.30 \times 180 = 54
   \]
   \[
   \text{Third Month Downloads} = 180 - 54 = 126
   \]

4. **Total Downloads Over Three Months:**
   \[
   \text{Total Downloads} = \text{First Month Downloads} + \text{Second Month Downloads} + \text{Third Month Downloads}

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money from the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point at which this profit becomes positive.

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:
- Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons.
- Each lemon is sold for $1.5.
- Therefore, the annual revenue from lemons is \(7 \times 1.5 = 10.5\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the annual cost of watering and feeding the tree:
- The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.

Now, we can find the net profit each year by subtracting the annual cost from the annual revenue:
- Net profit per year = Annual revenue - Annual cost
- Net profit per year = \(10.5 - 3 = 7.5\) dollars.

Since the initial cost to plant the tree is $90, we need to determine how many years it will take for the net profit to cover this initial cost.

Let \(n\) be the number of years it takes to start earning money. The total net profit after \(n\) years is \(7.5n\). We need this to be at least equal to the initial cost of $90:
\[7.5n \geq 90\]

Solving for \(n\):
\[n \geq \frac{90}{7.5}\]
\[n \geq 12\]

Therefore, it will take at least 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree. The final numerical answer is:
12"
"Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had as \( x \).

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \).

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \).

3. She then sold half of what was left at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \). The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \).

We know that after these sales, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

Let's solve this equation step by step.

First, simplify the expression inside the parentheses:

\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \left( \frac{x}{3} - 1 \right) = \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{x}{3} + 1 = \frac{x}{3} - 1 \]

So the equation becomes:

\[ \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5 \]

Add 1 to both sides:

\[ \frac{x}{3} = 6 \]

Multiply both sides by 3:

\[ x = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners. Let's verify this by going through the steps:

1. She sold \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) vacuum cleaners at the green house, leaving her with \( 18 - 6 = 12 \) vacuum cleaners.
2. She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, leaving her with \( 12 - 2 = 10 \) vacuum cleaners.
3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) vacuum cleaners, leaving her with \( 10 - 5 = 5 \) vacuum cleaners.

Since the final number of vacuum cleaners left is 5, our solution is correct. The initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had is:

\[
\boxed{18}

"First, let's calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we have:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after those who enrolled in contemporary dance have been accounted for:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Now, 25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

The rest of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance. To find out how many students that is, we subtract the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance from the remaining students:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of students in hip-hop dance}}{\text{Total number of students}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.60 \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the entire students that enrolled in hip-hop dance is 60%."
"To determine which purchase plan will maximize the profit, we need to calculate the future value of each item based on the expected market growth and then compare the profit from each plan.

For the jewelry:
- Current value: $5,000
- Expected growth: 2.5%

The future value of the jewelry can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Future Value of Jewelry} = \text{Current Value} \times (1 + \text{Growth Rate}) \]
\[ \text{Future Value of Jewelry} = 5000 \times (1 + 0.025) \]
\[ \text{Future Value of Jewelry} = 5000 \times 1.025 \]
\[ \text{Future Value of Jewelry} = 5125 \]

For the electronic gadgets:
- Current value: $8,000
- Expected growth: 1.2%

The future value of the electronic gadgets can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Future Value of Gadgets} = \text{Current Value} \times (1 + \text{Growth Rate}) \]
\[ \text{Future Value of Gadgets} = 8000 \times (1 + 0.012) \]
\[ \text{Future Value of Gadgets} = 8000 \times 1.012 \]
\[ \text{Future Value of Gadgets} = 8096 \]

Now, we calculate the profit for each plan:
- Profit from jewelry: \( \text{Future Value of Jewelry} - \text{Current Value} \)
\[ \text{Profit from Jewelry} = 5125 - 5000 = 125 \]

- Profit from electronic gadgets: \( \text{Future Value of Gadgets} - \text{Current Value} \)
\[ \text{Profit from Gadgets} = 8096 - 8000 = 96 \]

Comparing the profits:
- Profit from jewelry: $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets: $96

The merchant would maximize profit by choosing to purchase the jewelry, which would yield a profit of $125."
"To determine the total distance covered by each train over the two days, we need to add the distances traveled in both directions.

1. The first day, the train travels 80 miles west.
2. The second day, the train travels 150 miles north.

The total distance covered by each train is the sum of these two distances:
\[ 80 \text{ miles} + 150 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles} \]

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles."
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from both teaching and coaching separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her annual earnings from teaching:
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual teaching hours = 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year
Annual teaching earnings = 1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her annual earnings from coaching:
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual coaching hours = 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year
Annual coaching earnings = 750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year

Now, we sum up her annual earnings from both teaching and coaching:
Annual salary = Annual teaching earnings + Annual coaching earnings
Annual salary = $35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

The final numerical answer is $57,500."
"To determine how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs Claire uses per day.
2. Calculate the number of eggs Claire uses per week.
3. Calculate the number of eggs Claire uses in 4 weeks.
4. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.

Step 1: Claire uses 3 eggs per day.

Step 2: There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Step 3: Over 4 weeks, she will use:
\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Step 4: Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, we convert 84 eggs into dozens:
\[ \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozen} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour over the entire 12-mile trail.

First, let's calculate the total time Marissa has already spent hiking:
- She took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles.
- She took another 1 hour to walk the next 2 miles.
So, she has already spent 2 hours hiking.

Let's denote the remaining distance as \( x \) miles. The time taken to walk the remaining distance is \( \frac{x}{v} \) hours, where \( v \) is the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance.

The total distance is 12 miles, and she has already covered 6 miles (4 miles + 2 miles). Therefore, the remaining distance is:
\[ x = 12 - 6 = 6 \text{ miles} \]

The total time for the entire hike is the sum of the time already spent and the time for the remaining distance:
\[ \text{Total time} = 2 + \frac{6}{v} \]

Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour over the entire 12-mile trail. The formula for average speed is:
\[ \text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 4 = \frac{12}{2 + \frac{6}{v}} \]

To find \( v \), we solve the equation:
\[ 4 = \frac{12}{2 + \frac{6}{v}} \]
\[ 4 \left(2 + \frac{6}{v}\right) = 12 \]
\[ 8 + \frac{24}{v} = 12 \]
\[ \frac{24}{v} = 4 \]
\[ v = \frac{24}{4} \]
\[ v = 6 \]

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles at a speed of 6 miles per hour to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \]"
"First, let's determine the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the amount of water in the orange drink is:

\[ \text{Water in orange drink} = 10 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ liters} \]

Next, let's determine the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is:

\[ \text{Water in pineapple drink} = 15 \times \frac{3}{5} = 9 \text{ liters} \]

After pouring the orange drink, we spill one liter, so we have:

\[ 10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters of orange drink} \]

The total volume of the mixture after adding the orange drink to the pineapple drink is:

\[ 9 + 15 = 24 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we need to find the total amount of water in the 24 liters of the mixture. The total amount of water from the orange drink is \(\frac{20}{3}\) liters, and the total amount of water from the pineapple drink is 9 liters. Therefore, the total amount of water in the mixture is:

\[ \frac{20}{3} + 9 = \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3} \text{ liters} \]

So, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture is:

\[ \frac{47}{3} \]

To provide the final numerical answer:

"To find the original price of the book, we can set up an equation based on the information given. If the book was bought for $19.50 with a 25% discount, this means Kyle paid 75% of the original price (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \). According to the problem, 75% of \( P \) is $19.50. We can write this as:

\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we need to solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's calculate the value of \( P \).
```python
# Calculation
original_price = 19.50 / 0.75
original_price
```
```output
RuntimeError
```
It seems there was an error in the execution environment. Let me perform the calculation manually:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered except for the boxes of pizza.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
The cost of 4 apples is \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Adding these together, the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples is:
\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\] dollars.

Marie paid a total of $50. If we subtract the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples from the total amount paid, we can find out how much she spent on the boxes of pizza:
\[50 - 33 = 17\] dollars.

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, we can determine the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered by dividing the amount spent on pizza by the cost per box:
\[17 \div 8.50 = 2\]

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza. The final numerical answer is:
\[2\]"

3 pairs * $22.50/pair = $67.50

The cost of the shoes is:
3 pairs * $42/pair = $126.00

Now, we add these amounts together to find the total cost:
$59.50 + $67.50 + $126.00 = $253.00

So, Mishka spent $253.00 on all the clothing items."
"To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.
2. Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need to buy.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.**

Cynthia eats 1 serving of ice cream every night. There are 60 days in the period, so:
\[ \text{Total servings} = 1 \text{ serving/day} \times 60 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ servings} \]

"Henry's second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip is 60 miles, the distance to the end of the trip is 60 miles. Therefore, the distance to his second stop is 60 - 15 = 45 miles from the start. He first stopped after 20 miles. So, the distance he traveled between his first and second stops is 45 - 20 = 25 miles.

The final numerical answer is 25."
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

The cost of the first pair of high heels is $33. The cost of the second pair of high heels is twice the cost of the first pair, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = 104 \]

So, the cost of the boots is \( 104 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 104 \]"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen based on the given ratio and total age.

Given:
- The ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11.
- The total age of Darrell and Allen is 162.

Let's denote Darrell's age as \(7x\) and Allen's age as \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The sum of their ages is:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]
\[18x = 162\]
\[x = \frac{162}{18}\]
\[x = 9\]

Now, we can find their current ages:
- Darrell's age: \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\)
- Allen's age: \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\)

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is:
\[109\]"
"To find the average guess, we first need to determine each friend's guess and then calculate the average.

1. The first friend's guess is 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half of the first friend's guess:

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these as equations:
\[ G + S = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins \( S \) is 40, we can find the number of gold coins \( G \) using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins. The final numerical answer is:

\]

Now, we add 5 to this number to find out how many jewels Aaron has:

\[
20 + 5 = 25
\]

Next, we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. The problem states that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Since Aaron has 25 jewels, we subtract 2 from this number to find out how many jewels Siobhan has:

\[
25 - 2 = 23

"To determine how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
2. Determine how many sets of 4 yogurts are needed to meet this number.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the price per set.

Step 1: Number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats:
\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Step 2: Determine how many sets of 4 yogurts are needed.
Since each set contains 4 yogurts, the number of sets needed for 60 yogurts is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total cost.
Each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, so for 15 sets, the total cost is:
\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times 5 \text{ dollars/set} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John makes from selling his lego sets. He has 13 lego sets and sells each for $15.

\[ \text{Total money from lego sets} = 13 \times 15 = 195 \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money John spends on the video games. He buys 8 video games for $20 each.

\[ \text{Total money spent on video games} = 8 \times 20 = 160 \]

Now, we can determine how much money John has left after buying the video games. We know he has $5 left after these purchases.

\[ \text{Money left} = 195 - 160 = 35 \]

Since the problem states that John has $5 left, we can verify that the calculation is consistent with the given information.

Finally, since John did not sell any lego sets after buying the video games, he still has all 13 lego sets.

\[ \text{Number of lego sets John still has} = 13 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find John's speed, we need to determine the total distance he runs and the total time he spends running.

John runs 60 miles a week over 3 days. The first day he runs 3 hours, and the other two days he runs half as much time as the first day, which is 1.5 hours each day.

First, let's calculate the total time he spends running in a week:
- First day: 3 hours
- Second day: 1.5 hours
- Third day: 1.5 hours

Total time = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours

Now, we know the total distance he runs in a week is 60 miles and the total time he spends running is 6 hours. Speed is calculated as distance divided by time.

Speed = Total distance / Total time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour

So, the final numerical answer is 10 miles per hour."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how far Dana can travel in six hours given her running, walking, and skipping speeds, and the time she spends on each activity.

First, let's find Dana's walking speed. We know that Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, and this speed is half of her running speed. Therefore, her running speed is:
\[ \text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine the time she spends running and walking. Since she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, and the total time is six hours, we can calculate the time spent on each activity:
\[ \text{Time spent running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Time spent walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the distance she covers while running and walking:
\[ \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time spent running} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time spent walking} \]

To find the walking speed, we use the fact that her walking speed is one-fourth of her running speed:
\[ \text{Walking speed} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Running speed} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6 = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Distance walking} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, we add the distances covered while running and walking to find the total distance Dana can travel in six hours:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance walking} = 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to calculate how many calories are left in your daily calorie target.

Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories. Therefore, the remaining calories you can consume are:
\[ 2000 - 1800 = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories are in one serving of chips. According to the nutritional info, one serving of chips has 250 calories.

To find out how many servings of chips you can consume with the remaining 200 calories, we divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories/serving}} = 0.8 \text{ servings} \]

Since one serving is 300 grams, we can find out how many grams of chips you can eat by multiplying the number of servings by the grams per serving:
\[ 0.8 \text{ servings} \times 300 \text{ grams/serving} = 240 \text{ grams} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the cost of making the candles. Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax and wicks for every 10 candles. For 20 candles, he will need 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks. The cost for 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks is:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pound} = \$20.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles. Each candle is sold for $2.00:

\[ 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00 \text{ per candle} = \$40.00 \]

Now, we can find the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00 \]

So, the net profit if Charlie makes and sells 20 candles is:

\[ \$20.00 \]"

2. Calculate the total number of hours spent writing articles over the three days.

**Step 1: Determine the number of articles written on each day.**

- **Monday:** Meredith wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday:** She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. So, the number of articles on Tuesday is:
  \[
  5 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 5 \right) = 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ articles}
  \]
- **Wednesday:** She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, the number of articles on Wednesday is:
  \[

The total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days is \(\boxed{104}\)."
"To determine how many Post-it notes were in the package that Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Post-it Notes**: Candice started with 80 Post-it notes.
2. **Post-it Notes Used**: She placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee. Therefore, she used 220 Post-it notes.
3. **Remaining Post-it Notes**: After using 220 Post-it notes, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased as \( x \).

The total number of Post-it notes she had before purchasing the new package is the sum of the initial notes and the notes in the new package:
\[ 80 + x \]

After using 220 Post-it notes and having 23 remaining, the equation representing the total number of Post-it notes is:
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x - 220 = 23 - 80 \]
\[ x - 220 = -57 \]
\[ x = -57 + 220 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

Therefore, the number of Post-it notes in the package that she purchased is 163."
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Given that each blue tie costs $40 and he spent a total of $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of each red tie. Since red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, the cost of each red tie is:

\[ \text{Cost per red tie} = \text{Cost per blue tie} + 0.5 \times \text{Cost per blue tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60 \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

Finally, the total amount John spent on ties is the sum of the cost of the blue ties and the cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total spent on ties} = \text{Total spent on blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

Next, we need to determine how many 6-inch pieces can be cut from the 48-inch wire. We do this by dividing the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"First, let's calculate the total number of units in the building. The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units. Therefore, the total number of units is:

\[ 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units/floor} = 120 \text{ units} \]

Next, we need to find out how many units are occupied. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is:

\[ 120 \text{ units} \times \frac{3}{4} = 90 \text{ units} \]

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

\[ 120 \text{ units} - 90 \text{ units} = 30 \text{ units} \]

So, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"First, we need to determine how many dozens of eggs Lloyd gets from his chickens per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs produced per day by 12:

Next, we calculate how much Lloyd makes per day by selling the eggs at $2 per dozen:

\[ \text{Daily earnings} = 21 \text{ dozen} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much Lloyd makes in a week, we multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in a week (7 days):

\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 42 \text{ dollars/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 294 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the maximum allowable weight of the boxes:**
   The bridge can carry no more than 5000 pounds. Subtract the weight of the driver and the empty truck from this limit to find the maximum weight the boxes can add.

   \[
   \text{Maximum weight for boxes} = 5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of boxes that can be loaded:**
   Each box weighs 15 pounds. To find the maximum number of boxes, divide the maximum allowable weight for the boxes by the weight of one box.

"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of work, we need to consider the two different phases of her pension calculation:

1. For the first 20 years, her pension is a flat $50,000 per year.
2. After 20 years, her pension increases by 5% of the value of the pension each year.

Let's calculate her pension at the end of 20 years:
- Initial pension at year 0: $50,000
- Pension at year 20: $50,000 * (1 + 0.05) = $50,000 * 1.05 = $52,500

Now, we need to calculate her pension at the end of 30 years, which is 10 years after the 20-year mark. Her pension will increase by 5% each year from year 20 to year 30.

Let's calculate the pension at the end of year 30:
- Pension at year 20: $52,500
- Pension at year 21: $52,500 * 1.05
- Pension at year 22: ($52,500 * 1.05) * 1.05
- And so on...

The pension at the end of year 30 can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Pension at year 30} = 52,500 \times (1.05)^{10} \]

Let's compute \( (1.05)^{10} \):
\[ (1.05)^{10} \approx 1.62889 \]

Now, we can find the pension at the end of year 30:
\[ \text{Pension at year 30} = 52,500 \times 1.62889 \approx 85,714.03 \]

Therefore, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years will be approximately $85,714.03."
"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payment into two halves of the year and then sum them up.

1. **First Half of the Year:**
   - The streaming service charges $140 per month.
   - There are 6 months in a half-year.
   - Total cost for the first half of the year:
     \[
     140 \text{ dollars/month} \times 6 \text{ months} = 840 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Second Half of the Year:**
   - The service charges 10% less than the initial amount.
   - The reduced monthly charge:
     \[
     140 \text{ dollars} \times (1 - 0.10) = 140 \text{ dollars} \times 0.90 = 126 \text{ dollars/month}
     \]
   - There are also 6 months in the second half of the year.
   - Total cost for the second half of the year:
     \[
     126 \text{ dollars/month} \times 6 \text{ months} = 756 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Total Amount Paid by the End of the Year:**
   - Sum of the costs for both halves of the year:
     \[
     840 \text{ dollars} + 756 \text{ dollars} = 1596 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Therefore, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is:
\[

"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to calculate how much gas she has left in her tank after her 100-mile trip. Since she needed 4 gallons to refill her 12-gallon tank, she currently has:

\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to find out how many miles she can drive with the 8 gallons of gas she currently has. We know that she drove 100 miles with 4 gallons, so the miles per gallon (mpg) for her car is:

\[ \text{mpg} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

With 8 gallons of gas, she can drive:

\[ 8 \text{ gallons} \times 25 \text{ miles per gallon} = 200 \text{ miles} \]

"First, let's determine how many hours Jim spends on TV and reading in one session.

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV. He then reads for half as long as he watches TV, which is:
\[ \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, in one session, he spends:
\[ 2 \text{ hours (TV)} + 1 \text{ hour (reading)} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total time spent in one week is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week} \]

Now, to find out how many hours he spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly total by 4:
\[ 9 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 36 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

  \[
  \text{Number of rubies} = 175 - 35 = 140
  \]
- The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies, so:
  \[
  \text{Number of emeralds} = 2 \times 140 = 280
  \]

Now, let's find the total number of gems by summing up the diamonds, rubies, and emeralds:
\[

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the five cell phones before interest:

\[ \text{Total cost of cell phones} = 5 \times \$150 = \$750 \]

Next, we need to calculate the interest on the total cost. The interest rate is 2% per unit:

\[ \text{Interest per unit} = 2\% \times \$150 = 0.02 \times \$150 = \$3 \]

Since Shiela bought five cell phones, the total interest is:

\[ \text{Total interest} = 5 \times \$3 = \$15 \]

Now, we add the total interest to the total cost of the cell phones to get the total installment amount:

\[ \text{Total installment amount} = \$750 + \$15 = \$765 \]

Shiela will pay this amount over 3 months, so we divide the total installment amount by 3 to find the monthly payment:

"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4 leveled sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level.

Given:
- The top level (level 4) has a square footage of 16.
- Each level below has half the square footage of the level above it.

Let's calculate the square footage for each level:

- Level 4 (top level): 16 square feet.
- Level 3: \(16 \div 2 = 8\) square feet.
- Level 2: \(8 \div 2 = 4\) square feet.

"To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in both package sizes and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost if Vincent buys the flowers in packages of 3:
- Each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50.
- To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs 6 packages of 3 flowers (since \(18 \div 3 = 6\)).
- The total cost for 18 flowers in packages of 3 is \(6 \times 2.50 = 15.00\).

Next, let's calculate the cost if Vincent buys the flowers in packages of 2:

"To determine the final cost of the grooming after the discount, we first need to calculate the amount of the discount and then subtract it from the original cost.

The original cost of the grooming is $100. The discount is 30%, which means John pays 70% of the original cost (since 100% - 30% = 70%).

To find 70% of $100, we can use the formula:
\[ \text{Discounted Cost} = \text{Original Cost} \times (1 - \text{Discount Rate}) \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ \text{Discounted Cost} = 100 \times (1 - 0.30) \]
\[ \text{Discounted Cost} = 100 \times 0.70 \]
\[ \text{Discounted Cost} = 70 \]

So, the final cost of the grooming is $70."
"First, we need to determine how much water each of the two girls received. Since each girl got \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the 24 liters of water, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[ \text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we first need to calculate how many hours James slept. Since James slept only \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what Harry slept, we can calculate the hours James slept as follows:

\[ \text{Hours James slept} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 \]

Let's calculate that:
\[ \text{Hours James slept} = \frac{2 \times 9}{3} = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \]

Now, to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we subtract the hours James slept from the hours Harry slept:

\[ \text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3 \]

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the volume of tomatoes before cooking:**
   - Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces.
   - The tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked.
   - Therefore, before cooking, the volume of tomatoes was twice the volume of the sauce.
   - Volume of tomatoes before cooking = 32 ounces * 2 = 64 ounces.

2. **Determine the number of tomatoes:**
   - Each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes.
   - To find out how many 16-ounce cans are needed to make 64 ounces of tomatoes, we divide the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of one can.
   - Number of 16-ounce cans = 64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans.
   - Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes is:
   - Total number of tomatoes = 4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes.

Therefore, Freda used 12 tomatoes.

The final numerical answer is:
12"

"Mary initially has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, which totals to:
\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ potted plants} \]

She receives 18 more potted plants from her nursery, so the total number of potted plants she has now is:
\[ 80 + 18 = 98 \text{ potted plants} \]

Tomorrow, she will give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family, which means she will give away:
\[ 40 \text{ potted plants} \]

Therefore, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:
\[ 98 - 40 = 58 \text{ potted plants} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 58 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. So, the second friend pressed the doorbell \(20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25\) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. So, the third friend pressed the doorbell \(60 + 10 = 70\) times.

Now, let's sum up all the doorbell rings:

- First friend: 20 times
- Second friend: 25 times
- Third friend: 70 times
- Fourth friend: 60 times

Total doorbell rings = \(20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175\)

"First, let's calculate the total number of pages Solo needs to read:

- Science: 4 pages
- Social Studies: 20 pages
- History: 7 pages
- Geography: 8 pages

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday. Therefore, the remaining pages he needs to read are:

Remaining pages = Total pages - Pages read on Monday
Remaining pages = 39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read, on average, in one day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days left:

Pages per day = Remaining pages / Number of days left
Pages per day = 24 / 4 = 6 pages

So, Solo needs to read, on average, 6 pages per day."
"To determine how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to break down his water consumption by weekdays and weekends.

John drinks water with each meal on weekdays (Monday to Friday):
- Breakfast
- Lunch
- Dinner
- Before bed

That's 4 glasses of water per day on weekdays.

So, for 5 weekdays:
\[ 4 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ glasses} \]

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he drinks a soda with dinner instead of water:
- Dinner

That's 1 glass of water per day on weekends.

So, for 2 weekend days:
\[ 1 \text{ glass/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 2 \text{ glasses} \]

Adding the glasses of water from weekdays and weekends:
\[ 20 \text{ glasses} + 2 \text{ glasses} = 22 \text{ glasses} \]

Therefore, the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is 22."
"To determine how many minutes it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total distance the fog bank needs to cover:**
   The city is 42 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge.

2. **Determine the rate at which the fog bank covers the city:**
   The fog bank covers every 3 miles in 10 minutes.

3. **Calculate the number of 3-mile segments in the 42-mile city:**
   \[
   \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/segment}} = 14 \text{ segments}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total time required to cover all segments:**
   Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each 3-mile segment, the total time for 14 segments is:
   \[
   14 \text{ segments} \times 10 \text{ minutes/segment} = 140 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Therefore, the fog bank will take 140 minutes to cover the whole city.

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to determine the inner dimensions of a single box and then calculate its volume. After that, we can multiply the volume of one box by 3 to get the total inner volume of all 3 boxes.

The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, the inner dimensions of each box are:
- Length: 5 inches - 2 * 1 inch = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - 2 * 1 inch = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - 1 inch = 3 inches

The volume of one box is calculated as:
\[ \text{Volume of one box} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} = 3 \times 4 \times 3 = 36 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, let's break down the hours he spent watching TV each day:

- Monday and Tuesday: 1 hour each day, so \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours.
- Thursday: 1 hour for a 1-hour episode and 0.5 hours (30 minutes) for a 30-minute episode, so \(1 + 0.5 = 1.5\) hours.
- Friday: 2 hours for two 1-hour episodes, so \(2\) hours.

Now, let's sum up the hours watched from Monday to Friday:
\[2 \text{ (Monday and Tuesday)} + 1.5 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Friday)} = 5.5 \text{ hours}.\]

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. Therefore, the hours he watched on Wednesday is:
\[7 - 5.5 = 1.5 \text{ hours}.\]

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is:
\[1.5 \div 0.5 = 3.\]

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry meant to bake as \( x \). According to the problem, he actually baked twice as many as he meant to, which is \( 2x \). However, he ended up baking 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the actual number of cookies he baked is \( 2x = x + 15 \).

From the equation \( 2x = x + 15 \), we can solve for \( x \):
\[
2x - x = 15 \implies x = 15
\]
So, Henry meant to bake 15 cookies. But he actually baked \( 2x = 2 \times 15 = 30 \) cookies. After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he had left is:
\[
30 - 5 = 25
\]
According to the problem, after dropping 5 cookies, he had a total of 110 cookies. This means that the 25 cookies he had left were part of the 110 cookies he ended up with. Therefore, the number of cookies he baked last year, which is \( x \), is:
\[
x = 15

"First, let's determine the speed at which Julia rows the boat. It takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Therefore, her speed is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet per second} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes her to row the entire 64 seconds distance to the shore:

\[ \text{Time to row 64 seconds} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds per 20 feet}} = 4 \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. To find out how much water the boat took on during the 80 feet row, we can set up a proportion:

\[ \text{Water taken on} = \left( \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 80 \text{ feet} = \frac{2 \times 80}{10} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold:**
   - Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
   - Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
   - Let \( B \) be the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold.
   - Therefore, \( 1800 = 6B \).
   - Solving for \( B \), we get \( B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \).

2. **Determine the number of birds in Jamal's photograph:**
   - The maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times the number of birds in Jamal's photograph.
   - Let \( N \) be the number of birds in Jamal's photograph.
   - Therefore, \( 300 = 50N \).

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the leftover lumber Sasha has:

- Ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards at $10 each: \(10 \times 10 = $100\)
- Five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at $16 each: \(5 \times 16 = $80\)

The total cost of the leftover lumber is \(100 + 80 = $180\).

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the leftover lumber:

- Ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards at $15 each (assuming the price has increased by 50% from $10 to $15): \(10 \times 15 = $150\)
- Five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at $24 each (assuming the price has increased by 50% from $16 to $24): \(5 \times 24 = $120\)

The total revenue from selling the leftover lumber is \(150 + 120 = $270\).

Finally, the profit Sasha makes is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = 270 - 180 = $90 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the ratio and the total amount used. The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total number of parts in the ratio is 7 + 13 = 20 parts.

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water. To find out how many teaspoons of sugar she used, we can set up a proportion based on the ratio. The number of teaspoons of sugar used is the ratio part for sugar (7) divided by the total ratio parts (20) times the total amount used (120 teaspoons).

Let's calculate the number of teaspoons of sugar used:

\[
\text{Number of teaspoons of sugar} = \left(\frac{7}{20}\right) \times 120

"First, let's calculate the total number of hours the hospital sees patients in a day. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can divide the total minutes per day by 60 to get the number of hours.

\[ \text{Total hours per day} = \frac{500 \text{ patients/day} \times 24 \text{ minutes/patient}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = \frac{12000 \text{ minutes/day}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 200 \text{ hours/day} \]

Next, we calculate the revenue generated by the hospital from the doctors' fees. The doctors charge $150 per hour.

\[ \text{Revenue from doctors} = 200 \text{ hours/day} \times \$150/\text{hour} = \$30000/\text{day} \]

Then, we calculate the revenue generated from the patients. The hospital charges $200 per hour.

\[ \text{Revenue from patients} = 200 \text{ hours/day} \times \$200/\text{hour} = \$40000/\text{day} \]

Finally, we calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost to find the profit. Since the cost is not specified, we assume it is zero for this calculation.

\[ \text{Total revenue} = \$30000 + \$40000 = \$70000/\text{day} \]

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Cost} = \$70000 - \$0 = \$70000/\text{day} \]

So, the hospital makes a profit of $70,000 per day from these visits."
"Initially, Nissa hires 60 seasonal workers. A third of them quit, which means \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) elves quit. So, the number of elves remaining is \( 60 - 20 = 40 \).

Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit. Therefore, the number of elves left is \( 40 - 10 = 30 \).

The final numerical answer is 30."

"First, let's calculate the number of tickets Pam used:
- Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times, so she used \(2 \times 6 = 12\) tickets.
- Pam also rode the luge 2 times, so she used \(2 \times 6 = 12\) tickets.
- Therefore, Pam used a total of \(12 + 12 = 24\) tickets.

Next, let's calculate the number of tickets Fred used:
- Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times, so he used \(4 \times 6 = 24\) tickets.
- Fred also rode the luge 2 times, so he used \(2 \times 6 = 12\) tickets.
- Therefore, Fred used a total of \(24 + 12 = 36\) tickets.

Now, let's find the total number of tickets used by both Pam and Fred:
- The total number of tickets used is \(24 + 36 = 60\).

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many miles Walt walked on Tuesday.
2. Calculate the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday.
3. Subtract the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday from the total miles walked from Monday to Wednesday to find the miles walked on Wednesday.

First, we know that Walt walked 4 miles on Monday. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he did on Monday. Therefore, the miles walked on Tuesday are:
\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday:
\[ 4 \text{ miles (Monday)} + 24 \text{ miles (Tuesday)} = 28 \text{ miles} \]

We know that the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. Therefore, the miles walked on Wednesday can be found by subtracting the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday from the total miles walked from Monday to Wednesday:
\[ 41 \text{ miles (Monday through Wednesday)} - 28 \text{ miles (Monday through Tuesday)} = 13 \text{ miles} \]

So, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 13 \]"
"Tom gets 4 car washes a month, so in a year, he gets 4 * 12 = 48 car washes. If each car wash costs $15, then the total cost for a year is 48 * $15 = $720.

"First, let's determine how many video games Brian has after losing 5 of them. Brian originally has 20 video games, but he lost 5, so:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Now, we know that Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian has. Since Brian now has 15 video games, we calculate 3 times that number:

\[ 3 \times 15 = 45 \]

Then, we subtract 5 from this number to find out how many video games Bobby has:

\[ 45 - 5 = 40 \]

So, Bobby has 40 video games. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 27 = 9 \]

Next, we know that two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female. Therefore, the number of female Scottish unicorns is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

So, the number of female Scottish unicorns is 6."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the subs:
\[ 2 \text{ subs} \times \$7.50 \text{ per sub} = \$15.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the chips:
\[ 2 \text{ bags of chips} \times \$1.50 \text{ per bag} = \$3.00 \]

Then, let's calculate the cost of the cookies:
\[ 2 \text{ cookies} \times \$1.00 \text{ per cookie} = \$2.00 \]

Now, let's add up the cost of the subs, chips, and cookies:
\[ \$15.00 + \$3.00 + \$2.00 = \$20.00 \]

Next, we need to add the 20% delivery fee. To find the delivery fee, we calculate 20% of the subtotal:
\[ 20\% \times \$20.00 = 0.20 \times \$20.00 = \$4.00 \]

Adding the delivery fee to the subtotal:
\[ \$20.00 + \$4.00 = \$24.00 \]

Finally, we add the $5.00 tip to the total:
\[ \$24.00 + \$5.00 = \$29.00 \]

So, the total cost of Rory's delivery order is:
\[ \boxed{29} \]"
"First, let's calculate how many questions Mark completed on each test.

For the first test:
- Mark took 8 hours to complete the test.
- He completed 5 questions per hour.
- Therefore, the number of questions he completed is \(8 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ questions/hour} = 40 \text{ questions}\).
- Since the test had 75 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete is \(75 - 40 = 35 \text{ questions}\).

For the second test:
- Mark took 6 hours to complete the test.
- He completed 5 questions per hour.
- Therefore, the number of questions he completed is \(6 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ questions/hour} = 30 \text{ questions}\).
- Since the test had 100 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete is \(100 - 30 = 70 \text{ questions}\).

Now, let's add the incomplete questions from both tests:
- Incomplete questions from the first test: 35
- Incomplete questions from the second test: 70
- Total incomplete questions: \(35 + 70 = 105\).

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of semi-automatic cars. We know there are 20 cars in total, 12 of which are automatic and 4 are manual. So, the number of semi-automatic cars is:

\[ 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 \]

Next, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of queens as \( Q \), the number of baby bees as \( B \), and the number of worker bees as \( W \).

According to the problem:
1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so \( W = 2B \).
2. There are twice as many baby bees as queens, so \( B = 2Q \).

The total number of bees is 700, so:
\[ W + B + Q = 700 \]

Substituting \( W = 2B \) and \( B = 2Q \) into the total bees equation:
\[ 2B + B + Q = 700 \]
\[ 3B + Q = 700 \]

Since \( B = 2Q \), we can substitute \( B \) with \( 2Q \) in the equation:
\[ 3(2Q) + Q = 700 \]
\[ 6Q + Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now, we can find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]
\[ W = 2B = 2 \times 200 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is \( 400 \).

"First, let's calculate the total cost of nonfood items before tax:

- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

Total cost of nonfood items = $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $15

Next, we calculate the tax on the nonfood items. The tax rate is 10%, so the tax amount is:

Tax amount = 10% of $15 = 0.10 * $15 = $1.50

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of nonfood items to get the final cost:

Final cost = Total cost of nonfood items + Tax amount = $15 + $1.50 = $16.50

So, the total cost including tax is $16.50."

"To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of harvests John can have in a year.
2. Determine the total number of pineapples harvested based on the number of harvests.

First, since John harvests his pineapples every 3 months, we need to find out how many 3-month periods there are in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so:
\[ \text{Number of harvests in a year} = \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests} \]

Next, we know that John has 100 pineapples per hectare and he has 10 hectares of pineapple field. Therefore, the total number of pineapples per harvest is:
\[ \text{Total pineapples per harvest} = 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} \times 10 \text{ hectares} = 1000 \text{ pineapples} \]

Since John harvests 4 times a year, the total number of pineapples he can harvest in a year is:
\[ \text{Total pineapples in a year} = 4 \text{ harvests/year} \times 1000 \text{ pineapples/harvest} = 4000 \text{ pineapples} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 4000 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of pieces in each lego set:

"First, let's break down the information given:

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of 30 bees return to the hive, which is 15 bees.
3. In the following 6 hours, twice as many bees as those that left in the first 6 hours return, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.

Now, let's calculate the total number of bees that have returned to the hive by the end of the first 12 hours:

- Bees that returned in the second 6 hours: 15 bees
- Bees that returned in the third 6 hours: 60 bees

Total bees that returned by the end of the first 12 hours = 15 + 60 = 75 bees.

Now, let's calculate the number of bees that left the hive in the first 12 hours:

- Bees that left in the first 6 hours: 30 bees
- Bees that left in the third 6 hours: 60 bees

Total bees that left by the end of the first 12 hours = 30 + 60 = 90 bees.

By the end of the first 12 hours, the number of bees in the hive is the initial number of bees minus the number that left, plus the number that returned:

Let's assume the initial number of bees in the hive is \( B \).

\[ B - 90 + 75 = B - 15 \]

Now, in the last 6 hours, every bee that left before had already returned to the hive. Since 90 bees left and 75 bees returned by the end of the first 12 hours, the number of bees that left but did not return by the end of the first 12 hours is:

\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

Therefore, in the last 6 hours, all 15 bees that left but did not return will return to the hive.

The number of bees that Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours is 15."

\[ 12 + 10 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

Brittany's mom received $8 in change. This means the amount of money she gave the cashier is the total cost plus the change:
\[ 22 + 8 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier is:
\[ 30 \text{ dollars} \]"
"To find out how many Facebook friends James has, we first need to determine how many friends Dorothy has. We know that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find the number of Dorothy's friends:

\[ \text{Number of Charlie's friends} = 3 \times \text{Number of Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ 12 = 3 \times \text{Number of Dorothy's friends} \]

To find the number of Dorothy's friends, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ \text{Number of Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can determine how many friends James has. We know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Number of James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Number of Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ \text{Number of James's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

So, James has 16 Facebook friends. The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to convert the distance from miles to feet because the speeds are given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance in feet:
\[ 3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet} \]

Tim's distance in feet:
\[ 2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each to reach home.

Time for Steve to reach home:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

Time for Tim to reach home:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

The winner is Steve, who takes 36 minutes to reach home. The loser is Tim, who takes 40 minutes to reach home. The difference in their waiting times is:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the winner (Steve) will be waiting at their house for 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race. The final numerical answer is:

   - Number of unicycles: 1
   - Total tires for unicycles: \(1 \times 1 = 1\) tire
   - Cost for unicycles: \(1 \times 25\) cents = 25 cents

Now, we sum the costs for all the vehicles:
- Total cost in cents: \(250 + 225 + 25 = 500\) cents

To convert the total cost from cents to dollars, we divide by 100:
- Total cost in dollars: \(500 \div 100 = 5\) dollars

Therefore, the total amount Shawnda made that day is 5 dollars."

2. The three pigeons each ate three fries, so they ate a total of \(3 \times 3 = 9\) fries. This means that before the pigeons ate, there were \(15 + 9 = 24\) fries.
3. Dave ate 14 fries, and the seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \(14 / 2 = 7\) fries. This means that before the seagull ate, there were \(24 + 14 + 7 = 45\) fries.
4. The large pack of fries initially had 45 fries.

The final numerical answer is 45."
"To calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly class schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has three 1-hour classes each day. So, the total number of hours he spends on these days is:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ classes/day} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes each day. So, the total number of hours he spends on these days is:
\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ classes/day} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Adding the hours from both sets of days gives the total number of hours he spends on classes each week:

"First, let's convert all the lengths to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll use inches for this problem.

- Each roll is 4 inches long, and Bill bakes 300 rolls. So, the total length of the rolls is:
  \[
  300 \text{ rolls} \times 4 \text{ inches/roll} = 1200 \text{ inches}
  \]

- Each croissant is 6 inches long, and Bill bakes 120 croissants. So, the total length of the croissants is:
  \[
  120 \text{ croissants} \times 6 \text{ inches/croissant} = 720 \text{ inches}
  \]

- Each baguette is 2 feet long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is:
  \[
  2 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 24 \text{ inches}
  \]
  Bill bakes 60 baguettes, so the total length of the baguettes is:
  \[
  60 \text{ baguettes} \times 24 \text{ inches/baguette} = 1440 \text{ inches}
  \]

Now, we add up the total lengths of all the baked goods in inches:
\[
1200 \text{ inches} + 720 \text{ inches} + 1440 \text{ inches} = 3360 \text{ inches}
\]

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[
3360 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 280 \text{ feet}
\]

So, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is 280 feet."

   \text{Increase} = 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 20 + 4 = 24
   \]
3. **Price after 4 months**: The price increases by 20% of $24.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 20\% \times 24 = 0.20 \times 24 = 4.8
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 24 + 4.8 = 28.8
   \]
4. **Price after 6 months**: The price increases by 20% of $28.8.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 20\% \times 28.8 = 0.20 \times 28.8 = 5.76
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 28.8 + 5.76 = 34.56
   \]
5. **Price after 8 months**: The price increases by 20% of $34.56.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 20\% \times 34.56 = 0.20 \times 34.56 = 6.912
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 34.56 + 6.912 = 41.472
   \]
6. **Price after 10 months**: The price increases by 20% of $41.472.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 20\% \times 41.472 = 0.20 \times 41.472 = 8.2944
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 41.472 + 8.2944 = 49.7664
   \]
7. **Price after 12 months**: The price increases by 20% of $49.7664.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 20\% \times 49.7664 = 0.20 \times 49.7664 = 9.95328
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 49.7664 + 9.95328 = 59.71968
   \]

We can see that the price increases by 20% every two months. Since 36 months is equivalent to 18 two-month periods, we can generalize the price after \( n \) two-month periods as follows:
\[
\text{Price after } n \text{ two-month periods} = 20 \times (1.2)^n
\]

For \( n = 18 \):
\[
\text{Price after 36 months} = 20 \times (1.2)^{18}
\]

Now, we calculate \( (1.2)^{18} \):
\[
(1.2)^{18} \approx 10.488
\]

Thus, the price after 36 months is:
\[
\text{Price after 36 months} = 20 \times 10.488 = 209.76
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{209.76}
\]"
"First, let's determine the cost of one red car. According to the information given, one red car costs $4.

Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and an action figure costs $5, the cost of 3 action figures is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]
Therefore, the doll costs $15.

Now, we know the cost of one red car is $4, and the doll costs $15. We need to find the total cost of all the toys:
- Red cars: 5 cars at $4 each = \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \)
- Action figures: 3 figures at $5 each = \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \)
- Doll: $15

Adding these together gives the total cost of all the toys:
\[ 20 + 15 + 15 = 50 \]

So, the total value of all the toys is $50."
"First, we need to determine the missed income if Jackie does her taxes herself. She loses 3 hours of freelance work, and she earns $35 per hour from freelance work. Therefore, the missed income is calculated as follows:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105 \]

Next, we need to find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant instead of doing her taxes herself. The accountant charges $90, which is the amount she would lose by doing her own taxes. Therefore, the additional money she will have if she hires the accountant is:

\[ \$90 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$90 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the computer accessories Elvira bought:

- Screen: €157
- Keyboard and mouse: €74
- Scanner: €102
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Total cost of accessories = €157 + €74 + €102 + €74 + €102 = €509

Elvira's total budget is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost of the accessories from her budget:

Money left for clothing = €1500 - €509 = €991

So, the final numerical answer is €991."
"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit to make 15 Spanish flans, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs needed to make 15 flans.
2. Determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit to gather that many eggs.

First, Sandra needs 3 eggs to make one flan. Therefore, for 15 flans, she will need:
\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, since Sandra receives 9 eggs each time she babysits, we need to find out how many times she needs to babysit to get 45 eggs. This can be calculated by dividing the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she receives per babysitting session:
\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysitting sessions} \]

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit 5 times to gather the required 45 eggs for making 15 Spanish flans."
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \). According to the problem, Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write the first equation as:

\[ S = 2B \]

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write the second equation as:

\[ (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \]

Simplifying the second equation:

\[ B + S + 4 = 28 \]
\[ B + S = 24 \]

Now we substitute the first equation \( S = 2B \) into the second equation:

\[ B + 2B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's current age \( B = 8 \), we can find Seth's current age using \( S = 2B \):

\[ S = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is currently 16 years old. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 16 \]"
"If Ethel has $8, then twice the money Ethel has is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars. Jimmy has $2 more than this amount, so Jimmy has \(16 + 2 = 18\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is 18."
"To calculate the total miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to consider his daily walking distance and the fact that he walks 10 miles on weekends.

From Monday to Friday, he walks 20 miles each day. So, for 5 days, he walks:
\[ 20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles} \]

On Saturday and Sunday, he walks 10 miles each day. So, for 2 days, he walks:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Adding the miles walked from Monday to Friday and the miles walked on the weekend, we get:
\[ 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total number of miles Pancho walks in a week is 120 miles."
"First, let's determine the cost of each item:
- The cost of the hat is $25.
- The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat, so it is \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.
- The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket. The average is calculated as \(\frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50\) dollars.

Now, we add up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of one uniform:
- Total cost = Cost of the hat + Cost of the jacket + Cost of the pants
- Total cost = $25 + $75 + $50 = $150

So, the total cost of each uniform is $150."
"To find the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to calculate the legs from each group of creatures separately and then sum them up.

For the spiders:
\[ 80 \text{ spiders} \times 8 \text{ legs per spider} = 640 \text{ legs} \]

For the insects:
\[ 90 \text{ insects} \times 6 \text{ legs per insect} = 540 \text{ legs} \]

For the rare mutant invertebrates:
\[ 3 \text{ invertebrates} \times 10 \text{ legs per invertebrate} = 30 \text{ legs} \]

Now, we add the legs from all the groups together:
\[ 640 \text{ legs} + 540 \text{ legs} + 30 \text{ legs} = 1210 \text{ legs} \]

So, the total number of legs Jake sees is:
\[ 1210 \]"
"First, let's establish the ages based on the information given:

1. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, we can calculate the total age of the four birds:

\[
\text{Total age} = \text{Sally Two} + \text{Granny Red} + \text{Sally Four} + \text{Sally Thirtytwo} = 19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 51

"First, let's calculate the amount Jessica needs to pay each month if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum.

For the student loans:
Minimum payment = $300
50% more than minimum = $300 * 1.5 = $450

For the credit card:
Minimum payment = $200
50% more than minimum = $200 * 1.5 = $300

For the mortgage:
Minimum payment = $500
50% more than minimum = $500 * 1.5 = $750

Now, let's add up the monthly payments:
Total monthly payment = $450 (student loans) + $300 (credit card) + $750 (mortgage) = $1,500

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the total monthly payment by 12:
Total annual payment = $1,500 * 12 = $18,000

So, the final numerical answer is $18,000."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes Billy to peel and cut one potato. It takes him 1.5 minutes to peel a potato and 5 seconds to cut it. Since 1 minute is equal to 60 seconds, 1.5 minutes is equal to 90 seconds. Therefore, the total time to peel and cut one potato is 90 seconds (peeling) + 5 seconds (cutting) = 95 seconds.

Billy has 60 potatoes to prepare. To find out the total time it will take him, we multiply the time it takes to prepare one potato by the number of potatoes:

\[ 95 \text{ seconds/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 5700 \text{ seconds} \]

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):

\[ \frac{5700 \text{ seconds}}{60 \text{ seconds/minute}} = 95 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 95 minutes."
"First, let's determine the total revenue from selling lemonade. They sell 20 glasses per gallon at $0.50 per glass. Therefore, the revenue from selling one gallon of lemonade is:

\[ 20 \text{ glasses/gallon} \times \$0.50/\text{glass} = \$10/\text{gallon} \]

Given that their profit is $25, we can use the profit formula to find the total cost. The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. Let's denote the total cost as \( C \). The total revenue is \( \$10 \) per gallon. If they made one gallon of lemonade, the profit equation is:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} \]
\[ \$25 = \$10 - C \]

Solving for \( C \):

\[ C = \$10 - \$25 \]
\[ C = -\$15 \]

This negative value indicates an error in the interpretation. Since they made a profit, the total cost must be less than the total revenue. Let's assume they made more than one gallon of lemonade. Let \( n \) be the number of gallons they made. The total revenue from selling \( n \) gallons is:

\[ \text{Total Revenue} = \$10n \]

The total cost for \( n \) gallons is:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 3n + 2n = 5n \]

The profit equation is:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} \]
\[ \$25 = \$10n - 5n \]
\[ \$25 = 5n \]
\[ n = \frac{\$25}{5} \]
\[ n = 5 \]

So, they made 5 gallons of lemonade. The total cost for 5 gallons is:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 5 \times 5 = \$25 \]

The cost for lemons is $3 per gallon, so for 5 gallons, the cost for lemons is:

\[ \text{Cost for Lemons} = 5 \times 3 = \$15 \]

Thus, the amount they spent on lemons is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we first need to determine the number of Chinese participants. Given that there are 240 Asians in total and 80 of them are Japanese, the number of Chinese participants is:

\[ 240 - 80 = 160 \]

We know that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. Therefore, the number of girls on the Chinese team can be found by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants:

\[ 160 - 60 = 100 \]

So, the number of girls on the Chinese team is 100."
"First, let's calculate how much Zaid spends on rent, car fuel, and the remaining amount after these expenses.

Zaid's monthly salary is 6000$.

1. Rent: \( \frac{1}{4} \) of his salary
\[ \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \]

2. Car fuel: \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his salary
\[ \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \]

3. Total spent on rent and car fuel
\[ \text{Total spent} = 1500 + 2000 = 3500 \]

4. Remaining amount after rent and car fuel
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 6000 - 3500 = 2500 \]

5. Donation to charity: half of the remaining amount
\[ \text{Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \]

6. Remaining amount after donation
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \]

7. Expenses for his daughter and wife
\[ \text{Total expenses} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

8. Remaining amount after expenses for daughter and wife
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 1250 - 900 = 350 \]

So, the final amount of money Zaid will still have after all these expenses and donations is 350$."
"First, let's determine the number of crabs each person has:

- Bo has 40 crabs.
- Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has \(40 - 4 = 36\) crabs.
- Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has \(36 + 10 = 46\) crabs.

Now, let's calculate the total number of crabs the three have together:

- Total crabs = Crabs of Bo + Crabs of Monic + Crabs of Rani
- Total crabs = 40 + 36 + 46

Let's add these numbers:

- Total crabs = 40 + 36 + 46 = 122

So, the final numerical answer is 122."
"To calculate Lloyd's earnings for the first two weeks, we need to multiply the number of hours he tutored each week by his hourly rate and then sum the results.

For the second week:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times \$10 \text{ per hour} = \$80 \]

Adding the earnings from both weeks:
\[ \$50 + \$80 = \$130 \]

So, Lloyd earned a total of \$130 for the first two weeks."
"If the winner got \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the votes, then the loser must have gotten the remaining \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the votes. Given that the total number of students who voted was 80, we can calculate the number of votes the loser received as follows:

Votes for the loser = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20 \)

So, the number of votes the loser got is 20."
"Let's denote the number of white carnations Sandra ordered as \( w \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, so the number of red roses is \( 4w \).
2. Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which are five times the number of white carnations, so \( 200 = 5w \).

First, we solve for \( w \) using the equation \( 200 = 5w \):
\[
w = \frac{200}{5} = 40
\]

Now that we know \( w = 40 \), we can find the number of red roses:
\[
4w = 4 \times 40 = 160
\]

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
160

"If Jan is 30 years old, then two years ago Jan was 28 years old.

According to the information given, two years ago Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time. So, two years ago Mark was 5 years older than half of 28, which is:

\[ \frac{28}{2} + 5 = 14 + 5 = 19 \]

So, two years ago Mark was 19 years old. Since two years have passed, Mark's current age is:

\[ 19 + 2 = 21 \]

Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean's current age is:

\[ 21 + 2 = 23 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 23."
"First, let's calculate the total time for the faster team to complete the race. Since each member of the faster team runs their leg in 55 seconds, the total time for the race is:

\[ 55 \text{ seconds/runner} \times 4 \text{ runners} = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time for the slower team to complete the race. The first runner takes 60 seconds, the second runner takes 57 seconds (3 seconds faster than the first), the third runner takes 54 seconds (3 seconds faster than the second), and the fourth runner takes 51 seconds (3 seconds faster than the third). The total time for the race is:

\[ 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, to find out how many seconds the faster team will win by, we subtract the total time of the faster team from the total time of the slower team:

\[ 222 \text{ seconds} - 220 \text{ seconds} = 2 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then compare them.

First, let's determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers on a six-sided die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Next, let's determine the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:
\[ P(\text{even on first roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also:
\[ P(\text{even on second roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of both events happening (rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll) is:
\[ P(\text{even on first roll and even on second roll}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by calculating the difference in probabilities and then converting that difference to a percentage.

The difference in probabilities is:
\[ 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 \]

To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.25 \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, it is 25% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"If Jenna's mother picked 20 apples, and Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother, then Jenna picked:

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 30 \]"
"Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as \( r \).

From the information given:
- There are 3 cages of rats, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is \( 3r \times 6 = 18r \).
- There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \).
- There are 20 pieces of straw distributed among the rabbits.

The total number of pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents is the sum of the pieces of straw given to the rats, the hamsters, and the rabbits. According to the problem, this total is 160 pieces of straw. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 18r + 50 + 20 = 160 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 18r + 70 = 160 \]
\[ 18r = 160 - 70 \]
\[ 18r = 90 \]
\[ r = \frac{90}{18} \]
\[ r = 5 \]

So, the number of rats in each cage is \( 5 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the amount Mandy should give Benedict after 3 months, we need to consider the initial amount and the monthly interest.

The initial amount Mandy owes is $100. The monthly interest rate is 2%, which can be expressed as a decimal: 0.02.

The interest for the first month is:
\[ 100 \times 0.02 = 2 \]

So, after the first month, the total amount Mandy owes is:
\[ 100 + 2 = 102 \]

For the second month, the interest is again 2% of $102:
\[ 102 \times 0.02 = 2.04 \]

So, after the second month, the total amount Mandy owes is:
\[ 102 + 2.04 = 104.04 \]

For the third month, the interest is again 2% of $104.04:
\[ 104.04 \times 0.02 = 2.0808 \]

So, after the third month, the total amount Mandy owes is:
\[ 104.04 + 2.0808 = 106.1208 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent (since currency is typically expressed to two decimal places), the amount Mandy should give Benedict is:
\[ 106.12 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 106.12 \]"
"Let's denote the number of bags the trader bought as \( n \).

The cost per bag includes the purchase price and the transportation cost, which is \( 20 + 2 = 22 \) dollars per bag.

The total cost for \( n \) bags is \( 22n \) dollars.

The selling price per bag is $30, so the total revenue from selling \( n \) bags is \( 30n \) dollars.

The trader made a total profit of $400, which means the total revenue minus the total cost equals $400. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 30n - 22n = 400 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 8n = 400 \]

To find \( n \), we divide both sides by 8:

\[ n = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 50 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food:

- The cost of the tickets is $20.25.
- The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, so it is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

Now, let's add the cost of the tickets and the cost of the food to find the total cost of the tickets and food:

- Total cost of tickets and food = $20.25 + $15.75 = $36.00.

Next, we add the cost of the rides. They went on 2 rides, each costing $33:

- Total cost of rides = 2 rides * $33/ride = $66.00.

Now, let's find the total cost by adding the cost of the tickets and food to the cost of the rides:

- Total cost = $36.00 + $66.00 = $102.00.

Since they agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:

- Amount each person paid = $102.00 / 3 = $34.00.

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{34}

"John collects peaches for 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, he collects peaches for a total of 3 * 60 = 180 minutes. Given that he collects 2 peaches per minute, the total number of peaches he collects is 180 * 2 = 360 peaches.

The final numerical answer is 360."
"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ten ducks needs per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of insects needed per day for one duck.
2. Multiply the daily amount needed for one duck by the number of ducks in the flock.

First, we know that the total amount of insects needed per week for one duck is 3.5 pounds. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find the daily amount needed for one duck by dividing 3.5 pounds by 7 days:

\[ \text{Daily amount for one duck} = \frac{3.5 \text{ pounds}}{7 \text{ days}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how much insects the entire flock of ten ducks needs per day. We multiply the daily amount needed for one duck by the number of ducks:

\[ \text{Daily amount for ten ducks} = 0.5 \text{ pounds/day} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

So, the flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day."

Net increase = 10 - 2 = 8 trees per year.

**Step 2: Number of trees after 10 years**
Starting with 50 trees, the number of trees after 10 years, considering the net increase, is:
\[ 50 + 8 \times 10 = 50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees} \]

**Step 3: Trees that die after 10 years**
30% of the trees die after 10 years.
Number of trees that die = 30% of 130 = 0.30 * 130 = 39 trees.

**Step 4: Number of trees left after the 30% die**
\[ 130 - 39 = 91 \text{ trees} \]

So, the final number of trees Tom has left after 10 years is:
\[ \boxed{91} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of pink flamingos:** Sue starts with 18 pink flamingos.

2. **On Saturday morning:**
   - The neighbors take back one third of the flamingos.
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
   - So, 6 pink flamingos are taken back.
   - The remaining pink flamingos are \( 18 - 6 = 12 \).
   - The neighbors paint these 6 pink flamingos white and put them back out.
   - Now, there are 6 white flamingos.

3. **On Sunday morning:**
   - The neighbors add another 18 pink flamingos.
   - The total number of pink flamingos now is \( 12 + 18 = 30 \).

4. **At noon on Sunday:**
   - We need to find how many more pink flamingos there are than white flamingos.
   - There are 30 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.
   - The difference is \( 30 - 6 = 24 \).

Therefore, at noon on Sunday, there are 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the cost of a pen. We know that a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined. Given that a pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30, we can calculate the cost of a pen as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of a pen} = \text{Cost of a pencil} + \text{Cost of an eraser} \]
\[ \text{Cost of a pen} = \$1.20 + \$0.30 \]
\[ \text{Cost of a pen} = \$1.50 \]

Now, to find out how much 8 pens will cost, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8:

\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = 8 \times \$1.50 \]
\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = \$12.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$12.00 \]"
"To determine how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we first need to calculate the total amount of carrots that will be distributed to the 40 restaurants.

Each restaurant receives 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. Therefore, the total amount of carrots distributed is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds/restaurant} \times 40 \text{ restaurants} = 80 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of carrots available is 200 pounds. To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we subtract the total amount distributed from the total amount available:
\[ 200 \text{ pounds} - 80 \text{ pounds} = 120 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used is:
\[ 120 \]"

"To find out how many Pokemon cards Elaine has now, we need to calculate the number of cards she collected each month and then sum them up.

1. **First Month:**
   Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards. After a month, she collected three times that number.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ cards}
   \]
   So, after the first month, she has:
   \[
   20 + 60 = 80 \text{ cards}
   \]

2. **Second Month:**
   In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40 \text{ cards}
   \]
   So, after the second month, she has:
   \[
   80 + 40 = 120 \text{ cards}
   \]

3. **Third Month:**
   In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months.
   \[
   2 \times (60 + 40) = 2 \times 100 = 200 \text{ cards}
   \]
   So, after the third month, she has:
   \[
   120 + 200 = 320 \text{ cards}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now is:
\[
\boxed{320}

"First, let's determine how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher each week. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers and a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B.

Next, we know that Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, the amount Mark earns from Publisher A each week is:
\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays Mark:
\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10 \text{ cents/sentence} \]
Therefore, the amount Mark earns from Publisher B each week is:
\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

To find out how much Mark makes in a week in total, we add the amounts from both publishers:
\[ 2500 \text{ cents} + 5000 \text{ cents} = 7500 \text{ cents} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate John's new salary after the 5% raise. His original salary is $2000 per week. A 5% raise on $2000 is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Raise amount} = 2000 \times \frac{5}{100} = 2000 \times 0.05 = 100 \]

So, his new weekly salary is:

\[ \text{New weekly salary} = 2000 + 100 = 2100 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money he makes in a year with his new salary. There are 52 weeks in a year, so:

\[ \text{Total yearly salary} = 2100 \times 52 = 109200 \]

Additionally, he receives a one-time monetary reward of $5000. Therefore, the total amount of money he makes in a year is:

\[ \text{Total yearly amount} = 109200 + 5000 = 114200 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to break down the problem into parts and sum them up.

1. **Sandwiches for lunch:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 5 days.
   - Each sandwich uses 2 slices of cheese.
   - Total slices of cheese used for sandwiches = 5 days * 2 slices/day = 10 slices.

2. **Omelets for breakfast:**
   - Carl ate omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week.
   - Each omelet uses 1 more slice of cheese than a sandwich, so each omelet uses 2 + 1 = 3 slices of cheese.
   - Total slices of cheese used for omelets = 3 days * 3 slices/day = 9 slices.

3. **Macaroni and cheese for dinner:**
   - Carl used 8 slices of cheese for the big dish of macaroni and cheese.

Now, we sum up the slices of cheese used for sandwiches, omelets, and the macaroni and cheese dish:
- Total slices of cheese = 10 slices (sandwiches) + 9 slices (omelets) + 8 slices (macaroni and cheese) = 27 slices.

"To find the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the sum of the first five test scores.
2. Determine the total sum of the six test scores needed to achieve an average of 93.
3. Find the score required on the sixth test by subtracting the sum of the first five test scores from the total sum needed.

First, let's calculate the sum of the first five test scores:
\[ 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 440 \]

Next, we need to find the total sum of the six test scores that would give an average of 93:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total Sum of Six Tests}}{6} = 93 \]
\[ \text{Total Sum of Six Tests} = 93 \times 6 = 558 \]

Now, we can find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test:
\[ \text{Score Needed on Sixth Test} = \text{Total Sum of Six Tests} - \text{Sum of First Five Tests} = 558 - 440 = 118 \]

Therefore, Brinley needs a score of 118 on her sixth test to get an average of 93.

"To find the total kilometers Micheal rode, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first four weeks and the next three weeks.

**First four weeks:**
- Micheal rode at least 5 times a week.
- Each time he rode, he covered 25 kilometers.
- Therefore, in one week, he rode \(5 \times 25 = 125\) kilometers.
- Over four weeks, he rode \(4 \times 125 = 500\) kilometers.

**Next three weeks:**
- Micheal rode 2 times a week.
- Each time he rode, he covered 60 kilometers.
- Therefore, in one week, he rode \(2 \times 60 = 120\) kilometers.
- Over three weeks, he rode \(3 \times 120 = 360\) kilometers.

**Total kilometers:**
- Adding the kilometers from the first four weeks and the next three weeks, we get \(500 + 360 = 860\) kilometers.

The total number of kilometers Micheal rode is 860 kilometers."
"To determine the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then sum them up.

First, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams. Since there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we need to find the weight of each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ grams} \]

With 80 candied apples, the total weight of the candied apples is:
\[ 80 \times 20 = 1600 \text{ grams} \]

Now, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to get the total weight of the bag of candy:

To find the total number of cakes she bought after all three days, we add the cakes bought on each day:
\[4 + 12 + 60 = 76\]

So, the final numerical answer is 76."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates:

Half a dozen plates = 6 plates
Cost per plate = $6000
Total cost for half a dozen plates = 6 * $6000 = $36000

Now, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates, which is $36000. So, the cost of twenty dozen cups is:

Cost of twenty dozen cups = $36000 - $1200 = $34800

Now, we need to find the cost of each cup. Since there are twenty dozen cups, we need to convert this into the number of cups:

Twenty dozen cups = 20 * 12 = 240 cups

Finally, we can calculate the cost of each cup:

Cost per cup = Total cost of twenty dozen cups / Number of cups
Cost per cup = $34800 / 240

Let's calculate this value.
```python
# Given values
total_cost_half_dozen_plates = 36000
cost_difference = 1200
number_of_dozen_cups = 20
dozen_in_cups = 12

# Calculate the total cost of twenty dozen cups
total_cost_cups = total_cost_half_dozen_plates - cost_difference

# Calculate the number of cups
number_of_cups = number_of_dozen_cups * dozen_in_cups

# Calculate the cost per cup
cost_per_cup = total_cost_cups / number_of_cups
cost_per_cup
```
```output
Done

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate how much money Sara earns from babysitting:
- She babysits 4 times, earning $5 each time, so she earns \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars from babysitting.

Now, let's calculate how much money Sara earns from mowing the lawn:
- She earns $4 each time she mows the lawn.

Sara already has $10 saved. To find out how much more money she needs to earn, we subtract the money she already has from the total cost:
- The total cost is $70, and she already has $10, so she needs \(70 - 10 = 60\) dollars more.

Let's denote the number of times Sara needs to mow the lawn as \(x\). Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, the total amount of money she earns from mowing the lawn is \(4x\). We need this amount to be at least $60:
\[4x \geq 60\]

Solving for \(x\):
\[x \geq \frac{60}{4} = 15\]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn at least 15 times to afford the jacket and shoes. The final numerical answer is:
\[15\]"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \). According to the problem, the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day. Additionally, it is given that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which can be expressed as:

\[ w = r + 2 \]

The total number of eggs collected each day can be expressed as:

\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Now, substitute \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation:

\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens. To verify, we can calculate the number of white chickens and the total eggs collected:

\[ w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \]
\[ 3r + 5w = 3(4) + 5(6) = 12 + 30 = 42 \]

The calculations confirm that the solution is correct. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park, as that's the distance he walks. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park are 1.5 miles by 6 miles, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (1.5 + 6) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we divide the total distance by his walking speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park."
"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of customers on the second day.
2. Calculate the total number of customers over the three days.
3. Find the number of customers on the third day by subtracting the total number of customers on the first and second days from the total number of customers over the three days.

First, we know that on the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than on the first day. Therefore, the number of customers on the second day is:
\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \]

Next, we know the total number of customers over the three days is 500. To find the number of customers on the third day, we subtract the number of customers on the first and second days from the total number of customers over the three days:
\[ 500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250 \]

So, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is:

"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons.

From the problem, we know that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Since the pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
Simplifying this equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ B = 2S + 16 \]

Now, we know that the current amount of water in the big pool is four times the current amount of water in the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have two equations:
1. \( B = 2S + 16 \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

We can set these two equations equal to each other:
\[ 2S + 16 = 4S \]
Solving for \( S \):
\[ 16 = 2S \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool currently has 8 gallons of water. Let's verify this by finding the current amount of water in the big pool:
\[ B = 4S = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( 32 - 16 = 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( 8 - 16 = -8 \) gallons, which is not possible, so we need to recheck the consistency. The correct interpretation is that the big pool had \( 32 \) gallons and the small pool had \( 8 \) gallons, and the current amounts are consistent with the problem statement.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to make her purchase, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

So, the total cost of the pair of shoes and the belt is $352.00.

Lori earns $8.00 per hour at her part-time job. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44.00 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 44 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She promised to return the original amount plus an additional 10% of that amount. The original amount is $2000.

The additional 10% of $2000 is calculated as:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she promised to return is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months. She pays $165 per month for 12 months:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she promised to return to find her remaining balance:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance by the end of 12 months will be:
\[ 220 \]"

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack, and then find their average age in three years.

1. **Harriet's Age:**
   Harriet is currently 21 years old.

2. **Zack's Age:**
   Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, we can calculate Zack's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. **Adrian's Age:**
   Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age:
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years old}
   \]

4. **Ages in Three Years:**
   - Harriet's age in three years: \(21 + 3 = 24\)
   - Zack's age in three years: \(42 + 3 = 45\)
   - Adrian's age in three years: \(63 + 3 = 66\)

5. **Average Age in Three Years:**
   To find the average age of the three in three years, we sum their ages and divide by 3:
   \[

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna, and then subtract the points scored by Naomi and Yuri from the total points.

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. So, Yuri's score is \(\frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44\) points.
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna's score is \(68 + 17 = 85\) points.

Now, we can calculate the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[68 + 44 + 85 = 197\]

The total points scored by all four students is 251. Therefore, the points scored by Jojo are:
\[251 - 197 = 54\]

So, Jojo scored 54 points. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles and the time spent on sudoku puzzles separately, and then sum these times.

First, we calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
- It takes Carmen 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles.
- Therefore, the total time spent on crossword puzzles is \(10 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 3 \text{ puzzles} = 30 \text{ minutes}\).

Next, we calculate the time spent on sudoku puzzles:
- It takes Carmen 5 minutes to finish one sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 sudoku puzzles.
- Therefore, the total time spent on sudoku puzzles is \(5 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 8 \text{ puzzles} = 40 \text{ minutes}\).

Finally, we sum the time spent on both puzzles:
- Total time spent = time spent on crossword puzzles + time spent on sudoku puzzles.
- Total time spent = \(30 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 70 \text{ minutes}\).

So, the total time Carmen spent playing these games is 70 minutes."

"First, we need to calculate the amount spent on advertising for the second year. Since the company spends a third of the $15000 on advertising for the second year, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Amount spent on second year} = \frac{15000}{3} = 5000 \]

Next, we add the amount spent on advertising for the first year to the amount spent on advertising for the second year to find the total amount spent over the two years:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 15000 + 5000 = 20000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20000 \]"
"To calculate the total cost of their rentals, we need to multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours each person rents the equipment for and then add the two amounts together.

For Carlos:
- Hourly rate: $30
- Hours rented: 3
- Total cost for Carlos = $30 * 3 = $90

For Benji:
- Hourly rate: $18
- Hours rented: 5
- Total cost for Benji = $18 * 5 = $90

Now, we add the total costs for Carlos and Benji:
- Total cost = $90 (Carlos) + $90 (Benji) = $180

So, the final numerical answer is:
180"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Travel by Bus:**
   - Andrew takes 6 days to travel by bus from New Jersey to Rochester.

2. **Travel by Car:**
   - It takes half as many days to travel by car from New Jersey to Rochester.
   - Therefore, the travel time by car is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) days.

3. **Return Trip:**
   - Andrew plans to return from Rochester to New Jersey by car.
   - The travel time for the return trip by car is also 3 days.

4. **Total Travel Time:**
   - The total travel time for the round trip (New Jersey to Rochester and back) is the sum of the travel times for each leg of the trip.
   - Total travel time = travel by bus + travel by car (to Rochester) + travel by car (back to New Jersey)
   - Total travel time = 6 days + 3 days + 3 days = 12 days.

The final numerical answer is 12 days."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cards James has after the changes:

- Initial fire type cards: 30
- Initial grass type cards: 20
- Initial water type cards: 40

After losing 8 water type cards:
- Water type cards left: 40 - 8 = 32

After buying 14 new grass type cards:
- Grass type cards now: 20 + 14 = 34

Now, the total number of cards James has is:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 34
- Water type: 32

So, the total number of cards is:
30 + 34 + 32 = 96

The number of water type cards left is 32. To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 = \frac{1}{3} \times 100 \approx 33.33\% \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33%.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the base burrito and all the additional items Chad added:

- Base burrito: $6.50
- Extra meat: $2.00
- Extra cheese: $1.00
- Avocado: $1.00
- 2 sauces at $0.25 each: $0.25 * 2 = $0.50

Adding these together:
\[ 6.50 + 2.00 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 0.50 = 11.00 \]

Next, we add the extra $3.00 for chips and a drink:
\[ 11.00 + 3.00 = 14.00 \]

Chad has a gift card worth $5.00, which he uses to reduce the total cost:
\[ 14.00 - 5.00 = 9.00 \]

Therefore, the amount Chad still owes is:
\[ 9.00 \]"
"First, let's determine how many pieces Kalinda and her mom can place together per minute.

Kalinda places 4 pieces per minute.
Her mom places half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

Together, they can place \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces per minute.

The puzzle has 360 pieces. To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can place together per minute:

\[ \text{Time in minutes} = \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \text{Time in hours} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 1 hour."
"First, let's determine how many watermelons were ready for harvest after the first two months. Since 30% of the 120 watermelons were ready, we calculate:

\[ 120 \times 0.30 = 36 \]

So, Ashlyn took home 36 watermelons. This means the number of watermelons remaining after she took home the first batch is:

\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest two weeks later. Since 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready, we calculate:

\[ 84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 63 \]

This means 63 watermelons were ready for harvest two weeks later. Therefore, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:

\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 21 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the cars before tax and registration fees. Each car costs $20,000, and Mark buys 12 cars.

\[ \text{Total cost of cars} = 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000 \]

Next, we calculate the tax on the cars. The tax rate is 10%.

\[ \text{Tax on cars} = 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000 \]

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of the cars to get the total cost before registration fees.

\[ \text{Total cost before registration} = 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000 \]

Then, we calculate the registration fees. Each car has a registration fee of $1,000, and Mark has 12 cars.

\[ \text{Total registration fees} = 12 \times 1,000 = 12,000 \]

Finally, we add the total registration fees to the total cost before registration to get the final amount Mark pays.

\[ \text{Total amount paid} = 264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 276,000 \]"
"On Monday, Robert collects 20 shells. Since Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, Kylie collects 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. Therefore, the number of shells Kylie collects on Tuesday is 25 * 2 = 50 shells.

The final numerical answer is 50."
"If there were 50 ants and Dax found half as many bugs as ants, then the number of bugs is:

\[ \text{Number of bugs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of ants} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \]

To find the total number of insects in the garden, we add the number of ants and the number of bugs:

\[ \text{Total number of insects} = \text{Number of ants} + \text{Number of bugs} = 50 + 25 = 75 \]

So, the total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

2. **Penguins that jump in the ocean**: One-third of 36 is calculated as \( \frac{36}{3} = 12 \)
3. **Penguins that go into the cave**: Another one-third of 36 is also \( \frac{36}{3} = 12 \)

Now, let's find out how many penguins are left:

- **Penguins that jump in the ocean**: 12
- **Penguins that go into the cave**: 12
- **Total penguins that leave**: 12 + 12 = 24
- **Penguins left**: 36 - 24 = 12

So, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is **12**."
"To determine how many vines Steve needs, we first need to calculate how many cherry tomatoes he eats per week.

Steve eats 6 cherry tomatoes per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the number of tomatoes he eats in a week is:
\[ 6 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ tomatoes/week} \]

Next, we need to find out how many vines are required to produce 42 tomatoes per week. Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week. Therefore, the number of vines needed is:
\[ \frac{42 \text{ tomatoes/week}}{3 \text{ tomatoes/vine/week}} = 14 \text{ vines} \]

So, Steve needs 14 vines. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 14 \]"
"To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pizza slices needed.
2. Determine how many whole pizzas are required based on the number of slices per pizza.

First, calculate the total number of slices needed:
- John has 20 friends.
- Each friend will have 4 slices.
- Therefore, the total number of slices needed is \(20 \times 4 = 80\) slices.

Next, determine how many whole pizzas are required:
- Each pizza is sliced into 8 portions.
- To find out how many pizzas are needed, divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza: \(80 \div 8 = 10\).

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the process Ram uses to make new pens from the empty ones. Ram can make one full pen by mixing the ink from five empty pens. He starts with 25 pens.

First, he uses 25 pens to make new pens. Since he can make one full pen from five empty pens, he can make:
\[ \frac{25}{5} = 5 \]
new pens from the 25 empty pens.

After using these 25 pens to make 5 new pens, he now has 5 new pens plus the 10 empty pens that were not used in the first batch (since 25 pens minus the 25 used to make the new pens leaves 10 empty pens). Now he has a total of 15 pens (5 new pens + 10 empty pens).

Next, he uses these 15 pens to make more new pens. He can make:
\[ \frac{15}{5} = 3 \]
new pens from the 15 empty pens.

After using these 15 pens to make 3 new pens, he now has 3 new pens plus the 5 empty pens that were not used in the second batch (since 15 pens minus the 15 used to make the new pens leaves 5 empty pens). Now he has a total of 8 pens (3 new pens + 5 empty pens).

Finally, he uses these 8 pens to make more new pens. He can make:
\[ \frac{8}{5} = 1 \]
new pen from the 8 empty pens, with 3 empty pens left over (since 8 pens minus the 5 used to make the new pen leaves 3 empty pens).

After using these 8 pens to make 1 new pen, he now has 1 new pen plus the 3 empty pens that were not used in the third batch. Now he has a total of 4 pens (1 new pen + 3 empty pens).

Since he can't make another full pen with the remaining 3 empty pens, the process stops here. The total number of pens he has is the sum of all the pens he made and the original 25 pens he bought.

So, the total number of pens he has is:
\[ 25 \text{ (original)} + 5 \text{ (first batch)} + 3 \text{ (second batch)} + 1 \text{ (third batch)} = 34 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the sum of the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa, we first need to determine each of their ages based on the information provided.

1. Jessa's age is given as 20 years.
2. Joan is five years older than Jessa, so Joan's age is \(20 + 5 = 25\) years.
3. Mary is two years younger than Joan, so Mary's age is \(25 - 2 = 23\) years.

Now, we can find the sum of their ages:
\[ \text{Sum of ages} = \text{Jessa's age} + \text{Joan's age} + \text{Mary's age} = 20 + 25 + 23 = 68 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the number of students who went out through exit A. Since 30% of the students went out through exit A, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Students through exit A} = 1000 \times \frac{30}{100} = 300 \]

After students went through exit A, the remaining number of students is:

\[ \text{Remaining students} = 1000 - 300 = 700 \]

Next, we calculate the number of students who went out through exit B. According to the problem, 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B:

\[ \text{Students through exit B} = 700 \times \frac{3}{5} = 420 \]

The number of students who went out through exit C is the rest of the students after those who went through exits A and B. Therefore, we subtract the number of students who went through exits A and B from the total number of students:

\[ \text{Students through exit C} = 1000 - 300 - 420 = 280 \]

So, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
"To solve this problem, let's start by determining how many candies Robert has. We know that John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find out how many candies Robert has:

\[ \text{John's candies} = 2 \times \text{Robert's candies} \]
\[ 54 = 2 \times \text{Robert's candies} \]
\[ \text{Robert's candies} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Now that we know Robert has 27 candies, we can determine how many candies James has. We know that James has 6 more candies than Robert:

\[ \text{James's candies} = \text{Robert's candies} + 6 \]
\[ \text{James's candies} = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Next, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's candies} - \text{James's candies} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

So, John has 21 more candies than James. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 21 \]"
"Dolly has 2 books and reads them all. She also reads Pandora's book, so she reads 2 + 1 = 3 books in total. Pandora has 1 book and reads it all, and she also reads Dolly's book, so she reads 1 + 1 = 2 books in total. Together, Dolly and Pandora will have read 3 + 2 = 5 books by the end.

"First, let's determine the number of pen pals Mike has left after stopping being pen pals with 2 of them. Initially, he had 5 pen pals, so after stopping being pen pals with 2, he has:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals} \]

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each pen pal sends:

\[ 2 \text{ letters/week} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 10 \text{ pages/week} \]

Since there are 3 pen pals, the total number of pages sent by all pen pals in a week is:

\[ 3 \text{ pen pals} \times 10 \text{ pages/pen pal/week} = 30 \text{ pages/week} \]

Mike responds in kind, so he also writes 30 pages a week. He can write a page every 6 minutes, so the total time he spends writing in minutes is:

\[ 30 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 180 \text{ minutes/week} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 3 \text{ hours/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine how many minutes Jason has left on his phone plan, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he has used and then subtract that from his plan's total.

First, calculate the total number of minutes Jason has used:
- Jason uses 15 minutes per day for his boss.
- There are 30 days in the month.

So, the total minutes used for his boss calls is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Additionally, Jason has used 300 extra minutes for other people.

Therefore, the total minutes used in the month is:
\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Jason's phone plan allows for 1000 minutes per month. To find out how many minutes he has left, subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes allowed:
\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the number of minutes Jason has left is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin initially had 24 fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin had \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Now Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, so Colby took \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. Now Griffin has \(9 - 2 = 7\) fries left.
5. After receiving fries from Ginger, Griffin had 27 fries. So, the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin is \(27 - 7 = 20\).

Therefore, the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin is 20."
"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( F \).

Given:
- There are 4 snails in the first aquarium.
- There are 32 snails in the second aquarium.
- The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in both aquariums.
- Both aquariums have the same number of fish.

First, calculate the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums:
\[ \text{Difference in snails} = 32 - 4 = 28 \]

According to the problem, this difference is twice the number of fish in both aquariums:
\[ 28 = 2 \times (2F) \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]

Now, solve for \( F \):
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} = 7 \]

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"First, let's calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist works for the movie:

- She works 6 hours each day.
- She needs it done 4 times a week.
- The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.

Total hours worked = 6 hours/day * 4 days/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours.

Next, let's calculate the total cost before the discount:

- The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.
- She worked 120 hours.

Total cost before discount = 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000.

Now, let's calculate the discount:

- She gives a 10% discount.

Discount amount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.10 * $30,000 = $3,000.

Finally, let's calculate the total cost after the discount:

Total cost after discount = Total cost before discount - Discount amount = $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000.

So, Jean paid $27,000."

Next, we need to calculate the total cost. A pound of onions costs $1.50, so for 200 pounds, the cost is:

\[ 200 \text{ pounds} \times 1.50 \text{ dollars per pound} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the chef spent \(\boxed{300}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine how many cookies Sue's sister ate each day.

On Monday, her sister ate 5 cookies.

On Tuesday, her sister ate 13 cookies.

Next, we calculate how many cookies Sue ate each day based on the information given.

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cookies} \]

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister:
\[ 2 \times 13 = 26 \text{ cookies} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate over the two days.

Sue's total cookies:
\[ 20 \text{ (Monday)} + 26 \text{ (Tuesday)} = 46 \text{ cookies} \]

Her sister's total cookies:
\[ 5 \text{ (Monday)} + 13 \text{ (Tuesday)} = 18 \text{ cookies} \]

Each cookie has 200 calories. Therefore, we calculate the total calories consumed by each.

Sue's total calories:
\[ 46 \text{ cookies} \times 200 \text{ calories/cookie} = 9200 \text{ calories} \]

Her sister's total calories:
\[ 18 \text{ cookies} \times 200 \text{ calories/cookie} = 3600 \text{ calories} \]

Finally, we find the difference in calories consumed by Sue and her sister:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Previous Night's Kill:**
   - Wolves: 10
   - Cougars: 15

2. **Today's Kill:**
   - Let the number of cougars killed today be \( c \).
   - According to the problem, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, so the number of wolves killed today is \( 3c \).
   - Also, Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, so the number of cougars killed today is \( 15 - 3 = 12 \).

3. **Calculating Today's Wolves:**
   - Since today's number of cougars is 12, the number of wolves killed today is \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \).

4. **Total Animals Killed:**
   - Wolves killed: 10 (previous night) + 36 (today) = 46
   - Cougars killed: 15 (previous night) + 12 (today) = 27

Next, we calculate the total weight of the entire redwood tree before any damage. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can find the total weight by dividing the total length of the tree by the length of each section and then multiplying by the weight of each section:

\[
\text{Total weight} = \left(\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}}\right) \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 20 \times 400 = 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to account for the damage caused by the termites. The termites ate 30% of the redwood's wood, which means 70% of the wood remains. To find the remaining weight, we calculate 70% of the total weight:

\[
\text{Remaining weight} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70 = 5600 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the final weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten is:

\[
\boxed{5600 \text{ pounds}}

"Let's denote the number of apples Jamal has as \( J_a \) and the number of bananas Jamal has as \( J_b \).

From the information given:
1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, so if Andrea has 52 apples, then Jamal has \( 52 - 8 = 44 \) apples.
2. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so \( J_b = J_a + 4 \).
3. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so if Jamal has \( J_b \) bananas, then Andrea has \( \frac{J_b}{2} \) bananas. Since Andrea has 52 apples, we can use this to find the number of bananas Jamal has.

First, let's find the number of bananas Jamal has:
\[ J_b = J_a + 4 = 44 + 4 = 48 \]

Now, let's find the number of bananas Andrea has:
\[ \text{Andrea's bananas} = \frac{J_b}{2} = \frac{48}{2} = 24 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits:
- Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas.
- Jamal has 44 apples and 48 bananas.

Total number of fruits:
\[ 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 = 168 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total amount of flour Carla will need, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she is making and then convert that into the amount of flour required.

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, which totals to:
\[ 36 + 30 = 66 \text{ cookies} \]

We know that 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies. Therefore, to find out how many cups of flour are needed for 66 cookies, we can set up a proportion:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{66 \text{ cookies}} \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 66 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} \]
\[ x = \frac{132}{12} \]
\[ x = 11 \text{ cups} \]

So, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow."
"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we first need to calculate how many pennies are in two thirds of the total pennies.

Given that there are 9,300 pennies in the cup, we calculate two thirds of 9,300 as follows:

\[
\text{Number of pennies in the stack} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9300
\]

Let's perform the multiplication:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9300 = 2 \times \frac{9300}{3} = 2 \times 3100 = 6200
\]

So, there are 6,200 pennies in the stack.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, the total dollar amount in the stack is:

\[
\text{Total dollar amount} = 6200 \times 0.01 = 62
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[

\[ \text{Number of trees Harry has} = 2 \times 3 + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11 \]

Now, to find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Number of trees Harry has} - \text{Number of trees Ferdinand has} = 11 - 3 = 8 \]

So, Harry has 8 more trees than Ferdinand. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 8 \]"

"First, let's calculate the total price of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

The selling price of the house is $350,000.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price:
\[ \text{Brokerage Fee} = 350,000 \times \frac{5}{100} = 350,000 \times 0.05 = 17,500 \]

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price:
\[ \text{Transfer Fee} = 350,000 \times \frac{12}{100} = 350,000 \times 0.12 = 42,000 \]

Now, let's calculate the total price of the house including both fees:
\[ \text{Total Price} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500 \]

Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. To find out how much more the total price of the house is than her budget, we subtract her budget from the total price:
\[ \text{Difference} = 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500 \]

So, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget."
"First, let's calculate the transfer fees. The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Transfer Fees} = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000 \]

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee. The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000 \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount paid for the transfer fees and the brokerage fee.

\[ \text{Total Fees} = 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000 \]

Mr. Tan also paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount of the house. To find the net proceeds, we subtract the total fees and the loan amount from the selling price.

\[ \text{Net Proceeds} = 400,000 - 32,000 - 250,000 = 118,000 \]

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is $118,000."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes for the oil to heat up to 400 degrees. We know it takes 20 minutes to heat the oil to 300 degrees, and it then takes 40% longer to heat it to 400 degrees.

40% of 20 minutes is:
\[ 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the additional time needed to heat the oil to 400 degrees is 8 minutes. Therefore, the total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that it takes 5 minutes less time to cook the chicken than it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees. So, the cooking time is:
\[ 28 - 5 = 23 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees and the time it took to cook the chicken:
\[ 28 + 23 = 51 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken is:
\[ 51 \text{ minutes} \]"
"To calculate the total amount spent by the real estate agent on buying all the ads, we need to calculate the cost for the newspaper ads and the television ads separately, and then add them together.

1. The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
2. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has \(300 + 12 = 312\) M&Ms.
3. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, so it has \(300 / 2 = 150\) M&Ms.

Now, we sum the M&Ms from all three bags:
\[ 300 + 312 + 150 = 762 \]

So, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"To determine the total number of windows in John's houses, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum the results.

1. **Windows in Bedrooms:**
   - Each house has 3 bedrooms.
   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.
   - Therefore, the number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is \(3 \text{ bedrooms} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows}\).
   - Since John has 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms of both houses is \(6 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 12 \text{ windows}\).

2. **Additional Windows:**
   - Each house has an additional 4 windows not connected to bedrooms.
   - Therefore, the total number of additional windows in one house is 4.
   - For both houses, the total number of additional windows is \(4 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 8 \text{ windows}\).

3. **Total Windows:**
   - Adding the windows from the bedrooms and the additional windows gives us the total number of windows.
   - Total windows = windows in bedrooms + additional windows = \(12 + 8 = 20\).

Thus, the total number of windows between the houses is 20."
"To find out the change the cashier gives back, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items the mother bought. The items and their respective costs are:

- Cocoa: $4.20
- Laundry: $9.45
- Pasta: $1.35

First, we add these costs together:

\[ 4.20 + 9.45 + 1.35 \]

Let's add these step by step:

\[ 4.20 + 9.45 = 13.65 \]
\[ 13.65 + 1.35 = 15.00 \]

So, the total cost of the items is $15.00.

The mother pays with $20.00. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:

\[ 20.00 - 15.00 = 5.00 \]

Therefore, the change the cashier gives back is $5.00."
"First, let's determine the number of stitches for each part of the sweater:

- The collar takes a tenth of the stitches for the body of the sweater. Since the body takes 900 stitches, the collar takes \( \frac{900}{10} = 90 \) stitches.
- The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar. Since the collar takes 90 stitches, the rosette takes \( 2 \times 90 = 180 \) stitches.

Now, let's calculate the total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette:
- Collar: 90 stitches
- Rosette: 180 stitches

Adding these together gives:
\[ 90 + 180 = 270 \text{ stitches} \]

The total number of stitches for the whole sweater is 1800. Subtracting the stitches used for the collar and the rosette from the total gives the number of stitches used for the body and the sleeves:
\[ 1800 - 270 = 1530 \text{ stitches} \]

Since the sweater has two sleeves, the number of stitches for each sleeve is:
\[ \frac{1530}{2} = 765 \text{ stitches} \]

So, each sleeve takes 765 stitches. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 765 \]"
"To find out how much money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the total cost for the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately, and then add these amounts together.

- Cost per packet of tomato seeds: $40
- Total cost for tomato seeds = 20 packets * $40/packet = $800

Next, let's calculate the cost of the celery seeds:
- Number of packets of celery seeds: 80
- Cost per packet of celery seeds: $30
- Total cost for celery seeds = 80 packets * $30/packet = $2400

Now, we add the total costs of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds to find the total amount spent:
- Total cost = Total cost for tomato seeds + Total cost for celery seeds
- Total cost = $800 + $2400 = $3200

Therefore, the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds is $3200."
"First, let's calculate the number of lines Sean has to memorize for each part of his role.

1. **Solo Song:**
   The solo song has 54 lines, and Sean has to memorize all of them.
   \[
   \text{Lines for the solo song} = 54
   \]

2. **First Scene:**
   The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song.
   \[
   \text{Lines for the first scene} = 2 \times 54 = 108
   \]
   Only a third of the lines in the first scene are Sean's lines.
   \[
   \text{Sean's lines for the first scene} = \frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36
   \]

3. **Second Scene:**
   The second scene has six more lines than the solo song.
   \[
   \text{Lines for the second scene} = 54 + 6 = 60

"First, let's calculate the number of cards that had the letter A on them. Since 2/5 of the cards had the letter A, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Number of cards with letter A} = \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \]

Next, we need to find out how many cards are left after removing the cards with the letter A:

\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 80 - 32 = 48 \]

Now, 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B on them:

\[ \text{Number of cards with letter B} = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]

After removing the cards with the letter B, we have:

\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 48 - 24 = 24 \]

Then, 5/8 of the remaining cards had the letter C on them:

\[ \text{Number of cards with letter C} = \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \]

After removing the cards with the letter C, we have:

\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 24 - 15 = 9 \]

The remaining cards, which have the letter D on them, are 9. Therefore, the number of cards that had the letter D on them is:

"To determine the total time Matthew will take to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we need to calculate the time for each type of hole separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the time for the small holes:
- Matthew takes 3 minutes to dig one small hole.
- He needs to dig 30 small holes.
- Therefore, the total time for small holes is \(30 \times 3 = 90\) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time for the large holes:
- Matthew takes 10 minutes to dig one large hole.
- He needs to dig 15 large holes.
- Therefore, the total time for large holes is \(15 \times 10 = 150\) minutes.

Now, we sum the time for both types of holes:
- Total time in minutes is \(90 + 150 = 240\) minutes.

Finally, we convert the total time from minutes to hours:
- Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, the total time in hours is \(\frac{240}{60} = 4\) hours.

\[ 20 + 10 + 10 = 40 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 40."
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, which translates to \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. This can be written as \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

First, we substitute the expression for \( R \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Next, we expand and simplify the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old. To verify, we can find Ruby's current age:
\[ R = 6S = 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

In 9 years, Sam will be \( 6 + 9 = 15 \) years old, and Ruby will be \( 36 + 9 = 45 \) years old. Checking the condition that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
\[ 45 = 3 \times 15 \]
This is true, so our solution is correct.

"First, let's determine the number of spots a mamba has. Since a cobra has 70 spots and a mamba has half as many spots as a cobra, a mamba has:

\[ \text{Spots per mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and all the mambas. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, so the total number of spots for the cobras is:

\[ \text{Total spots for cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots, so the total number of spots for the mambas is:

\[ \text{Total spots for mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Now, we find the combined total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas:

\[ \text{Total spots combined} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of this combined total:

\[ \text{Half the number of spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2450 \]"

"To find the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot altogether, we need to calculate the number of stories each wrote in both weeks and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of stories each wrote in the second week:
- Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week and doubled that in the second week, so she wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories in the second week.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week and doubled that in the second week, so he wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories in the second week.
- Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week and doubled that in the second week, so she wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories in the second week.

Next, we sum up the total number of stories written by each of them over the two weeks:
- Alani wrote \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories in total.
- Braylen wrote \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories in total.
- Margot wrote \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories in total.

"To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we first need to calculate the total number of stars accounted for by the rows of 8 and 6 stars, and then subtract this from the total number of stars to find the number of 5-star rows.

The total number of stars on the flag is 76. There are three rows of 8 stars and two rows of 6 stars. Let's calculate the number of stars in these rows:

- Three rows of 8 stars: \(3 \times 8 = 24\)
- Two rows of 6 stars: \(2 \times 6 = 12\)

Adding these together gives the total number of stars in the rows of 8 and 6 stars:

\[24 + 12 = 36\]

Now, we subtract the number of stars in the rows of 8 and 6 stars from the total number of stars to find the number of stars in the rows of 5 stars:

\[76 - 36 = 40\]

Since each row of 5 stars contains 5 stars, we divide the number of 5-star rows by 5:

\[40 \div 5 = 8\]

Therefore, the number of rows of 5 stars is 8."

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, the speed of the car in the slow lane is:

\[ \text{Speed of slow lane car} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it took the car in the fast lane to travel 480 miles. The time taken can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the fast lane:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{fast lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Since the car in the slow lane traveled the same distance (480 miles) but at a different speed (30 miles/hour), we can calculate the time it took for the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance using the same formula:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{slow lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

\[ 16 \text{ hours} \]"
"To find out how many medals have been given out for counting, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of medals Izzy has:
   - Ali has 22 medals.
   - Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has \(22 - 5 = 17\) medals.

2. Calculate the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:
   - Ali has 22 medals.
   - Izzy has 17 medals.
   - Together, they have \(22 + 17 = 39\) medals.

3. According to the problem, the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:
   - The total number of medals given out is \(39 \times 10 = 390\).

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 390."
"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available:

- Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars.
- There are 8 packets.

So, the total number of chocolate bars is:
\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars/packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Next, let's determine how many chocolate bars the adults will get:

- There are 4 adults.
- Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars.

So, the total number of chocolate bars for the adults is:
\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars/adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, we can find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children:

\[ 40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

There are 8 children, and we need to distribute the remaining 16 chocolate bars equally among them:

\[ \frac{16 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars/child} \]

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \]"
"Susan works for a total of 3 hours (from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m.), which is equivalent to 180 minutes. She takes a 30-minute break, so she actually works for 150 minutes.

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we can calculate her earnings as follows:

\[ \text{Earnings per minute} = \frac{5}{10} = 0.5 \, \text{dollars per minute} \]

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 150 \times 0.5 = 75 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 75."
"First, let's determine the initial points for each player:

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Next, we check if any of the players get an extra point in the fourth round. According to the rules, a player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points.

- Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so Mike gets an extra point.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so Jim does not get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so Tony gets an extra point.

Now, we add the extra points to their initial points:

- Mike's new total is \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
- Jim's new total remains \(18\) points.
- Tony's new total is \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

Finally, we calculate the total points for all three players:

\[22 + 18 + 43 = 83\]

So, the total points for all three players after the extra points had been distributed is 83."
"First, let's determine the ages of Will's sons. The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest son is half as old as the oldest, which means the youngest son is 4 years old.

Next, we calculate the number of oranges each son washes. The oldest son washes 8 oranges, and the youngest son washes 4 oranges. Therefore, the total number of oranges washed by both sons is:

\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \]

Will initially bought 15 oranges. After his sons wash 12 oranges, the number of oranges left unwashed is:

\[ 15 - 12 = 3 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"On the first day, Darren does:
- 100 pushups
- 50 squats
- 20 dumbbell presses

On the second day, he does:
- 20 more pushups than on the first day: \(100 + 20 = 120\) pushups
- 10 fewer squats than on the first day: \(50 - 10 = 40\) squats
- Doubles the number of dumbbell presses: \(20 \times 2 = 40\) dumbbell presses

The total count of activities he does in the two days is:
- Pushups: \(100 + 120 = 220\)
- Squats: \(50 + 40 = 90\)
- Dumbbell presses: \(20 + 40 = 60\)

Adding these together gives the total count of activities:
\(220 + 90 + 60 = 370\)

The final numerical answer is 370."
"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day by the household.
2. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week by the household.
3. Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

First, let's calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day by the household. Since each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal and there are 5 members, and they eat rice at lunch and dinner, the total consumption per day is:
\[ 5 \text{ members} \times 0.2 \text{ kg/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 2 \text{ kg/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week:
\[ 2 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ kg/week} \]

Now, we determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last:
\[ \frac{42 \text{ kg}}{14 \text{ kg/week}} = 3 \text{ weeks} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we first need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week.

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he did not sell any bread on those days. Over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday), he sold 20 crates. From Tuesday to Thursday, he sold the following number of crates:
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates

Now, let's add up the crates sold during the days he was open:
\[ 15 + 12 + 18 = 45 \]

Adding the crates sold over the weekend:
\[ 45 + 20 = 65 \]

Sam's target for the week was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off by, we subtract the number of crates he sold from his target:
\[ 120 - 65 = 55 \]

So, Sam was 55 crates off from his target for the week.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 55 \]"
"To determine the total cost of the antique desk to Carmen, we need to calculate the bids she placed and the bids placed by the other bidders.

Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so she bids 3 times. Each of her bids increases by $50. Therefore, her bids are:
1. First bid: $200
2. Second bid: $200 + $50 = $250
3. Third bid: $250 + $50 = $300

The other 3 bidders each bid once, and since they bid in sequence, their bids are:
1. First bidder: $200
2. Second bidder: $200 + $50 = $250
3. Third bidder: $250 + $50 = $300

Carmen wins with her third bid of $300. To find out how much she spent, we sum up all her bids:
$200 + $250 + $300 = $750

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
750"
"First, let's calculate the total distance John drives in a year.

John drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back, so he drives 60 miles each day. He goes to work 5 days a week, so he drives 60 miles * 5 days = 300 miles per week. There are 50 weeks in a year, so he drives 300 miles * 50 weeks = 15,000 miles per year.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the miles driven.

He is charged $2 per mile, so the cost for the miles driven is 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000.

Now, let's calculate the total bonus he gives the driver per year.

The driver gets a $150 bonus per month, and there are 12 months in a year, so the total bonus is $150 * 12 = $1,800.

Finally, let's calculate the total amount John pays in a year.

The total amount John pays is the cost of the miles driven plus the total bonus, which is $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

So, the final numerical answer is $31,800."

"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the folding process and how the pages are printed.

1. **Folding the Paper**: When a piece of paper is folded vertically, it creates two layers. This means that each piece of paper can be used to print two pages.
2. **Printing Layout**: The pages are printed in a specific order: page 1 on the left back, page 2 on the left front, page 32 on the right back, and page 31 on the right front. This means that each piece of paper is used to print two pages, one on each side of the fold.

Since the tabloid is 32 pages long, we can calculate the number of pieces of paper needed as follows:
- Each piece of paper can print 2 pages.
- Therefore, for 32 pages, we need \( \frac{32}{2} = 16 \) pieces of paper.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of books sold in the first year:**
   - Elise sold 45 books this year.
   - She sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year.
   - Therefore, the number of books sold in the first year is \( 2 \times 45 = 90 \) books.

2. **Calculate the total number of books sold in the first two years:**
   - Total books sold in the first year: 90 books.
   - Total books sold in the current year: 45 books.
   - Total books sold in the first two years: \( 90 + 45 = 135 \) books.

3. **Determine the total number of books sold over the three years:**
   - Total books in the collection: 250 books.
   - Total books sold in the first two years: 135 books.
   - Total books sold in the third year: \( 250 - 135 = 115 \) books.

4. **Calculate the total number of books sold in the second year:**
   - Total books sold in the first two years: 135 books.
   - Total books sold in the third year: 115 books.
   - Total books sold in the second year: \( 135 + 115 = 250 - 135 - 45 = 60 \) books.

5. **Calculate the total amount of money earned in the second year:**
   - Each book sells for $20.

"To determine how much money Watson made in April, we need to calculate his earnings from his hourly wage and his weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate Watson's daily earnings:
- Watson works 10 hours a day.
- He earns $10 per hour.

\[ \text{Daily earnings} = 10 \, \text{hours/day} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$100/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate his weekly earnings:
- Watson works 5 days a week.
- He earns $100 per day.

\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 5 \, \text{days/week} \times \$100/\text{day} = \$500/\text{week} \]

Since Watson received a $300 bonus each week if the company performed well, his total weekly earnings when the company performed well are:

\[ \text{Total weekly earnings} = \$500 + \$300 = \$800/\text{week} \]

Now, let's calculate his total earnings for the month of April. April has 30 days, and we need to determine how many weeks are in April. Since April has 30 days and each week has 7 days:

\[ \text{Number of weeks in April} = \left\lfloor \frac{30}{7} \right\rfloor = 4 \, \text{weeks} \]

Each week, Watson earns $800. Therefore, his total earnings for the month of April are:

\[ \text{Total earnings for April} = 4 \, \text{weeks} \times \$800/\text{week} = \$3200 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$3200 \]"

"First, let's determine how many loaves of bread are sold in the morning. Since two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning, we calculate:

\[
\text{Morning sales} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
\]

Next, we find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales:

\[
\text{Loaves left after morning} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
\]

In the afternoon and evening, half of the remaining loaves are sold equally. Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening combined is:

\[
\text{Afternoon and evening sales combined} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
\]

Since the loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[
\text{Afternoon sales} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ loaves}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the savings on the ice cream. The original price of one tub of ice cream is $13, and it is now sold at $11. The discount per tub is:

\[ 13 - 11 = 2 \]

So, the savings on one tub of ice cream is $2. Therefore, the savings on two tubs of ice cream would be:

\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \]

Next, let's calculate the savings on the milk. The discount on one packet of milk is $0.5. Therefore, the savings on one packet of milk is $0.5. Therefore, the savings on four packets of milk would be:

\[ 0.5 \times 4 = 2 \]

Now, we add the savings from the ice cream and the milk to find the total savings:

\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \]

So, the total amount saved if you buy 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine the number of new limbs Helena's serum will cause a person to grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and extra legs that grow based on the given growth rates.

The serum makes a person grow an extra arm every three days and an extra leg every five days.

First, let's calculate the number of extra arms:
- In fifteen days, the number of times an extra arm grows is the number of multiples of three within fifteen days.
- The multiples of three within fifteen days are: 3, 6, 9, 12.
- Therefore, the number of extra arms grown is \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \).

Next, let's calculate the number of extra legs:
- In fifteen days, the number of times an extra leg grows is the number of multiples of five within fifteen days.
- The multiples of five within fifteen days are: 5, 10.
- Therefore, the number of extra legs grown is \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \).

To find the total number of new limbs grown, we add the number of extra arms and extra legs:
- Total new limbs = Number of extra arms + Number of extra legs
- Total new limbs = 5 + 3 = 8

Thus, the final numerical answer is 8."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
6 business suits * $100 each = $600

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
3 suitcases * $50 each = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit:
5 * $100 (cost of one business suit) = $500
$700 more than $500 = $5700
So, the flight ticket costs $5700.

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
Cost of business suits: $600
Cost of suitcases: $150
Cost of flight ticket: $5700
Total expenses = $600 + $150 + $5700 = $6450

Theo wishes to save $2000 for the trip, so the total amount he has to spend is:
Total expenses - Savings = $6450 - $2000 = $4450

Therefore, the amount Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa is:
$4450 - $6000 = -$1550

Since spending cannot be negative, it implies that Theo does not have enough money to cover all his expenses and save $2000. He is short by $1550. However, the question asks for the amount he has to spend on gifts, which is $0 because he cannot spend more than he has."
"To determine the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum up the results.

First, let's identify the number of people in the family and their daily egg consumption:
- There are 5 people in the family.
- 3 people eat 3 eggs each day.
- The remaining 2 people eat 2 eggs each day.

Calculate the daily egg consumption for the 3 people:
\[ 3 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ eggs/person/day} = 9 \text{ eggs/day} \]

Calculate the daily egg consumption for the 2 people:
\[ 2 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ eggs/person/day} = 4 \text{ eggs/day} \]

Now, add the daily egg consumption of both groups to find the total daily egg consumption:
\[ 9 \text{ eggs/day} + 4 \text{ eggs/day} = 13 \text{ eggs/day} \]

Next, calculate the total weekly egg consumption by multiplying the daily consumption by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):
\[ 13 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 91 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Therefore, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week."
"If Quinn is 30 years old, and Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, then Jane is:

So, the final numerical answer is 32."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera's current age is 46 years.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old six years ago.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since six years have passed, Noah's current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Let the current population of Chile be \(P\).
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was \(P / 2\).

4. **Relate the population of Chile six years ago to Noah's age:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age.
   - Therefore, \(P / 2 = 3000 \times 20\).
   - Simplifying, \(P / 2 = 60000\).
   - Multiplying both sides by 2, we get \(P = 120000\).

So, the population of Chile now is 120000.

\[
\boxed{120000}

"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players in the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining the terms on the left side:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 3D + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{6D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve for \( D \), we multiply both sides by 2:
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 7:
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha initially invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\)
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\)

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we account for the people who couldn't come due to illness. This number is 8.

Then, we account for the people who couldn't come due to previous commitments. This number is \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the number of people who couldn't come due to illness, which is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \).

The total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Therefore, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is \(24 - 10 = 14\).

"First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Height = 5 feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 5 = 120 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is given as $0.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The number of girls is 3 times the number of boys.
2. The number of nongendered children is 1/10 the number of boys.
3. The classroom has 30 boys.

First, calculate the number of girls:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 3 \times \text{Number of boys} = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

Next, calculate the number of nongendered children:
\[ \text{Number of nongendered children} = \frac{1}{10} \times \text{Number of boys} = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3 \]

Now, add up all the children in the classroom:
\[ \text{Total number of children} = \text{Number of boys} + \text{Number of girls} + \text{Number of nongendered children} \]
\[ \text{Total number of children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 \]

So, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and there are 45 electric wires, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles.

Let \( P \) be the number of electric poles and \( W \) be the number of electric wires. According to the ratio, we have:
\[ \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Given \( W = 45 \), we can substitute this value into the equation:
\[ \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \]

To find \( P \), we solve the equation by cross-multiplying:
\[ P = \frac{45}{3} \]
\[ P = 15 \]

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

"At the beginning, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 25 + 15 = 40 people.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left, which means 1/4 * 40 = 10 people left.

If 22 men stayed at the party, this means that 22 - 10 = 12 men left the party.

Since 12 men left, 25 - 12 = 13 men are left at the party.

Since the total number of people left is 10, and 13 men are left, the number of women left must be 10 - 13 + 15 = 12 women.

So, the final numerical answer is 12."
"First, we need to determine the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book and the book costs $4, we can calculate the cost of the magazine as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of magazine} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cost of book} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of the pen, which is $1 less than the cost of the magazine. Therefore:

\[ \text{Cost of pen} = \text{Cost of magazine} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 \]

So, the cost of the pen is $1."
"First, let's determine the total number of pencils Jam has. We know that Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. So, the number of pencils in the three boxes is:

\[ 26 - 2 = 24 \]

This means Jam has 24 pencils in the boxes and 2 loose pencils, making a total of 26 pencils. Now, we need to find out how many boxes are needed to store all the pencils if Meg also has 46 pencils. The total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together is:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Since we don't know the capacity of each box, we assume each box can hold one pencil. Therefore, to store 72 pencils, Jam and Meg need 72 boxes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 72 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the cooling effect and the additional liquid added to the coffee.

First, let's determine how many ice cubes are used to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we can calculate the number of ice cubes used as follows:

\[ \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \]

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, the total reduction in milliliters due to the ice cubes is:

\[ \text{Total reduction due to ice cubes} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters} \]

Next, we need to account for the 15 milliliters of cream added. Adding cream does not weaken the coffee; it simply changes the composition of the drink. Therefore, the additional 15 milliliters of cream does not affect the reduction in milliliters due to the ice cubes.

Thus, the total reduction in milliliters of the coffee is:

\[ \text{Total reduction} = 60 \text{ milliliters} \]

So, Shannon’s iced coffee is 60 milliliters weaker when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 60 \]"
"If 5 people leave with 7 new records between them, and each person can trade 2 old records for 1 new record, then the total number of new records traded out is 7. Since each new record traded out comes from 2 old records, the total number of old records brought in is \(7 \times 2 = 14\).

The final numerical answer is 14."
"First, let's determine the number of junior and senior programmers.

Given that the total number of employees is 100 and the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:
\[ \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers is:
\[ \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Next, we know that each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total amount paid to junior programmers per month is:
\[ \text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

The senior programmers are paid $400 more than the junior programmers, so each senior programmer is paid:
\[ \text{Payment to each senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400 \]

Therefore, the total amount paid to senior programmers per month is:
\[ \text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

Finally, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers:
\[ \text{Total payment to all programmers} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 224000 \]"
"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the number of people on the bus became \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on, so the number of people on the bus became \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).

We are given that there were 20 people on the bus at the third stop. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( 14 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 14 \]"
"Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has:
\[ 24 - 2 = 22 \]
lollipops left.

He passes 14 lollipops to his friends, so he has:
\[ 22 - 14 = 8 \]
lollipops left.

He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which means he buys:
\[ 2 \times 14 = 28 \]
lollipops. Adding these to the remaining lollipops, he has:
\[ 8 + 28 = 36 \]
lollipops.

He eats 3 more that night and 2 more in the morning, so he eats:
\[ 3 + 2 = 5 \]
lollipops. Subtracting these from the total, he has:
\[ 36 - 5 = 31 \]
lollipops.

The final numerical answer is 31."
"The phone is currently at 60% charged and needs to reach 100% charged. The recharging rate is 1 percentage point per 3 minutes. To find out how many percentage points are needed to fully charge the phone, we subtract the current charge from 100%:

100% - 60% = 40%

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, it will take:

40% * 3 minutes/percentage point = 120 minutes

To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60:

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

So, the final numerical answer is 2 hours."
"Erin initially has 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her another 10 lollipops, so she now has:

\[ 7 + 10 = 17 \text{ lollipops} \]

\[ 17 - 3 = 14 \text{ lollipops} \]

The final numerical answer is 14."
"First, let's calculate the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip where they spent $80. For every $20 spent, they get $1 off their next purchase. So, for $80 spent, they would earn:

\[ \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ rewards} \]

Each reward is worth $1 off their next purchase. So, they earned 4 rewards, which means they can get $4 off their next purchase.

Next, let's calculate the rewards they earned from their current shopping trip where they spent $43. For every $20 spent, they get $1 off their next purchase. So, for $43 spent, they would earn:

\[ \frac{43}{20} = 2.15 \]

Since they can only earn whole rewards, they would earn 2 rewards. This means they can get $2 off their next purchase.

They used their rewards from the last shopping trip, which is $4 off their next purchase. They also used a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. So, the coupon would take:

\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars off} \]

Now, let's calculate the total discount they applied:

\[ 4 + 4 = 8 \text{ dollars off} \]

Subtracting the total discount from the current shopping trip's cost:

\[ 43 - 8 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the customer paid $35 on this shopping trip.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 35 \]"
"First, let's calculate the net pay for Job A.

Job A:
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours per year: 2000
- Total annual income before tax: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- State tax rate: 20%
- State tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net pay for Job A: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Next, let's calculate the net pay for Job B.

Job B:
- Annual income before tax: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax rate on net income: 10%
- Tax on net income: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay for Job B: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, let's find the difference in net pay between the two jobs.

Difference in net pay: $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate compared to the other job."
"To find the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of ruined castles:
   - 40 percent of 220 castles are ruined.
   - Number of ruined castles = 40% of 220 = 0.40 * 220 = 88 castles.

2. Calculate the number of unmanned ruined castles:
   - Half of the ruined castles are unmanned.
   - Number of unmanned ruined castles = 50% of 88 = 0.50 * 88 = 44 castles.

Therefore, the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland is 44."
"First, let's calculate the total cost for each offer.

For Furniture United:
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 installments of $350 each

Total cost for Furniture United = Advance payment + (Number of installments * Monthly installment amount)
Total cost for Furniture United = $1,350 + (6 * $350)
Total cost for Furniture United = $1,350 + $2,100
Total cost for Furniture United = $3,450

For Cozy Homes:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 installments of $250 each

Total cost for Cozy Homes = Advance payment + (Number of installments * Monthly installment amount)
Total cost for Cozy Homes = $1,100 + (9 * $250)
Total cost for Cozy Homes = $1,100 + $2,250
Total cost for Cozy Homes = $3,350

Now, let's find the cost difference between the two offers.

Cost difference = Total cost for Furniture United - Total cost for Cozy Homes
Cost difference = $3,450 - $3,350
Cost difference = $100

The cost difference between the two offers is $100."

"First, let's calculate the value of Maria's shares after the first year.

Maria initially buys 8 shares at $8 each, so the initial total value of her shares is:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8/\text{share} = \$64 \]

After the first year, the stock price increases by 50%. The new price per share after the increase is:
\[ \$8 \times (1 + 0.50) = \$8 \times 1.50 = \$12 \]

So, the value of her 8 shares after the first year is:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12/\text{share} = \$96 \]

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. The new price per share after the decrease is:
\[ \$12 \times (1 - 0.25) = \$12 \times 0.75 = \$9 \]

So, the value of her 8 shares after the second year is:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$9/\text{share} = \$72 \]

Therefore, the final value of all of Maria's shares is:

"First, let's determine how many hot dogs Thomas ate. Since Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, we can calculate the number of hot dogs Thomas ate as follows:

\[ \text{Thomas's hot dogs} = 3 \times \text{Luke's hot dogs} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Next, we need to find out how many hot dogs John ate. John ate half the amount that Thomas ate, so:

\[ \text{John's hot dogs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Thomas's hot dogs} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \]

Now, to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's hot dogs} - \text{Luke's hot dogs} = 3 - 2 = 1 \]

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The number of students in the smallest group would then be \( x - 10 \).

Given that the total number of students is 200, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two equal groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60."
"Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \) and the number of chickens as \( H \). According to the problem, the total number of animals is 60, and there are twice as many chickens as cows. This gives us the following equations:

\[ H + C = 60 \]
\[ H = 2C \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( C \):

\[ 2C + C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:

\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of legs. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:

\[ \text{Total legs} = (2 \times H) + (4 \times C) = (2 \times 40) + (4 \times 20) = 80 + 80 = 160 \]

So, the total number of legs the animals have is 160."

"First, let's determine the weights of the other animals based on the information given:

1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. A blue beetle weighs the same as a pink frog, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
3. A green toad weighs the same as a pink frog, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
4. A yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than a pink frog, so the yellow snake weighs \(50 + 10 = 60\) pounds.
5. A red bird weighs 20 pounds less than a pink frog, so the red bird weighs \(50 - 20 = 30\) pounds.

Now, let's calculate the total weight of one of each animal:
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds

"First, let's calculate the daily revenue from tractors when they made them:
- They sold 10 tractors a day.
- Each tractor was sold for $100.

So, the daily revenue from tractors was:
\[ 10 \text{ tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate the daily revenue from silos now that they make them:
- They sell 5 silos a day.
- Each silo is sold for $220.

So, the daily revenue from silos is:
\[ 5 \text{ silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day} \]

Now, we need to find the percentage increase in daily revenue from making silos compared to making tractors:
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New revenue} - \text{Old revenue}}{\text{Old revenue}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\$1100 - \$1000}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{\$100}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

The phone costs $400, so the amount of money Annabelle still needs to save is:
\[ 400 - 355 = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 45 \]"
"First, let's determine the height of the second tree. Since the second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, and the shortest tree is 6 feet tall, the height of the second tree is:
\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the combined height of the shortest and the second tree:
\[ 6 + 11 = 17 \text{ feet} \]

The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and the second tree:
\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height of the tallest tree is:
\[ 34 \text{ feet} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 34 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the toy cars. Dean bought 6 toy cars, and each toy car costs $2. So, the total cost for the toy cars is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the teddy bears. Dean bought 5 teddy bears, and each teddy bear costs $1. So, the total cost for the teddy bears is:
\[ 5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's find the total cost of the toys Dean bought:
\[ 12 + 5 = 17 \text{ dollars} \]

Dean initially had $28. After buying the toys, the amount of money he has left is:
\[ 28 - 17 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

Dean's mother then gives him an extra $10. So, the total amount of money Dean has now is:
\[ 11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 21 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost for the mini-golf and go-karts:

- Cost for one round of mini-golf: $5
- Cost for two rides on go-karts: $10 * 2 = $20

So, the total cost for mini-golf and go-karts is $5 + $20 = $25.

Now, let's subtract this cost from the total budget to find out how much money is left for arcade tokens and for Morgan herself:

- Total budget: $90
- Cost for mini-golf and go-karts: $25

Money left for arcade tokens and Morgan herself: $90 - $25 = $65.

Morgan wants to have $5 in arcade tokens, so the remaining money after buying arcade tokens is:

- Money left after mini-golf and go-karts: $65
- Cost of arcade tokens: $5

Money left for Morgan herself: $65 - $5 = $60.

Since the question asks how many friends she can invite, and we assume that each friend gets the same amount as Morgan, we need to divide the remaining money by the cost per person (which is $5 for arcade tokens and $5 for Morgan herself):

- Money left for each person: $60
- Cost per person: $5

Number of friends she can invite: $60 / $5 = 12.

So, the final numerical answer is 12."
"First, let's calculate how much Marisa spends on lollipops each day. Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and she buys 4 lollipops each day. So, the cost per day is:

\[ 4 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 100 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, 100 cents is equivalent to 1 dollar. So, Marisa spends $1 each day on lollipops.

Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day. Therefore, the amount of money she saves each day is:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars} - 1 \text{ dollar} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

If she saves this amount for 5 days, the total amount saved is:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Billy spent on gumballs. He bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, so the total cost for the gumballs is:

\[ 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Since he takes half of his change and spends it on gumballs, the total amount of money he had initially is twice the amount he spent on gumballs:

\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Billy started with $10, so the amount of money he spent on candy is:

\[ 10 - 4 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of candy is $1.5 per pound. To find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we divide the total amount spent on candy by the cost per pound:

\[ \frac{6}{1.5} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's denote Carver's son's age as \( x \) years.

According to the problem, Carver's age is 5 years less than twice his son's age. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

The final numerical answer is 25."
"First, let's calculate the distance of the entire trip from the first city to the third city and back to the first city.

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city back to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the second and third city trip, which is \(100 - 50 = 50\) miles.

So, the total distance for one complete round trip (first to second, then second to third, and finally third to first) is:
\[75 + 100 + 50 = 225 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[225 \times 3 = 675 \text{ miles}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance traveled in one day by the service interval:
\[18000 \div 675 = 26.6667\]

Since the train cannot go between services for a fraction of a day, we round up to the next whole number. Therefore, the train goes between services every 27 days.

The final numerical answer is:
\[27\]"
"First, let's determine the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed. The collie bed requires the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. A Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds of stuffing and a chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing. The average amount of stuffing for a collie bed is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Average stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we can calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the 4 chihuahua beds and the 3 collie beds:

\[
\text{Total stuffing for chihuahua beds} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]
\[
\text{Total stuffing for collie beds} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Adding these together gives the total amount of stuffing needed:

\[
\text{Total stuffing} = 8 + 15 = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

The final numerical answer is:

\[
23

"First, let's calculate the time John spent driving to his friend's house. The distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, and he drives at a speed of 70 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time taken to drive to his friend's house is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} = \frac{200 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{200}{70} \text{ hours} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 2.857 \text{ hours} \]

Next, John took a detour that added 10 miles to his trip, making the total distance to his friend's house 210 miles. The time taken for this detour is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{210}{70} \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the time John spent driving back home. The distance home is 240 miles, and he drives at a speed of 80 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{back home}} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = \frac{240}{80} \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, the total time for the trip is the sum of the time taken to drive to his friend's house, the time taken for the detour, and the time taken to drive back home:

\[ \text{Total Time} = \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} + \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} + \text{Time}_{\text{back home}} \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{20}{7} + 3 + 3 \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{20}{7} + 6 \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{20}{7} + \frac{42}{7} \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{62}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 8.857 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time for the trip is:

\[ \frac{62}{7} \text{ hours} \]

Let's convert this to a decimal for a more precise answer:

\[ \frac{62}{7} \approx 8.857 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 8.857 \text{ hours} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of boys at Small Tree School. Since there are 96 fourth-graders in total and 43 of them are girls, the number of boys is:

"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test, we start by calculating the total points she has already scored on her first two tests.

Points scored on the first test: 15 points
Points scored on the second test: 18 points

Total points scored on the first two tests:
\[ 15 + 18 = 33 \]

Jane needs a total of at least 42 points across all three tests. To find the minimum score she needs on the third test, we subtract the total points she has already scored from the required total:

\[ 42 - 33 = 9 \]

Therefore, the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass is 9.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 9 \]"
"Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as \( C \). According to the problem, \( C = 3 \).

The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is \( 4C - 5 \). Substituting \( C = 3 \) into this equation, we get:
\[ 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]

The number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is \( 3 \) times the number of shoplifters, which is \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \).

Now, we know the total number of customers kicked out is 50. The total number of customers and shoplifters and those for physical violence can be calculated as follows:
\[ C + (4C - 5) + 3(4C - 5) = 50 \]
\[ 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 \]

The number of customers kicked out for other reasons is the total number of people kicked out minus the number of customers, shoplifters, and those for physical violence:
\[ 50 - 31 = 19 \]

So, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is 19."
"To determine how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we need to first find out how many points Erin had after scoring 14 points.

Sara scored 8 points. After scoring 14 points, Erin has three times more points than Sara. Therefore, we calculate Erin's points after scoring 14 points as follows:
\[ \text{Erin's points after scoring 14} = 3 \times \text{Sara's points} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Since Erin scored 14 points after already having some points, we can find out how many points Erin had before by subtracting the 14 points she scored from her total points after scoring:
\[ \text{Erin's points before scoring 14} = \text{Erin's points after scoring 14} - 14 = 24 - 14 = 10 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. Each picture frame costs $20 and an additional 20% for etching. The total cost per picture frame is:

\[ 20 + (20 \times 0.20) = 20 + 4 = 24 \]

Since there are 44 seniors, the total cost for the picture frames is:

\[ 44 \times 24 = 1056 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the pins. Two seniors will receive pins, and each pin costs $5:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the cords for the officers. One-fourth of the seniors are officers, so:

\[ \frac{44}{4} = 11 \]

Each cord costs $12, so the total cost for the cords is:

\[ 11 \times 12 = 132 \]

Finally, we sum up all the costs:

\[ 1056 + 10 + 132 = 1200 \]

The total amount spent on the senior gifts is:

\[ \boxed{1200} \]"
"To determine the total cost for Ethan if he makes his own hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the savings from the DIY option and then subtract that from the original cost.

The original cost of the wallpaper is $400. The DIY option saves 20% of this cost. First, we calculate 20% of $400:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.20 \times 400 = 80 \]

This means Ethan saves $80 by making his own wallpaper. Therefore, the total cost for Ethan if he makes his own wallpaper is:

\[ 400 - 80 = 320 \]

So, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.
On Saturday, they sold double the number of Friday, which is \(14 \times 2 = 28\) pairs.
On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount of Saturday, which is \(28 \div 2 = 14\) pairs.

The total number of pairs sold without considering returns or exchanges is \(14 + 28 + 14 = 56\) pairs.

Six pairs were returned, so the number of pairs sold after returns is \(56 - 6 = 50\) pairs.

The final numerical answer is 50."
"To find out how many hours a week Hallie had dance practice, we need to calculate the total hours for each day she had practice and then sum them up.

- On Tuesdays, she had 1 hour of practice.
- On Thursdays, she had 2 hours of practice.
- On Saturdays, she had practice that lasted twice as long as Tuesday's, which means she had \(2 \times 1 = 2\) hours of practice on Saturdays.

Now, we sum up the hours for each day:
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 2 hours
- Saturday: 2 hours

Total hours per week = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 hours.

"First, let's determine the number of faulty pieces of equipment. Since 40% of the total number of pieces were faulty, we can calculate the number of faulty pieces as follows:

\[ \text{Number of faulty pieces} = 40\% \times \text{Total number of pieces} \]

Let's denote the total number of pieces as \( N \). Therefore:

\[ \text{Number of faulty pieces} = 0.40 \times N \]

The total cost of the equipment is $400,000. If we assume that each piece of equipment costs the same amount, the cost per piece is:

\[ \text{Cost per piece} = \frac{\$400,000}{N} \]

The total cost of the faulty pieces is:

\[ \text{Total cost of faulty pieces} = 0.40 \times N \times \frac{\$400,000}{N} = 0.40 \times \$400,000 = \$160,000 \]

The total cost of the functioning pieces of equipment is the total cost of the equipment minus the cost of the faulty pieces:

\[ \text{Total cost of functioning pieces} = \$400,000 - \$160,000 = \$240,000 \]

So, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is:

\[ \text{Total cost of functioning pieces} = \$240,000 \]

Let's confirm this with a numerical answer in a separate line:

"First, we need to determine how many pupils like blue. Since half of the class likes blue, we calculate:

\[
\text{Pupils who like blue} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Next, we find out how many pupils are left after accounting for those who like blue:

\[
\text{Remaining pupils} = 40 - 20 = 20
\]

One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green, so we calculate:

\[
\text{Pupils who like green} = \frac{20}{4} = 5
\]

The rest of the pupils like yellow. To find out how many pupils like yellow, we subtract the number of pupils who like green from the remaining pupils:

\[

"First, let's determine how many apples Lucy sold on Monday. Given that she sold all the apples she picked on Monday and received $56 from selling them at $4 per piece, we can calculate the number of apples sold on Monday as follows:

\[ \text{Number of apples sold on Monday} = \frac{\$56}{\$4/\text{apple}} = 14 \text{ apples} \]

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples. On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday, which means she picked:

\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ apples} \]

To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we add the apples picked on each day:

\[ 14 \text{ (Monday)} + 12 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 24 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 50 \text{ apples} \]

So, the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days is:

"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including the interest, and then divide that by five.

The formula to calculate the total amount to be paid with interest is:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} \times (1 + \text{Interest Rate})^{\text{Time}} \]

Here, the principal (P) is $3,650, the interest rate (r) is 10% or 0.10, and the time (t) is 5 months. Since the interest rate is given as an annual rate, we need to adjust it for the time period. However, since the interest is compounded monthly, we can use the formula directly with the given values.

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 \times (1 + 0.10)^5 \]

First, calculate \( (1 + 0.10)^5 \):
\[ (1 + 0.10)^5 = 1.10^5 \approx 1.61051 \]

Now, multiply this by the principal:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 \times 1.61051 \approx 5873.3315 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the total amount Karan has to pay is approximately $5873.33.

Next, we need to divide this total amount by the number of months (5) to find the monthly payment:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{5873.3315}{5} \approx 1174.67 \]

Therefore, Karan has to pay approximately $1174.67 per month.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1174.67 \]"
"To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked, we need to calculate the distance each person hiked and then find the difference.

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

So, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe."
"First, let's determine the number of silver and gold pesos Anna has.

Axel has 50 silver pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Axel has 80 gold pesos. Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so:
\[ 80 + 40 = 120 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of silver pesos they have together:
\[ 50 \text{ (Axel's silver pesos)} + 100 \text{ (Anna's silver pesos)} = 150 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of gold pesos they have together:

"First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make:

- Each pitcher holds 12 cups.
- She can make 3 pitchers of lemonade.

So, the total number of cups is:
\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups/pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling all the lemonade:

- She sells each cup for $1.
- She has 36 cups.

So, the total revenue is:
\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1/\text{cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to determine the cost of making the lemonade:

- She spent $18 to buy the supplies.

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue:
\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Millie sells all the lemonade, and she sells an average of 4 cups per hour. To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours the lemonade stand is open:

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$4.50 \]"
"Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially as \( L \).

According to the problem, he sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. We know that \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land is equal to 12.8 hectares.

To find the total amount of land \( L \), we can set up the following equation:

\[ \frac{2}{5} L = 12.8 \]

To solve for \( L \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[ L = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} \]

Let's calculate the value of \( L \).
```python

"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 50\% \times 52 = 0.5 \times 52 = 26 \]

Since the choir is evenly split between boys and girls, the number of boys is also 26.

Next, we need to find out how many female members are performing. Since all female members are performing, the number of female members is equal to the number of girls, which is 26.

On the day of the performance, half of the female members can't make it to the show because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of female members who can't make it is:

\[ \frac{26}{2} = 13 \]

This means that the number of female members who can make it to the show is:

\[ 26 - 13 = 13 \]

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is the sum of the female members who can make it and the 3 teachers:

\[ 13 + 3 = 16 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost for David who buys a ride bracelet. The ride bracelet costs $30 and gives 9 rides. So, David's total cost is $30.

Next, let's calculate the cost for Dasha who buys tickets. Each ride costs 2 tickets, and there are 9 rides. Therefore, Dasha needs 9 rides * 2 tickets/ride = 18 tickets. Since each ticket costs $2, Dasha's total cost is 18 tickets * $2/ticket = $36.

Now, we need to find out how much money David saves by buying the ride bracelet instead of buying tickets. The difference in cost between Dasha's and David's total costs is $36 - $30 = $6.

So, David saves $6."
"To determine how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of gifts Monica needs to wrap.
2. Divide the total length of ribbon by the total number of gifts.

First, let's calculate the total number of gifts:
- Monica has 6 gifts to wrap for her family.
- She has 4 gifts to wrap for her friends.
- She has 2 gifts to wrap for her teachers.

Total number of gifts = 6 (family) + 4 (friends) + 2 (teachers) = 12 gifts.

Next, we divide the total length of ribbon by the total number of gifts:
- Monica has 144 inches of ribbon.
- She needs to wrap 12 gifts.

Number of inches of ribbon per gift = 144 inches / 12 gifts = 12 inches per gift.

So, the final numerical answer is:
12 inches"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many popsicles Betty and Sam each have based on the given ratio and total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. The total parts of the ratio are 5 + 6 = 11 parts.

Given that the total number of popsicles is 165, we can find out how many popsicles each part of the ratio represents by dividing the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts in the ratio:
\[ \text{Number of popsicles per part} = \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can find out how many popsicles Betty and Sam have individually:
- Betty has \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \) popsicles.
- Sam has \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ \text{Difference} = 90 - 75 = 15 \]

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 15 \]"
"First, let's calculate the monthly cost of the streaming services Tim will use after the discount:

- Netflix costs $10 a month.
- Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 each, but with a 20% discount, the cost for each is reduced by 20% of $10.

The discount for Hulu and Disney Plus is:
\[ 10 \times 0.20 = 2 \]

So, the discounted monthly cost for each of Hulu and Disney Plus is:
\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \]

Now, let's calculate the total monthly cost for Hulu and Disney Plus after the discount:
\[ 8 + 8 = 16 \]

Next, we add the cost of Netflix to the discounted cost of Hulu and Disney Plus to find the total monthly cost for the streaming services:
\[ 10 + 16 = 26 \]

Tim's cable package costs $60 a month. Therefore, the amount of money he saves by cancelling his cable package and switching to the streaming services is:
\[ 60 - 26 = 34 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 34 \]"
"First, let's convert all the time spent into the same unit. We'll use minutes for this calculation.

Carol spends 4 hours writing a song. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 4 hours is:
\[ 4 \times 60 = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

She spends half that much time recording it, which is:
\[ \frac{240}{2} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

She spends 90 minutes editing it.

Now, let's find the total time spent on all activities:
\[ 240 \text{ minutes (writing)} + 120 \text{ minutes (recording)} + 90 \text{ minutes (editing)} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

To find the percentage of her total work time that she spent editing, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{90}{450} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{5} \right) \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of her total work time that she spent editing is:
\[ 20\% \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of books Wendy wants to place in the shelving system.

First, we calculate the total number of slots in the shelving system:
- The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns.
- Therefore, the total number of slots is \(6 \times 6 = 36\).

Next, we need to find out how many books Wendy wants to place. According to the problem, she wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in the slots.

Let's denote the number of books in the slots as \(B\). The total number of books Wendy wants to place is given by:
\[ \text{Total books} = 2B + 20 \]

Since \(B\) is the total number of slots, we have:
\[ B = 36 \]

Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's add the slices given to Bill and Mark:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny eats 2 slices. So, the total number of slices given away or eaten is:
\[ 7 + 2 = 9 \text{ slices} \]

Since the pizza originally had 12 slices, the number of slices left is:
\[ 12 - 9 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"Mark currently has $50 in his bank account. The bike costs $300. Therefore, he needs an additional $300 - $50 = $250 to buy the bike. Since he earns $10 per day, the number of days he needs to work to earn $250 is $250 / $10 = 25 days.

The final numerical answer is 25."
"First, let's determine the number of millipedes. Nancy saw 1/3 as many millipedes as spiders. Since she saw 90 spiders, the number of millipedes is:

\[ \text{Number of millipedes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30 \]

Next, we need to find the number of stink bugs. The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12. Since there are 30 millipedes, the number of stink bugs is:

\[ \text{Number of stink bugs} = 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48 \]

Now, we can find the total number of bugs by adding the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs together:

\[ \text{Total number of bugs} = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168 \]

So, the total number of bugs Nancy counted is:

"To determine the builder's annual earnings, we need to calculate the total number of days he works in a year and then multiply that by his daily wage.

First, let's calculate the number of days the builder works in a month:
- The builder works 6 days a week.
- There are 4 weeks in a month.

So, the number of days worked in a month is:
\[ 6 \text{ days/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 24 \text{ days/month} \]

Next, we calculate the number of days the builder works in a year:
- There are 12 months in a year.

So, the number of days worked in a year is:
\[ 24 \text{ days/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 288 \text{ days/year} \]

Now, we calculate the total earnings for the year:
- The builder earns $50 per day.

So, the total earnings for the year are:

"To determine how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for a quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for:
- 3 cups of flour
- 1 cup of milk

For a quadruple batch, the amounts are:
- Flour: \( 3 \text{ cups} \times 4 = 12 \text{ cups} \)
- Milk: \( 1 \text{ cup} \times 4 = 4 \text{ cups} \)

Next, we need to determine how many bags of flour and bottles of milk are required.

Flour is sold in 2-cup bags:
- \( \frac{12 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups per bag}} = 6 \text{ bags} \)

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles:
- \( \frac{4 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups per bottle}} = 2 \text{ bottles} \)

Finally, we calculate the difference between the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk:

"To determine the energy saved by Mel, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the energy consumption of the air conditioner per hour.
2. Determine the daily energy consumption after the reduction.
3. Calculate the total energy saved in 30 days.

First, the air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour. Reducing the usage by 5 hours a day means the new usage is 8 - 5 = 3 hours a day.

The daily energy consumption after the reduction is:
\[ 900 \text{ watts/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 2700 \text{ watt-hours/day} \]

To convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours, we divide by 1000:
\[ 2700 \text{ watt-hours/day} = 2.7 \text{ kilowatt-hours/day} \]

Now, to find the total energy saved in 30 days:
\[ 2.7 \text{ kilowatt-hours/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 81 \text{ kilowatt-hours} \]

So, the total kilowatt-hours of electric energy saved in 30 days is 81 kilowatt-hours. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of cannolis**: Allan initially has 40 cannolis.
2. **Corn to cannolis ratio**: There is twice as much corn as cannolis. Therefore, initially, Allan has \(2 \times 40 = 80\) corns.
3. **Cannolis after buying more**: Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new total number of cannolis is \(40 + 60 = 100\).
4. **Corn after buying fewer**: Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he had after buying more. Since he now has 100 cannolis, he bought \(100 - 40 = 60\) fewer corns. Therefore, the new total number of corns is \(80 - 60 = 20\).

Now, we need to find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house:
\[ 100 \text{ (cannolis)} + 20 \text{ (corns)} = 120 \]

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is \(\boxed{120}\)."

"First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:
\[ \text{Total words} = \text{Number of pages} \times \text{Words per page} = 45 \times 200 = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, let's determine how long it will take Toby to read the entire book:
\[ \text{Time to read the book} = \frac{\text{Total words}}{\text{Words per minute}} = \frac{9000}{300} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby plans to leave the airport in 60 minutes and it takes 10 minutes to get there. Therefore, he needs to start reading 50 minutes before he needs to be at the airport:
\[ \text{Time to start reading} = 60 - 10 - 30 = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Toby starts reading 20 minutes before he needs to be at the airport, he will be:
\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \text{ minutes early} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carolyn's company paid to the employees in May.

Each employee was paid $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek, so the weekly pay for each employee is:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} = 600 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Since there were 40 employees in May, the total weekly payment for all employees in May is:
\[ 40 \text{ employees} \times 600 \text{ dollars/employee/week} = 24000 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Assuming May has 4 weeks, the total payment for May is:
\[ 24000 \text{ dollars/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 96000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in June.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired. Therefore, the number of employees who continued working in June is:
\[ 40 \text{ employees} - \frac{1}{4} \times 40 \text{ employees} = 40 \text{ employees} - 10 \text{ employees} = 30 \text{ employees} \]

The weekly pay for each of the 30 employees who continued working in June is still $600. So, the total weekly payment for these 30 employees in June is:
\[ 30 \text{ employees} \times 600 \text{ dollars/employee/week} = 18000 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Assuming June also has 4 weeks, the total payment for June is:
\[ 18000 \text{ dollars/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 72000 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is sold in a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. Sally bought 2 pounds of taffy.

For the first pound, the cost is $3.
For the second pound, the cost is $3 - $1.50 = $1.50 (since it's half off).

So, the total cost for the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50 and the magnets cost $0.25 each. Sally bought 4 magnets.

The total cost for the seashells and magnets is $1.50 + 4 * $0.25 = $1.50 + $1.00 = $2.50.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items Sally bought:
Total cost = Cost of taffy + Cost of seashells and magnets
Total cost = $4.50 + $2.50 = $7.00.

Sally's parents gave her $10 to spend. So, the amount of money Sally has left is:
Money left = Initial amount - Total cost
Money left = $10 - $7.00 = $3.00.

The final numerical answer is $3.00."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the two packs of fireworks. The first pack costs $400, and the second pack costs twice as much, which is $800. So, the total cost for the two packs before the discount is:

"First, we need to determine the discount price for each blouse. The regular price of each blouse is $20, and there is a 30% discount.

To find the discount amount per blouse:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Regular Price} \times \text{Discount Percentage} \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 20 \times 0.30 \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 6 \]

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the regular price to find the sale price of each blouse:
\[ \text{Sale Price} = \text{Regular Price} - \text{Discount Amount} \]
\[ \text{Sale Price} = 20 - 6 \]
\[ \text{Sale Price} = 14 \]

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so the total cost for the discounted blouses is:

"Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees as \( A \).

From the problem, we know:
- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples.
- Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
- Joanne's sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
- Joanne's sister doesn't take any apples from the average trees, so she contributes 0 apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is:
\[ 30 + 15 + A \]

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne's sister is:
\[ 60 + 45 + 0 = 105 \]

The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500:
\[ (30 + 15 + A) + (60 + 45 + 0) = 500 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 30 + 15 + A + 60 + 45 = 500 \]
\[ 150 + A = 500 \]

Solving for \( A \):
\[ A = 500 - 150 \]
\[ A = 350 \]

"Let's denote the number of camels as \( C \) and the number of dromedaries as \( D \).

From the problem, we have two equations:
1. The total number of heads: \( C + D = 180 \)
2. The total number of humps: \( 2C + D = 304 \)

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, we can express \( C \) in terms of \( D \) from the first equation:
\[ C = 180 - D \]

Next, we substitute \( C \) in the second equation:
\[ 2(180 - D) + D = 304 \]
\[ 360 - 2D + D = 304 \]
\[ 360 - D = 304 \]
\[ -D = 304 - 360 \]
\[ -D = -56 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

"First, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days. He traveled 200 kilometers every day, so the total distance for the first 4 days is:
\[ 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \]

Next, we need to find out how far he traveled in the next two days. The total distance for these two days is 30% of the distance traveled in the first four days. So, we calculate 30% of 800 km:
\[ 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \]

Now, we know that during the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day. Since he traveled for 7 days in the second week, the total distance for the second week is:
\[ 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \]

To find the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we add the distances from the first four days, the next two days, and the second week:
\[ 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km} \]

"To determine how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to find the difference in elevation between Oliver and Stanley's comb.

Stanley's comb is at an elevation of 10,000 feet (where Stanley was standing initially) and then it fell 4,000 feet to a ledge below. Therefore, the comb is at an elevation of:
\[ 10,000 \text{ feet} - 4,000 \text{ feet} = 6,000 \text{ feet} \]

Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb at 6,000 feet, we subtract Oliver's elevation from the comb's elevation:
\[ 6,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 3,000 \text{ feet} \]

So, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 3000 \]"
"To determine the total capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of money given by the second bank.
2. Sum the amounts given by both banks.
3. Add the initial capital to the total amount received from the banks.

First, the second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank. Since the first bank gave him $4000, the second bank gave him:
\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Next, we sum the amounts given by both banks:
\[ 4000 + 8000 = 12000 \]

Then, we add the initial capital to the total amount received from the banks:
\[ 5000 + 12000 = 17000 \]

So, the total capital Mr. Josue has now is:
\[ 17000 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 17000 \]"
"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, which means a total of \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cats were taken away. Therefore, the number of cats remaining on the rock after the boats left is \(50 - 20 = 30\).

Later, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse they'd seen. The number of cats that ran away is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \). Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is \(30 - 18 = 12\).

The final numerical answer is 12."
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service for Bill, we need to break down the cost into different periods based on the pricing changes.

1. **First 6 months**: The cost is $8 per month.
   \[
   6 \text{ months} \times \$8/\text{month} = \$48
   \]

2. **Next 2 months (months 7 and 8)**: The cost is the normal price of $12 per month.
   \[
   2 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$24
   \]

3. **Next 18 months (months 9 to 26)**: The cost is the increased price of $14 per month.
   \[
   18 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$252
   \]

Now, we sum up the costs for all the periods:
\[
\$48 + \$24 + \$252 = \$324
\]

So, the total cost for 2 years of the service is **\$324**."
"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:

\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find out how much Cole saved from each type of jeans. He saved a total of $6, and he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. This means he saved:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]

from the jogger jeans, and the rest, which is:

\[ 6 - 2 = 4 \]

from the tattered jeans. Now, let's verify the savings. The tattered jeans originally cost $28, and he saved $4 from them. The jogger jeans originally cost $22, and he saved $2 from them. The total savings are indeed $6, which matches the information given.

The question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. We already know the original cost of the tattered jeans is $28 and the jogger jeans is $22. The difference in cost is:

\[ 28 - 22 = 6 \]

So, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 more than the tattered jeans. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To determine the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and then sum these capacities.

First, we calculate the capacity of the buses:
\[ 4 \text{ buses} \times 60 \text{ employees per bus} = 240 \text{ employees} \]

Next, we calculate the capacity of the minibusses:
\[ 6 \text{ minibusses} \times 30 \text{ employees per minibus} = 180 \text{ employees} \]

Then, we calculate the capacity of the minivans:
\[ 10 \text{ minivans} \times 15 \text{ employees per minivan} = 150 \text{ employees} \]

Now, we sum the capacities of all the vehicles:
\[ 240 \text{ employees} + 180 \text{ employees} + 150 \text{ employees} = 570 \text{ employees} \]

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is:
\[ 570 \]"
"Lillian builds 3 bird feeders herself and buys 3 more, making a total of 6 bird feeders. Each of her bird feeders attracts 20 birds per day. The store-bought bird feeders attract 20 birds each, while her bird feeders attract 10 more birds each, which means they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds per day.

To find the total number of birds she can expect to see each day, we multiply the number of feeders by the number of birds each feeder attracts:

\[ 6 \text{ feeders} \times 30 \text{ birds per feeder} = 180 \text{ birds per day} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 180."
"First, let's determine the cost of the soup. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. The bagel costs $4.

To find 25% of $4:
\[ 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]

So, the soup costs:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Next, we know the cake costs half of the price of the bagel. The bagel costs $4, so:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the dinner by adding the cost of the soup, the bagel, and the cake:
\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \]

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for the dinner she ordered."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of cards Kenny started with. Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( x \).

Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards, so he sells 2/3 of them. The number of cards he sells is \( \frac{2}{3}x \). He sells each card for $1.5, so the total amount of money he earns from selling the cards is \( 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}x = x \).

According to the problem, after selling the cards, Kenny has $50 in spending cash and the remaining $50 to buy the ticket to the amusement park, which costs $100. This means the total amount of money he has after selling the cards is $100. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x = 100 \]

So, Kenny started with 100 cards. The final numerical answer is:

100"
"First, let's determine how many hotdogs the caterer initially prepared. Since half of the 40 guests would have two hotdogs each, we calculate:

\[
\frac{40}{2} \times 2 = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ hotdogs}
\]

The caterer prepared 40 hotdogs, but 40 guests showed up, and each guest wanted a second hotdog. This means that the caterer needs to provide 40 more hotdogs to satisfy the second hotdog request for each of the 40 guests. However, the caterer only has 40 hotdogs, so he can only provide one hotdog to each guest.

Since there are 40 guests and the caterer can only provide one hotdog per guest, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:

\[
40 - 40 = 0
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
0

"First, let's determine the number of letters in Indras' sister's name. We know that Indras' name has 6 letters. Half of the letters in Indras' name is:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name, so:

\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Now, to find the total number of letters in both names, we add the number of letters in Indras' name to the number of letters in her sister's name:

\[ 6 + 7 = 13 \]

So, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Mixing bowls: $20.00
- Utensils: 5 utensils at $5.00 each, so 5 * $5.00 = $25.00

Adding these together gives the total cost before the discount:
$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Now, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost:
20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00

Subtracting the discount from the total cost gives the final amount:
$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

So, the final numerical answer is $132.00."

So, the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew is 30."
"First, we need to determine how much gas is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we can calculate the amount of gas per container as follows:

\[ \text{Gas per container} = \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5 \text{ containers}} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Josey needed \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a container, so we calculate the amount of gas she needed in gallons:

\[ \text{Gas needed by Josey} = \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to convert gallons to pints. Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we can convert \( \frac{3}{4} \) gallons to pints as follows:

\[ \text{Gas needed by Josey in pints} = \frac{3}{4} \times 8 \text{ pints} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount of money George spent:**
   George spent $5.

2. **Determine the amount of money George had left:**
   Since he had 1% of his money left, the amount of money he had left is:
   \[
   0.01 \times 5 = 0.05 \text{ dollars} = 5 \text{ cents}
   \]

3. **Determine the total amount of money spent on chips:**
   Since he had 5 cents left, the amount spent on chips is:
   \[
   5 \text{ dollars} - 5 \text{ cents} = 4.95 \text{ dollars} = 495 \text{ cents}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of bags of chips George bought:**
   Each bag of chips costs 40 cents, so the number of bags of chips he bought is:
   \[
   \frac{495 \text{ cents}}{40 \text{ cents/bag}} = 12.375 \text{ bags}
   \]
   Since George can only buy whole bags of chips, he bought 12 bags of chips.

5. **Calculate the total cost of the chips:**
   The cost of 12 bags of chips is:
   \[
   12 \times 40 \text{ cents} = 480 \text{ cents}
   \]

6. **Determine the total amount of money spent on candy bars:**
   The total amount spent on candy bars is:

"First, let's determine the amount of onions Antoine uses. The recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, and he doubles that amount:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00 \text{ per pound} = \$8.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box is $2.00:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00 \text{ per box} = \$4.00 \]

Adding the cost of the onions and the beef stock gives us the total cost:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

"First, let's determine the time it takes for Wayne to drive to the theater. According to the information provided, it takes Wayne 4 minutes to drive to the theater.

Since the drive from Bernadette’s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne’s hotel, we can calculate the time it takes for Bernadette to drive to the theater as follows:
\[ \text{Time for Bernadette} = 4 \times \text{Time for Wayne} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Therefore, to find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave, we subtract the time it takes Wayne to drive to the theater from the time it takes Bernadette to drive to the theater:
\[ \text{Time Bernadette should leave earlier} = \text{Time for Bernadette} - \text{Time for Wayne} = 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Bernadette should leave 12 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first.

"First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of Billie's bedroom in feet is:
\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area formula for a rectangle, which is:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

Given that the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, we can find the width:
\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{width} \]
\[ \text{width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can calculate the perimeter of the rectangle using the perimeter formula:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

"First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven. Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour. Therefore, the total temperature increase from the oven is:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, let's calculate the temperature decrease due to the window. Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Therefore, the total temperature decrease from the window is:

\[ \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 3 \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 6 \text{ degrees} \]

Now, we can find the final temperature by adding the temperature increase from the oven to the initial temperature and then subtracting the temperature decrease from the window:

"First, let's convert all times to minutes for easier calculation:
- Jon's swim time: 40 minutes
- Jon's bike ride time: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 60 + 20 = 80 minutes
- Jon's run time: 50 minutes

Now, let's calculate James's times:
- James's swim time: Jon's swim time minus 10% of Jon's swim time
  \[
  \text{James's swim time} = 40 - (0.10 \times 40) = 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ minutes}
  \]
- James's bike ride time: Jon's bike ride time plus 5 minutes
  \[
  \text{James's bike ride time} = 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes}

Let James's run time be \( x \) minutes. Then James's total time is:
\[
\text{James's total time} = 36 + 85 + x = 121 + x \text{ minutes}
\]

We know that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[
121 + x = 170 + 10
\]
\[
121 + x = 180
\]
\[
x = 180 - 121

Next, we know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, the length of Movie B in minutes is:

\[ 75 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, we can find the length of Movie A by dividing the length of Movie B by 4:

"First, we need to determine how many miles the horse runs. The horse runs at a speed of 32 miles per hour for 30 minutes, which is half an hour. Therefore, the distance the horse runs is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 32 \text{ miles/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of hay the horse eats. For every mile the horse runs, it eats 1/2 a bail of hay. Therefore, for 16 miles, the horse eats:

\[ \text{Hay consumed} = 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail/mile} = 8 \text{ bails} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the hay. Since each bail of hay costs $3, the total cost for 8 bails is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars/bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which means he has:

\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the hay, the change Michael has is:

"Let's denote the regular price of the popcorn as \( P \).

The cost of the super ticket is $20, and it includes one popcorn and one soda for an extra $1. So, the total cost for the super ticket is $20 + $1 = $21.

The cost of buying a movie ticket for $12 and a popcorn and a soda at regular prices is $12 + \( P \) + $3 = $15 + \( P \).

According to the problem, you saved $2 by buying the super ticket instead of buying the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda separately. Therefore, the cost of buying the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda separately is $2 more than the cost of the super ticket. This can be expressed as:

\[ 15 + P = 21 + 2 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 15 + P = 23 \]

To find \( P \), we subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ P = 23 - 15 \]
\[ P = 8 \]

So, the regular price of the popcorn is $8.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the initial cost per balloon and then calculate the new cost per balloon after the price increase. Finally, we will use this new cost to find out how much Bentley paid for 170 balloons.

First, let's find the initial cost per balloon. The total cost for 20 balloons was $900. Therefore, the cost per balloon initially is:
\[ \text{Initial cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. So, the new cost per balloon is:

"To find the average speed of the car during the entire trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

First, calculate the distance for each segment of the trip:
- For the first segment: \(60 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles}\)
- For the second segment: \(30 \text{ mph} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 30 \text{ miles}\)

Next, add the distances to find the total distance:
- Total distance = \(120 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 150 \text{ miles}\)

Now, calculate the total time taken:
- Total time = \(2 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} = 3 \text{ hours}\)

Finally, calculate the average speed:
- Average speed = \(\frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ mph}\)

The car's average speed during the trip is 50 mph."
"First, let's determine the value of the sapphires Jenna traded. Jenna traded 3 sapphires, and each sapphire is worth $800. Therefore, the value of the sapphires she traded is:

\[ 3 \text{ sapphires} \times \$800 \text{ per sapphire} = \$2400 \]

Next, we need to determine how many sapphires Jenna has left after the trade. Initially, she had 8 sapphires and traded 3, so she has:

\[ 8 - 3 = 5 \text{ sapphires} \]

Now, we calculate the total value of the sapphires Jenna has left:

\[ 5 \text{ sapphires} \times \$800 \text{ per sapphire} = \$4000 \]

Jenna also received 2 rubies in the trade. Each ruby is worth $1200, so the value of the rubies she received is:

\[ 2 \text{ rubies} \times \$1200 \text{ per ruby} = \$2400 \]

To find the total value of all her jewels, we add the value of the sapphires she has left to the value of the rubies she received:

\[ \$4000 + \$2400 = \$6400 \]

Therefore, the total value of all her jewels is:

"First, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the raised bed) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

For one raised bed, the volume is:

\[ V = 8 \text{ feet} \times 2 \text{ feet} \times 2 \text{ feet} = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:

\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 \text{ cubic feet} = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \text{ cubic feet}}{2 \text{ cubic feet per bag}} = 160 \text{ bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \text{ bags} \times 12 \text{ dollars per bag} = 1920 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of green cards. We know there are 15 red cards and 60% more green cards than red cards.

The number of green cards is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Number of green cards} = \text{Number of red cards} + 0.60 \times \text{Number of red cards} \]
\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + 0.60 \times 15 \]
\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + 9 \]
\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 24 \]

Next, we calculate the number of yellow cards. The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards:
\[ \text{Number of yellow cards} = \text{Number of red cards} + \text{Number of green cards} \]
\[ \text{Number of yellow cards} = 15 + 24 \]
\[ \text{Number of yellow cards} = 39 \]

Now, we can find the total number of cards by adding the number of red, green, and yellow cards:
\[ \text{Total number of cards} = \text{Number of red cards} + \text{Number of green cards} + \text{Number of yellow cards} \]
\[ \text{Total number of cards} = 15 + 24 + 39 \]
\[ \text{Total number of cards} = 78 \]

"To determine how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. **Calculate the total amount of oats consumed by one horse per day:**
   - Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal.
   - Each horse is fed twice a day.
   - Therefore, one horse consumes \(5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day}\).

2. **Calculate the total amount of oats consumed by all four horses per day:**
   - There are four horses.
   - Each horse consumes 10 pounds of oats per day.
   - Therefore, all four horses consume \(10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}\).

3. **Calculate the total amount of oats consumed by all four horses for five days:**
   - All four horses consume 40 pounds of oats per day.
   - They are fed for five days.
   - Therefore, the total consumption for five days is \(40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds}\).

4. **Calculate the number of bags of oats needed:**
   - Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats.
   - The total consumption is 200 pounds.
   - Therefore, the number of bags needed is \(200 \text{ pounds} \div 50 \text{ pounds/bag} = 4 \text{ bags}\).

The final numerical answer is 4 bags."

"First, let's calculate the cost of 2 packs of razors without any discounts:

- Each pack costs $4.00.
- Heather buys 2 packs, so the total cost without any discounts is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) dollars.

Now, let's apply the buy one get one free offer:

- With the buy one get one free offer, Heather only pays for one razor from each pack.
- Since she buys 2 packs, she only pays for 2 razors.
- The cost for 2 razors at $4.00 per pack is $8.00.

Next, let's apply the $2.00 coupon:

- The total cost after applying the coupon is \(8.00 - 2.00 = 6.00\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the cost per razor:

- Heather buys 2 packs, which contain 4 razors.
- The total cost for 4 razors is $6.00.
- The cost per razor is \(\frac{6.00}{4} = 1.50\) dollars.

Finally, converting the cost per razor to cents:

- Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, the cost per razor in cents is \(1.50 \times 100 = 150\) cents.

Therefore, the final numerical answer in cents is:

"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \( D \). According to the problem, Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects. Additionally, David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects. The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ D = 9 \]

So, David found 9 insects. Since Lily found 7 more than David, Lily found:

\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Therefore, the number of insects Lily found is 16. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the width of the rug. Since the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair and the chair is 3 feet wide, the width of the rug is:

\[ \text{Width of the rug} = \text{Width of the chair} + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the length of the couch. The problem states that the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Since the width of the rug is 8 feet, twice the width of the rug is:

\[ 2 \times \text{Width of the rug} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the length of the couch is:

\[ \text{Length of the couch} = 2 \times \text{Width of the rug} + 2 = 16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet} \]

So, the length of the couch is 18 feet."
"Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( S \). Since she bought four packs of gum in total, and two of them were strawberry, the cost of the strawberry gum is \( 2S \).

She also bought one pack of grape gum, which cost $2. She bought one small pack of green apple gum, which she paid half as much as the grape gum, so the cost of the green apple gum is \( \frac{2}{2} = $1 \).

The total cost of all the gum is given as $7. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total cost as:
\[ 2S + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

"To determine the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his sled dogs, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
2. Determine the number of pairs of legs (since each pair of snowshoes is for one pair of legs).
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of pairs of legs.

First, we know that each dog has 4 legs and there are 6 dogs:
\[ 4 \text{ legs/dog} \times 6 \text{ dogs} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Since each pair of snowshoes covers one pair of legs, we need to find out how many pairs of legs there are:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs/pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs of legs} \]

Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, so the total cost for 12 pairs of snowshoes is:
\[ 12 \text{ pairs} \times 12 \text{ dollars/pair} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is:

"To determine how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate her total weekly cost without the bus pass and then compare it to the cost of the bus pass.

First, let's calculate her total weekly cost without the bus pass:
- Janet takes two bus trips each day.
- She takes five bus trips per day.
- Therefore, her total number of bus trips per week is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) trips.
- Each bus trip costs her $2.20.
- So, her total weekly cost without the bus pass is \(10 \times 2.20 = 22.00\) dollars.

Next, we compare this to the cost of the bus pass:
- The weekly bus pass costs her $20.

Now, we calculate the savings by subtracting the cost of the bus pass from her total weekly cost without the bus pass:
- Savings = Total weekly cost without the bus pass - Cost of the bus pass
- Savings = $22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00

Therefore, Janet would save $2.00 by buying the weekly bus pass."
"The farm has 30 cows and 15 sheep (since the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, and the zoo has 20 sheep, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep, but the question states the farm has 15 sheep, which is consistent with the zoo having twice as many cows as the farm).

The zoo has 20 sheep and 40 cows (since the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, and the farm has 30 cows, so the zoo has 30 * 2 = 60 cows, but the question states the zoo has 20 sheep and 40 cows, which is consistent).

The total number of animals on the farm is 30 cows + 15 sheep = 45 animals.
The total number of animals in the zoo is 40 cows + 20 sheep = 60 animals.

Therefore, the total number of animals on the farm and in the zoo combined is 45 + 60 = 105 animals."
"To determine how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we start by understanding the relationship between the quantities bought by Sophia and Rose. According to the problem, Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.

Given:
- Rose bought 12 onions.
- Rose bought 4 potatoes.

Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as \( S_o \) and the number of potatoes Sophia bought as \( S_p \).

From the problem, we know:
\[ 4 \times (S_o + S_p) = 12 + 4 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[ 4 \times (S_o + S_p) = 16 \]

Next, we solve for \( S_o + S_p \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ S_o + S_p = \frac{16}{4} \]
\[ S_o + S_p = 4 \]

Therefore, Sophia bought a total of 4 onions and potatoes. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, the house cost three times as much as the lot, so we can write:

\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]

Combining like terms, we have:

\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

To find \( L \), we divide both sides by 4:

\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000 \]

Now that we know the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):

- Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
- Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick \(5 \times 2 = 10\) quarts per hour.
- Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than does Kathy, so Ricky can pick \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, let's add up the quarts picked per hour by all four individuals:

- Tony: 6 quarts
- Bobby: 5 quarts
- Kathy: 10 quarts
- Ricky: 8 quarts

Total quarts picked per hour = \(6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29\) quarts.

The final numerical answer is 29."

1. Start with the initial number of loaves baked: 200 loaves.
2. Subtract the loaves sold in the morning: 200 - 93 = 107 loaves.
3. Subtract the loaves sold in the afternoon: 107 - 39 = 68 loaves.
4. Add the loaves returned by the grocery store: 68 + 6 = 74 loaves.

So, the number of loaves of bread they had left is 74."
"First, we need to determine how many rows of red tulips Jackson can plant. Since he can fit 6 red tulips in a row and he has 36 red tulips, we divide the total number of red tulips by the number of red tulips per row:

\[ \text{Number of rows of red tulips} = \frac{36}{6} = 6 \]

Next, we determine how many rows of blue tulips Jackson can plant. Since he can fit 8 blue tulips in a row and he has 24 blue tulips, we divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of blue tulips per row:

\[ \text{Number of rows of blue tulips} = \frac{24}{8} = 3 \]

To find the total number of rows of flowers Jackson will plant, we add the number of rows of red tulips and the number of rows of blue tulips:

\[ \text{Total number of rows} = 6 + 3 = 9 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 9 \]"
"To determine how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we first need to find out how many cups of raisins she will have for the oatmeal cookies after dividing the bag equally among the three items.

The total number of cups of raisins is 27. If she divides the raisins equally among the three items (oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix), each item will get:

\[ \frac{27 \text{ cups}}{3} = 9 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we need to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies she can make with 9 cups of raisins. Each batch of oatmeal cookies requires \( \frac{3}{4} \) cup of raisins. Therefore, the number of batches she can make is:

\[ \frac{9 \text{ cups}}{\frac{3}{4} \text{ cups per batch}} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 12 \]

So, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"First, let's calculate Ada's daily electric consumption before and after adding the new device.

Before adding the new device:
- Daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour
- Cost per kilowatt per hour: $1.50

Daily cost before:
\[ 12 \, \text{kWh/day} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$18.00/\text{day} \]

Weekly cost before:
\[ \$18.00/\text{day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = \$126.00/\text{week} \]

After adding the new device:
- Daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour + 2 kilowatts per hour = 14 kilowatts per hour
- Cost per kilowatt per hour: $1.50

Daily cost after:
\[ 14 \, \text{kWh/day} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$21.00/\text{day} \]

Weekly cost after:
\[ \$21.00/\text{day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = \$147.00/\text{week} \]

Now, let's find the difference between the weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device:
\[ \$147.00/\text{week} - \$126.00/\text{week} = \$21.00/\text{week} \]

The difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is \$21.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which one person paints and then scale it up for 5 people.

1. One person can paint half a house in 5 days. Therefore, one person can paint a whole house in 10 days.
2. The rate of painting for one person is \(\frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}}\).
3. If 5 people are working together, their combined rate of painting is \(5 \times \frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{2 \text{ days}}\).
4. This means that 5 people can paint a whole house in 2 days.

To convert this into hours, we multiply the number of days by 24 (since there are 24 hours in a day):

\[2 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 48 \text{ hours}\]

So, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

The final numerical answer is 48."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ophelia has 20 sofas.
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. Therefore, Ophelia has \(20 + 2 = 22\) chairs.
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. So, Jenna has \(3 \times 22 = 66\) chairs.
4. Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, Ophelia also has 22 sofas (as calculated earlier).
5. Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so Jenna has \(66 - 2 = 64\) sofas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have together:

- Ophelia's total: \(20\) sofas + \(22\) chairs = \(42\)
- Jenna's total: \(64\) sofas + \(66\) chairs = \(130\)

Adding their totals together:

\[42 + 130 = 172\]

So, the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together is 172."
"To determine how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had not purchased the headphone set, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of the headphone set.
2. Determine the amount of money Tom would have had if he did not buy the headphone set.
3. Calculate how many CDs he could have bought with that amount of money.

First, we know that Tom paid $48 in total and that the CD cost $4. Therefore, the cost of the headphone set is:
\[ 48 - 4 = 44 \]

If Tom had not bought the headphone set, he would have had:
\[ 48 - 44 = 4 \]

With $4, Tom could have bought:
\[ \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

So, Tom would have been able to buy 1 more CD if he had not bought the headphone set. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1 \]"

"Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 people get off. Then, 5 times as many people as those who got off get on. So, \(5 \times 8 = 40\) people get on the bus. The number of people on the bus after the first stop is:
\[48 - 8 + 40 = 80\]

At the second stop, 21 people get off. Then, 3 times fewer people get on compared to those who got off. So, \(21 \div 3 = 7\) people get on the bus. The number of people on the bus after the second stop is:
\[80 - 21 + 7 = 66\]

The final numerical answer is 66."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, Jame's current age is \( 27 - 5 = 22 \) years.

2. **Determine the age of Jame's cousin in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 27 + 8 = 35 \) years old.
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \( 2 \times 35 = 70 \).
   - Therefore, Jame's cousin will be \( 70 - 5 = 65 \) years old in 8 years.

3. **Determine Jame's cousin's current age:**
   - If Jame's cousin will be 65 in 8 years, then Jame's cousin's current age is \( 65 - 8 = 57 \) years.

4. **Calculate the age difference between Jame and his cousin:**
   - Jame's current age is 22 years.
   - Jame's cousin's current age is 57 years.

"Let's break down the information given:

- The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400.
- The computer costs $1,100.
- The printer costs $400 less than the computer, so the printer costs $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the computer and the printer:
- Cost of the computer: $1,100
- Cost of the printer: $700
- Total cost of the computer and the printer: $1,100 + $700 = $1,800

Since the total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400, we can find the total cost of the 2 monitors by subtracting the total cost of the computer and the printer from the total cost:
- Total cost of the computer and the printer: $1,800
- Total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer: $2,400
- Total cost of the 2 monitors: $2,400 - $1,800 = $600

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the total cost of the 2 monitors by 2:
- Total cost of the 2 monitors: $600
- Cost of one monitor: $600 / 2 = $300

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is $300.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many seashells each girl brought, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of boys and girls.
2. Calculate the total number of seashells brought by the boys.
3. Calculate the total number of seashells brought by the girls.

First, since there are 20 kids in total and they are divided into two equal groups of girls and boys, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

Next, each boy brought back 60 seashells. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is:
\[ 10 \text{ boys} \times 60 \text{ seashells/boy} = 600 \text{ seashells} \]

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. So, the total number of seashells brought by the girls is:
\[ 600 \text{ seashells} + 4 \times 600 \text{ seashells} = 600 \text{ seashells} + 2400 \text{ seashells} = 3000 \text{ seashells} \]

Since there are 10 girls, the number of seashells each girl brought is:
\[ \frac{3000 \text{ seashells}}{10 \text{ girls}} = 300 \text{ seashells/girl} \]

Thus, the number of seashells brought by each girl is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and then sum them up.

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so its thickness is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so its thickness is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm.

Now, we sum the thicknesses of all four books:
\[31 + 50 + 45 + 62\]

Let's calculate the sum:
\[31 + 50 = 81\]
\[81 + 45 = 126\]
\[126 + 62 = 188\]

Therefore, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable parts. First, we need to determine the total amount Elvis needs to save in April and then figure out how much he needs to save in the second half of the month.

April has 30 days. Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125. Therefore, he needs to save $1125 in April.

Let's denote the number of days in the first half of April as \( x \). Consequently, the number of days in the second half of April would be \( 30 - x \).

According to the problem, Elvis saves twice as much daily in the second half of the month as he does in the first half. Let's denote the daily savings in the first half as \( y \). Therefore, the daily savings in the second half would be \( 2y \).

The total savings in April can be expressed as the sum of the savings in the first half and the second half:
\[ x \cdot y + (30 - x) \cdot 2y = 1125 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ xy + 2(30 - x)y = 1125 \]
\[ xy + 60y - 2xy = 1125 \]
\[ 60y - xy = 1125 \]
\[ y(60 - x) = 1125 \]

To find \( y \), we need to determine \( x \). Since \( x \) must be a whole number between 0 and 30, we can test values to find a suitable \( x \).

Let's test \( x = 15 \):
\[ y(60 - 15) = 1125 \]
\[ 45y = 1125 \]
\[ y = \frac{1125}{45} \]
\[ y = 25 \]

So, Elvis saves $25 per day in the first half of April. Therefore, in the second half of April, he saves \( 2 \times 25 = 50 \) dollars per day.

To verify, let's calculate the total savings:
- First half: \( 15 \times 25 = 375 \) dollars
- Second half: \( 15 \times 50 = 750 \) dollars
- Total: \( 375 + 750 = 1125 \) dollars

The calculations confirm that Elvis needs to save $50 per day in the second half of April.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the apples:
- Verna bought 3 apples at $1.50 each.
- Total cost for apples = 3 * $1.50 = $4.50

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the oranges:
- Verna bought 5 oranges at $0.80 each.
- Total cost for oranges = 5 * $0.80 = $4.00

Then, let's calculate the total cost of the peaches:
- Verna bought 6 peaches at $0.75 each.
- Total cost for peaches = 6 * $0.75 = $4.50

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the fruits:
- Total cost = Cost of apples + Cost of oranges + Cost of peaches
- Total cost = $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

Verna gave $20 to the seller. To find out the change she received, we subtract the total cost of the fruits from the amount she gave:
- Change received = Amount given - Total cost
- Change received = $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

The final numerical answer is $7.00."

"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars. The total amount of money is $100, so we can write the equation:

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets $20. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's amount as:

\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets $80.

The final numerical answer is 80."

"To determine the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Rewriting**: Elise writes the entire alphabet twice.
   - The alphabet has 26 letters.
   - Therefore, writing it twice means \(26 \times 2 = 52\) letters.

2. **Second Rewriting**: Elise writes half of the alphabet once.
   - Half of the alphabet is \(26 / 2 = 13\) letters.
   - Therefore, writing half of the alphabet once means \(13\) letters.

3. **Third Rewriting**: Elise rewrites everything she has already written.
   - This includes the two full alphabets and the half alphabet.
   - The total number of letters already written is \(52 + 13 = 65\).
   - Rewriting everything means writing \(65\) letters again.

Now, we sum up all the letters written:
- First rewriting: \(52\) letters.
- Second rewriting: \(13\) letters.
- Third rewriting: \(65\) letters.

Adding these together:
\[ 52 + 13 + 65 = 130 \]

Thus, the total number of letters Elise has written is:

"First, let's determine how long it takes Ray to swim a mile when the water is warm.

Given:
- When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.
- When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold.

Let's calculate the time it takes to swim a mile in warm water:
- Twice the time it takes in cold water is \(2 \times 16 = 32\) minutes.
- Adding 2 minutes to this gives \(32 + 2 = 34\) minutes.

So, it takes Ray 34 minutes to swim a mile in warm water.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water:
- In cold water, it takes \(16 \times 3 = 48\) minutes to swim 3 miles.
- In warm water, it takes \(34 \times 3 = 102\) minutes to swim 3 miles.

Finally, to find out how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day compared to a cold day, we subtract the time taken in cold water from the time taken in warm water:
- The difference is \(102 - 48 = 54\) minutes.

Therefore, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day."

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80."
"First, let's determine the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub. The cost of the foot-long fish sub is $40, and the six-inch cold-cut combo sub costs three times as much. Therefore, the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub is:

\[ 3 \times 40 = 120 \]

Now, to find the total cost for both subs, we add the cost of the foot-long fish sub and the six-inch cold-cut combo sub:

\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \]

So, the total cost for lunch today at Subway is $160."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes in all the buttons.

First, we know that there are 21 buttons in total. Out of these, 7 buttons have 2 holes each. So, the number of holes in these 7 buttons is:
\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ holes} \]

The rest of the buttons have 4 holes each. Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 of them have 2 holes, the number of buttons with 4 holes is:
\[ 21 - 7 = 14 \text{ buttons} \]

The number of holes in these 14 buttons is:
\[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \text{ holes} \]

Adding the holes from both types of buttons gives us the total number of holes:
\[ 14 + 56 = 70 \text{ holes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 70 \]"
"First, we need to determine the volume of Zack's locker. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can calculate its volume as follows:

\[ \text{Volume of Zack's locker} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Volume of Timothy's locker} \]
\[ \text{Volume of Zack's locker} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 \]
\[ \text{Volume of Zack's locker} = 12 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we need to determine the volume of Peter's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can calculate its volume as follows:

\[ \text{Volume of Peter's locker} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Volume of Zack's locker} \]
\[ \text{Volume of Peter's locker} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 \]
\[ \text{Volume of Peter's locker} = 3 \text{ cubic inches} \]

\[ 3 \]"
"First, let's determine the daily recommended cups of coffee for Octavia. Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, if the daily recommended cups of coffee is \( R \), then Octavia drinks \( \frac{R}{2} \) cups of coffee.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks, so Juan drinks \( 10 \times \frac{R}{2} = 5R \) cups of coffee.

According to Juan's doctor, Juan's coffee intake should be reduced to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. Therefore, Juan needs to reduce his coffee intake by \( 5R - 4 \) cups.

To find the exact reduction, we need to know the value of \( R \), the daily recommended cups of coffee. However, since the problem does not provide the value of \( R \), we can express the reduction in terms of \( R \).

The reduction in Juan's coffee intake is:
\[ 5R - 4 \]

Since the problem does not provide the value of \( R \), we cannot determine a specific numerical answer. The reduction in cups of coffee that Juan must reduce is \( 5R - 4 \).

Therefore, the final numerical answer cannot be determined without the value of \( R \)."
"To find the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then add them together.

There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each, so the total number of hamsters is:
\[ 3 \times 10 = 30 \]

There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each, so the total number of guinea pigs is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Adding the number of hamsters and guinea pigs together gives the total number of rodents:
\[ 30 + 15 = 45 \]

So, the pet shop had a total of 45 rodents."
"First, let's determine the weights of Susan and Bob.

Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark. Since Mark weighs 150 pounds, Susan's weight is:

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the angle the sun makes with the ground after moving for 10 hours.

Initially, the sun is at the tip of the pyramid, which is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground. The sun moves upward at a rate of 5 degrees per hour. Over 10 hours, the sun will move upward by:

\[ 5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the total angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours will be the initial angle plus the angle the sun has moved upward:

\[ 32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much James spends on candles, we first need to find out how many candles he needs in total.

1. Determine the ages of the sons:
   - The older son is 12 years old.
   - The younger son is 4 years younger, so the younger son is \(12 - 4 = 8\) years old.

2. Calculate the total number of candles needed:
   - James needs one candle for each son, so he needs \(12 + 8 = 20\) candles.

3. Determine how many packs of candles are needed:
   - Each pack contains 5 candles.
   - To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack: \(20 \div 5 = 4\) packs.

4. Calculate the total cost:
   - Each pack costs $3.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 4 packs is \(4 \times 3 = 12\).

James spends $12 on candles."
"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the pages read in the first week and add it to the pages read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week. She read for 15 minutes each night for 7 nights, so the total reading time in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pages she can read in 105 minutes. Since she can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, we first find out how many 1.5-minute intervals are in 105 minutes:
\[ \frac{105 \text{ minutes}}{1.5 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 70 \text{ intervals} \]

Since she reads 2 pages in each 1.5-minute interval, the total number of pages read in the first week is:
\[ 70 \text{ intervals} \times 2 \text{ pages/interval} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

Now, we know that in the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 240 \]"

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equation based on the information given.

Let \( S \) be Shiloh's current age, and let \( N \) be his nephew's current age.

From the problem, we know:
1. Shiloh is currently 44 years old, so \( S = 44 \).
2. In 7 years, Shiloh will be \( 44 + 7 = 51 \) years old.
3. In 7 years, his nephew will be \( N + 7 \) years old.
4. At that time, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   51 = 3 \times (N + 7)
   \]

Now, let's solve for \( N \):
\[
51 = 3 \times (N + 7)
\]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[
17 = N + 7
\]
Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[
N = 10
\]

So, his nephew is currently 10 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Tooth:**
   - The tooth fairy left $5.00.

2. **Next Three Teeth:**
   - For each of these teeth, the tooth fairy gave $1.00.
   - Total for these three teeth: \(3 \times 1.00 = 3.00\).

3. **Last Two Teeth:**
   - For each of these teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of money per tooth as the previous three teeth.
   - Amount per tooth for the last two teeth: \( \frac{1.00}{2} = 0.50 \).
   - Total for these two teeth: \(2 \times 0.50 = 1.00\).

Now, let's sum up all the amounts:

- First tooth: $5.00
- Next three teeth: $3.00
- Last two teeth: $1.00

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage error in Maggie's oven and then apply that same percentage error to the 520 degrees she needs for her recipe.

First, let's calculate the percentage error when the oven is set to 450 degrees and the actual temperature is 468 degrees:

\[
\text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{\text{Actual Temperature} - \text{Set Temperature}}{\text{Set Temperature}} \right) \times 100
\]

\[
\text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{468 - 450}{450} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 = 4\%
\]

Now, we apply this 4% error to the 520 degrees required for the recipe:

\[
\text{Adjusted Temperature} = \text{Original Temperature} + (\text{Original Temperature} \times \text{Percentage Error})
\]

\[
\text{Adjusted Temperature} = 520 + (520 \times 0.04) = 520 + 20.8 = 540.8
\]

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 540.8 degrees to compensate for the error in her oven's temperature.

90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is 215 minutes."
"First, we need to determine the value of Juan's house. Since Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's, we can calculate the price of Juan's house by finding 30% of Herb's house price and subtracting it from Herb's house price.

Herb's house price = $76,000

30% of Herb's house price = 0.30 * $76,000 = $22,800

Therefore, the value of Juan's house = Herb's house price - 30% of Herb's house price
Juan's house price = $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

Now, we need to find the combined value of both houses:
Combined value = Herb's house price + Juan's house price
Combined value = $76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200

The final numerical answer is $129,200."
"First, let's determine the number of cups and dishes Judy initially bought.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups.

She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.

At the event, her friend brought 40 cups. Since Judy initially bought 12 cups, her friend brought \(40 - 12 = 28\) more cups than Judy bought.

Her friend also brought 20 more dishes than Judy's initial 24 dishes, so her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend.

Judy's total cups: \(12 + 28 = 40\)
Judy's total dishes: \(24 + 44 = 68\)

The total number of utensils (cups and dishes) brought by both is:

"First, let's determine the cost of one box of contacts after the 10% discount. The original price of one box is $100.00. A 10% discount on $100.00 is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Discount} = 100.00 \times \frac{10}{100} = 10.00 \]

So, the discounted price of one box is:

\[ \text{Discounted Price} = 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

Since Pete is buying 2 boxes, the total cost for 2 boxes is:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost per pair of contacts. Since each box contains 90 single use contacts, 2 boxes will contain:

\[ \text{Total Contacts} = 90 \times 2 = 180 \]

Since each pair of contacts consists of 2 contacts, the number of pairs of contacts is:

\[ \text{Number of Pairs} = \frac{180}{2} = 90 \]

Finally, the cost per pair of contacts is:

\[ \text{Cost per Pair} = \frac{180.00}{90} = 2.00 \]

\[ \text{Jill's earnings} = 3 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$30 \]

Next, let's calculate the total hours John worked.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so:
\[ \text{John's hours on Saturday} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so:
\[ \text{John's hours on Sunday} = 3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, John's total hours worked are:
\[ \text{John's total hours} = 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ hours} \]

John's earnings are:
\[ \text{John's earnings} = 7 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$70 \]

"First, let's calculate the total calories burned from doing aerobics and running.

For aerobics:
- Hannah spends 2 hours doing aerobics.
- Aerobics burn 500 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from aerobics = 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.

For running:
- Hannah spends 1 hour running.
- Running burns 600 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from running = 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.

Now, let's add the calories burned from both activities:
- Total calories burned = calories from aerobics + calories from running = 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories.

Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. To find out how many ml of water she needs to drink for 1600 calories, we can set up a proportion:

\[
\frac{100 \text{ ml}}{200 \text{ calories}} = \frac{x \text{ ml}}{1600 \text{ calories}}
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{100 \text{ ml} \times 1600 \text{ calories}}{200 \text{ calories}} = \frac{160000 \text{ ml-calories}}{200 \text{ calories}} = 800 \text{ ml}

So, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the note, the number of red jelly beans is 1% less than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \). Similarly, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of the red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

So, the number of blue jelly beans is 1500. Now we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

- Number of red jelly beans = \( 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \)
- Number of green jelly beans = \( 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \)

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 30."
"First, let's determine the increase in Jared's typing speed. He starts at 47 WPM and increases to 52 WPM after some lessons. The increase in speed is:

\[ 52 - 47 = 5 \text{ WPM} \]

If he continues to increase his typing speed by 5 words per minute, his new speed will be:

\[ 52 + 5 = 57 \text{ WPM} \]

Now, we need to find the average of the three measurements: 47 WPM, 52 WPM, and 57 WPM. The average is calculated by summing these values and dividing by the number of measurements:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{47 + 52 + 57}{3} \]

Let's calculate the sum:

\[ 47 + 52 + 57 = 156 \]

Now, divide the sum by 3:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{156}{3} = 52 \]

So, the average of the three measurements is:

\[ 52 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms every day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Calculate the total protein intake per week.

First, we know that 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein. Therefore, 200 grams of mushrooms will contain:
\[ \text{Protein in 200 grams} = \left(\frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams of mushrooms}}\right) \times 200 \text{ grams of mushrooms} = 6 \text{ grams of protein} \]

Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, the protein intake per day is 6 grams. To find out how much protein John gets in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 (the number of days in a week):
\[ \text{Protein intake per week} = 6 \text{ grams/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

George needs 2 implants, and each implant has a base price of $2000. So, the cost for the implants is:
\[ 2 \times 2000 = 4000 \]

For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. So, the additional cost for the porcelain crown is:
\[ 500 \]

The total cost for the dental work is:
\[ 4000 + 500 = 4500 \]

George has already put down a deposit of $600. Therefore, the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
\[ 4500 - 600 = 3900 \]

George makes $15 per hour at work. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:

So, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 260 \]"
"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees, and the other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees. The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees and \( 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees. The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The measure of the largest angle in the triangle is \(\boxed{90}\) degrees."

"First, let's determine the total number of rotations the tires go through in a month. Given that the car drives 400 miles a month and the tires rotate 725 times for every 2 miles, we can calculate the total rotations per month as follows:

\[ \text{Rotations per mile} = \frac{725}{2} \]
\[ \text{Rotations per month} = 400 \times \frac{725}{2} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of rotations per month:

\[ \text{Rotations per month} = 400 \times 362.5 = 145000 \]

Now, we know that each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations. To find out how many months the tires can last, we divide the total number of rotations each tire can handle by the number of rotations per month:

\[ \text{Months per tire} = \frac{10,440,000}{145000} \]

Let's calculate this value:

\[ \text{Months per tire} = 72 \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can find out how many years the tires can last by dividing the number of months per tire by 12:

\[ \text{Years per tire} = \frac{72}{12} = 6 \]

So, the tires can last for 6 years before they need to be replaced. The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how much each pump costs, we first need to determine the total number of washes Jackie can get from one bottle of shampoo. Since the directions say 2 pumps give 120 washes, we can calculate the number of washes per pump:

\[ \text{Washes per pump} = \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washes per pump} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pumps are in the bottle. Since the bottle gives 120 washes and each pump gives 60 washes, the number of pumps in the bottle is:

\[ \text{Number of pumps} = \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{60 \text{ washes per pump}} = 2 \text{ pumps} \]

The total cost of the bottle is $24.00. To find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the number of pumps:

\[ \text{Cost per pump} = \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 12.00 \text{ dollars per pump} \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert dollars to cents (1 dollar = 100 cents):

\[ 12.00 \text{ dollars} = 12.00 \times 100 \text{ cents} = 1200 \text{ cents} \]

So, the cost of each pump is 1200 cents."
"First, let's calculate the discount on the shirt and the shorts.

The shirt originally costs $25, and there is a 30% off sale.
The discount on the shirt is \( 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \).

So, the shirt will cost \( 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \) after the discount.

The shorts originally cost $35, and there is a 30% off sale.
The discount on the shorts is \( 35 \times 0.30 = 10.50 \).

So, the shorts will cost \( 35 - 10.50 = 24.50 \) after the discount.

Now, let's add the discounted prices of the shirt and the shorts to find the total cost of the outfit.
The total cost is \( 17.50 + 24.50 = 42.00 \).

"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the funding into two parts: the initial 5 months and the extended 5 months.

1. **Initial 5 months funding:**
   - The initial funding is $100,000 for the first 5 months.

2. **Extended 5 months funding:**
   - The research took 10 times the initial 5 months, which means it took \(10 \times 5 = 50\) months in total.
   - The first 5 months cost $100,000.
   - The remaining 45 months (50 months - 5 months) cost 50% more per month than the initial $100,000 / 5 = $20,000 per month.
   - The new monthly funding for the extended period is \(20,000 \times 1.5 = 30,000\) dollars per month.
   - Therefore, the total funding for the extended 45 months is \(45 \times 30,000 = 1,350,000\) dollars.

3. **Total cost:**
   - Adding the initial 5 months funding and the extended 45 months funding, we get:

1. The total number of seats in the auditorium is given by the number of rows multiplied by the number of seats per row:
   \[
   \text{Total seats} = 4 \times 18 = 72
   \]

2. One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators:
   \[
   \text{Seats occupied by administrators} = \frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18
   \]

3. The number of remaining seats after the administrators have been seated is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining seats} = 72 - 18 = 54
   \]

4. One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents:
   \[
   \text{Seats occupied by parents} = \frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18
   \]

5. The number of seats occupied by the students is the remaining seats after the administrators and parents have been seated:
   \[
   \text{Seats occupied by students} = 54 - 18 = 36
   \]

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is:
\[
\boxed{36}

"To find the total number of functioning street lights, we first need to calculate the total number of street lights available.

Each pole has 4 street lights, and there are 6 poles at each intersection. Therefore, the number of street lights at one intersection is:
\[ 4 \text{ lights/pole} \times 6 \text{ poles/intersection} = 24 \text{ lights/intersection} \]

Since there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights across all intersections is:
\[ 24 \text{ lights/intersection} \times 4 \text{ intersections} = 96 \text{ lights} \]

Given that 20 street lights are not working, the number of functioning street lights is:
\[ 96 \text{ lights} - 20 \text{ non-functioning lights} = 76 \text{ functioning lights} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 76 \]"
"To find out how many total times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to add the number of times each DVD has already been played to their respective maximum play counts.

The first DVD can be played 1000 times and has been played 356 times, so it can be played:
\[ 1000 - 356 = 644 \text{ more times} \]

The second DVD can also be played 1000 times and has been played 135 times, so it can be played:
\[ 1000 - 135 = 865 \text{ more times} \]

Adding the remaining play counts of both DVDs together:
\[ 644 + 865 = 1509 \]

Therefore, the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is 1509."
"To calculate the total cost of John's physical therapy, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of therapy sessions John attended.
2. Calculate the total number of hours John spent in therapy.
3. Compute the total cost based on the hourly rate.

**Step 1: Total number of therapy sessions**
John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks, and each week he attended twice for 2 hours at a time.
\[ \text{Total sessions} = 6 \text{ weeks} \times 2 \text{ sessions/week} = 12 \text{ sessions} \]

**Step 2: Total number of hours spent in therapy**
Each session is 2 hours long.
\[ \text{Total hours} = 12 \text{ sessions} \times 2 \text{ hours/session} = 24 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 3: Total cost of therapy**
The cost per hour is $125.
\[ \text{Total cost} = 24 \text{ hours} \times 125 \text{ dollars/hour} = 3000 \text{ dollars} \]

The total cost of John's physical therapy is $3000."
"First, let's determine how many pieces of gum Jim chews during the school day. Since he chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school and a school day lasts 8 hours, we can calculate the number of pieces he chews during school as follows:

\[ \text{Pieces chewed during school} = \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours/piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we account for the pieces he chews on the way home from school and after dinner:

\[ \text{Pieces chewed on the way home} = 1 \]
\[ \text{Pieces chewed after dinner} = 1 \]

Adding these together with the pieces chewed during school, we get:

\[ \text{Total pieces chewed} = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 \text{ pieces} \]

Jim starts with a 20-pack of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, the number of pieces remaining is:

\[ \text{Remaining pieces} = 20 - 6 = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

Jim then gives half of the remaining pieces to his sister right before bed:

\[ \text{Pieces given to sister} = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ pieces} \]

So, the number of pieces Jim has left at the end of the day is:

\[ \text{Pieces left} = 14 - 7 = 7 \text{ pieces} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 7 \]"

\[ 8 \text{ basketballs} \times \$14 \text{ per basketball} = \$112 \]

Now, to find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we subtract the amount spent by the baseball coach from the amount spent by the basketball coach:

\[ \$112 - \$27 = \$85 \]

So, the basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \$85 \]"
"To find out how many flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of flowers in the garden.
2. Determine the number of flowers that have bloomed based on the given fraction.

First, let's calculate the total number of flowers in the garden:
\[ \text{Total number of flowers} = \text{Number of rows} \times \text{Number of flowers per row} = 10 \times 20 = 200 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these flowers have bloomed. Since 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed, we can calculate this as follows:
\[ \text{Number of flowers that have bloomed} = \frac{4}{5} \times \text{Total number of flowers} = \frac{4}{5} \times 200 = 160 \]

So, the number of flowers in Arianna's garden that have bloomed is:
\[ 160 \]"
"First, we need to convert Ashley's internet connection speed from kilobytes per second (kb/s) to megabytes per second (Mb/s).

Given:
- Ashley's internet speed = 20 kb/s
- 1 Mb = 1000 kb

To convert kb/s to Mb/s, we divide the speed in kb/s by 1000:
\[ \text{Speed in Mb/s} = \frac{20 \text{ kb/s}}{1000} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \]

Next, we need to find out how much data Ashley can get in one hour. There are 3600 seconds in one hour.

\[ \text{Speed in Mb/hour} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \times 3600 \text{ s} \]

\[ \text{Speed in Mb/hour} = 72 \text{ Mb/hour} \]

So, Ashley’s internet connection speed in Mb per hour is 72 Mb/hour."
"To calculate the total number of cars towed by the tow truck over the week, we can break down the problem into two parts: the first three days and the last four days.

For the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day. Therefore, the total number of cars pulled in the first three days is:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

For the remaining four days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day than it did on the first three days. So, the number of cars pulled each day for the last four days is:
\[ 10 \text{ cars} - 4 \text{ cars} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]
Therefore, the total number of cars pulled in the last four days is:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Adding the number of cars pulled over the first three days and the last four days gives us the total number of cars towed that week:
\[ 30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 54 \]"
"First, we need to convert Adam's current height from inches to feet to compare it with the required height. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, Adam's height in feet is:

\[ 40 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{40}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The minimum height required to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. Therefore, Adam needs to grow:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Adam grows 2 inches per year, which is equivalent to \(\frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6}\) feet per year. To find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet, we divide \(\frac{2}{3}\) by \(\frac{1}{6}\):

\[ \frac{2}{3} \div \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = \frac{2 \times 6}{3 \times 1} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Therefore, Adam will be tall enough to ride the roller coaster in 4 years. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 cars James sold:
\[ \text{Total cost of cars} = 10 \times \$25,000 = \$250,000 \]

Next, we calculate the amount the company paid to acquire these cars:
\[ \text{Cost to acquire the cars} = 30\% \times \$250,000 = 0.30 \times \$250,000 = \$75,000 \]

Now, we find the total profit from selling the cars:
\[ \text{Total profit} = \text{Total cost of cars} - \text{Cost to acquire the cars} = \$250,000 - \$75,000 = \$175,000 \]

James gets a 10% commission on the profits:
\[ \text{James's commission} = 10\% \times \$175,000 = 0.10 \times \$175,000 = \$17,500 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$17,500 \]"
"First, let's determine how many riders can stay upright on the wave. Since only 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright, we calculate:

\[ 100 \times 0.25 = 25 \]

So, 25 riders can stay upright on the wave. Next, we need to find out how many of these 25 riders are women. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we calculate:

\[ 25 \times 0.60 = 15 \]

So, 15 riders are women who can stay upright. To find out how many of these 25 riders are men, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is 10. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 10 \]"
"First, let's find the price of the gold jewel. Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000 and the price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times as much as the price of a diamond jewel, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

\[
\text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600
\]

Next, we need to find the price of the silver jewel. The problem states that the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of the gold jewel. Therefore, we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

\[
\text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
\]

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond jewel, the gold jewel, and the silver jewel:

\[
\text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800
\]

The final numerical answer is:

\[

"First, let's determine the number of truck stamps Max bought. Since he bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, and he bought 16 snowflake stamps, the number of truck stamps is:

\[ 16 + 3 = 19 \]

Next, we need to find out how many rose stamps Max bought. He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so the number of rose stamps is:

\[ 19 - 9 = 10 \]

Now, we can find the total number of stamps Max bought by adding the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps together:

\[ 16 + 19 + 10 = 45 \]

So, the total number of stamps Max bought is:

\[ 45 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between him and Bob.

First, let's find the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap. Since Bob is driving at 55 mph and Tom is driving at 70 mph, Tom is gaining on Bob at a rate of:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is closing the 75-mile gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. To find the time it takes for Tom to close this gap, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

The final numerical answer is:

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 14."
"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the maximum cost per class and then find out how many classes he can attend without exceeding this cost.

First, let's denote the total cost of the 10 classes as \( C \). The total cost is given as $60. If the cost per class exceeds $10, they won't sign him up again. Therefore, we need to find the maximum number of classes \( n \) such that the cost per class is not more than $10.

The cost per class if he attends \( n \) classes is:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{n} \]

We need this cost to be less than or equal to $10:
\[ \frac{60}{n} \leq 10 \]

Solving for \( n \):
\[ 60 \leq 10n \]
\[ n \geq 6 \]

This means Manny can miss up to \( 10 - 6 = 4 \) classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \]"
"To determine the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we first need to find out how many customers each of them processes in a day.

Given that Jewel processes 50 customers per day, and Julie processes twice as many customers as Jewel, we can calculate the number of customers Julie processes per day as follows:
\[ \text{Customers processed by Julie per day} = 2 \times \text{Customers processed by Jewel per day} = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of customers processed by each of them in a week (7 days):
\[ \text{Total customers processed by Jewel in a week} = 50 \times 7 = 350 \]
\[ \text{Total customers processed by Julie in a week} = 100 \times 7 = 700 \]

Finally, we add the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel in a week to find the total weekly production:
\[ \text{Total weekly production} = \text{Total customers processed by Jewel in a week} + \text{Total customers processed by Julie in a week} = 350 + 700 = 1050 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1050 \]"

Next, we know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. So, to find out how many miles Lynn ran, we subtract 3 miles from Reggie's distance:

\[ \text{Lynn's distance} = \text{Reggie's distance} - 3 = 20 - 3 = 17 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 17 \]"
"First, let's find the cost of one apple and one orange.

The cost of four apples is $5.20, so the cost of one apple is:
\[ \text{Cost of one apple} = \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \]

The cost of three oranges is $3.30, so the cost of one orange is:
\[ \text{Cost of one orange} = \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \]

Now, we need to find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

The cost of 5 apples is:
\[ \text{Cost of 5 apples} = 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \]

The cost of 5 oranges is:
\[ \text{Cost of 5 oranges} = 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \]

So, Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the hole:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel one cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) it will take him to dig the hole is:

\[ T = \text{volume} \times \text{time per cubic foot} \]
\[ T = 72 \times 3 = 216 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of each additional feature:

1. King cab upgrade: $7,500
2. Leather seats: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so $7,500 / 3 = $2,500
3. Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats, so $2,500 - $500 = $2,000
4. Upgraded exterior light package: $1,500

Now, let's sum up the costs of these features:

Total cost of additional features = $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $13,500

Finally, we add the base price of the truck to the total cost of the additional features:

"To determine the total time Bill will take to dig the well, we need to calculate the time taken to dig through the soil and the time taken to dig through the clay separately, and then sum these times.

First, let's calculate the time to dig through the soil:
- Bill digs at a rate of 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He needs to dig 24 feet of soil.

\[
\text{Time to dig through soil} = \frac{\text{Distance through soil}}{\text{Rate through soil}} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the sales from green hats in the first month:**
   - The sales from red hats in the first month were $400.
   - The sales from green hats in the first month were twice the sales from red hats.
   - Therefore, the sales from green hats in the first month = $400 * 2 = $800.

2. **Calculate the total sales for the first month:**
   - Total sales in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
   - Total sales in the first month = $400 + $800 = $1200.

3. **Determine the sales from green hats in the second month:**
   - The sales from green hats in the second month were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month.
   - Therefore, the sales from green hats in the second month = $1200 * 3/4 = $900.

4. **Calculate the total sales for the second month:**
   - Total sales in the second month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
   - Sales from red hats in the second month = 1/2 of the sales from red hats in the first month = $400 * 1/2 = $200.
   - Total sales in the second month = $200 + $900 = $1100.

5. **Calculate the total sales for the two months:**
   - Total sales for the two months = Total sales in the first month + Total sales in the second month
   - Total sales for the two months = $1200 + $1100 = $2300.

The final numerical answer is $2300."
"To determine how much James paid for the horse-drawn carriage, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total time hired:**
   - James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM.
   - Total time hired = 9 PM - 5 PM = 4 hours.

2. **Account for the free hour:**
   - James gets 1 hour free.
   - Effective paid hours = Total time hired - Free hour = 4 hours - 1 hour = 3 hours.

3. **Calculate the cost for each paid hour:**
   - The first paid hour costs $15.
   - Each subsequent hour costs twice the previous hour's cost.
   - Cost for the first hour = $15.
   - Cost for the second hour = 2 * $15 = $30.
   - Cost for the third hour = 2 * $30 = $60.

4. **Sum the costs of the paid hours:**
   - Total cost = Cost of the first hour + Cost of the second hour + Cost of the third hour
   - Total cost = $15 + $30 + $60 = $105.

Therefore, James paid $105 for the horse-drawn carriage."
"To determine how many dollars were withheld from Sally’s wage, we need to calculate the difference between the amount in her bank account at the end of the week and the amount she should have in her bank account if she had received her full weekly wage.

The amount in her bank account at the end of the week is $420.
The amount she should have in her bank account if she had received her full weekly wage is $300.

The difference, which represents the amount withheld, is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Amount withheld} = \text{Amount in bank account at the end of the week} - \text{Amount she should have} \]
\[ \text{Amount withheld} = 420 - 300 \]
\[ \text{Amount withheld} = 120 \]

So, the number of dollars withheld from Sally’s wage is $120."
"First, let's determine the total number of deviled egg halves Lori needs. Since each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves and she is inviting 16 guests, the total number of deviled egg halves is:

\[ 16 \text{ guests} \times 3 \text{ deviled egg halves/guest} = 48 \text{ deviled egg halves} \]

Next, we need to find out how many whole eggs are required. Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, the number of whole eggs needed is:

\[ \frac{48 \text{ deviled egg halves}}{2 \text{ deviled egg halves/whole egg}} = 24 \text{ whole eggs} \]

Now, we need to convert the number of whole eggs into dozens. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, the number of dozens of eggs Lori needs is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ whole eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozen} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading, we need to calculate the total number of days it will take him to read the entire 200-page book at a rate of 10 pages per day.

The total number of days required can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by the number of pages Mike plans to read per day:

\[
\text{Total days required} = \frac{\text{Total pages}}{\text{Pages per day}} = \frac{200 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ pages/day}} = 20 \text{ days}
\]

Since the assignment is to be completed within 30 days, we can find out how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading by subtracting the total days required from the deadline:

\[
\text{Days before deadline} = \text{Deadline} - \text{Total days required} = 30 \text{ days} - 20 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ days}
\]

So, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline."
"To determine the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to consider both the initial cost of the plane and the monthly expenses.

1. **Initial Cost of the Plane:**
   - The plane costs $150,000.

2. **Monthly Rent for the Hanger:**
   - James pays $5,000 per month to rent the hanger.

3. **Monthly Cost for Fuel:**
   - James spends twice as much on fuel as he does on rent, so the monthly fuel cost is $5,000 * 2 = $10,000.

4. **Total Monthly Expenses:**
   - The total monthly expenses are the sum of the rent and the fuel cost, which is $5,000 + $10,000 = $15,000.

5. **Annual Expenses:**
   - To find the annual expenses, we multiply the total monthly expenses by 12 months: $15,000 * 12 = $180,000.

6. **Total Cost for the First Year:**
   - The total cost for the first year includes the initial cost of the plane plus the annual expenses: $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000.

Therefore, the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is $330,000."
"First, let's determine the cooking times for each item:

- It took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice.
- It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so the cooking time for pork is \(30 + 20 = 50\) minutes.
- The beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is \(30 + 50 = 80\) minutes. Therefore, the cooking time for beans is \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) minutes.

Now, we sum up the cooking times for all the items:
- Rice: 30 minutes
- Pork: 50 minutes
- Beans: 40 minutes

The total cooking time is \(30 + 50 + 40 = 120\) minutes.

We know that:
1. Sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs.
2. Sheep have 1 head and geese have 1 head.
3. The total number of animal legs is 70.
4. The total number of animal heads is 20.

From the information given, we can set up the following equations:
\[ 4S + 2G = 70 \]
\[ S + G = 20 \]

We can solve these equations step by step. First, we can simplify the first equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( 2S + G = 35 \)
2. \( S + G = 20 \)

We can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate \( G \):
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep is \( S = 15 \).

"Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs. When there are 8 more dogs, he needs to buy toys for these additional dogs. Since each dog needs one toy, he needs 8 more toys. So, after the first purchase, he has 4 (initial toys) + 8 (additional toys) = 12 toys.

When James came back, there were twice as many more dogs than when he left, which means there were 8 * 2 = 16 more dogs. So, he needs to buy toys for these 16 dogs. After this purchase, he has 12 (toys after first purchase) + 16 (additional toys) = 28 toys.

However, when James came back again, 3 dogs were gone, so he no longer needed those toys. Therefore, he had to return 3 toys. So, the total number of toys he needs is 28 (toys after second purchase) - 3 (returned toys) = 25 toys.

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( Tr \).

Given that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can write:
\[ T = Tr + 7 \]

Also, we know that the combined ages of the twins and the triplets are 44:
\[ T + T + Tr + Tr + Tr = 44 \]
\[ 2T + 3Tr = 44 \]

Substituting \( T = Tr + 7 \) into the equation:
\[ 2(Tr + 7) + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 2Tr + 14 + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr = 30 \]
\[ Tr = 6 \]

Now, substituting \( Tr = 6 \) back into the equation \( T = Tr + 7 \):
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, one of the twins is 13 years old. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 13 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time John needs to complete his homework:

- Math homework: 20 minutes
- Reading homework: 40 minutes
- History homework: 20 minutes

Total homework time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, 3 hours is equal to 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's find out how many minutes John has left for a nap:

Total minutes before dinner - Total homework time = Minutes for nap
180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes

"First, let's determine the cost of the lollipops and candies Manolo bought.

Given:
- Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for $3.20.
- Each lollipop costs $0.40.

Calculate the total cost of the lollipops:
\[ 5 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.40 \text{ per lollipop} = \$2.00 \]

Now, subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of the candies:
\[ \$3.20 - \$2.00 = \$1.20 \]

Since the cost of four candies is $1.20, we can find the cost of one candy:
\[ \frac{\$1.20}{4 \text{ candies}} = \$0.30 \text{ per candy} \]

Now, calculate the cost of 10 lollipops:
\[ 10 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.40 \text{ per lollipop} = \$4.00 \]

And the cost of 10 candies:
\[ 10 \text{ candies} \times \$0.30 \text{ per candy} = \$3.00 \]

Finally, add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies to find the total cost:
\[ \$4.00 + \$3.00 = \$7.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$7.00 \]"
"First, let's determine how many coins Rong has saved in ten years. Since Rong saves 20 coins every month, in ten years (which is 120 months), he will have saved:

\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Next, we need to find out how many coins Neil has saved in ten years. Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong per month. Therefore, Neil saves:

\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \text{ coins/month} \right) = 20 \text{ coins/month} + 8 \text{ coins/month} = 28 \text{ coins/month} \]

In ten years, Neil will have saved:

\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Now, to find the total number of coins they have together after ten years, we add the coins saved by Rong and Neil:

\[ 2400 \text{ coins} + 3360 \text{ coins} = 5760 \text{ coins} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Since each vaccine costs $20 and John needs 2 vaccines, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \]

Next, let's denote the cost of the heartworm check as \( H \). According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as \( T \). Therefore, we have:
\[ H = 0.6T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + H \]

Since \( H = 0.6T \), we can substitute \( H \) in the total bill equation:
\[ T = 40 + 0.6T \]

To find \( T \), we need to solve the equation:
\[ T - 0.6T = 40 \]
\[ 0.4T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.4} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, let's determine the price of each type of fruit:

- The price of one apple is $0.5.
- The price of one banana is twice the price of one apple, so it is \(2 \times 0.5 = $1.0\).
- The price of one orange is three times the price of one banana, so it is \(3 \times 1.0 = $3.0\).

Next, we calculate the total cost for one crate of fruit, which contains 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges:

- The cost for 5 bananas is \(5 \times 1.0 = $5.0\).
- The cost for 12 apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = $6.0\).
- The cost for 7 oranges is \(7 \times 3.0 = $21.0\).

Adding these costs together gives the total price for one crate of fruit:

- White squares: 24 - 12 = 12

Now, let's find the total number of squares on the comforter:

Total squares = Red squares + Blue squares + Green squares + White squares
Total squares = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12
Total squares = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is equal to the total number of squares. Therefore, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate how much Greta puts into her retirement account. She puts 50% of her $2400.00 paycheck into her retirement account:

\[ 2400 \times 0.50 = 1200 \]

So, she has $1200 left after putting money into her retirement account.

Next, we calculate how much she uses for her monthly car payment. She uses 20% of her $2400.00 paycheck for her car payment:

\[ 2400 \times 0.20 = 480 \]

So, she has $2400 - $1200 (retirement) - $480 (car payment) left to spend:

\[ 2400 - 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Greta has left to spend is $720."
"To determine how many pairs of pencils are in the box, we first need to find out how many pencils are actually in the box. If the box can hold 20 pencils and 4 are missing, then the number of pencils in the box is:

"First, let's determine the capacity of Gordy's truck. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, we can calculate Gordy's truck capacity as follows:

\[ \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = 4000 + 800 = 4800 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that the combined capacity of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks is 11,600 pounds. Let's denote Gary's truck capacity by \( G \). Therefore, we can write the equation for the total capacity as:

\[ 4000 + 4800 + G = 11600 \]

Now, we solve for \( G \):

\[ 8800 + G = 11600 \]
\[ G = 11600 - 8800 \]
\[ G = 2800 \]

So, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel. The final numerical answer is:

"If each female ate 3 dumplings and there are 6 females, then the total number of dumplings eaten by the females is:

\[ 6 \text{ females} \times 3 \text{ dumplings/female} = 18 \text{ dumplings} \]

Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, each male ate:

\[ 3 \text{ dumplings/female} + 1 \text{ dumpling} = 4 \text{ dumplings/male} \]

With 8 males, the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is:

\[ 8 \text{ males} \times 4 \text{ dumplings/male} = 32 \text{ dumplings} \]

Adding the dumplings eaten by the males and the females gives the total number of dumplings cooked:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money the firefighters have left to raise and then calculate how many additional hours they need to work to reach their goal.

1. The total goal is $6300.
2. After 3 hours, they have raised $2100.
3. Therefore, the remaining amount to be raised is $6300 - $2100 = $4200.
4. They need to raise $4200 in equal amounts per hour.

Since they raise an equal amount each hour, we divide the remaining amount by the number of hours they have already worked to find the amount raised per hour:
\[ \text{Amount raised per hour} = \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

Now, to find out how many more hours they need to work to raise the remaining $4200:
\[ \text{Additional hours needed} = \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

Adding the initial 3 hours to the additional hours needed:

"To find the percent of the river's total water that is used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the percentage of water used by the city for industrial purposes.
2. Subtract the industrial usage percentage from 100% to find the non-industrial usage percentage.

First, we know that Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. Out of this 40%, 80% is used for industrial purposes. Therefore, the percentage of water used by the city for industrial purposes is:
\[ 40\% \times 80\% = 40\% \times 0.80 = 32\% \]

Next, to find the percentage of water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the industrial usage percentage from 100%:
\[ 100\% - 32\% = 68\% \]

So, the percent of the river's total water that is used by the city for non-industrial purposes is 68%."

"First, let's determine the production rate for each type of ice cream.

For chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for chocolate ice cream is \( \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

For vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for vanilla ice cream is \( \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Now, we calculate the total production for 48 hours.

For chocolate ice cream in 48 hours:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of taps Helga makes with both her feet over the 5-minute period, considering the different tap rates when her arms are raised and when they are at her sides.

First, let's calculate the number of taps when her arms are at her sides:
- Right foot taps at 300 taps per minute.
- Left foot taps at 250 taps per minute.
- Total taps per minute when arms are at her sides: \(300 + 250 = 550\) taps per minute.
- Total taps in 5 minutes when arms are at her sides: \(550 \times 5 = 2750\) taps.

Next, let's calculate the number of taps when her arms are raised:
- Right foot taps at 200 taps per minute.
- Left foot taps at 200 taps per minute.
- Total taps per minute when arms are raised: \(200 + 200 = 400\) taps per minute.
- Total taps in 3 minutes when arms are raised: \(400 \times 3 = 1200\) taps.

Now, we add the taps from both scenarios to get the total number of taps:
- Total taps when arms are at her sides: 2750 taps.
- Total taps when arms are raised: 1200 taps.
- Combined total number of taps: \(2750 + 1200 = 3950\) taps.

The final numerical answer is:
3950"
"First, let's calculate the total cost if Ron fixes the pothole himself. 

The cost of fixing the pothole is $450.
The cost of 3 buckets of asphalt is $25 per bucket, so the total cost for the asphalt is \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.

Therefore, the total cost for Ron to fix the pothole himself is:
\[ 450 + 75 = 525 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to consider the fine he would have to pay if he fixes the pothole himself. The fine is $120.

So, the net cost for Ron if he fixes the pothole himself is:
\[ 525 - 120 = 405 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself compared to the damage it would cause to his car. The damage to his car is $450.

The amount of money Ron saves is:
\[ 450 - 405 = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

150 normal chairs + 10 baby chairs = 160 chairs.

So, the final numerical answer is 160."
"First, let's determine the total number of slices of pizza ordered. Since there are 5 people (Bryce and his four friends) and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate how many slices Bryce and two of his friends ate. They ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizzas:
\[ 2 \times 12 \times \frac{2}{3} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Then, we calculate how many slices the remaining two friends ate. They ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizzas:
\[ 2 \times 12 \times \frac{3}{4} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Now, we find the total number of slices eaten by all five people:
\[ 16 + 18 = 34 \]

Finally, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices ordered to find out how many slices are left:
\[ 60 - 34 = 26 \]

So, the number of slices of pizza left is:
\[ 26 \]"
"First, let's determine the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages. The cat takes 30 minutes to eat nine sausages. The dog can eat the same number of sausages in \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the time it takes the cat. Therefore, the time it takes for the dog to eat nine sausages is:

\[ \text{Time for dog} = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. The average time is calculated by adding the time taken by the cat and the dog, and then dividing by 2:

\[ \text{Average time} = \frac{\text{Time for cat} + \text{Time for dog}}{2} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes} \]

"First, let's convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, Topher's shoe length of 8-feet and 4-inches is:

\[ 8 \times 12 + 4 = 96 + 4 = 100 \text{ inches} \]

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( x \) inches. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches. The final numerical answer is:

- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.
- A quarter of the students' cars' windows is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64\) windows.
- Hannah also smashes three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows.
- Three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48\) windows.

Finally, the total number of windows smashed by Hannah is the sum of the windows smashed from the students' cars and the teachers' cars:
- Total windows smashed = \(64 + 48 = 112\).

The final numerical answer is 112."
"To find the percentage of blue spools, we first need to calculate the total number of spools and the total number of blue spools.

Candy has:
- 15 light blue spools
- 45 dark blue spools
- 40 light green spools
- 50 dark green spools

The total number of spools is:
\[ 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150 \]

The total number of blue spools is:
\[ 15 + 45 = 60 \]

To find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 \]

"At 8:00, there were 5000 people lined up to vote. By midday (12:00), 2/5 of the people had voted.

First, calculate the number of people who voted by midday:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000 \]

So, the number of people who had not voted by midday is:
\[ 5000 - 2000 = 3000 \]

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. The remaining people after midday were 3000, so 2/3 of 3000 voted by 16:00:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000 \]

Therefore, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is:

"To determine how many packs of gum Parker will need for 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will chew in 30 days.
2. Determine how many packs of gum are needed based on the total number of pieces.

First, we calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will chew in 30 days:
\[ \text{Total pieces of gum} = \text{Pieces per day} \times \text{Number of days} \]
\[ \text{Total pieces of gum} = 4 \times 30 = 120 \]

Next, we determine how many packs of gum are needed. Since each pack contains 15 pieces of gum:
\[ \text{Number of packs} = \frac{\text{Total pieces of gum}}{\text{Pieces per pack}} \]
\[ \text{Number of packs} = \frac{120}{15} = 8 \]

Therefore, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

"First, let's determine Dora's father's age. According to the problem, Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. Since Dora is 15 years old, we can calculate her father's age as follows:

\[
\text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8 = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38
\]

Next, we need to find Dora's mother's age. The problem states that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. Therefore, we can calculate her mother's age as follows:

\[
\text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4 = 38 - 4 = 34
\]

Now, we can find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother by adding their ages together:

\[
\text{Total combined age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87

"First, let's calculate the total weight of Cindy's math and science books. Since each of these books weighs 2 pounds and there are two of them, the total weight for the math and science books is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds/book} \times 2 \text{ books} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know the weight of her French book is 4 pounds and her English book is 3 pounds. So, the total weight of her French and English books is:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} + 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Her history book weighs twice as much as her English book. Since her English book weighs 3 pounds, the weight of her history book is:

"First, let's calculate the number of votes candidate B received. Candidate A got 20% of the votes, and candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes.

Candidate A's votes = 20% of 100 = 0.20 * 100 = 20 votes

Candidate B's votes = Candidate A's votes + 50% of Candidate A's votes
Candidate B's votes = 20 + 0.50 * 20 = 20 + 10 = 30 votes

Now, let's calculate the total votes received by candidates A and B combined:
Total votes for A and B = Candidate A's votes + Candidate B's votes
Total votes for A and B = 20 + 30 = 50 votes

The rest of the votes were given to candidate C. Since there were 100 voters in total, the number of votes candidate C received is:
Votes for candidate C = Total votes - Total votes for A and B
Votes for candidate C = 100 - 50 = 50 votes

So, the final numerical answer is 50."
"First, let's determine how many apples Beck has initially. Since Boris has 100 apples and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, we can calculate the number of apples Beck has as follows:

\[ \text{Beck's initial apples} = \text{Boris's apples} - 23 = 100 - 23 = 77 \]

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. So, we need to update the number of apples each person has after this transaction:

\[ \text{Boris's apples after giving 10 to Beck} = 100 - 10 = 90 \]
\[ \text{Beck's apples after receiving 10 from Boris} = 77 + 10 = 87 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after this transaction:

\[ \text{Difference in apples} = \text{Boris's apples} - \text{Beck's apples} = 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many students would be in each group if the activity is divided into 12 groups.

First, we find out how many students would be in each group if there are 12 groups:
\[ \text{Number of students per group} = \frac{54 \text{ students}}{12 \text{ groups}} = 4.5 \text{ students per group} \]

Since the number of students per group must be a whole number, and we cannot have half a student in a group, it is not possible to divide 54 students into 12 groups of equal size. Therefore, the question is asking for the number of additional groups needed to form, but since the current number of students cannot be evenly divided into 12 groups, the answer is that it is not possible.

However, if we interpret the question as asking how many more groups are needed to form if we start with 6 groups and need to increase to 12 groups, we can calculate the difference:
\[ \text{Additional groups needed} = 12 \text{ groups} - 6 \text{ groups} = 6 \text{ groups} \]

So, the number of additional groups needed is:

\[ 48 - 6 = 42 \text{ plates} \]

Now, we add the number of glasses and plates that are not broken to find the total number of glasses and plates Jeff has now:
\[ 86 + 42 = 128 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 128 \]"
"First, let's determine how many small stickers Lorraine trades for large buttons. She starts with 30 small stickers and trades 90% of them:

\[ 30 \times 0.90 = 27 \text{ small stickers} \]

Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons from trading 27 small stickers.

Next, let's calculate how many large stickers she trades for large buttons. She starts with 40 large stickers and trades 50% of them:

\[ 40 \times 0.50 = 20 \text{ large stickers} \]

Since each large button is worth three small buttons, and each large sticker is worth one large button, she trades 20 large stickers for large buttons. Each large sticker is worth one large button, and each large button is worth three small buttons, so each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons. Therefore, 20 large stickers are worth:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ small buttons} \]

Now, let's determine how many small stickers she has left after trading 27 small stickers. She started with 30 small stickers and traded 27:

\[ 30 - 27 = 3 \text{ small stickers} \]

She trades the remaining 3 small stickers for large buttons. Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 3 small buttons from trading 3 small stickers. These 3 small buttons can be traded for large buttons. Since each large button is worth three small buttons, 3 small buttons are worth:

\[ \frac{3}{3} = 1 \text{ large button} \]

So, she trades 3 small stickers for 1 large button. Now, let's calculate the total number of large buttons she has. Initially, she had 40 large stickers, traded 20 for large buttons, and got 1 more from trading 3 small stickers:

\[ 40 - 20 + 1 = 21 \text{ large buttons} \]

Adding the 60 large buttons she already had from trading 20 large stickers:

\[ 21 + 60 = 81 \text{ large buttons} \]

Since each large button is worth three small buttons, the total number of small buttons she has is:

\[ 81 \times 3 = 243 \text{ small buttons} \]

Therefore, the total number of buttons she has by the end is:

\[ 81 \text{ large buttons} + 243 \text{ small buttons} = 324 \text{ buttons} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{324} \]"
"To determine the total number of matches Joey played in one week, we need to add up the matches he played on each day of the week.

- On Monday, Joey played 2 matches.
- On Friday, Joey played 1 match.
- On Saturday, Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday. Since he played 2 matches on Monday, on Saturday he played \(2 \times 2 = 4\) matches.

Now, we sum the matches played each day:
\[ 2 \text{ (Monday)} + 1 \text{ (Friday)} + 4 \text{ (Saturday)} = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of matches Joey played in one week is 7.

\[
\boxed{7}

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x \). The total number of votes cast is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is \( x + 2x = 3x \).

We know the total number of people on the council is 33, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x \):
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Thus, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 22 \).

\[
\boxed{22}

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Extra-small (XS) shirts**: 11 students need size extra-small.
2. **Small (S) shirts**: Twice as many students need size small as extra small. Therefore, the number of students needing size small is \(2 \times 11 = 22\).
3. **Medium (M) shirts**: Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size medium is \(22 - 4 = 18\).
4. **Large (L) shirts**: Half as many students need size large as size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size large is \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\).
5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts**: Six more students need size extra-large than large. Therefore, the number of students needing size extra-large is \(9 + 6 = 15\).

Now, we sum up the number of students needing each size to find the total number of shirts ordered:

\[
11 \text{ (XS)} + 22 \text{ (S)} + 18 \text{ (M)} + 9 \text{ (L)} + 15 \text{ (XL)} = 75
\]

So, the total number of shirts Krissa ordered is 75."
"To find the final price after a 5% discount on a $140 item, we first need to calculate the amount of the discount and then subtract it from the original price.

The discount amount is calculated as:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Original Price} \times \frac{\text{Discount Percentage}}{100} \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 140 \times \frac{5}{100} = 140 \times 0.05 = 7 \]

Now, subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the final price:
\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount Amount} \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 140 - 7 = 133 \]

So, the final price after the discount is $133."
"To find the total number of hours the 20 playlists will last, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of songs across all playlists.
2. Calculate the total number of hours by multiplying the total number of songs by the length of each song.

First, let's calculate the total number of songs:
- Each playlist has 300 songs.
- John has 20 playlists.

Total number of songs = 300 songs/playlist * 20 playlists = 6000 songs.

Next, let's calculate the total number of hours:
- Each song is 10 hours long.

Total number of hours = 6000 songs * 10 hours/song = 60000 hours.

So, the 20 playlists will last a total of 60000 hours."
"First, let's find out how many people think horse #2 will win. 

20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win:
\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \text{ people} \]

Next, we need to find out how many people are left after those who think horse #2 will win:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ people} \]

Now, 60% of the remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win:
\[ 0.60 \times 40 = 24 \text{ people} \]

The rest of the people think horse #12 will win. To find out how many people that is, we subtract the number of people who think horse #7 will win from the remaining people:
\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \text{ people} \]

So, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is 16."
"To find the total number of puppies Jana has, we can work backwards from the information given.

We know that one third of the Pomeranian puppies are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. Therefore, the total number of Pomeranian puppies is:

\[ \text{Total Pomeranian puppies} = 6 \times 3 = 18 \]

Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can set up the following equation to find the total number of puppies (let's call this number \( P \)):

\[ \frac{2}{3} P = 18 \]

To find \( P \), we solve the equation:

\[ P = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 27 \]

So, Jana has 27 puppies in total."
"First, let's determine how much money Jayden has after his sister gives him half of her allowance.

Ava's allowance is $90, so half of that is:
\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

Jayden initially had $70, and his sister gave him $45, so now Jayden has:
\[ 70 + 45 = 115 \]

The camera costs $200, so the amount of money Jayden still needs is:
\[ 200 - 115 = 85 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 85 \]"
"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The first house needs \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the second house, so the first house needs \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases.
- The third house needs double the first house, so the third house needs \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) cases.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{5}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{5} \):
\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{5} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. The third house needs double the first house, which is:
\[ 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = 2 \times \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 100 \]"

"To find out how many fruits George has, we first need to calculate the number of pears he has. Given that George has 45% more pears than bananas, and he has 200 bananas, we can calculate the number of pears as follows:

Number of pears = Number of bananas + 45% of the number of bananas
Number of pears = 200 + 0.45 * 200
Number of pears = 200 + 90
Number of pears = 290

Now, to find the total number of fruits, we add the number of bananas and the number of pears:

Total number of fruits = Number of bananas + Number of pears
Total number of fruits = 200 + 290
Total number of fruits = 490

So, the final numerical answer is 490."

"To determine how much money Sam would have to spend to make 4 liters of juice, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of oranges needed for 4 liters of juice.
2. Calculate the cost of the oranges needed.

First, we know that 1 liter of juice requires 5 kilograms of oranges. Therefore, for 4 liters of juice, Sam would need:
\[ 4 \text{ liters} \times 5 \text{ kg/liter} = 20 \text{ kg} \]

Next, we know that each kilogram of oranges costs $3. Therefore, the cost for 20 kilograms of oranges is:
\[ 20 \text{ kg} \times 3 \text{ dollars/kg} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Sam would have to spend to make 4 liters of juice is:

"First, let's determine how many books Ahmed read in one hour. According to the problem, Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in one hour. Since Ezra read 300 books, we can set up the following equation to find out how many books Ahmed read:

\[ \text{Ahmed's books} = \frac{\text{Ezra's books}}{2} = \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

So, Ahmed read 150 books in one hour.

Next, we need to find out how many books Ezra will have read after reading an additional 150 books. Since Ezra has already read 300 books and will read 150 more, the total number of books Ezra will have read is:

\[ \text{Ezra's total books} = 300 + 150 = 450 \]

Now, we can find the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed together. Adding the books read by Ezra and Ahmed, we get:

\[ \text{Total books} = \text{Ezra's total books} + \text{Ahmed's books} = 450 + 150 = 600 \]

Therefore, the total number of books read by Ezra and Ahmed altogether is:

"To calculate Tanya's earnings for the two days, we need to break down her earnings for each day and then sum them up.

**Monday:**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She also earns an additional $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Monday:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} \times 5 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 20 \times 5 \times 15 = \$1500 \]

Next, calculate the additional earnings for Monday:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} > 3 \text{ classes} \]
\[ \text{Additional earnings} = \$5 \]

So, Tanya's total earnings for Monday are:
\[ \$1500 + \$5 = \$1505 \]

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She does not earn the additional $5 per day since she does not teach more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Wednesday:
\[ 2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 2 \times 2 \times 15 = \$60 \]

Since she does not teach more than 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5 per day.

So, Tanya's total earnings for Wednesday are:
\[ \$60 \]

Now, sum up the earnings for both days:
\[ \$1505 + \$60 = \$1565 \]

Therefore, Tanya earned a total of \$1565 for these two days of teaching."

"First, let's calculate the total amount Bennet makes from selling the eggplants.

He sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total amount from the eggplants is:
\[ 20 \text{ eggplants} \times \$3/\text{eggplant} = \$60 \]

Bennet wants to make a total of $135. To find out how much more he needs to make from selling the corn, we subtract the amount he already has from the total he wants to make:
\[ \$135 - \$60 = \$75 \]

Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the remaining amount he needs by the number of ears of corn:
\[ \frac{\$75}{25 \text{ ears}} = \$3/\text{ear} \]

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$3 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total hours Tatiana has available over the weekend:

\[ \text{Total hours} = 7 \text{ (Saturday)} + 5 \text{ (Sunday)} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we subtract the time she spends reading:

\[ \text{Remaining time after reading} = 12 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

She plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time:

\[ \text{Time spent on video games} = \frac{1}{3} \times 9 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the time she spends playing soccer:

\[ \text{Time spent on soccer} = \text{Remaining time after reading} - \text{Time spent on video games} = 9 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we calculate the percentage of the weekend Tatiana spends playing soccer:

\[ \text{Percentage of weekend spent on soccer} = \left( \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{12 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100\% = 50\% \]

"To determine how long Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time he spends driving to the museum and the time he spends driving back home, and then add the time he spends at the museum.

First, let's calculate the time spent driving to the museum. The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and Jack drives at a speed of 75 mph. The time spent driving to the museum is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time spent driving to the museum is:

\[ \text{Time to museum} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Since the trip back home is the same distance and at the same speed, the time spent driving back home is also 2 hours.

Now, we add the time spent driving to the museum, the time spent driving back home, and the time spent at the museum:

\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time to museum} + \text{Time back home} + \text{Time at the museum} \]
\[ \text{Total time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

So, Jack is gone from home for a total of 10 hours."

"First, let's break down the information given:

- Mike has 600 movies in total.
- A third of the movies are in various series, which means \( \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \) movies are in series.
- The remaining movies are \( 600 - 200 = 400 \) movies.
- 40% of the remaining 400 movies are older movies, which means \( 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \) movies are older.
- The remaining movies are \( 400 - 160 = 240 \) movies, which are not in series and not older.
- A third of the series movies can be bought for $6, so the cost for the series movies is $6.
- The cost of a normal movie is $10.
- The cost of an older movie is $5.

Now, let's calculate the cost for the remaining movies:

- The cost for the 240 normal movies is \( 240 \times 10 = 2400 \).
- The cost for the 160 older movies is \( 160 \times 5 = 800 \).

Adding these costs together with the cost of the series movies:

"First, let's calculate the distance the Llesis family drove. They drove for 6 hours at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.

\[ \text{Distance driven} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 50 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, let's determine the hiking speed. The hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half the driving speed.

\[ \text{Hiking speed} = \frac{50}{2} - 5 = 25 - 5 = 20 \, \text{miles/hour} \]

Given that they hiked for 1.5 hours at this speed, we can calculate the distance they hiked.

\[ \text{Distance hiked} = \text{Hiking speed} \times \text{Time} = 20 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, to find the total distance to their vacation spot, we add the distance driven and the distance hiked.

\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance driven} + \text{Distance hiked} = 300 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 330 \, \text{miles} \]

"Let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumps on as \( E_e \) and the number of berries she collects as \( B_e \). Ava jumps on \( E_a = E_e + 8 \) enemies and collects \( B_a = B_e + 3 \) berries. Emma's score can be represented as \( S_e = 10E_e + 5B_e \), and Ava's score can be represented as \( S_a = 10E_a + 5B_a + 30 \times 4 \).

Substituting the values for \( E_a \) and \( B_a \) into Ava's score equation, we get:
\[ S_a = 10(E_e + 8) + 5(B_e + 3) + 120 \]
\[ S_a = 10E_e + 80 + 5B_e + 15 + 120 \]
\[ S_a = 10E_e + 5B_e + 215 \]

Since Emma's score is \( S_e = 10E_e + 5B_e \), the difference between Ava's score and Emma's score is:
\[ S_a - S_e = (10E_e + 5B_e + 215) - (10E_e + 5B_e) \]
\[ S_a - S_e = 215 \]

Therefore, the difference between their two scores is 215 points."

"To solve this, let's break down the problem into parts:

1. **Normal Days (3 days):** They ride their bikes thrice a day.
   - Number of rides per normal day = 3
   - Number of normal days = 3
   - Total rides on normal days = 3 rides/day * 3 days = 9 rides

2. **Special Days (2 days):** They ride their bikes twice the times they do on normal days.
   - Number of rides per special day = 2 * 3 = 6 rides
   - Number of special days = 2
   - Total rides on special days = 6 rides/day * 2 days = 12 rides

3. **Total rides in a week:**
   - Total rides = rides on normal days + rides on special days
   - Total rides = 9 rides + 12 rides = 21 rides

"Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as \( w \) and the number of orange fish he bought as \( o \). We know that the total number of fish he bought from the pet store is \( o + w = 17 \).

After adding these fish to his pond, the total number of orange fish became \( 3 + o \) and the total number of white fish became \( 4 + w \). According to the problem, after adding the new fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish. This gives us the equation:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( o + w = 17 \)
2. \( 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \)

Let's solve the second equation first:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]
\[ 3 + o = 8 + 2w \]
\[ o - 2w = 5 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( o + w = 17 \)
2. \( o - 2w = 5 \)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use elimination. First, we can eliminate \( o \) by subtracting the second equation from the first:
\[ (o + w) - (o - 2w) = 17 - 5 \]
\[ o + w - o + 2w = 12 \]
\[ 3w = 12 \]
\[ w = 4 \]

Now that we have \( w = 4 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( o \):
\[ o + 4 = 17 \]
\[ o = 13 \]

"First, let's calculate the total distance Andy travels in a week. Since he goes to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days. The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, so the round trip distance is \(5 \times 2 = 10\) miles per day. Therefore, the total distance he travels in a week is \(10 \times 5 = 50\) miles.

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of gas Andy consumes in a week. Given that his car's fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon, the number of gallons consumed per week is \( \frac{50 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons} \).

Finally, we calculate the cost of the gas consumed in a week. If the price of gas is $3 per gallon, then the cost for 5 gallons is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is 15."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie received from her aunt.

Carrie received ten twenties, which means she received:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Carrie also received 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount from the quarters is:
\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie spent. She spent all the quarters, which is $35, and 3/5 of the twenties. The amount spent on the twenties is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = \frac{3 \times 200}{5} = \frac{600}{5} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

The total amount of money spent is the sum of the money spent on quarters and the money spent on twenties:
\[ 35 + 120 = 155 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is:
\[ \boxed{155} \]"
"To find out how many fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to calculate the total yield from the tomato plants and the eggplant plants separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the total yield from the tomato plants:
- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo planted 5 tomato plants.

\[
\text{Total tomatoes} = 5 \text{ plants} \times 22 \text{ tomatoes/plant} = 110 \text{ tomatoes}
\]

Next, let's calculate the total yield from the eggplant plants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo planted 8 eggplant plants.

\[
\text{Total eggplants} = 8 \text{ plants} \times 4 \text{ eggplants/plant} = 32 \text{ eggplants}
\]

Now, we sum the total yield from both types of plants to find the total number of fruits:

\[
\text{Total fruits} = 110 \text{ tomatoes} + 32 \text{ eggplants} = 142 \text{ fruits}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
142

"To find out how many OLED TVs were sold, we first need to determine the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold, and then subtract these from the total sales.

Given:
- One-fourth of the sales are smart TVs.
- One-eighth of the sales are analog TVs.
- The rest are OLED TVs.
- Total sales = 40 TVs.

First, calculate the number of smart TVs sold:
\[ \text{Number of smart TVs} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

Next, calculate the number of analog TVs sold:
\[ \text{Number of analog TVs} = \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5 \]

Now, calculate the number of OLED TVs sold by subtracting the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total sales:
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (\text{Number of smart TVs} + \text{Number of analog TVs}) \]
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (10 + 5) \]
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - 15 \]
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 25 \]

So, the number of OLED TVs sold is 25."

"First, we need to determine the temperature difference that needs to be prevented. The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. During the night, the temperature is 33 degrees colder than during the day, so the night temperature is:

\[ 45 - 33 = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

Since the night temperature is 12 degrees, we need to increase the temperature by:

\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn to increase the temperature by 20 degrees, we divide the required temperature increase by the temperature increase per log:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ degrees}}{5 \text{ degrees/log}} = 4 \text{ logs} \]

So, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's first determine Billy's starting salary and his salary after the raises.

1. **Billy's initial salary:**
   - Initial rate: $10 per hour.
   - Hours worked: 20 hours.
   - Initial salary = $10/hour * 20 hours = $200.

2. **Billy's salary after the first raise:**
   - Raise: $0.50 per hour.
   - New rate: $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.
   - Salary after first raise = $10.50/hour * 20 hours = $210.

3. **Billy's salary after the second raise:**
   - Raise: $1.00 per hour.
   - New rate: $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.
   - Salary after second raise = $11.50/hour * 20 hours = $230.

So, Billy's total earnings over 2 months (4 weeks) are $230.

Now, let's determine Sally's starting salary:
- Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary.
- Billy's starting salary was $10 per hour.
- Sally's starting salary = $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

Next, we calculate Sally's total earnings over 2 months (4 weeks) at her starting rate:
- Sally's rate: $10.50 per hour.
- Hours worked: 20 hours.
- Sally's total earnings = $10.50/hour * 20 hours = $210.

Finally, we find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally:
- Billy's total earnings: $230.

"First, let's calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:

- Puppies: 3
- Koalas: 5
- Zebras: 2
- Frogs: 4

Total stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Let's denote the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy as \( x \).

After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30%. Therefore, the equation representing this situation is:

\[ \frac{x}{14 + x} = 0.30 \]

To solve for \( x \), we can rearrange the equation:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total hours Kris has already played.

For the first 2 weeks (14 days), Kris plays for half an hour every day:
\[ 14 \text{ days} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/day} = 7 \text{ hours} \]

For the next week (7 days), Kris plays for 2 hours every day:
\[ 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/day} = 14 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's add the hours from both periods to find the total hours played so far:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} + 14 \text{ hours} = 21 \text{ hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. To find out how many more hours she needs to play, we subtract the hours she has already played from the total required hours:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} - 21 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

So, Kris still needs to play 9 more hours to earn the achievement."
"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled by the first car:
- The first car travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance traveled by the first car is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled by the second car:
- The second car travels at an average speed of 70 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance traveled by the second car is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_2 = 70 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled by the two cars:
\[
\text{Separation distance} = \text{Distance}_2 - \text{Distance}_1 = 140 \, \text{miles} - 120 \, \text{miles} = 20 \, \text{miles}

"First, let's calculate the pass rates for each grade:

- For third graders: \( \frac{340}{500} = 0.68 \) or 68%
- For fourth graders: \( \frac{40}{100} = 0.40 \) or 40%
- For fifth graders: The pass rate is twice that of fourth graders, so \( 2 \times 0.40 = 0.80 \) or 80%

Next, we calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students:

- Third graders: 340
- Fourth graders: 40
- Fifth graders: 400

Total number of students who passed: \( 340 + 40 + 400 = 780 \)

Total number of students: \( 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 \)

The overall pass rate is calculated as the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students:

"To determine how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has.
2. Determine the total area of the mosaic he can create with the chips he has.
3. Calculate the length of the mosaic based on the area and height.

First, let's find out how many glass chips Milo has:
- Each bag contains 72 chips.
- Milo has two bags.
- Therefore, the total number of chips is \( 72 \times 2 = 144 \) chips.

Next, we need to find out how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips:
- It takes 12 chips to make every square inch.
- Therefore, the total area in square inches is \( \frac{144}{12} = 12 \) square inches.

Now, we know the height of the mosaic is 3 inches. To find the length, we use the area formula for a rectangle (Area = Length × Height):
- The area is 12 square inches.
- The height is 3 inches.
- Therefore, the length is \( \frac{12}{3} = 4 \) inches.

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long. The final numerical answer is:

To find out how many candies he still needs to sell, we subtract the number of candies he has from the total number of candies he ordered, which is 200 - 150 = 50.

So, the final numerical answer is 50."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students on campus at the end of each month and then determine the total number of additional students who joined by the end of May.

Starting with 10 students at the beginning of the year, the number of students doubles every month.

- At the end of January: \(10 \times 2 = 20\) students
- At the end of February: \(20 \times 2 = 40\) students
- At the end of March: \(40 \times 2 = 80\) students
- At the end of April: \(80 \times 2 = 160\) students
- At the end of May: \(160 \times 2 = 320\) students

Now, we calculate the total number of additional students who joined by the end of May:

"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we first need to determine the total number of branches he climbed during the week.

Given that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs and he made $105 during the week, we can calculate the total number of branches he climbed by dividing the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\text{Total money made}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} \]

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = 420 \]

Since he made this amount of money during the week, and there are 7 days in a week, we can find the average number of branches he climbed per day by dividing the total branches climbed by the number of days in the week:

\[ \text{Branches climbed per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches climbed}}{\text{Number of days in a week}} = \frac{420}{7} \]

\[ \text{Branches climbed per day} = 60 \]

So, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day."
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose initially picks:

- For the next 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals.
- For the next 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals.
- For the last 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals.

Adding these together gives the total number of petals before any are dropped:
\[15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\] petals.

Rose drops 1 of each type of flower, so she drops:
- 1 flower with 5 petals,

- Let \( F \) be the amount of fragrance.
- Let \( C \) be the amount of citrus zest.
- Let \( G \) be the amount of sugar.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S = G \) (same amount of salt as sugar)
2. \( F = C \) (same amount of fragrance as citrus zest)
3. \( O = 2S \) (twice as much oil as salt)
4. \( S = C \) (twice as much salt as zest)

Since \( S = C \) and \( F = C \), we can say \( S = F = C \).

The total amount of ingredients in the jar is 10 ounces. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total amount of ingredients as:
\[ S + O + F + C + G = 10 \]

Substituting the relationships into the equation:
\[ S + 2S + S + S + S = 10 \]
\[ 6S = 10 \]
\[ S = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \]

Since \( O = 2S \):
\[ O = 2 \times \frac{5}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \]

Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \( \frac{10}{3} \) ounces.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \frac{10}{3} \]"

"First, let's determine how many cars Joe initially has. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. The number of cars he sells is:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

After selling 8 cars, Joe has:

\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \text{ cars} \]

Then, Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

After giving away 16 cars, Joe has:

\[ 32 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, the final number of cars Joe remains with is:

\[ 16 \]"
"To find out how much each student raised, we first need to determine the total amount of money raised by the students. The total amount raised by the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of this came from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to divide this amount by the number of students to find out how much each student raised. There are 20 students, so we calculate:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

Thus, each student raised $6,250. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6250 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of hours Sandy walked on the second day. She walked half as many hours on the second day as she did on the first day. Since she walked for 8 hours on the first day, on the second day she walked for:

\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of hours Sandy walked over the two days:

\[ 8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Since we need the total time in minutes, we convert the total hours into minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 12 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days in minutes is:

\[ 720 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of cars in the parking lot during the lunch break before any left. Hunter initially counted 50 cars, and during the first break, he saw 20 more cars. So, the total number of cars in the parking lot before the lunch break is:

\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \]

During the lunch break, half of the cars left the parking lot. Therefore, the number of cars that left is:

\[ \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

The number of cars remaining in the parking lot after the lunch break is:

\[ 70 - 35 = 35 \]

So, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35."
"To determine how much John makes in a full 7-day week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the daily earnings:**
   - John does 30 cycles of work a day.
   - Each cycle has 5 different tasks.
   - Each task pays $1.20.

   Therefore, the earnings per cycle are:
   \[
   5 \text{ tasks/cycle} \times \$1.20/\text{task} = \$6.00/\text{cycle}
   \]

   Now, the daily earnings are:
   \[

   \]

2. **Calculate the weekly earnings:**
   - John works 7 days a week.

   Therefore, the weekly earnings are:
   \[
   \$180.00/\text{day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = \$1260.00/\text{week}
   \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of tins of cat food Kimberly bought. She bought 8 packages of cat food, and each package contains 11 tins. So, the total number of tins of cat food is:

\[ 8 \times 11 = 88 \text{ tins} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of tins of dog food Kimberly bought. She bought 6 packages of dog food, and each package contains 6 tins. So, the total number of tins of dog food is:

\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \text{ tins} \]

Now, to find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we subtract the total number of tins of dog food from the total number of tins of cat food:

\[ 88 - 36 = 52 \]

So, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 52 \]"
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now we can find out how many cards Becca has:
\[ 3P + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

So, Becca has 153 cards. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of each color of eggs Cindy has:

- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: twice as many as green eggs, so \(2 \times 5 = 10\)
- Pink eggs: one fewer than blue eggs, so \(10 - 1 = 9\)
- Yellow eggs: one-third as many as pink eggs, so \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\)

Now, let's add up all the eggs:

- Total eggs = Green eggs + Blue eggs + Pink eggs + Yellow eggs
- Total eggs = \(5 + 10 + 9 + 3\)

Let's calculate the total:
```python
# Number of each color of eggs
green_eggs = 5
blue_eggs = 2 * green_eggs
pink_eggs = blue_eggs - 1
yellow_eggs = pink_eggs // 3

# Total number of eggs

"First, let's calculate the shipping cost. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound plus $0.08 per mile.

The cost for the weight of the book is:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.35/\text{pound} = \$1.40 \]

The cost for the distance is:
\[ 20 \text{ miles} \times \$0.08/\text{mile} = \$1.60 \]

So, the total shipping cost is:
\[ \$1.40 + \$1.60 = \$3.00 \]

Next, we calculate the refundable amount from Amazon. Since Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, the refundable amount is:
\[ 32 \text{ dollars} \times 0.75 = \$24.00 \]

Now, we calculate the total cost Milly will incur:
\[ \text{Cost of the book} + \text{Shipping cost} = 32 \text{ dollars} + 3 \text{ dollars} = \$35.00 \]

Finally, the amount of money Milly will lose is the total cost minus the refundable amount:
\[ 35 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = \$11.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"

"To find out how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then sum them up.

1. **Time spent on TikTok videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week.
   - Each video is 4 minutes long.
   - Therefore, the time spent on TikTok videos each week is \(18 \times 4 = 72\) minutes.
   - In a month with four weeks, the time spent on TikTok videos is \(72 \times 4 = 288\) minutes.

2. **Time spent writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 2 hours is \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes.
   - In a month with four weeks, the time spent writing songs is \(120 \times 4 = 480\) minutes.

3. **Time spent on makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup.
   - In a week, the time spent on makeup is \(15 \times 6 = 90\) minutes.
   - In a month with four weeks, the time spent on makeup is \(90 \times 4 = 360\) minutes.

Now, we sum up the time spent on TikTok videos, writing songs, and doing makeup:
\[ 288 + 480 + 360 = 1128 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

"To determine the cost for Angela, we need to break down the costs step by step.

First, let's calculate the cost for the additional items Angela needs:
- Angela needs 6 mirrors, and the base installation includes 4 mirrors. So, she needs 2 additional mirrors.
- Angela needs 2 chandeliers, and the base installation includes 1 chandelier. So, she needs 1 additional chandelier.
- Angela needs 20 pictures, and the base installation includes 10 pictures. So, she needs 10 additional pictures.

The cost for the additional mirrors, chandeliers, and pictures is:
- Additional mirrors: 2 * $15.00 = $30.00
- Additional chandeliers: 1 * $15.00 = $15.00
- Additional pictures: 10 * $15.00 = $150.00

Adding these together gives the total cost for the additional items:
$30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00

Next, we add the base installation cost to the cost of the additional items:
Base installation cost: $129.00
Additional items cost: $195.00

Total cost:
$129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to work through the relationships given step by step.

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei can, so Saskay can lift a mountain \(12 \times 1 = 12\) inches.
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay can, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain \(4 \times 12 = 48\) inches.
4. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami can, so Naruto can lift a mountain \(10 \times 48 = 480\) inches.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert 480 inches to feet:

\[ 480 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the speed and distance relationship. If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can calculate the total distance of the highway. Let's denote the distance as \(D\), the speed of each kangaroo as \(v\), and the time taken as \(t\).

The total distance \(D\) can be calculated as:
\[ D = 3v \times 18 \]

Now, we need to find out how long it will take for 4 turtles to cover the same distance \(D\). Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of each turtle is \(v/2\). Let \(t_t\) be the time taken by the 4 turtles to cover the distance \(D\).

The total distance \(D\) can also be expressed in terms of the speed and time for the turtles:
\[ D = 4 \times \frac{v}{2} \times t_t \]
\[ D = 2v \times t_t \]

Since the distance \(D\) is the same in both scenarios, we can set the two expressions for \(D\) equal to each other:
\[ 3v \times 18 = 2v \times t_t \]

We can cancel \(v\) from both sides of the equation (assuming \(v \neq 0\)):
\[ 3 \times 18 = 2 \times t_t \]
\[ 54 = 2 \times t_t \]
\[ t_t = \frac{54}{2} \]
\[ t_t = 27 \]

So, it will take 4 turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 27 \]"

"First, let's determine the final price of the laptop after the trade-in discount. The original price of the laptop is $600, and the trade-in discount is $200. Therefore, the final price is:

\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means she currently has:

\[ 400 - 50 = 350 \]

Erika has received money from three sources: her part-time job, her mom, and her savings in her purse. Let's denote the amount of money in her purse as \( x \). The total amount of money she has is the sum of her part-time job earnings, her mom's contribution, and her savings:

\[ 150 + 80 + x = 350 \]

Now, we can solve for \( x \):

\[ 230 + x = 350 \]
\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

So, Erika has $120 in her purse. The final numerical answer is:

Next, let's calculate the total number of slices from the small apples:
- Each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces.
- Adam decides to slice 5 small apples.
- Therefore, the total number of slices from the small apples is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) slices.

Now, let's find the total number of slices Adam has after slicing all the apples:
- Total slices from large apples: 15
- Total slices from small apples: 15
- Therefore, the total number of slices is \(15 + 15 = 30\) slices.

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:
- Total slices: 30
- Slices eaten: 15
- Therefore, the number of slices left is \(30 - 15 = 15\) slices.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to have to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to calculate the current daily milk production and then find out how much additional milk is needed.

The current daily milk production from 3 cows is:
\[ 5 \text{ liters/cow/day} \times 3 \text{ cows} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The additional milk needed is:
\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed to produce the additional 10 liters of milk is:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow/day}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

"To determine how many students are good at math, we need to consider the information given:

- There are 20 students in total.
- 5 students are good at math only.
- 8 students perform well in English only.
- The rest are good at both math and English.

First, we calculate the number of students who are good at both math and English. Since the total number of students is 20, and we know the number of students who are good at math only and those who perform well in English only, we can find the number of students who are good at both by subtracting the sum of students who are good at math only and those who perform well in English only from the total number of students.

Let's denote:
- \( M \) as the number of students good at math.
- \( E \) as the number of students good at English.
- \( B \) as the number of students good at both math and English.

From the problem, we know:
- \( M = 5 \) (students good at math only)
- \( E = 8 \) (students good at English only)
- The total number of students is 20.

The number of students good at both math and English is:
\[ B = 20 - (5 + 8) = 20 - 13 = 7 \]

"First, we need to determine how many trays the farmer needs to hold all 900 eggs. Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold:

\[ \text{Number of trays} = \frac{900 \text{ eggs}}{30 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 30 \text{ trays} \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of trays by the price per tray:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 30 \text{ trays} \times \$2.5/\text{tray} = \$75 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$75 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of goats sold from each farm.

From Farm X, Mr. Smith sold 10 goats.

From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats as from Farm X, which means he sold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) goats.

Now, let's calculate the number of goats remaining in each farm.

In Farm X, initially there were 55 goats, and 10 were sold, so the number of goats left is \(55 - 10 = 45\).

In Farm Y, initially there were 45 goats, and 20 were sold, so the number of goats left is \(45 - 20 = 25\).

To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the remaining goats from Farm X and Farm Y:

\(45 + 25 = 70\).

So, the final numerical answer is 70."
"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
2. Divide the total amount spent on shoes by the total number of pairs bought.

James buys 2 pairs of shoes each month. There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of pairs of shoes he buys in a year is:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair of shoes, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs bought:
\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

So, the average amount James pays for each pair of shoes is:
\[ 110 \text{ dollars} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the green food. Since each basket of green food costs $25 and you are buying 3 baskets, the total cost for the green food is:
\[ 25 \times 3 = 75 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the red food. Each basket of red food costs $18, but you get $2 off for each basket. Therefore, the effective cost per basket of red food is:
\[ 18 - 2 = 16 \]
Since you are buying 3 baskets of red food, the total cost for the red food is:
\[ 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

Now, we add the total cost of the green food and the total cost of the red food to find the overall total cost:
\[ 75 + 48 = 123 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 123 \]"

The total number of homes built over the next three years is 144."
"Let's denote the ages as follows:
- Let \( S \) be my age.
- Then my brother's age is \( S + 3 \).
- My sister's age is \( S - 2 \).
- My mom's age is \( 3(S + 3) - 1 \).

The sum of our ages is given as 87. So we can write the equation:
\[ S + (S + 3) + (S - 2) + (3(S + 3) - 1) = 87 \]

Simplifying the left side:
\[ S + S + 3 + S - 2 + 3S + 9 - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 87 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 6S = 78 \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ S = 13 \]

So, I am 13 years old."
"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glue sticks needed.
2. Determine how many packs are required to provide at least that many glue sticks.

First, calculate the total number of glue sticks needed:
\[ 27 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ glue sticks per student} = 54 \text{ glue sticks} \]

Next, determine how many packs of glue sticks are needed. Since glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to find the smallest number of packs that will provide at least 54 glue sticks. We do this by dividing the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack and rounding up to the nearest whole number:
\[ \frac{54}{8} = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up 6.75 to 7. Therefore, he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

The final answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Amount of Water**: The initial amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

2. **After the First Day**: The amount of water doubles. Therefore, the amount of water after the first day is:
   \[
   4000 \text{ gallons} \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **After the Second Day**: The amount of water doubles again. Therefore, the amount of water after the second day is:
   \[
   8000 \text{ gallons} \times 2 = 16000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

4. **After the Third Day**: The volume of water increases by 6000 gallons. Therefore, the amount of water after the third day is:
   \[
   16000 \text{ gallons} + 6000 \text{ gallons} = 22000 \text{ gallons}

So, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point after the third day is 22000 gallons."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of new infections each day and add them to the total number of infected people.

- **Day 0**: Initially, there are 10 infected people.
- **Day 1**: Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others, so the number of new infections is \(10 \times 6 = 60\). Therefore, the total number of infected people after Day 1 is \(10 + 60 = 70\).
- **Day 2**: Now there are 70 infected people, and each of them infects 6 others. So, the number of new infections is \(70 \times 6 = 420\). Therefore, the total number of infected people after Day 2 is \(70 + 420 = 490\).
- **Day 3**: Now there are 490 infected people, and each of them infects 6 others. So, the number of new infections is \(490 \times 6 = 2940\). Therefore, the total number of infected people after Day 3 is \(490 + 2940 = 3430\).

So, the total number of people infected after three days is 3430."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Rafaela received as tips. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate the total as follows:

\[ \text{Total tips for Rafaela} = 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Julieta received as tips. Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To find out how much less, we calculate 10% of Rafaela's total tips:

\[ \text{10% of Rafaela's tips} = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]

So, Julieta received:

\[ \text{Total tips for Julieta} = 800 - 80 = 720 \]

Now, to find the total amount of money both Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether, we add their individual totals:

\[ \text{Total tips for both} = 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

"First, let's determine the number of green cars. Since there are 12 red cars and 2 fewer green cars than red cars, we can calculate the number of green cars as follows:

\[ \text{Number of green cars} = \text{Number of red cars} - 2 = 12 - 2 = 10 \]

Next, we calculate the number of blue cars. The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars:

\[ \text{Number of blue cars} = 3 \times \text{Number of green cars} = 3 \times 10 = 30 \]

Now, we can find the total number of red, green, and blue cars:

\[ \text{Total number of red, green, and blue cars} = 12 + 10 + 30 = 52 \]

Given that the total number of cars in the rink is 75, we can find the number of yellow cars by subtracting the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:

"Let's denote the number of books Anne has as \( A \). According to the problem, Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has \( A + 25 \) books. Additionally, Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Fawn has \( A + 12 \) books.

The total number of books that Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have together is 85. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (A + 25) + A + (A + 12) = 85 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ A + 25 + A + A + 12 = 85 \]
\[ 3A + 37 = 85 \]

Next, we solve for \( A \):

\[ 3A = 85 - 37 \]
\[ 3A = 48 \]
\[ A = \frac{48}{3} \]
\[ A = 16 \]

So, Anne has 16 books. Since Fawn has 12 more books than Anne, we calculate the number of books Fawn has as follows:

\[ Fawn = A + 12 = 16 + 12 = 28 \]

Therefore, Fawn has 28 books. The final numerical answer is:

\]

So, after the first day, the number of pieces remaining is:

\[
60 - 24 = 36 \text{ pieces}
\]

On the second day, Tobias ate 10 pieces, so the number of pieces remaining after the second day is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost for Sarah to buy the rope for her friend. The rope is 20 meters long and costs $2 per meter.

\[
\text{Total cost for the rope} = 20 \text{ meters} \times 2 \text{ dollars/meter} = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to determine how much money Sarah will have left after buying the rope. Since she plans to use the profit from selling the rope to buy a new rope, we need to calculate the profit from selling the rope.

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total cost for the rope} = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we need to find out how much money Sarah will have left after buying the new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter and she needs to buy a new rope that is 20 meters long.

\[
\text{Cost of the new rope} = 20 \text{ meters} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars/meter} = 30 \text{ dollars}

"To solve this problem, let's denote Melanie's current age as \( M \).

According to the information given, in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ M + 10 = 18 \]

Solving for \( M \):
\[ M = 18 - 10 \]
\[ M = 8 \]

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

We need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. Let's denote the number of years from now as \( x \). In \( x \) years, Melanie's age will be \( 8 + x \). We want this to be three times her current age, so we set up the equation:
\[ 8 + x = 3 \times 8 \]
\[ 8 + x = 24 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age.

"First, let's calculate the cost of each item Kelly is purchasing:

1. **Bacon:**
   - Kelly has 5 packs of bacon.
   - The total cost for the bacon is $10.
   - Cost per pack of bacon = $10 / 5 = $2.

2. **Chicken:**
   - Kelly has 6 packets of chicken.
   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - Cost per packet of chicken = 2 * $2 = $4.
   - Total cost for the chicken = 6 * $4 = $24.

3. **Strawberries:**
   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries.
   - Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   - Total cost for the strawberries = 3 * $4 = $12.

4. **Apples:**
   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples.
   - Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   - Cost per pack of apples = $4 / 2 = $2.
   - Total cost for the apples = 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's sum up the total cost of all the items:
- Total cost = Cost of bacon + Cost of chicken + Cost of strawberries + Cost of apples
- Total cost = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60.

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget:
- Money left = Budget - Total cost
- Money left = $65 - $60 = $5.

"Let's denote the usual runtime of Elaina's concerts as \( x \) minutes. According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, so the final concert is \( 2x \) minutes long. Additionally, at the end of the final concert, she performs a 15-minute encore. Therefore, the total runtime of the final concert, including the encore, is \( 2x + 15 \) minutes.

We are given that the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. So, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual runtime of Elaina's concerts is 25 minutes. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 25 \]"
"Argo initially has 200 toys. After giving away 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky, the total number of toys given away is 40 + 80 + 30 = 150 toys. Therefore, the number of toys Argo has now is 200 - 150 = 50 toys. 

The final numerical answer is 50."
"To find the total number of chimichangas made on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday, we need to add the number of chimichangas made each day.

- On Tuesday, they make 125 chimichangas.
- On Wednesday, they make 125 chimichangas.
- On Friday, they make twice as many as on Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 125 = 250\) chimichangas.

Now, we add the number of chimichangas made on these three days:

\[ 125 + 125 + 250 = 500 \]

So, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many microphones are left after 20% of them are not able to fit in pairs. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Calculate 20% of the total microphones:
   \[
   20\% \text{ of } 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 10
   \]
   So, 10 microphones won't fit in pairs.

2. Subtract the number of microphones that won't fit from the total number of microphones to find out how many microphones can be paired:
   \[
   50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. Since the remaining microphones can be paired, we divide the number of paired microphones by 2 to find the number of pairs:
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]

Therefore, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage."
"First, let's determine the number of birds flying overhead. Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes. According to the problem, 2/3 of that number of birds are flying overhead. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of birds flying overhead} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of birds feeding. Jerry counts 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of birds feeding} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, we sum up all the birds Jerry counts:

\[ \text{Total number of birds} = \text{Number of birds nesting} + \text{Number of birds flying overhead} + \text{Number of birds feeding} \]
\[ \text{Total number of birds} = 6 + 4 + 24 = 34 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of petals for the orchids. Joelle has 5 orchids, and each orchid has 5 petals. So, the total number of petals for the orchids is:

\[ 5 \text{ orchids} \times 5 \text{ petals/orchid} = 25 \text{ petals} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals for the African daisies. Joelle has 4 African daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals. So, the total number of petals for the daisies is:

\[ 4 \text{ daisies} \times 10 \text{ petals/daisy} = 40 \text{ petals} \]

Now, to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we subtract the total number of petals of the orchids from the total number of petals of the daisies:

\[ 40 \text{ petals} - 25 \text{ petals} = 15 \text{ petals} \]

So, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants, so we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. We find the number of flowering plants by subtracting the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:

\[ \text{Number of flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25 \]

To find what percent of the total plants are flowering plants, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how fast a whirligig spins, we need to first determine the speed of the thingamabob. We know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, we can calculate the speed of the thingamabob as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{\text{Speed of whatchamacallit}}{11} = \frac{121 \text{ meters/second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters/second} \]

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can determine the speed of the whirligig. We know that a whirligig spins five times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of the whirligig is:

\[ \text{Speed of whirligig} = 5 \times \text{Speed of thingamabob} = 5 \times 11 \text{ meters/second} = 55 \text{ meters/second} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Joe's Lawn Mowing:**
   - Tasha mowed Joe's lawn once for $6.
   - Therefore, the payment from Joe is $6.

2. **First Week:**
   - Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's lawn.
   - Since she mowed Joe's lawn once, she mowed Kamala's lawn three times.
   - Let's assume the rate for mowing Kamala's lawn is \( R \) dollars per mow.
   - Therefore, the payment from Kamala is \( 3R \).

3. **Second Week:**
   - Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's lawn.
   - Since she mowed Joe's lawn once, she mowed Alba's lawn five times.
   - Let's assume the rate for mowing Alba's lawn is \( S \) dollars per mow.
   - Therefore, the payment from Alba is \( 5S \).

4. **Total Earnings from Mowing:**
   - Total earnings from mowing lawns = Payment from Joe + Payment from Kamala + Payment from Alba.
   - Total earnings from mowing = $6 + \( 3R \) + \( 5S \).

5. **Total Earnings:**
   - Tasha's total earnings from selling lemonade and mowing lawns last month were $80.
   - Therefore, the earnings from mowing lawns plus the earnings from lemonade sales equal $80.
   - Let's denote the earnings from lemonade sales as \( L \).
   - So, \( 6 + 3R + 5S + L = 80 \).

6. **Finding \( L \):**
   - We need to find \( L \), the earnings from lemonade sales.
   - From the equation \( 6 + 3R + 5S + L = 80 \), we can isolate \( L \):
     \[
     L = 80 - 6 - 3R - 5S
     \]
     \[
     L = 74 - 3R - 5S
     \]

Since the rates \( R \) and \( S \) are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of \( L \). However, the problem does not require us to find the exact rates \( R \) and \( S \), but rather the total earnings from lemonade sales. Given the information, the final numerical answer for the earnings from lemonade sales is:

"First, let's determine Carl's weight. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, we can calculate Carl's weight as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's weight} = \text{Martin's weight} + 16 \]
\[ \text{Carl's weight} = 55 \, \text{kg} + 16 \, \text{kg} \]
\[ \text{Carl's weight} = 71 \, \text{kg} \]

Next, we find Christian's weight, which is 8 kg more than Carl's weight:

\[ \text{Christian's weight} = \text{Carl's weight} + 8 \]
\[ \text{Christian's weight} = 71 \, \text{kg} + 8 \, \text{kg} \]
\[ \text{Christian's weight} = 79 \, \text{kg} \]

Finally, we determine Harry's weight, which is 5 kg less than Christian's weight:

\[ \text{Harry's weight} = \text{Christian's weight} - 5 \]
\[ \text{Harry's weight} = 79 \, \text{kg} - 5 \, \text{kg} \]
\[ \text{Harry's weight} = 74 \, \text{kg} \]

So, the weight of Harry is 74 kg."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours John rents his car out in a month. He rents his car 10 times a month, and each time for 3 hours. So, the total number of hours rented in a month is:

\[ 10 \text{ times/month} \times 3 \text{ hours/time} = 30 \text{ hours/month} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money John earns from renting his car in a month. He gets paid $25 per hour, so:

\[ 30 \text{ hours/month} \times 25 \text{ dollars/hour} = 750 \text{ dollars/month} \]

Now, we need to find out the profit John makes. To do this, we subtract his monthly car payment from his monthly earnings:

\[ 750 \text{ dollars/month} - 500 \text{ dollars/month} = 250 \text{ dollars/month} \]

So, the profit John makes on his car is:

\[ 250 \text{ dollars/month} \]

"To find the total distance Dijana and Anis rowed on that Sunday, we first need to determine how far Anis rowed.

Dijana rowed 50 miles.

Anis rowed \(\frac{1}{5}\) times more miles than Dijana. This means Anis rowed \(50 + \frac{1}{5} \times 50\) miles.

Let's calculate the distance Anis rowed:
\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles}
\]
\[
50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles}
\]

Now, we add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis to find the total distance:
\[
50 \text{ miles} + 60 \text{ miles} = 110 \text{ miles}
\]

The total distance the two of them rowed on that day is 110 miles."

"First, let's determine how many pages each person read over the two days.

Yesterday:
- Denise read 10 pages.
- Daniel read 13 pages.

Today:
- Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.
- Daniel was not able to read any pages today, so he read 0 pages today.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages each person read over the two days:
- Denise's total: \(10 + 18 = 28\) pages.
- Daniel's total: \(13 + 0 = 13\) pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total number of pages Daniel read from the total number of pages Denise read:
\[ 28 - 13 = 15 \]

So, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to first understand the capacity of the pot and how it is divided among the family members.

1. The pot can fill four adult's bowls.
2. The pot can also fill eight child's bowls.

Since Calvin is an adult, he will have one bowl of soup. His wife is also an adult, so she will have one bowl of soup. This accounts for 2 adult bowls.

This leaves us with 2 bowls of soup for the two children. Since each child can have one bowl of soup, the two children will each have one bowl of soup.

Therefore, each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup once.

"To determine the amount of material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum the results.

First, let's find out how much material is needed for 20 small masks. We know that 4 small masks require 2 yards of material. Therefore, the amount of material needed for 1 small mask is:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} \]

So, for 20 small masks, the material required is:
\[ 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's find out how much material is needed for 8 large masks. We know that 3 large masks require 2.25 yards of material. Therefore, the amount of material needed for 1 large mask is:
\[ \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} \]

So, for 8 large masks, the material required is:
\[ 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we add the material needed for the small and large masks together:
\[ 10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards} \]

Therefore, the total amount of material Jo would need to make 20 small and 8 large masks is:

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information provided.

Let \( D \) be Duncan's age eight years ago and \( A \) be Adam's age four years ago.

From the problem, we know:
1. Duncan's current age is 60.
2. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( 60 - 8 = 52 \).
3. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was two times Adam's age four years ago.

So, we can write the equation:
\[ D = 2A \]
\[ 52 = 2A \]

From this, we can solve for \( A \):
\[ A = \frac{52}{2} = 26 \]

This means Adam's age four years ago was 26. To find Adam's current age, we add 4 years to 26:
\[ \text{Adam's current age} = 26 + 4 = 30 \]

To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 years to his current age:

"Let's denote the number of red balloons as \( R \) and the number of yellow balloons as \( Y \). According to the problem, \( R = 20 \).

Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon, so the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is \( 2R \). Given that \( R = 20 \), the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \).

The total number of pieces of bologna thrown at all balloons is 58. Therefore, the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons is \( 58 - 40 = 18 \).

Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, the number of yellow balloons \( Y \) can be found by dividing the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons by 3. So, \( Y = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).

Thus, the number of yellow balloons is 6.

\[ \text{Total distance} = 100 \, \text{miles/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 3000 \, \text{miles} \]

Since the car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can determine the number of tune-ups needed by dividing the total distance by the distance between tune-ups:

\[ \text{Number of tune-ups} = \frac{3000 \, \text{miles}}{1000 \, \text{miles/tune-up}} = 3 \, \text{tune-ups} \]

So, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time."

"First, let's calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class. Since there are 30 students and each student sold an average of 10 lollipops, the total number of lollipops sold is:

\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops. Each lollypop was sold for $0.8, so the total revenue is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollypop} = \$240 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops. Each lollypop was bought for $0.5, so the total cost is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollypop} = \$150 \]

Finally, the profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ \$240 - \$150 = \$90 \]

So, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops."
"To find the total number of Larry's pets, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet step by step.

1. **Cats**: Larry has 3 cats.
2. **Dogs**: Larry has 3 times as many dogs as cats. Therefore, the number of dogs is \(3 \times 3 = 9\).
3. **Rabbits**: Larry has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. Therefore, the number of rabbits is \(9 - 2 = 7\).
4. **Fish**: Larry has three times the number of fish as rabbits. Therefore, the number of fish is \(3 \times 7 = 21\).
5. **Gerbils**: Larry has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has. Therefore, the number of gerbils is \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\).

"Martha collects shells every month. She started collecting at age 5 and her 10th birthday marks the end of her collection period. To find out how many months she collected shells, we calculate the difference in age and then convert that into months.

From age 5 to 10, she has 5 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of months is:
\[ 5 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 60 \text{ months} \]

Since she collects one shell per month, the total number of shells she has collected by her 10th birthday is:
\[ 60 \text{ shells} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 60 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total cups of tea**: Lana has 27 cups of tea.
2. **Rows of tea cups**: She divides these cups into 3 rows, so each row has \( \frac{27}{3} = 9 \) cups.
3. **Tea types in each row**: In each row, she brews an equal amount of chamomile and mint tea. Therefore, each row has \( \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \) cups of chamomile tea and \( 4.5 \) cups of mint tea.
4. **Cups of cinnamon tea**: She uses the remaining cups to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea. Since the total number of cups is 27, the number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea is \( 27 - 15 = 12 \). Since there are 3 rows, and each row has 4.5 cups of chamomile and mint tea, the total number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea is \( 3 \times 4.5 = 13.5 \), but since we know it's 12, it means the distribution is correct.

The number of cups of mint tea in each row is \( 4.5 \).

The final numerical answer is:
4.5"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground, given that he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

First, let's break down the time spent on each trip:
- The sloth takes 4 hours to make the trip down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up into his tree.

Since the sloth needs to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we need to find out how many trips he can make in 8 hours.

The time for one complete trip (down and back) is 4 hours. Therefore, in 8 hours, the number of complete trips the sloth can make is:
\[ \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips} \]

Since the sloth needs to collect 24 berries in 8 hours and he can make 2 trips in that time, the number of berries he needs to pick up per trip is:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip} \]

Thus, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip down to the ground is:
\[ 12 \]"
"First, we need to determine the amount of water in the tank. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons of water, the tank will have:

\[ \text{Tank capacity} = \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much water will be left in the tank after 6 days, given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. The total amount of water removed from the tank over 6 days is:

\[ \text{Total water removed} = 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[ \text{Remaining water} = 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2000 \]"
"To determine how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate his remaining budget after accounting for the items he has already purchased.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items he has already bought:
- 2 tubs of popcorn: \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars
- 4 boxes of candy: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars
- 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday: \(5 \times 10 = 50\) dollars
- 8 movies on other days: \(8 \times 7 = 56\) dollars

Adding these together gives the total amount spent:
\[16 + 8 + 50 + 56 = 120\]

Colby starts with $150, so his remaining budget is:
\[150 - 120 = 30\]

Now, we need to determine how many movies he can see with the remaining $30. Each movie ticket costs $7, and he also wants to buy a popcorn and a box of candy. The cost for one movie, popcorn, and candy is:
\[7 + 8 + 2 = 17\]

With $30, the number of movies he can see is:
\[ \left\lfloor \frac{30}{17} \right\rfloor = 1 \]

So, Colby can see 1 more movie with his remaining budget. The final numerical answer is:
\[1\]"
"First, we need to calculate the calories for the mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins.

For the mini cinnamon rolls:
- A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
- A mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll.
- Therefore, a mini cinnamon roll has \( \frac{600}{3} = 200 \) calories.
- Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls.
- So, the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls are \( 200 \times 200 = 40000 \) calories.

For the mini blueberry muffins:
- A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
- A mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin.
- Therefore, a mini blueberry muffin has \( \frac{450}{3} = 150 \) calories.
- Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins.
- So, the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins are \( 300 \times 150 = 45000 \) calories.

Adding the calories from both types of pastries:
- Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls: 40000 calories.
- Total calories from mini blueberry muffins: 45000 calories.
- Therefore, the total calories from all pastries are \( 40000 + 45000 = 85000 \) calories.

The final numerical answer is 85000."
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the five days and then divide that total by the number of days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, so she removed \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs each day.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days:
\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

First, add the Junebugs removed on Monday and Tuesday:
\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]

Next, add the Junebugs removed on Wednesday:
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]

Then, add the Junebugs removed on Thursday:
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]

Finally, add the Junebugs removed on Friday:
\[
243 + 57 = 300
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days is 300.

To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days (5):
\[
\frac{300}{5} = 60
\]

Thus, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"First, we calculate the distance traveled by the bus. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For the bus:
\[ \text{Speed} = 60 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, the distance traveled by the bus is:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \times 5 = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance traveled by the car:
\[ \text{Speed} = 30 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

So, the distance traveled by the car is:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 30 \times 8 = 240 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 300 - 240 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the bus went 60 miles farther than the car. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 60 \]"
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to calculate the difference between the total number of toys Sophie has and the number of toys she already had before buying the bouncy balls.

The number of toys Sophie had before buying the bouncy balls is the sum of the building blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings:
\[ 31 \text{ (building blocks)} + 8 \text{ (stuffed animals)} + 9 \text{ (stacking rings)} = 48 \text{ toys} \]

Sophie's total number of toys after buying the bouncy balls is 62. Therefore, the number of bouncy balls is:
\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

So, the number of bouncy balls that came in the tube is 14."
"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old:
   \[
   P + Pa + J = 100
   \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   Pa = J + 10
   \]

3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = Pa + J
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now, we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, we can find Paul's age:
\[
Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]

And Peter's age:
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

So, Peter's age is \( 50 \) years old. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"Initially, Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons, so that's 4 friends * 2 balloons/friend = 8 balloons. Maria also received 2 balloons, so the total number of balloons at this point is 8 (for her friends) + 2 (for Maria) = 10 balloons.

Then, her mom gave each person 3 more balloons. There are 4 friends + 1 Maria = 5 people in total. So, 5 people * 3 balloons/person = 15 additional balloons.

Adding the additional balloons to the initial total, we get 10 (initial total) + 15 (additional balloons) = 25 balloons.

The final numerical answer is 25."

"First, let's calculate the total distance Zoey spits her seeds. Zoey has 40 seeds and spits each one 10 feet. So, the total distance Zoey spits is:
\[ 40 \text{ seeds} \times 10 \text{ feet/seed} = 400 \text{ feet} \]

Next, let's calculate the total distance Sydney spits her seeds. Sydney has 35 seeds and spits each one 12 feet. So, the total distance Sydney spits is:
\[ 35 \text{ seeds} \times 12 \text{ feet/seed} = 420 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we need to find the average total distance spat by both Zoey and Sydney. To do this, we add the total distances and divide by the number of people (which is 2):
\[ \text{Average total distance} = \frac{400 \text{ feet} + 420 \text{ feet}}{2} = \frac{820 \text{ feet}}{2} = 410 \text{ feet} \]

The average total distance spat is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost if Cameron chooses the option of adding 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark.

Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which totals to 17 hours.

The cost for the first 12 hours is 1000 pesos.
The cost for the additional 5 hours (17 hours total - 12 hours) is 5 * 70 pesos.

So, the additional cost for the extra hours is:
5 * 70 = 350 pesos

The total cost for Cameron if he chooses the option of adding 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark is:
1000 pesos (for the first 12 hours) + 350 pesos (for the additional 5 hours) = 1350 pesos

Now, let's calculate the cost if Cameron had chosen the 24-hour option.

The cost for a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos.

The difference in cost between the 24-hour option and the 12-hour plus additional hours option is:
1600 pesos (for the 24-hour option) - 1350 pesos (for the 12-hour plus additional hours option) = 250 pesos

Therefore, Cameron would save 250 pesos by choosing the option of adding 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark."
"First, let's determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. So, we calculate twice the amount each goat needs and then subtract 3 pounds:

\[ \text{Hay per sheep} = 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep. There are 15 goats, and each needs 5 pounds of hay:

\[ \text{Hay for goats} = 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

There are 12 sheep, and each needs 7 pounds of hay:

\[ \text{Hay for sheep} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the hay needed for the goats and the sheep gives us the total amount of hay needed:

\[ \text{Total hay} = 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 159 \]"
"First, let's calculate John's total earnings for the week:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Hourly wage} \times \text{Hours worked} = 50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of gas:
\[ \text{Cost of gas} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the remaining money after spending on gas:
\[ \text{Remaining money after gas} = \text{Total earnings} - \text{Cost of gas} = 300 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so we subtract that from the remaining money:
\[ \text{Money left after deposit} = \text{Remaining money after gas} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of 5 pencils:
\[ \text{Cost of 5 pencils} = 5 \times 10 \text{ dollars/pencil} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

"First, let's calculate the distance James swims. He swims 60% of the 20-mile lake, which is:

\[ 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes for him to swim 12 miles at a pace of 2 miles per hour:

\[ \text{Time to swim 12 miles} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

After swimming, he rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is:

\[ \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the remaining distance to be swum, which is:

\[ 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

He swims this remaining distance at half the speed, which is:

\[ \text{Speed for remaining distance} = \frac{2 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile/hour} \]

The time it takes to swim the remaining 8 miles at this speed is:

\[ \text{Time to swim remaining 8 miles} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, the total time taken to get across the lake is the sum of the swimming time, rest time, and the time to swim the remaining distance:

\[ \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time it took James to get across the lake is:

"To calculate the total commission Cayley will earn, we need to calculate the commission for each newspaper separately and then sum them up.

For the New York Times:
- Commission rate: 10%
- Cost per copy: $5
- Number of copies: 6

The commission for the New York Times is calculated as:
\[ \text{Commission for New York Times} = 6 \times 5 \times \frac{10}{100} = 6 \times 5 \times 0.10 = 30 \times 0.10 = 3 \]

For the Wall Street Journal:
- Commission rate: 8%
- Cost per copy: $15
- Number of copies: 10

The commission for the Wall Street Journal is calculated as:
\[ \text{Commission for Wall Street Journal} = 10 \times 15 \times \frac{8}{100} = 10 \times 15 \times 0.08 = 150 \times 0.08 = 12 \]

"Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as \( A \), by Bahati as \( B \), and by Dinar as \( D \).

From the problem, we know:
1. \( B = A + 20 \)
2. \( B = D + 10 \)
3. \( B + A + D = 45 \)

First, we can express \( D \) in terms of \( A \) using the first two equations:
\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]
From \( B = D + 10 \), we can substitute \( B \) from the first equation:
\[ A + 20 = D + 10 \]
Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = A + 10 \]

Now we substitute \( B \) and \( D \) in terms of \( A \) into the total points equation:
\[ (A + 20) + A + (A + 10) = 45 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]
Subtract 30 from both sides:
\[ 3A = 15 \]
Divide by 3:
\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the total time Vince spent stapling reports. He started at 8:00 AM and finished at 11:00 PM. 

From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours. Converting this into minutes, we get:
\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes, we divide 900 by 15:
\[ 900 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports he staples per interval:
\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

Therefore, the total number of reports Vince stapled is:
\[ 1800 \]"
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up early.

1. **Total sleep time**: Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Converting this to minutes:
   \[
   8 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Time spent sleepwalking**: Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. The duration of sleepwalking is:
   \[
   2:38 \text{ a.m.} - 2:15 \text{ a.m.} = 23 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Time woke up early**: Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. This means she woke up at:
   \[
   6:00 \text{ a.m.} - 5 \text{ minutes} = 5:55 \text{ a.m.}
   \]
   The time she was awake before waking up early is:
   \[
   5:55 \text{ a.m.} - 6:00 \text{ a.m.} = 5 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Total time awake**: Adding the time spent sleepwalking and the time she woke up early:
   \[
   23 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 28 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Time slept on the bed**: Subtracting the total time awake from the total sleep time:
   \[
   480 \text{ minutes} - 28 \text{ minutes} = 452 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Therefore, the number of minutes Kim slept on her bed that day is 452 minutes."
"First, let's determine the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has initially. Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has two dozen (24) measuring cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons as follows:

\[ \text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

Next, Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons. So, the number of measuring spoons he has remaining is:

\[ \text{Remaining measuring spoons} = 16 - 6 = 10 \]

Now, we add the remaining measuring spoons to the number of measuring cups to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining:

\[ \text{Total utensils} = \text{Remaining measuring spoons} + \text{Measuring cups} = 10 + 24 = 34 \]

So, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is 34."
"First, let's determine the initial number of occupied beds in the hospital. The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of these beds are occupied.

\[ \text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

Next, we calculate the number of beds that are unoccupied initially:

\[ \text{Initial unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 200 = 800 \]

Now, we need to determine the number of patients admitted over 2 weeks. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, and 50 patients are admitted each day.

\[ \text{Total patients admitted in 2 weeks} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

We then subtract the total number of patients admitted from the initial unoccupied beds to find the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks.

\[ \text{Unoccupied beds after 2 weeks} = 800 - 700 = 100 \]

So, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of emails Robyn sends to her family. We know that out of the sixteen emails, seven are work emails. Therefore, the number of non-work emails is:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these non-work emails are sent to her family. According to the problem, two-thirds of the non-work emails are sent to her family. So, the number of emails sent to her family is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

Now, we need to find out how many emails are left after sending emails to her family. This is:

\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

These remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. According to the problem, one-third of these remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. So, the number of emails sent to her boyfriend is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

Therefore, the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"If Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, then Shawna is:

\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

\[ 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

The final numerical answer is 45."
"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate the number that is 20% less than the number reported by Courtney.

Courtney reported that there were 48 people in attendance. If this number is 20% more than the actual number, we can set up the following equation to find the actual number of people, which we'll call \( x \):

\[ 48 = x + 0.20x \]
\[ 48 = 1.20x \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.20:

\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \). According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls. We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so we can set up the equation \( 2J = 2 \). Solving for \( J \), we get \( J = 1 \). Therefore, Jeffrey carried 1 ball, Jason carried \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) balls, and Jordan carried \( 4 \times 1 = 4 \) balls. The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey, which is \( 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 \) balls. Since the three boys picked up and carried all the balls in one trip, the total number of balls the coach brought to practice is 7.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the number of holes at the end of the first day.
3. Calculate the number of holes at the end of the third day.
4. Find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
- First day: 10 holes
- Second day: 13 holes
- Third day: 8 holes (but they filled in 2 holes, so they actually dug 8 - 2 = 6 holes)

Total holes by the end of the third day = 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 holes.

The island had four times as many holes by the end of the third day as it did at the end of the first day. So, the number of holes at the end of the first day is:
\[ \text{Holes at the end of the first day} = \frac{29}{4} = 7.25 \]

Since the number of holes must be a whole number, and considering the context of digging holes, it's reasonable to assume the number of holes at the end of the first day is 7 (as 7.25 would imply a fractional hole, which is not practical in this context).

Now, let's find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day. The number of holes at the end of the third day is 29, and the number of holes at the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day, which is:
\[ 4 \times 7 = 28 \]

So, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[ 28 - 29 + 2 = 1 \]

Therefore, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of corn chips given the conditions.

1. Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips.
2. Collins received 15 more corn chips than the number Amora and Lainey received.

First, calculate the number of corn chips Collins received:
\[ \text{Collins' chips} = 70 + 15 = 85 \]

Next, calculate the total number of corn chips by summing the chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:
\[ \text{Total chips} = 70 + 70 + 85 \]

Now, perform the addition:
\[ 70 + 70 = 140 \]
\[ 140 + 85 = 225 \]

Therefore, the total number of corn chips is:
\[ 225 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 225 \]"
"To find the cost of the travel tickets, we need to calculate 50% more than the cost of the supplies. The cost of the supplies is $400.

First, calculate 50% of $400:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

Next, add this amount to the original cost of the supplies to find the total travel cost:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

So, the total cost of the travel is $600.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 600 \]"
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( X = S + 5 \)
2. \( S = 4A - 13 \)
3. \( X + S + A = 339 \)

First, we substitute the expressions for \( X \) and \( S \) from the first two equations into the third equation.

Substituting \( X = S + 5 \) and \( S = 4A - 13 \) into \( X + S + A = 339 \):

\[ (4A - 13) + 5 + (4A - 13) + A = 339 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 4A - 13 + 5 + 4A - 13 + A = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Add 21 to both sides:

\[ 9A = 360 \]

Divide by 9:

\[ A = 40 \]

Now, we can find \( S \) using \( S = 4A - 13 \):

\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

The final numerical answer is:
147"

     \]

Therefore, the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show is 200 minutes."
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance the bird traveled in each segment of her journey and then sum these distances.

1. **First Segment:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Direction: Norttherly
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \)

3. **Third Segment:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \)

Now, we sum the distances of all segments to find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes:

\[ 300 \text{ miles} + 36 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 446 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 446 miles."
"First, let's determine the total number of brownies Greta had initially:

- For herself, she made 1 dozen brownies.
- At her office, she received 1/2 dozen brownies.
- At her friends' surprise party, she received 4 dozen brownies.
- During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.

We'll convert all the dozen measurements to individual brownies (1 dozen = 12 brownies):

- 1 dozen = 12 brownies
- 1/2 dozen = 1/2 * 12 = 6 brownies
- 4 dozen = 4 * 12 = 48 brownies
- 1 1/2 dozen = 1.5 * 12 = 18 brownies

Now, let's sum up all the brownies:

- Brownies made for herself: 12
- Brownies received from the office: 6
- Brownies received from friends: 48
- Brownies eaten during the party: 18

Total brownies = 12 + 6 + 48 - 18 = 48

So, the number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is 48."
"First, let's determine the ages of Nani's brother and sister.

Nani's age is 8 years.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so:
\[ \text{Brother's age} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ years} \]

Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani, which means she is 75% of Nani's age:
\[ \text{Sister's age} = 0.75 \times 8 = 6 \text{ years} \]

Now, let's calculate the total age of all three family members:
\[ \text{Total age} = \text{Nani's age} + \text{Brother's age} + \text{Sister's age} \]
\[ \text{Total age} = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 \text{ years} \]

"To determine the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the total length of the fence. Since the fence is rectangular, the total length of the fence is the perimeter of the rectangle.

The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given:
- Length = 15 feet
- Width = 10 feet

Substituting the given values into the formula:
\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 25 \]
\[ P = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Robert needs 2 wooden slats for every foot of fencing. Therefore, the total number of wooden slats required is:

"First, let's determine the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington initially had and how many she gave away:

- Total boxes bought: 12
- Boxes given to mom: 2
- Boxes given to sister: 2

Total boxes given away = 2 + 2 = 4

So, the number of boxes Mrs. Harrington kept is:
12 - 4 = 8 boxes

Each box contains 20 oranges, so the total number of oranges is:
12 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 240 oranges

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges, so the number of oranges she kept is:
1/4 * 240 oranges = 60 oranges

Therefore, the number of oranges she sold is:
240 oranges - 60 oranges = 180 oranges

"To solve this problem, let's first determine the number of states in the USA. According to the latest data, the United States has 50 states.

Given that India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, we can calculate the number of states in India as follows:
- Half the number of states in the USA is \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \).
- India has 4 more than this, so the number of states in India is \( 25 + 4 = 29 \).

Now, to find the total number of states in both countries together, we add the number of states in India and the number of states in the USA:
- Total number of states = Number of states in India + Number of states in the USA
- Total number of states = 29 + 50 = 79

The final numerical answer is 79."

- Dictionary: $18
- Dinosaur book: $13
- Children's cookbook: $8

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Tyler has already saved $14. Therefore, the additional amount he needs to earn is:
Additional amount needed = Total cost - Amount saved
Additional amount needed = $39 - $14 = $25

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn the additional $25, we divide the additional amount needed by his hourly wage:
Hours needed = Additional amount needed / Hourly wage
Hours needed = $25 / $5 = 5 hours

So, Tyler has to work 5 hours to afford his books."
"First, let's determine how many cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 30 cherries and 10 more than Richard, we can calculate Richard's cherries as follows:

\[ \text{Richard's cherries} = \text{Robert's cherries} - 10 = 30 - 10 = 20 \]

Now, we know the total number of cherries is 60. We can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting the number of cherries Richard and Robert have from the total:

\[ \text{Jerry's cherries} = \text{Total cherries} - (\text{Richard's cherries} + \text{Robert's cherries}) = 60 - (20 + 30) = 60 - 50 = 10 \]

Finally, to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Robert's cherries} - \text{Jerry's cherries} = 30 - 10 = 20 \]

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of sunscreen Pamela will use while on vacation.

She re-applies sunscreen every hour she is outside, and she will be outside 4 hours a day for 8 days. So, the total number of hours she will be outside is:
\[ 4 \text{ hours/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ hours} \]

Since she uses 1 ounce of sunscreen per hour, the total amount of sunscreen she will use is:
\[ 32 \text{ hours} \times 1 \text{ ounce/hour} = 32 \text{ ounces} \]

Each bottle of sunscreen contains 8 ounces. To find out how many bottles she needs, we divide the total amount of sunscreen by the amount each bottle contains:

"To solve this problem, let's define the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother as \( D \) and \( B \) respectively.

Given:
- Emil is currently 19 years old.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.

First, let's determine how many years it will be until Emil turns 24:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \text{ years} \]

In 5 years, Emil will be 24 years old. At that time, his dad's age will be:
\[ D + 5 \]

According to the problem, at that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad:
\[ 24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5) \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ 24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5) \]
\[ 48 = D + 5 \]
\[ D = 43 \]

So, Emil's dad is currently 43 years old.

Next, we know that in 5 years, Emil will be twice as old as his brother:
\[ 24 = 2 (B + 5) \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ 24 = 2 (B + 5) \]
\[ 12 = B + 5 \]
\[ B = 7 \]

So, Emil's brother is currently 7 years old.

Now, we need to find the sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother:
\[ D + B = 43 + 7 = 50 \]

The sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is:

"First, let's find out how many students are football players. Since 20% of the class are football players, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 30 = \frac{20}{100} \times 30 = 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are football players. This means the remaining number of students is:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining 24 students are either cheerleaders or part of the band. Since 25% of the remaining students are cheerleaders or part of the band, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 24 = \frac{25}{100} \times 24 = 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are either cheerleaders or part of the band. Adding the football players to these students, we get the total number of students leaving early:

Now, we have the sizes of both Charlie's and Sophie's boots, which are 25 and 5, respectively. To find the average size, we add these sizes together and then divide by 2:

\[ \text{Average size} = \frac{25 + 5}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 15 \]"
"First, let's convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches to match the units of the flower width. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the flower bed is:

\[ 111 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 1332 \text{ inches} \]

Each flower is 12 inches wide, and there needs to be 1.5 feet (which is 18 inches) between every plant. Therefore, the total space taken by one plant and the space between it and the next plant is:

\[ 12 \text{ inches} + 18 \text{ inches} = 30 \text{ inches} \]

To find out how many plants can fit in the flower bed, we divide the total length of the flower bed by the space taken by one plant and the space between it and the next plant:

\[ \frac{1332 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/plant}} = 44.4 \]

Since Pat can't plant a fraction of a plant, she can plant 44 plants. Pat already owns 17 plants, so she needs to buy:

\[ 44 - 17 = 27 \text{ plants} \]

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for the new plants is:

\[ 27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 162 \]"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we first need to determine how many pretzels his brother eats in a day. Since Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, we calculate:

\[ \text{Pretzels Edgar's brother eats per day} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many pretzels his brother eats in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of pretzels his brother eats in a day by 7:

\[ \text{Pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week} = 9 \times 7 = 63 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 63 \]"
"To determine the total cost Katherine will spend, we need to calculate the cost for one basket and then multiply by the number of baskets.

First, let's calculate the cost for one basket:
- Cost of petunias: 3 petunias * $3.00/petunia = $9.00
- Cost of sweet potato vines: 2 sweet potato vines * $2.50/vine = $5.00

Total cost for one basket:
$9.00 (petunias) + $5.00 (sweet potato vines) = $14.00

Now, we need to find the total cost for 5 baskets:
5 baskets * $14.00/basket = $70.00

Therefore, the total amount Katherine will spend is $70.00."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

For the sunflowers:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

For the carnations:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of soil they have is 30 pounds. So, the remaining soil for roses is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. Therefore, the number of roses they can plant is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"First, let's determine how much Jessica sets aside each month for fancy shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly paycheck.

\[ \text{Monthly savings for shoes} = 25\% \times \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times \$2,000.00 = \$500.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy with her monthly savings. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes per month} = \frac{\$500.00}{\$1,000.00} = 0.5 \]

Since Jessica can only buy whole pairs of shoes, she can buy 0 pairs of shoes per month.

To find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year, we need to consider the number of months in a year, which is 12.

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes per year} = 0.5 \times 12 = 6 \]

However, since she can only buy whole pairs, the number of pairs she can buy in a year is 0.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 0 \]"
"First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, the time required to peel 90 shrimp is:

\[ \text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to saute 30 shrimp. Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, the time required to saute 90 shrimp (which is three times 30 shrimp) is:

\[ \text{Time to saute 90 shrimp} = 3 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Emily can either peel or saute shrimp simultaneously, the total time required to peel and saute 90 shrimp is the longer of the two times calculated. In this case, it is 30 minutes.

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 30 \text{ minutes} \]"
"First, let's calculate the temperature change during each phase of the air conditioner's operation.

1. **Low setting for 3 hours:**
   - Cooling rate: 2 degrees per hour
   - Time: 3 hours
   - Total cooling: \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ degrees}\)

2. **High setting for 4 hours:**
   - Cooling rate: 3 degrees per hour
   - Time: 4 hours
   - Total cooling: \(3 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ degrees}\)

3. **No air conditioner for 2 hours:**
   - Temperature increase: 2 degrees per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Total increase: \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ degrees}\)

Now, let's sum up the total cooling and the total increase in temperature:

- Total cooling: \(6 \text{ degrees} + 12 \text{ degrees} = 18 \text{ degrees}\)
- Total increase: \(4 \text{ degrees}\)

The net change in temperature is the total cooling minus the total increase:

- Net change: \(18 \text{ degrees} - 4 \text{ degrees} = 14 \text{ degrees}\)

Since the air conditioner was running and cooling the room, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's father when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Bill's father saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Since his father was 30 years old when he saw the comet, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw it for the second time.

3. **Determine the age difference between the first and second sightings:**
   - The comet orbits the sun every 75 years, so the second sighting was 75 years after the first sighting.
   - Therefore, Bill was 90 - 75 = 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

So, the final numerical answer is:
15"
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to break down the information given and calculate each category of checks.

1. **Electric Bill**: Buford writes a check once per month for the electric bill. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes 12 electric bill checks per year.
2. **Gas Bill**: Buford writes a check once per month for the gas bill. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes 12 gas bill checks per year.
3. **Church**: Buford writes a check twice per month to the church. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes \(2 \times 12 = 24\) church checks per year.
4. **Pest and Lawn Service**: Buford writes a check quarterly (every 3 months) to the pest and lawn service. There are 4 quarters in a year, so he writes 4 pest and lawn service checks per year.

Now, we sum up all the checks:
- Electric bill checks: 12
- Gas bill checks: 12
- Church checks: 24
- Pest and lawn service checks: 4

Total number of checks per year = \(12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52\)

The final numerical answer is 52."
"Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as \( F \). According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4}F \). The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany, so the number of flights to France is \( \frac{1}{4}F \) and the number of flights to Germany is also \( \frac{1}{4}F \).

The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and this is half the number of flights the first plane makes in a day. Therefore, the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day is \( 2 \times 44 = 88 \). So, \( F = 88 \).

Now, we can calculate the number of flights to France by the first plane:
\[ \text{Flights to France} = \frac{1}{4}F = \frac{1}{4} \times 88 = 22. \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 22 \]"
"First, let's determine the duration of each wolf's howl.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so:
\[ \text{Chikote's howl duration} = 2 \times 20 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Igneous howls for as long as Tobias and Chikote combined, so:
\[ \text{Igneous's howl duration} = 20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} = 60 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, let's find the combined duration of all three wolves' howls in seconds:
\[ \text{Combined duration} = 20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} + 60 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ seconds} \]

To convert the combined duration from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):
\[ \text{Combined duration in minutes} = \frac{120 \text{ seconds}}{60} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much money Adam's father gave him. Since his father gave him twice as much as his mother, and his mother gave him $6, his father gave him \(2 \times 6 = 12\) dollars.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money Adam received from his mother and father:
\[6 + 12 = 18\]

Adam spent $30 on the trousers. To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount of money he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers:
\[30 - 18 = 12\]

So, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings. The final numerical answer is:
\[12\]"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the ages of the children as follows:
- Akbar's age = 3 years
- Alessandro's age = 4 years
- Helene's age = \( H \) years
- Wilfred's age = \( W \) years

We know the total age of the children is 20 years:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

We are also given that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{3 + 4 + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene is twice the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now we substitute \( H = 10 \) into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Therefore, Wilfred's age is 3 years. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Walter has collected from his neighbors and the online fund:

- From neighbors: $500
- From online fund: $1500

Total collected so far: $500 + $1500 = $2000

Next, we need to determine how much Walter's lawyer will donate. The lawyer will donate three times as much as everyone else donates. To find out how much everyone else has donated, we need to add the $200 that Walter's friend is going to give:

Total donations from neighbors and online fund: $500 + $1500 = $2000
Friend's donation: $200

Total donations from everyone else: $2000 + $200 = $2200

The lawyer's donation will be three times this amount:

Lawyer's donation: $2200 * 3 = $6600

So, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6600."
"First, we need to calculate the total number of cookies. Since there were 100 guests and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies/guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies} \]

The bride decided to give half of the cookies to the church next door. Therefore, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500 \text{ cookies}}{2} = 750 \text{ cookies} \]

Each person in the church next door got 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church next door, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people} \]

So, the number of people in the church next door is 50. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 50 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the distribution of the watermelon slices among the family members. Let's denote the total volume of the watermelon as \( V \).

Given that there are 2 adults and 4 kids, and each adult's slice is twice as big as each kid's slice, we can represent the volume of each adult's slice as \( 2x \) and the volume of each kid's slice as \( x \).

The total volume of the watermelon is the sum of the volumes of all the slices:
\[ 2(2x) + 4(x) = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

Since the total volume of the watermelon is \( V \), we have:
\[ 8x = V \]

Each adult's slice is \( 2x \), so the total volume of the slices for the adults is:
\[ 2(2x) = 4x \]

To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we calculate:
\[ \frac{4x}{V} \times 100\% \]

Since \( 8x = V \), we can substitute \( V \) with \( 8x \):
\[ \frac{4x}{8x} \times 100\% = \frac{1}{2} \times 100\% = 50\% \]

Therefore, each adult gets 50% of the watermelon. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 50 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on inpatient rounds. He has 9 inpatients, and each round takes 20 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent on inpatient rounds is:
\[ 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes per inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time spent on appointments. He has 10 appointments, and each appointment takes 30 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent on appointments is:
\[ 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes per appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's add the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments to find the total time spent on these activities:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 480 \text{ minutes} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time spent from minutes to hours:
\[ 480 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic in total. Therefore, the time left for him to update his records is:

"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to complete all the steps and then subtract this total from the desired serving time of 5:00 pm.

1. Time to make the cake batter: 20 minutes
2. Time to bake the cake: 30 minutes
3. Time to cool the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
4. Time to frost the cake: 10 minutes

Now, let's add up all these times:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Convert 180 minutes into hours and minutes:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Jordan needs 3 hours to complete all the steps. If she wants the cake to be ready by 5:00 pm, we subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm:
\[ 5:00 \text{ pm} - 3 \text{ hours} = 2:00 \text{ pm} \]

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"To find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we first need to determine the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes.

Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars. Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes is:
\[ \text{Chocolate bars per box (Peter)} = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]

Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars. Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes is:
\[ \text{Chocolate bars per box (Martha)} = \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

Now, to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we subtract the number of chocolate bars per box for Martha from the number of chocolate bars per box for Peter:
\[ \text{Difference} = 16 - 8 = 8 \]

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of female porcupines in the park. Given that the population of porcupines is 50 and the number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population, we can calculate the number of female porcupines as follows:

\[ \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the number of babies born each month is:

\[ \text{Number of babies born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120 \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[ \text{Total number of babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440 \]

The initial population of porcupines is 50. After a year, the total number of porcupines in the park will be the initial population plus the total number of babies born in a year:

\[ \text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1490 \]"
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the swimming pool. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:

\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

\[ \text{Volume} = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. We know that 1 cubic foot is approximately equal to 7.48 gallons. Therefore:

\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = 1400 \times 7.48 \]

\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = 10472 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:

\[ \text{Cost} = 10472 \times 0.10 \]

\[ \text{Cost} = 1047.20 \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is $1047.20."

Next, we calculate the distance Shandy traveled:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} = 45 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the distance Matteo traveled from the distance Shandy traveled:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of students over 16 years old and the number of students under 16 years old.

Since half of the students are over 16 years old:
\[ \text{Number of students over 16} = \frac{3000}{2} = 1500 \]

Since the other half are under 16 years old:
\[ \text{Number of students under 16} = \frac{3000}{2} = 1500 \]

Next, we find the number of male students over 16 years old and the number of male students under 16 years old.

One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male:
\[ \text{Number of male students over 16} = \frac{1500}{4} = 375 \]

One-half of the students under 16 years old are male:
\[ \text{Number of male students under 16} = \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \]

Now, we can find the number of female students over 16 years old and the number of female students under 16 years old.

The number of female students over 16 years old is:
\[ \text{Number of female students over 16} = 1500 - 375 = 1125 \]

The number of female students under 16 years old is:
\[ \text{Number of female students under 16} = 1500 - 750 = 750 \]

Finally, the total number of female students enrolled at the school is:
\[ \text{Total number of female students} = 1125 + 750 = 1875 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many laps each person can run:

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) laps.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps.

Now, to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run:

"First, let's calculate the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day.

On the first day:
- Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity, which is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons.

So, the total amount of water pumped on the first day is \( 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \) gallons.

On the second day:
- Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons.

So, the total amount of water pumped on the second day is \( 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \) gallons.

The total amount of water pumped in two days is \( 7875 + 4125 = 12000 \) gallons.

The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, so the remaining amount of water needed to fill the tank is \( 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \) gallons.

The final numerical answer is 6000 gallons."
"Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as \( C \).

First, we know that the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour for 5 hours. This means that after 5 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ C \times (1 - 0.09)^5 = C \times 0.91^5 \]

Next, for the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour. So, after another 3 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ C \times 0.91^5 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = C \times 0.91^5 \times 0.93^3 \]

We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ C \times 0.91^5 \times 0.93^3 = 0.28 \times C \]

We can cancel \( C \) from both sides of the equation (assuming \( C \neq 0 \)):
\[ 0.91^5 \times 0.93^3 = 0.28 \]

Now, let's calculate the values:
\[ 0.91^5 \approx 0.656 \]
\[ 0.93^3 \approx 0.817 \]
\[ 0.91^5 \times 0.93^3 \approx 0.656 \times 0.817 \approx 0.535 \]

Since we know that the charge remaining is 28%, we can set up the equation:
\[ 0.535C = 0.28 \]
\[ C = \frac{0.28}{0.535} \approx 0.524 \]

Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 52.4%."
"First, let's calculate Janet's total weekly earnings. She earns $10 per hour from her job and $15 per hour from tips, so her total hourly wage is:

\[ 10 + 15 = 25 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Since she works 40 hours a week, her weekly earnings are:

\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ dollars per week} \]

Next, we need to determine how much she needs to save to buy the car. The downpayment for the car is $10,000. She wants to save 20% of this amount:

\[ 10000 \times 0.20 = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take for her to save $2000 at a rate of $1000 per week. We do this by dividing the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:

\[ \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

So, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment for the car. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased:

- Peaches: 3 peaches * $0.50/peach = $1.50
- Pears: 4 pears * $0.50/pear = $2.00
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00/kiwi = $2.00
- Apples: 5 apples * $0.75/apple = $3.75

Now, let's sum up the cost of these fruits:

Total cost of purchased fruits = $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar has $10 to spend, so the remaining amount he can spend on plums is:

Remaining amount = $10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums he can buy is:

Number of plums = $0.75 / $0.25/plum = 3 plums

So, the final numerical answer is 3."
"First, we need to determine the total number of pieces of sweets Anne purchased. Since she bought a box containing 15 packs and each pack has 60 pieces, we calculate the total number of pieces as follows:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept 2 packs for herself. The number of pieces in these 2 packs is:

\[ 2 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

To find out how many pieces of sweets she gave to her friends, we subtract the number of pieces she kept from the total number of pieces:

\[ 900 \text{ pieces} - 120 \text{ pieces} = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne gave these 780 pieces to her 10 friends equally. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide the total number of pieces given to friends by the number of friends:

\[ \frac{780 \text{ pieces}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 78 \text{ pieces per friend} \]

So, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 78 \]"
"To calculate the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating compounded price increases:

\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (1 + \text{Rate})^{\text{Number of Years}} \]

Given:
- Initial Price = $120
- Rate = 5% = 0.05
- Number of Years = 3

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 139 \]

So, the price of carrots after three years would be $139."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many selfies and portraits Olivia uploaded to her albums. We know that she uploaded a total of 72 pictures into 8 albums, with 3 albums dedicated to selfies and 2 albums dedicated to portraits. This means the remaining albums are for other types of pictures.

First, let's calculate the number of albums that are not selfies or portraits:
\[ 8 \text{ total albums} - 3 \text{ selfies albums} - 2 \text{ portraits albums} = 3 \text{ other albums} \]

Since the 3 albums for selfies and 2 albums for portraits are already accounted for, the remaining 3 albums must contain the rest of the pictures. Let's denote the number of pictures in each album as \( x \). Therefore, the total number of pictures can be expressed as:
\[ 3x + 2x + 3x = 72 \]
\[ 8x = 72 \]
\[ x = \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

So, each album contains 9 pictures. Now, we can determine the number of selfies and portraits:
- Number of selfies = 3 albums * 9 pictures/album = 27 pictures
- Number of portraits = 2 albums * 9 pictures/album = 18 pictures

Thus, the total number of selfies and portraits is:
\[ 27 + 18 = 45 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 45 \]"
"To determine how long James spends reading, we first need to find out how many minutes it takes him to read one page. Since it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can calculate the time it takes to read one page by dividing 10 minutes by 3 pages:

\[ \text{Time per page} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages. We do this by multiplying the time it takes to read one page by 18:

\[ \text{Time to read 18 pages} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, James spends 60 minutes reading. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 60 \]"
"To determine the current number of guests in the hotel, we need to account for the changes in the number of guests over the day.

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.

- 24 guests checked out early.
- 15 guests checked out late.
- Twice as many people checked in as those who checked out late. Since 15 guests checked out late, twice that number is \(2 \times 15 = 30\) guests.
- 7 more guests checked in after dinner.

Let's calculate the number of guests step by step:

1. Subtract the early checkouts from the initial number of guests:
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76
   \]

2. Subtract the late checkouts from the remaining guests:
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61
   \]

3. Add the guests who checked in after the late checkouts:
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91
   \]

4. Add the additional guests who checked in after dinner:
   \[
   91 + 7 = 98
   \]

Therefore, the hotel now has 98 guests.

\[
\boxed{98}

4 (Wednesday) + 6 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) = 22 bananas.

The final numerical answer is 22."
"First, let's determine the number of easy, average, and difficult questions in the quiz.

- Total number of questions: 60
- Easy questions: 40% of 60 = 0.40 * 60 = 24 questions
- Average and difficult questions combined: 60 - 24 = 36 questions
- Since the average and difficult questions are equally divided, there are 36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct. So, the number of easy questions she is sure to get correct is:
\[ 75\% \text{ of } 24 = 0.75 \times 24 = 18 \]

Aries is sure to get half of the average and difficult questions correct. So, the number of average and difficult questions she is sure to get correct is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \text{ of } 18 = 9 \]

Adding these up, the total number of questions Aries is sure to get correct is:
\[ 18 \text{ (easy)} + 9 \text{ (average)} + 9 \text{ (difficult)} = 36 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 36 \]"
"First, let's determine the price of a large stuffed animal. Since each small stuffed animal costs $4 and large stuffed animals cost three times as much, the price of a large stuffed animal is:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( L \). According to the problem, the number of small stuffed animals sold is twice the number of large stuffed animals sold, so the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2L \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as the sum of the earnings from the large stuffed animals and the small stuffed animals. The earnings from the large stuffed animals are \( 12L \) dollars, and the earnings from the small stuffed animals are \( 4 \times 2L = 8L \) dollars. The total earnings are given as $120, so we can set up the following equation:
\[ 12L + 8L = 120 \]
\[ 20L = 120 \]
\[ L = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

Since the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2L \), we have:
\[ 2L = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we first need to calculate the total number of sandwiches they eat in one day and then multiply that by 7 (the number of days in a week).

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, the wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and the son eats 2 sandwiches per day. So, the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by the family is:

\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \text{ sandwiches per day} \]

Now, to find out how many sandwiches they eat in one week, we multiply the daily total by 7:

\[ 11 \times 7 = 77 \text{ sandwiches per week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 77."
"First, let's calculate Suzanne's earnings from selling cookies and cupcakes.

She sold 80 cookies at $1 each:
\[ 80 \text{ cookies} \times \$1/\text{cookie} = \$80 \]

She sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each:
\[ 60 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$4/\text{cupcake} = \$240 \]

Now, let's add these amounts to find her total earnings:
\[ \$80 + \$240 = \$320 \]

Next, we need to account for the money she gave to her two sisters. She gave each sister $10:
\[ 2 \times \$10 = \$20 \]

Finally, we subtract the amount she gave to her sisters from her total earnings to find out how much money she has left:
\[ \$320 - \$20 = \$300 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$300 \]"

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the ore mining rate with a steel pickaxe:**
   - A dwarf with an iron pickaxe mines 12 pounds per day.
   - A dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 50% more than a dwarf with an iron pickaxe.
   - 50% of 12 pounds is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6\) pounds.
   - Therefore, a dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines \(12 + 6 = 18\) pounds per day.

2. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in one day:**
   - Each dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 18 pounds per day.
   - 40 dwarves would mine \(18 \times 40 = 720\) pounds per day.

3. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month:**

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to use the information that the prices are proportional. We can set up a proportion based on the given information:

- The first package with 2 sandwiches costs $3.
- The second package with 4 sandwiches costs $6.
- The third package with 8 sandwiches costs an unknown amount, which we will call \( x \).

Since the prices are proportional, the ratio of the number of sandwiches to the cost should be the same for all packages. We can write the proportion as:

\[
\frac{2 \text{ sandwiches}}{3 \text{ dollars}} = \frac{4 \text{ sandwiches}}{6 \text{ dollars}} = \frac{8 \text{ sandwiches}}{x \text{ dollars}}
\]

We can use the first two parts of the proportion to find the cost of the third package. Notice that the second package has twice the number of sandwiches as the first package and the cost is also twice. Therefore, the cost of the third package should be four times the cost of the first package. Since the first package costs $3, the third package should cost:

\[
4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost \(\boxed{12}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine how much Tom has to pay for the bedroom set after using the money from selling his old bedroom. He initially buys the bedroom set for $3000 and sells his old bedroom for $1000. Therefore, the remaining amount he needs to pay is:

\[ 3000 - 1000 = 2000 \]

Next, Tom has to pay 10% of this remaining amount each month. To find out how much he has to pay per month, we calculate 10% of $2000:

\[ 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst due to the gust of wind. Sally initially had 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst.

\[ \text{Red balloons that burst} = 25 \times \frac{40}{100} = 25 \times 0.4 = 10 \]

So, the number of red balloons remaining is:

\[ \text{Remaining red balloons} = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Next, Sally accidentally released half of the yellow balloons. She initially had 12 yellow balloons.

\[ \text{Yellow balloons released} = 12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons remaining is:

\[ \text{Remaining yellow balloons} = 12 - 6 = 6 \]

Sally found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining balloons.

\[ \text{Blue balloons added} = 8 \times \frac{75}{100} = 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \]

So, the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school is the sum of the remaining red, yellow, and the added blue balloons.

\[ \text{Total balloons} = \text{Remaining red balloons} + \text{Remaining yellow balloons} + \text{Blue balloons added} \]
\[ \text{Total balloons} = 15 + 6 + 6 = 27 \]

"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of the different scenarios and their outcomes.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of the substitute teacher collecting the homework: 50% or 0.50
   - Therefore, the probability of the substitute teacher collecting the homework: \(0.50 \times 0.50 = 0.25\) or 25%

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having the normal teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension: 40% or 0.40
   - Therefore, the probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension: \(1 - 0.40 = 0.60\) or 60%
   - Probability of Marcus convincing the teacher his dog ate the assignment: 20% or 0.20
   - Therefore, the probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension and Marcus not convincing the teacher: \(0.60 \times (1 - 0.20) = 0.60 \times 0.80 = 0.48\) or 48%
   - Therefore, the probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension and Marcus convincing the teacher: \(0.60 \times 0.20 = 0.12\) or 12%
   - Therefore, the probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension: \(0.48 + 0.12 = 0.60\) or 60%

3. **Total Probability of Not Having to Turn in Homework:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher and the substitute teacher collecting the homework: 25%
   - Probability of having the normal teacher and the normal teacher not giving an extension: 60%

"First, we need to determine the total number of seats that are not occupied by graduates and faculty. The total capacity of the Fine Arts Center is 6000 seats. After accounting for 950 seats for graduates and 300 seats for faculty, the number of seats available for distribution to graduates' friends and family is:

\[ 6000 - 950 - 300 = 5750 \]

Next, we need to find out how many tickets each graduate will receive if the 5750 seats are split equally among the 950 graduates. We do this by dividing the number of available seats by the number of graduates:

\[ \frac{5750}{950} = 6.052631578947368 \]

Since the number of tickets must be a whole number, we round 6.052631578947368 to the nearest whole number, which is 6. Therefore, each graduate would receive 6 tickets to give to their friends and family.

"First, let's calculate the total amount Jim borrowed during his college years. He borrowed $50,000 per year for 4 years, so the total amount borrowed is:

\[ 50,000 \times 4 = 200,000 \]

Next, let's determine his income after graduating from college. His original income was $25,000 per year, and his income tripled, so his new income is:

\[ 25,000 \times 3 = 75,000 \]

Now, let's calculate the total income he would have earned if he had not gone to college. He would have earned $25,000 per year for 4 years:

\[ 25,000 \times 4 = 100,000 \]

The total income he lost by going to college is the difference between the income he would have earned and the income he actually earned:

\[ 100,000 - 75,000 = 25,000 \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost of his loans and the income he lost. The total cost of his loans is $200,000, and the income he lost is $25,000, so the total cost is:

\[ 200,000 + 25,000 = 225,000 \]

To find out how long it would take him to earn this amount, we divide the total cost by his new income:

\[ \frac{225,000}{75,000} = 3 \]

So, it would take Jim 3 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the income lost from not working while in school. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total square feet of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of each piece of fabric he requires. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide.

Each piece of fabric is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. Therefore, the dimensions of each piece of fabric are:
- Length: \( 6 + 2 = 8 \) feet
- Width: \( 8 + 2 = 10 \) feet

Next, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
\[
\text{Area of one piece} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 8 \, \text{feet} \times 10 \, \text{feet} = 80 \, \text{square feet}
\]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[
\text{Total area} = 2 \times 80 \, \text{square feet} = 160 \, \text{square feet}
\]

Thus, the total number of square feet of fabric Jim needs to buy is:
\[
\boxed{160}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Monday's Deliveries:**
   - The post office delivered 425 letters on Monday.

2. **Tuesday's Deliveries:**
   - On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday.
   - One-fifth of Monday's deliveries is \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \).
   - Therefore, Tuesday's deliveries are \( 85 + 17 = 102 \) letters.

3. **Wednesday's Deliveries:**
   - On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday.
   - Twice Tuesday's deliveries is \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \).
   - Therefore, Wednesday's deliveries are \( 204 + 5 = 209 \) letters.

4. **Total Deliveries:**
   - To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we sum the deliveries of each day.
   - Total deliveries = Monday's deliveries + Tuesday's deliveries + Wednesday's deliveries
   - Total deliveries = \( 425 + 102 + 209 \)

Now, let's calculate the total:

\[
425 + 102 + 209 = 736

   - Since he won, this is a positive amount, but for the purpose of calculating the total loss, we consider the amount lost, which is $0.

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Amount won in the second race = $11.
   - Amount lost in the third race = 1.5 * $11 = $16.5.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost:
- Total loss = Amount lost in the first race + Amount lost in the third race
- Total loss = $5 + $16.5 = $21.5

To find the average loss per race, we divide the total loss by the number of races:
- Number of races = 3
- Average loss per race = Total loss / Number of races
- Average loss per race = $21.5 / 3 = $7.1667 (rounded to four decimal places)

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{7.1667}

"To find the total number of people in South America, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country and then by the number of people living in each city.

Number of countries in South America = 26
Number of cities in each country = 5
Number of people in each city = 1000

Total number of people = Number of countries × Number of cities per country × Number of people per city
Total number of people = 26 × 5 × 1000

Now, let's calculate the total number of people:
Total number of people = 26 × 5 × 1000 = 130,000

The final numerical answer is 130,000."
"First, we need to convert all measurements to the same unit for easier comparison. Let's use inches.

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, Xavier's height in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Xavier grew 3 inches, so his current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole's initial height was 50 inches. Cole grew 2 inches, so his current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is:
\[ 1 \text{ inch} \]"
"Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( 420 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 420 \]"
"To determine the number of hours each painter worked, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of days the painters worked:**
   - There are 3 weeks of work.
   - Each week has 7 days.
   - Therefore, the total number of days is \(3 \times 7 = 21\) days.

2. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by the team:**
   - Each day, the team worked \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day.
   - Therefore, the total number of hours worked by the team is \( 21 \times \frac{3}{8} \).

3. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by the team:**
   \[
   21 \times \frac{3}{8} = \frac{21 \times 3}{8} = \frac{63}{8} = 7.875 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of hours each painter worked:**
   - There are 4 painters.
   - Therefore, each painter worked \( \frac{7.875}{4} \) hours.

5. **Calculate the number of hours each painter worked:**
   \[
   \frac{7.875}{4} = 1.96875 \text{ hours}

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, Rory retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2}) = 2 \cdot 19 \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now that we know \( x = 6 \), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

So, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation year by year from 2007 to 2010.

The initial price of the car in 2007 is $20,000. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year, which means it retains 79% (100% - 21%) of its value each year.

Let's calculate the price for each year:

- **2007 to 2008**: Price = $20,000 * 0.79
- **2008 to 2009**: Price = (Price in 2008) * 0.79
- **2009 to 2010**: Price = (Price in 2009) * 0.79

Now, let's perform the calculations:

1. Price in 2008:
\[ 20000 \times 0.79 = 15800 \]

2. Price in 2009:
\[ 15800 \times 0.79 = 12522 \]

3. Price in 2010:
\[ 12522 \times 0.79 = 9824.38 \]

Therefore, the price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9,824.38."
"First, let's determine the number of English books. Since half of the 50 books are written in English, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of English books} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

Next, we calculate the number of German books. Since 10% of the books are written in German, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of German books} = 10\% \times 50 = 0.10 \times 50 = 5 \]

Now, to find the number of Spanish books, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:

\[ \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - (\text{Number of English books} + \text{Number of German books}) \]
\[ \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - (25 + 5) \]
\[ \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - 30 \]
\[ \text{Number of Spanish books} = 20 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 20."

"To find the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we need to follow the sequence of events and update the number of people on the train accordingly.

1. **Initial number of people on the train:**
   Romeo boards the train with 120 people.
   \[
   \text{Initial number of people} = 120
   \]

2. **First stop:**
   20 more people board the train.
   \[
   \text{Number of people after first stop} = 120 + 20 = 140
   \]

3. **Second stop:**
   50 people disembark the train.
   \[
   \text{Number of people after disembarking} = 140 - 50 = 90

   At the second stop, twice the number of people who disembarked (which is 50) board the train.
   \[
   \text{Number of people who boarded} = 2 \times 50 = 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of people after second stop} = 90 + 100 = 190
   \]

4. **Third stop:**
   80 more people disembark the train.
   \[

"To determine the cost of renovating the kitchen floor, we first need to calculate how many tiles are required to cover the 200 square feet.

Each tile is a square with a side length of 1 foot, so the area of each tile is:
\[ 1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt} \]

Since the total area of the kitchen floor is 200 square feet, the number of tiles needed is:
\[ 200 \text{ SqFt} \div 1 \text{ SqFt/tile} = 200 \text{ tiles} \]

Each tile costs $12, so the total cost for 200 tiles is:
\[ 200 \text{ tiles} \times \$12/\text{tile} = \$2400 \]

Therefore, the cost to renovate the kitchen floor is:
\[ \$2400 \]"
"To determine how much James pays for insurance a year after his accident, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the increased monthly cost due to the accident.
2. Determine the annual cost based on the increased monthly cost.

First, let's calculate the increased monthly cost:
- The normal cost of insurance is $120 a month.
- The increase is 60% of the normal cost.

\[ \text{Increase} = 120 \times \frac{60}{100} = 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the increased monthly cost is:
\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Next, we calculate the annual cost:
- The increased monthly cost is $192.
- There are 12 months in a year.

\[ \text{Annual cost} = 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the number of loads required for the twin beds and the king size bed separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of loads for the twin beds:
- Greg has 4 twin beds.
- Each load can wash 2 twin sets of sheets.
- Therefore, the number of loads for the twin beds is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) loads per week.

Next, let's calculate the number of loads for the king size bed:
- Greg has 1 king size bed.
- Each load can wash 1 king set of sheets.
- Therefore, the number of loads for the king size bed is \( \frac{1}{1} = 1 \) load per week.

Now, let's find the total number of loads per week:
- Total loads per week = Loads for twin beds + Loads for king size bed
- Total loads per week = 2 + 1 = 3 loads per week.

Finally, let's calculate the total number of loads per year:
- There are 52 weeks in a year.
- Total loads per year = Total loads per week * Weeks per year
- Total loads per year = 3 * 52 = 156 loads.

"To determine the total number of movies Jill and her friends can watch in 4 weeks, we need to first calculate the number of movies they watch in one weekend and then extend that to four weekends.

1. **Movies watched on Saturday:**
   - They watch 4 movies on Saturday.

2. **Movies watched on Sunday:**
   - They watch half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday.
   - Therefore, the number of movies watched on Sunday is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \).

3. **Total movies watched in one weekend:**
   - Total movies watched in one weekend = Movies on Saturday + Movies on Sunday
   - Total movies watched in one weekend = 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

4. **Total movies watched in 4 weeks:**
   - Since they watch movies every weekend, they watch 4 weekends in 4 weeks.
   - Total movies watched in 4 weeks = Total movies watched in one weekend \(\times\) Number of weekends
   - Total movies watched in 4 weeks = 6 \(\times\) 4 = 24 movies.

Thus, the total number of movies they can watch in 4 weeks is 24."

"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time for the meal is the sum of the times for both parts, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Next, we isolate \( D \) by subtracting 18 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Then, we solve for \( D \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's part as follows:

\[ Betsy's\ part = D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's break down the costs:

1. The cost of the cast is $200.
2. The cost of the visit is $300/hour for 30 minutes. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the cost for the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.
3. The cost of the painkillers is $4/pill for 30 pills. So, the cost for the painkillers is $4 * 30 = $120.
4. The cost of parking is $6/hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours. So, the cost for parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add up all these costs to find the total cost of the doctor's visit:

Total cost = Cost of the cast + Cost of the visit + Cost of the painkillers + Cost of parking

Total cost = $482

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"First, we need to determine how many emails James does not respond to in a day. Since 20% of the 80 emails do not require any response, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 80 = \frac{20}{100} \times 80 = 0.2 \times 80 = 16 \]

So, James does not respond to 16 emails a day. This means he responds to the remaining emails:

\[ 80 - 16 = 64 \]

James responds to 64 emails each day. To find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of emails he responds to each day by 5:

\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 320."

"First, let's determine the number of big coupons Anthony wants to send. Since he wants to send twice as many big coupons as small coupons, and he wants to send 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is:

\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, and he is sending 700 of them:

\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, and he is sending 1400 of them:

\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of mailing all the coupons, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the cost of mailing the big coupons:

"To determine the cost Dennis will incur to purchase 6 pounds of butter under the promotion, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total amount of butter needed:**
   Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
   \[
   \text{Total butter needed} = 6 \text{ dozen} \times 1 \text{ pound/dozen} = 6 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Understand the promotion:**
   The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter get one half off."" This means for every 2 pounds of butter purchased, Dennis only pays for 1 pound.

3. **Calculate the number of sets of 2 pounds needed:**
   Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter.
   \[
   \text{Number of sets of 2 pounds} = \frac{6 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds/set}} = 3 \text{ sets}
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost for each set:**
   The cost of butter is $4.00 per pound.
   \[
   \text{Cost for 1 pound in a set} = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Since the second pound in each set is half off, the cost for the second pound is:
   \[
   \text{Cost for 0.5 pounds} = \frac{4 \text{ dollars}}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Therefore, the total cost for one set of 2 pounds is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she spent \( \frac{1}{4} \) of $60.
   \[
   \text{Amount Maggie spent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15
   \]
   Therefore, the amount Maggie has left is:
   \[
   60 - 15 = 45

"First, let's determine the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats:
\[ 10 + 4 = 14 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Together, the first and second monkeys eat:
\[ 10 + 14 = 24 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. Therefore, the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day is:
\[ \frac{315}{7} = 45 \text{ bananas each day} \]

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we subtract the number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day:
\[ 45 - 24 = 21 \text{ bananas each day} \]

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 21 \]"
"Teddy finished half of the first 500-piece puzzle, which means Teddy placed 500 / 2 = 250 pieces of the first puzzle. Teddy also finished the second 500-piece puzzle, which means Teddy placed 500 pieces of the second puzzle. Therefore, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is 250 + 500 = 750 pieces."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the roses Jenny bought. She bought 15 roses, and since roses cost $2 each, the cost for the roses is:
\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2/\text{rose} = \$30 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jenny has initially. She arrived with five 5 dollar bills, so she has:
\[ 5 \times \$5 = \$25 \]

Since the total cost of the roses is $30 and Jenny only has $25, she needs an additional $5 to pay for the roses. However, the question asks how many quarters she leaves with, which implies we need to find out how many quarters she receives in change.

The change she receives is:
\[ \$30 - \$25 = \$5 \]

Since quarters are worth $0.25 each, the number of quarters she receives is:
\[ \frac{\$5}{\$0.25/\text{quarter}} = 20 \text{ quarters} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total money Terry makes from selling milkshakes:

\[ 9 \text{ burger platters} \times \$11 \text{ per burger platter} = 9 \times 11 = \$99.00 \]

Then, let's calculate the total money Terry makes from selling sodas:
\[ 20 \text{ sodas} \times \$1.50 \text{ per soda} = 20 \times 1.50 = \$30.00 \]

Now, let's add up all the totals to find the overall amount of money Terry makes:
\[ \$33.00 + \$99.00 + \$30.00 = \$162.00 \]

So, the total amount of money Terry makes is:
\[ \$162.00 \]"
"To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the arrival and departure times of each train and then find out when Paul's train arrives.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays in the station for 20 minutes.
   - Departure time: 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves (30 minutes after 30 minutes = 60 minutes).
   - Stays in the station for a quarter of the first train's stay time (20 minutes / 4 = 5 minutes).
   - Departure time: 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives 60 minutes after the second train leaves (65 minutes).
   - Leaves immediately after it arrives, so it stays in the station for 0 minutes.
   - Departure time: 65 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves (65 minutes + 20 minutes = 85 minutes).
   - This is the train Paul needs to board.

Now, we need to determine how long Paul will wait for his train. Since Paul arrives at the station at the start (0 minutes) and the fourth train arrives at 85 minutes, Paul will wait for 85 minutes.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate how many toothpicks Melanie has saved so far. She has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks.

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie needs a total of 200 toothpicks. She has already saved 120 toothpicks, so she still needs:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks, we divide the number of toothpicks she still needs by the number of toothpicks she saves each week:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take her 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks."
"First, let's determine the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. The original price of the watch is $2000, and he bought it at 75% of its original price.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers bought the watch for} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price. The original price was $2000, and the friend bought it for $1800.

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

To find the percentage discount:

\[ \text{Percentage discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is 10%."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs over a period of 4 hours.

1. First, we need to find out how many seconds are in 4 hours:
   \[
   4 \text{ hours} = 4 \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 4 \times 60 \times 60 \text{ seconds} = 14400 \text{ seconds}
   \]

2. Since one spring creates one jellyfish every second, in 14400 seconds, one spring would create:
   \[
   14400 \text{ jellyfish}
   \]

3. If we have 5 springs working simultaneously, the total number of jellyfish created would be:
   \[
   5 \times 14400 = 72000 \text{ jellyfish}
   \]

Therefore, 5 springs working at the same rate would create 72000 jellyfish in 4 hours."

James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour. To find out how long it took him to walk 4 miles, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 1 hour."
"First, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually.

Jenny buys 10 bunches, and each bunch has an average of 4 bananas. Therefore, the total number of bananas she buys is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

The cost of buying 40 bananas individually at $0.80 each is:
\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches.

Jenny buys 10 bunches at $3.00 per bunch, so the total cost is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

Now, we find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually:
\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

So, the amount of money Jenny saved is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) and the amount of fence Harry gets as \( H \). According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so we can write:

\[ H = S + 60 \]

Since the total amount of fence is 100 feet, we also have:

\[ S + H = 100 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Subtract 60 from both sides:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many inches a crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to find the growth rate per year. The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, so the growth rate per year is:

\[
\text{Growth rate per year} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year}
\]

Now, to find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we multiply the growth rate per year by 13:

\[
\text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches}

"To determine how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply by their respective prices.

First, let's find out how many of each type of bike were sold:
- Total bikes sold = 300
- Trekking bikes sold = 50% of 300 = 0.5 * 300 = 150
- BMX bikes sold = 15% of 300 = 0.15 * 300 = 45
- MTB bikes sold = Total bikes sold - Trekking bikes sold - BMX bikes sold = 300 - 150 - 45 = 65

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike:
- Price of an MTB = $500
- Price of a BMX bike = Half the price of an MTB = $500 / 2 = $250
- Price of a Trekking bike = $450

Now, we calculate the total earnings:
- Earnings from MTB bikes = 65 * $500 = $32,500
- Earnings from BMX bikes = 45 * $250 = $11,250
- Earnings from Trekking bikes = 150 * $450 = $67,500

Finally, we sum up the earnings from all types of bikes:
- Total earnings = $32,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $111,250

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of hours John spends learning each week, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. **Calculate the number of periods John takes each day:**
   - A normal student has 6 periods.
   - John has 2 extra classes.
   - Therefore, John takes \(6 + 2 = 8\) periods each day.

2. **Calculate the total time spent in class each day:**
   - Each period is 40 minutes long.
   - John has 8 periods each day.
   - Therefore, the total time spent in class each day is \(8 \times 40 = 320\) minutes.

3. **Calculate the total time spent in class each week:**
   - John goes to class 5 days a week.
   - Therefore, the total time spent in class each week is \(320 \times 5 = 1600\) minutes.

4. **Calculate the extra learning time John spends on Saturday and Sunday:**
   - John spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday.
   - The total weekly minutes are 1600.
   - Therefore, the extra learning time is \(\frac{1600}{16} = 100\) minutes.

5. **Calculate the total time spent learning each week:**
   - The total time spent learning each week is the sum of the time spent in class and the extra learning time.
   - Therefore, the total time spent learning each week is \(1600 + 100 = 1700\) minutes.

6. **Convert the total time spent learning from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the total time spent learning each week in hours is \(\frac{1700}{60} = \frac{1700 \div 20}{60 \div 20} = \frac{85}{3} \approx 28.33\) hours.

Next, we need to find out how high the ball bounces on its first bounce. The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height. Therefore, the height after the first bounce is:

\[ 72 \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we need to find out how high the ball bounces on its second bounce. The ball again bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its height after the first bounce. Therefore, the height after the second bounce is:

\[ 48 \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height the ball goes on its second bounce is:

\[ 32 \text{ feet} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 32 \]"
"First, let's convert all heights to inches for easier calculation. The first child is 6 feet tall, which is 6 * 12 = 72 inches. The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall. The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the meat, so it left \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
3. The Allosaurus then ate the remaining meat, which is \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms. According to the problem, this amount is 270 kilograms.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]

To find \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

Therefore, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 kilograms.

"First, let's calculate the total area of the walls that Tony needs to paint.

The north and south walls are each 10 feet by 8 feet, so the area of each is:
\[ 10 \times 8 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is:
\[ 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The east and west walls are each 5 feet by 8 feet, so the area of each is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is:
\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Adding the areas of all four walls together gives the total area to be painted:
\[ 160 + 80 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, since each gallon of paint costs $12, the total cost to paint the room is:

"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( T \).

Given:
- A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{T}{5} \).
- A third of the large jellyfish change color under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{T}{5} = \frac{T}{15} \).
- When the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color.

We know that the number of jellyfish that change color is 6, which is equal to \( \frac{T}{15} \).

So, we can set up the equation:

   Lauren plans to save for 20 years, but she will only live with 40% of her current annual salary after retirement. Therefore, she needs to save enough to cover her living expenses for 20 years.
   \[
   \text{Annual living expenses} = 0.40 \times \$100,000 = \$40,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total retirement savings needed} = 20 \times \$40,000 = \$800,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of years Lauren needs to work to save \$800,000:**
   \[
   \text{Number of years} = \frac{\$800,000}{\$20,000} = 40 \text{ years}
   \]

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for an additional 40 years to save enough for her retirement, given her current savings rate and retirement plans."
"To find out the length of each final cut, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, Marty cuts the 100 centimeters of ribbon into 4 equal parts. To find the length of each part, we divide 100 by 4:
   \[
   \frac{100}{4} = 25 \text{ cm}
   \]
   So, each of the 4 parts is 25 centimeters long.

2. Next, each of these 25 centimeter parts is divided into 5 equal parts. To find the length of each of these smaller parts, we divide 25 by 5:
   \[
   \frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ cm}
   \]
   So, each of the final cuts is 5 centimeters long.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
5

"To find the total number of students in the school, we start by noting that 40% of the school population consists of 240 boys. Let's denote the total number of students in the school as \( T \).

Given that 40% of \( T \) is equal to 240 boys, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.40 \times T = 240 \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} \]

Calculating the right-hand side:
\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} = 600 \]

So, the total number of students in the school is 600.

Next, we need to find the number of girls in the school. Since 40% of the students are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. We calculate the number of girls as follows:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times T \]

Substituting the total number of students \( T = 600 \):
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times 600 \]

Calculating the right-hand side:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360."

The cost of the pots is $19.
The cost of the sack of garden soil is $26.
The value of the coupon is $7.

First, we add the cost of the pots and the sack of garden soil:
\[ 19 + 26 = 45 \]

Next, we subtract the value of the coupon from the total:
\[ 45 - 7 = 38 \]

So, the final amount of money my mom spent at the gardening shop is $38."
"To find the average height of the heels, we need to calculate the total height of all the heels and then divide by the number of heels.

There are 3 women wearing 4-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ inches} \]

There are 3 women wearing 2-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ inches} \]

The total height of all the heels is:
\[ 12 + 6 = 18 \text{ inches} \]

There are a total of 6 heels (3 from each group):
\[ 3 + 3 = 6 \]

The average height of the heels is:
\[ \frac{18}{6} = 3 \text{ inches} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days in June.
2. Determine the total number of miles Soledad plans to hike in June.
3. Calculate the number of miles Soledad plans to hike per day.
4. Determine the difference between the planned miles per day and the required miles per day.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days in June.**
June has 30 days.

**Step 2: Determine the total number of miles Soledad plans to hike in June.**
Soledad plans to hike 9,300 miles in June.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of miles Soledad plans to hike per day.**
To find the planned miles per day, we divide the total miles by the number of days:
\[ \text{Planned miles per day} = \frac{9,300 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 310 \text{ miles/day} \]

**Step 4: Determine the difference between the planned miles per day and the required miles per day.**
Soledad wants to hike twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. Therefore, the total miles per day she plans to hike is:
\[ \text{Planned miles per day} = 125 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

Now, we find the difference between the planned miles per day and the required miles per day:
\[ \text{Difference} = 250 \text{ miles/day} - 310 \text{ miles/day} = -60 \text{ miles/day} \]

Since the result is negative, it indicates that Soledad is already hiking more than the required miles per day. Therefore, she does not need to hike any more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

\[ 27 + 55 + 75 = 157 \]

Therefore, the store will have received \(\boxed{157}\) dollars after all the balls are sold."
"First, let's determine how many kilograms of apples each person wants.

Pierre wants a quarter of the total 12 kg of apples:
\[ \text{Pierre's share} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg} \]

Paul wants a third of the total 12 kg of apples:
\[ \text{Paul's share} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg} \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount of apples that Pierre and Paul want:
\[ \text{Total wanted by Pierre and Paul} = 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg} \]

Since the total amount of apples is 12 kg, the amount of apples that James will have left is:
\[ \text{James's share} = 12 \text{ kg} - 7 \text{ kg} = 5 \text{ kg} \]

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the rate at which the lighthouse's light blinks. We know that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. Therefore, the rate of blinking is:

\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times. We can use the rate we just calculated to find the time required:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} \]

Now, let's perform the division:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459}{51} = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the time each person took to complete their chores:

1. Amalia mowed the lawn, which took her 4 hours.
2. Megan walked the dog, which took her 2 hours longer than Amalia. Therefore, Megan's chore took her \(4 + 2 = 6\) hours.
3. Dior did the laundry, which took her well over 4 hours longer than Amalia. Since Amalia's chore took 4 hours, Dior's chore took more than \(4 + 4 = 8\) hours. Let's assume the minimum time Dior took, which is 9 hours (since ""well over"" typically means more than the minimum additional time).

Now, we can calculate the total time they all took to do their chores altogether:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Amalia's time} + \text{Megan's time} + \text{Dior's time} = 4 + 6 + 9 = 19 \text{ hours} \]

According to the question, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Therefore, Brian will walk half the distance that Sofie walks in 7 days. So, Brian will walk \(70 \div 2 = 35\) miles in 7 days.

The final numerical answer is 35."
"To determine how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers and then find out how many toys the fifth worker needs to produce to meet the order requirements.

First, let's calculate the production rate of the first two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 6 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(6 \times 2 = 12\) toys per hour.

Next, let's calculate the production rate of the next two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 4 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(4 \times 2 = 8\) toys per hour.

Now, let's find the total production rate of the first four workers:
- The first two workers produce 12 toys per hour.
- The next two workers produce 8 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

Since they all work for a 10-hour shift, the total number of toys produced by the first four workers in 10 hours is:
- \(20 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 200 \text{ toys}\).

The toy manufacturer received an order for 400 toys, and by the end of their shift, they still need 20 toys to ship the order. This means that the number of toys produced by the first four workers is:
- \(400 - 20 = 380 \text{ toys}\).

Since the first four workers produced 200 toys in 10 hours, the fifth worker must have produced:
- \(380 - 200 = 180 \text{ toys}\) in 10 hours.

To find out how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours in the shift:
- \(180 \text{ toys} \div 10 \text{ hours} = 18 \text{ toys/hour}\).

Therefore, the fifth worker produces \(\boxed{18}\) toys per hour."

"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline as \( A \). Since they painted the same number of eggs, the total painted by Arnold and Madeline is \( 2A \).

Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Sarah as \( S \). Therefore, the number of eggs painted by Camden is \( S + 12 \). The total painted by Camden and Sarah is given by:
\[ S + (S + 12) = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]
So, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

Now, we know the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. Therefore, the number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline together is:
\[ 2A = 56 - (9 + 21) = 56 - 30 = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]
So, Arnold painted 13 eggs, and Madeline also painted 13 eggs.

We need to find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Thus, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons. 

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups} \]

Each group of 8 crayons will be placed in a box. Since each box contains 8 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the weight of each box will be:

\[ \text{Weight of each box} = 8 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 8 \text{ ounces} \]

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the weight of each box in pounds is:

\[ \text{Weight of each box in pounds} = \frac{8 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes. There are 25 boxes, each weighing 0.5 pounds:

\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 0.5 \text{ pounds/box} = 12.5 \text{ pounds} \]

The total weight of the crayons is:

\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Converting the total weight of the crayons to pounds:

\[ \text{Total weight of crayons in pounds} = \frac{200 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 12.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 12.5 \text{ pounds (crayons)} + 12.5 \text{ pounds (boxes)} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 25 \]

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 25 pounds."
"First, we need to determine how many 4-foot logs John can make from the 80-foot tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, the length of the logs he can make is:

"First, let's determine how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns half of what her brother earns, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Valerie's salary} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

Given that Valerie earns $5000 per month, we can solve for her brother's salary:

\[ 5000 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

\[ \text{Brother's salary} = 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Now, we know Valerie's brother earns $10000 per month. Next, we need to find out how much their mother earns. Their mother earns twice their combined salary. First, we calculate their combined salary:

\[ \text{Combined salary} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} \]

\[ \text{Combined salary} = 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Their mother earns twice this amount:

\[ \text{Mother's salary} = 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \]

Now, we can find the total amount of money they all have together by adding their salaries:

\[ \text{Total amount} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} + \text{Mother's salary} \]

\[ \text{Total amount} = 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time spent by Grandma on the beach and on the sidewalk, and then sum these times to find the total time for her 3-mile walk.

First, let's denote the speed of Grandma on the beach as \( v \) miles per minute. Since she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes, we can write:
\[ v = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} \]

On the sidewalk, Grandma walks at twice the speed, so her speed on the sidewalk is:
\[ 2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Next, we calculate the time spent on the sidewalk. Since the distance on the sidewalk is 1 mile, the time spent on the sidewalk is:
\[ \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we sum the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk to find the total time for the 3-mile walk:
\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Jane has saved so far. She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so:

\[ 4 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 8 \, \text{weeks} = 32 \, \text{dollars} \]

Jane's goal is to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she has already saved from her goal:

\[ 60 \, \text{dollars} - 32 \, \text{dollars} = 28 \, \text{dollars} \]

Jane saves $4 each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28, we divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings:

\[ 28 \, \text{dollars} \div 4 \, \text{dollars/week} = 7 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60."

\[ \text{Current marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

Subtracting 24 from both sides of the equation gives:

\[ \text{Current marbles} = 60 - 24 \]
\[ \text{Current marbles} = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles. If he loses 10 of the marbles he has, the number of marbles he will have is:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 26 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the second mug of water such that after Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle, the resulting water can be drunk (i.e., at least 40 degrees).

Let's denote the temperature of the second mug of water as \( T \) degrees.

1. Initially, the 33-degree mug has 4 ounces of water, and the second mug has \( x \) ounces of water.
2. After pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug, the remaining water in the 33-degree mug is \( 4 - 4 = 0 \) ounces, and the temperature of the remaining water is still 33 degrees.
3. After pouring 1 ounce from the second mug, the remaining water in the second mug is \( x - 1 \) ounces, and the temperature of the remaining water is \( \frac{T \cdot 1 + (x-1) \cdot 33}{x} = \frac{T + 33x - 33}{x} \) degrees.

The resulting mixture in Donny's water bottle will have a total of 5 ounces of water (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug). The temperature of this mixture should be at least 40 degrees. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{T + 33x - 33}{x} \geq 40
\]

To find the minimum temperature \( T \), we need to consider the worst-case scenario where \( x \) is as small as possible, which is 1 ounce (since pouring 1 ounce from the second mug is the smallest amount we can consider).

Substituting \( x = 1 \) into the equation:

\[
\frac{T + 33 \cdot 1 - 33}{1} \geq 40
\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[
T \geq 40
\]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the second mug of water is 40 degrees.

The final numerical answer is:

40"
"First, let's calculate the number of days in three weeks:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cows and chickens added to the farm over these 21 days:
- Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day:
\[ 20 \text{ cows/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 420 \text{ cows} \]

- Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day:
\[ 10 \text{ chickens/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ chickens} \]

Now, we add the initial number of animals to the number of animals added over the 21 days:
- Initial number of cows: 50
- Initial number of chickens: 20
- Total number of cows after 21 days:
\[ 50 \text{ cows} + 420 \text{ cows} = 470 \text{ cows} \]

- Total number of chickens after 21 days:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} + 210 \text{ chickens} = 230 \text{ chickens} \]

Finally, we calculate the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks:
\[ 470 \text{ cows} + 230 \text{ chickens} = 700 \text{ animals} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 700 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount:

Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs cost:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Since Russell is ordering 4 packs, he will receive a 10% discount on the total cost. The discount amount is:
\[ 40 \times 0.10 = 4 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell will receive. Since each pack contains 9 bagels, 4 packs will contain:
\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \]

To find the cost per bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels:
\[ \frac{36}{36} = 1 \]

So, the cost per bagel is $1.00. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1 \]"
"First, let's determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. According to the question, Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, we calculate:

\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 1 less than 3 is 2 scoops, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. The question states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, 1 less than 3 scoops is 2 scoops, and 3 less than 6 potatoes is 3 potatoes. Therefore, 2 scoops of mashed potatoes require 3 potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes are required for 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 2 scoops require 3 potatoes, 18 scoops would require:

\[ \frac{18}{2} \times 3 = 9 \times 3 = 27 \]

So, Gomer ate 27 potatoes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 27 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days:
- Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days.
- Total eggs in the first 30 days = 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs.

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the next 30 days:
- Chester eats 5 eggs a day for 30 days.
- Total eggs in the next 30 days = 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.

Now, let's find the total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days:
- Total eggs in 60 days = 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.

To find out how many dozens of eggs Chester needs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs):
- Total dozens of eggs = 240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens.

The final numerical answer is 20 dozens."
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we first need to determine the number of red jellybeans and then subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans.

- Number of red jellybeans = 2 * number of green jellybeans

First, calculate the number of red jellybeans:
\[ \text{Number of red jellybeans} = 2 \times 17 = 34 \]

Next, calculate the total number of green and red jellybeans:
\[ \text{Total number of green and red jellybeans} = 17 + 34 = 51 \]

Finally, subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans to find the number of blue jellybeans:
\[ \text{Number of blue jellybeans} = 60 - 51 = 9 \]

So, the number of blue jellybeans is 9."
"To find out how many lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of lemons collected from one tree in a year.
2. Determine the number of lemons collected from all trees in a year.
3. Determine the number of lemons collected in a decade (10 years).

Step 1: Tim collects 6 lemons from each tree in a year.
Step 2: Tim has 5 trees, so the total number of lemons collected from all trees in a year is:
\[ 6 \text{ lemons/tree} \times 5 \text{ trees} = 30 \text{ lemons/year} \]

Step 3: To find out how many lemons he collects in a decade (10 years), we multiply the number of lemons collected in a year by 10:
\[ 30 \text{ lemons/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 300 \text{ lemons} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus initially.

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can represent the number of men as \(5x\) and the number of women as \(9x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of passengers is given as 84. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[5x + 9x = 84\]
\[14x = 84\]
\[x = 6\]

Now, we can find the number of men and women:
- Number of men = \(5x = 5 \times 6 = 30\)
- Number of women = \(9x = 9 \times 6 = 54\)

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:
\[54 - 20 = 34\]

So, the number of women who have remained on the bus is 34."
"First, let's determine how many sunflowers Faraday sold in one day. Since each sunflower costs $2, and he earned $26 from selling sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold in one day is:

\[ \text{Number of sunflowers sold per day} = \frac{\$26}{\$2} = 13 \text{ sunflowers} \]

Next, we need to find out how many bouquets of sunflowers Faraday sold in one day. Since each bouquet costs $8 and he earned $56 from selling bouquets, the number of bouquets sold in one day is:

\[ \text{Number of bouquets sold per day} = \frac{\$56}{\$8} = 7 \text{ bouquets} \]

Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, so the total number of sunflowers sold in one day from the bouquets is:

\[ \text{Number of sunflowers from bouquets per day} = 7 \text{ bouquets} \times 12 \text{ sunflowers per bouquet} = 84 \text{ sunflowers} \]

Now, we can find the total number of sunflowers sold in one day by adding the sunflowers sold from individual sunflowers and the sunflowers sold from bouquets:

\[ \text{Total sunflowers sold per day} = 13 \text{ sunflowers} + 84 \text{ sunflowers} = 97 \text{ sunflowers} \]

Finally, to find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold in 3 days, we multiply the number of sunflowers sold per day by 3:

\[ \text{Total sunflowers sold in 3 days} = 97 \text{ sunflowers per day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 291 \text{ sunflowers} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many rocks Adam can buy with his $100. Each rock costs $5.

\[
\text{Number of rocks} = \frac{\text{Total money}}{\text{Cost per rock}} = \frac{100}{5} = 20
\]

Adam buys 20 rocks and then sells 60% of them. Let's calculate how many rocks he sells:

\[
\text{Number of rocks sold} = 20 \times 0.60 = 12
\]

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling these 12 rocks. Each rock is sold for $7.

\[
\text{Revenue from selling 12 rocks} = 12 \times 7 = 84
\]

Adam initially invested $100 in buying the rocks. Now, let's calculate the loss by subtracting the revenue from the initial investment.

\[
\text{Loss} = \text{Initial investment} - \text{Revenue} = 100 - 84 = 16
\]

So, Adam loses $16."
"To determine the total number of days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the time required for each type of picture scene separately and then sum these times.

For the large-sized picture scenes:
Lauren can draw 5 large-sized scenes per day.
She needs to draw 45 large-sized scenes.
The number of days required for large-sized scenes is:
\[ \frac{45 \text{ scenes}}{5 \text{ scenes/day}} = 9 \text{ days} \]

For the medium-sized picture scenes:
Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized scenes per day.
She needs to draw 36 medium-sized scenes.
The number of days required for medium-sized scenes is:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ scenes}}{6 \text{ scenes/day}} = 6 \text{ days} \]

For the small-sized picture scenes:
Lauren can draw 7 small-sized scenes per day.
She needs to draw 49 small-sized scenes.
The number of days required for small-sized scenes is:
\[ \frac{49 \text{ scenes}}{7 \text{ scenes/day}} = 7 \text{ days} \]

Now, we sum the days required for each type of scene:

First, let's calculate the total distance:
- Sid traveled 110 miles in 2 hours.
- Sid then traveled an additional 140 miles in 3 hours.

Total distance = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles

Next, let's calculate the total time:
- Sid traveled for 2 hours initially.
- Sid then traveled for an additional 3 hours.

Total time = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Now, we can find the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour

The final numerical answer is 50 miles per hour."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that both tickets are winners.

First, let's denote the probability of winning with the first ticket as \( P(W_1) \). According to the problem, \( P(W_1) = 0.20 \).

The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning with the second ticket, \( P(W_2) \), is:
\[ P(W_2) = 3 \times P(W_1) = 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60 \]

Since the events are independent, the probability that both tickets are winners is the product of their individual probabilities:
\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = P(W_1) \times P(W_2) = 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

Thus, the probability that both tickets are winners is:
\[ \boxed{12\%} \]"

1. **Determine how many seashells Carlos collected:**
   - Jim collected 27 seashells.
   - Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos.
   - Therefore, Carlos collected \( 27 - 5 = 22 \) seashells.

2. **Determine how many seashells Carrey collected:**
   - Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey.
   - Therefore, Carrey collected \( \frac{22}{2} = 11 \) seashells.

3. **Calculate the total number of seashells collected:**
   - Carlos collected 22 seashells.
   - Jim collected 27 seashells.
   - Carrey collected 11 seashells.
   - Total seashells = \( 22 + 27 + 11 = 60 \) seashells.

4. **Divide the total seashells equally among the three people:**
   - Total seashells = 60.
   - Number of people = 3.
   - Each person gets \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) seashells.

Therefore, each person gets 20 seashells.

"To calculate the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to consider the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the number he eats on weekends.

Mason eats 4 carrots each weekday. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is:
\[ 4 \text{ carrots/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ carrots} \]

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is:
\[ 5 \text{ carrots/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ carrots} \]

Adding the carrots eaten on weekdays and the weekend gives us the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week:

"To determine how many more bottles of juices Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bottles needed to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.
2. Subtract the current daily production from the total number of bottles needed.

First, let's calculate the total number of bottles needed:
- Each person's daily energy demand is covered by 20% of a bottle.
- Therefore, to cover 100% of a person's daily energy demand, we need 5 bottles (since 100% / 20% = 5).

For 2300 people, the total number of bottles needed is:
\[ 2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we know that Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles are needed, we subtract the current production from the total number of bottles needed:
\[ 11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles} \]

So, Hortex would have to produce 7300 more bottles of juices to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of babies dressed in purple and blue, and then calculate the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple.

First, let's find out how many babies are dressed in purple and how many are dressed in blue:
- Total babies = 8
- Babies dressed in purple = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- Babies dressed in blue = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we need to find out how many babies wear bows:
- Babies wearing bows among the blue-wearers = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 2 = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.6667 \) (rounding to the nearest whole number, 1 baby)
- Babies wearing bows among the purple-wearers = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is \( 1 + 2 = 3 \).

Now, we need to find the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. This is given by the number of purple-wearers wearing bows divided by the total number of babies wearing bows:
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of purple-wearers wearing bows}}{\text{Total number of babies wearing bows}} = \frac{2}{3} \]

To convert this probability to a percentage:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 100 \approx 66.67\% \]

Therefore, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is approximately \( 66.67\% \)."

"First, let's determine the total number of eggs Cole hid in the yard. Since a dozen is equal to 12, 3 dozen eggs would be:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we'll calculate how many eggs each person found:

- Lamar found 5 eggs.
- Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy found \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) eggs.
- Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie found \( 10 - 2 = 8 \) eggs.
- Mei found half as many as Charlie, so Mei found \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) eggs.

Now, we'll sum the number of eggs found by Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei:

\[ 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 \text{ eggs} \]

"Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters, the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters, and the red rope as \( R \) centimeters.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we substitute \( B \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ R = 4(Y - 7) \]

Next, we substitute \( B \) and \( R \) into the third equation:
\[ 4(Y - 7) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]

Add 35 to both sides:
\[ 6Y = 72 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now, we can find \( B \) and \( R \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \]
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

The length of the red rope is \( 20 \) centimeters.

\[
\boxed{20}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine how much money Rissa and Ronnie were given initially:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = $15\).

2. **Let \(x\) be the amount of money each of them gave to their sister.**
   - After giving \(x\) dollars to their sister, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her initial amount.
   - Therefore, \(15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15\).

3. **Solve for \(x\):**
   \[
   15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
   \]
   \[
   15 - x = 12
   \]
   \[
   x = 15 - 12
   \]
   \[
   x = 3
   \]

4. **Determine how much money Rissa has left:**
   - Rissa initially had $15 and gave $3 to her sister.
   - Therefore, Rissa is left with \(15 - 3 = 12\) dollars.

5. **Determine how much money Ronnie has left:**
   - Ronnie initially had $5 and did not give any money to his sister.
   - Therefore, Ronnie is left with $5.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Paint Used**: The mural uses 12 pints of paint in total.

2. **Distribution of Paint**:
   - Let the amount of red paint be \( R \) pints.
   - Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, the amount of white paint is also \( R \) pints, and the amount of purple paint is also \( R \) pints.
   - The amount of yellow paint is half the mural, so it is \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) pints.

3. **Equation for Total Paint**:
   - The total amount of paint is the sum of the red, white, purple, and yellow paint.
   - Therefore, \( R + R + R + 6 = 12 \).

4. **Solve for \( R \)**:
   - Combine like terms: \( 3R + 6 = 12 \).
   - Subtract 6 from both sides: \( 3R = 6 \).
   - Divide by 3: \( R = 2 \).

So, the number of pints of red paint used is 2.

"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. The area of one bedroom is given by the product of its length and width:

\[ \text{Area of one bedroom} = 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

\[ \text{Total area of bedrooms} = 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so:

\[ \text{Area of the living room} = 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. Now, we can find the total area of the house by adding the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

\[ \text{Total area of the house} = 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

So, the total area of the house is:

\[ 3160 \text{ square feet} \]"
"To find the total number of puffs of clouds Alice counts from Monday to Friday, we need to calculate the number of puffs for each day and then sum them up.

- Monday: 3 puffs
- Tuesday: 2 * Monday's count = 2 * 3 = 6 puffs
- Wednesday: 2 * Tuesday's count = 2 * 6 = 12 puffs
- Thursday: 2 * Wednesday's count = 2 * 12 = 24 puffs
- Friday: 2 * Thursday's count = 2 * 24 = 48 puffs

Now, we sum the puffs from each day:
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93

So, the total number of puffs of clouds Alice counts at the end of the week is 93."
"To determine how many dishwashing cycles can be run for $1 with the new box, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of pods in the new box:**
   - The original box has 100 pods.
   - The new box has 20% more pods than the original box.
   - Calculate 20% of 100 pods: \( 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \) pods.
   - Therefore, the new box has \( 100 + 20 = 120 \) pods.

2. **Calculate the cost per pod:**
   - The new box costs $12 for 120 pods.
   - Cost per pod: \( \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \) dollars per pod.

3. **Determine the number of cycles that can be run for $1:**
   - If each cycle uses 1 pod, then for $1, you can run \( \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \) cycles.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
10"
"First, let's determine the number of 20 dollar bills Thomas initially withdraws from the bank. Since he withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills, we can calculate the number of bills as follows:

\[ \text{Number of 20 dollar bills} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \]

Next, Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home. Therefore, the number of bills he has left is:

\[ \text{Remaining bills} = 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Thomas then uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. The number of bills he uses is:

\[ \text{Bills used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, the number of bills he has left is:

\[ \text{Remaining bills} = 40 - 20 = 20 \]

Thomas then triples his money. Since each bill is worth $20, the total amount of money he has is:

\[ \text{Total money} = 20 \times 20 = 400 \]

After tripling his money, the total amount of money he has is:

\[ \text{Total money} = 400 \times 3 = 1200 \]

Finally, Thomas converts all his money to 5 dollar bills. The number of 5 dollar bills he has is:

\[ \text{Number of 5 dollar bills} = \frac{1200}{5} = 240 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 240 \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. In the first half, team A scores 4 goals.
2. In the first half, team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, which means team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.
3. In the second half, team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half.
4. Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which means team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals in the second half.
5. Therefore, team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals in the second half.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by each team in the match:

- Team A scores \(4 + 2 = 6\) goals in total.
- Team B scores \(2 + 8 = 10\) goals in total.

The total number of goals scored in the match is the sum of the goals scored by team A and team B:

\[6 + 10 = 16\]

So, the final numerical answer is 16."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chalk the teacher has left and then calculate how many days he can continue using only 20% of the chalk each day before he has to recycle it.

1. **Initial Chalk Length**: The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
2. **Chalk Used on Monday**: The teacher used 45% of the chalk by the end of Monday. So, the chalk used on Monday is:

Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, we need to determine how many cheese pizzas are required to provide 36 slices:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed by Kate's friends. Each of the 6 friends eats 4 slices of pepperoni pizza:

\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Since the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we need to determine how many pepperoni pizzas are required to provide 24 slices:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

To find the total number of pizzas Kate needs to buy, we add the number of cheese pizzas and pepperoni pizzas required:

\[ 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To find out how many miles Sam ran this week, we need to add up the miles he ran each day.

- On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day. So for these three days, he ran \(3 \times 3 = 9\) miles.
- On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. So for these two days, he ran \(5 \times 2 = 10\) miles.

Adding these together, the total miles Sam ran this week is \(9 + 10 = 19\) miles.

The final numerical answer is 19."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many snowballs Jay can actually make in an hour, accounting for the snowballs that melt.

Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Therefore, in 15 minutes, 2 snowballs melt, leaving him with 20 - 2 = 18 snowballs.

Since there are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the net number of snowballs Jay makes in an hour as follows:
- In the first 15 minutes, he makes 18 snowballs.
- In the next 15 minutes, he makes another 18 snowballs.
- In the next 15 minutes, he makes another 18 snowballs.
- In the final 15 minutes, he makes another 18 snowballs.

So, in one hour, Jay makes 18 * 4 = 72 snowballs. However, since he needs only 60 snowballs, we can calculate the time required to make 60 snowballs.

Let's denote the time required to make 60 snowballs as \( t \) hours. Since Jay makes 72 snowballs in one hour, we can set up the following proportion to find \( t \):

\[ \frac{72 \text{ snowballs}}{1 \text{ hour}} = \frac{60 \text{ snowballs}}{t \text{ hours}} \]

Solving for \( t \):

\[ t = \frac{60}{72} \text{ hours} = \frac{5}{6} \text{ hours} \]

To convert \(\frac{5}{6}\) hours into minutes, we multiply by 60:

\[ \frac{5}{6} \times 60 = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take Jay 50 minutes to have 60 snowballs.

The final numerical answer is 50."
"If John is currently 28 years old and he is twice as old as Jim, we can set up the following equation to find Jim's current age:

\[ \text{John's age} = 2 \times \text{Jim's age} \]

Given that John's current age is 28, we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[ 28 = 2 \times \text{Jim's age} \]

To find Jim's age, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ \text{Jim's age} = \frac{28}{2} = 14 \]

So, Jim is currently 14 years old."
"Doxa ate 1 slice.
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so she ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so he ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

The total number of slices they all ate is:
1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

The final numerical answer is 6."
"Let's break down the problem day by day to find out how many bandages were used and how many were left at the end of each day.

**First Day:**
- They used 38 bandages.
- They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
- Total bandages at the end of the first day: \(38 - 38 + 50 = 50\).

**Second Day:**
- They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
- Total bandages at the end of the second day: \(50 - 28 = 22\).

**Third Day:**
- They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered \(2 \times 50 = 100\) bandages.
- They used half a pack, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.
- Total bandages at the end of the third day: \(22 - 25 + 100 = 97\).

According to the problem, they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means there was a discrepancy in the calculation. Let's correct it:

- They used 25 bandages on the third day, so the correct calculation should be: \(22 - 25 + 100 = 97\). But since they ended up with 78 bandages, we need to adjust the initial bandages to match this condition.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages they had on the first day as \(x\). From the first day, we know they had 50 bandages at the end. So, the equation for the first day is:
\[ x - 38 + 50 = 50 \]
This equation is consistent, so we move to the second day:
\[ 50 - 28 = 22 \]
And for the third day:
\[ 22 - 25 + 100 = 97 \]
But since they ended up with 78 bandages, we need to adjust the initial number of bandages. Let's denote the initial number of bandages as \(x\). From the first day, we know:
\[ x - 38 + 50 = 50 \]
This is consistent, so we need to find \(x\) such that after the third day they have 78 bandages:
\[ x - 38 + 50 - 28 + 100 - 25 = 78 \]
Simplifying the equation:
\[ x - 38 + 50 - 28 + 100 - 25 = 78 \]
\[ x + 89 - 38 - 28 - 25 = 78 \]
\[ x + 26 = 78 \]
\[ x = 52 \]

So, the initial number of bandages they had on the first day is \(52\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{52}

"First, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut. May's hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches, so the haircut involved cutting 2 inches of hair.

The cost for the haircut is $30 per inch, so for 2 inches, the cost is:
\[ 2 \text{ inches} \times \$30/\text{inch} = \$60 \]

Next, we add the cost of the hair color, which is $40.

So, the total cost is:
\[ \$60 + \$40 = \$100 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$100 \]"
"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to consider her regular pay and the additional attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her regular pay:
- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- She works 6 days a week.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

So, her daily pay is \(7.5 \times 1.5 = 11.25\) dollars.
Her weekly pay is \(11.25 \times 6 = 67.5\) dollars.

Since there are exactly 4 weeks in April, her total pay for April is \(67.5 \times 4 = 270\) dollars.

Additionally, since she had complete attendance for the month, she receives an extra $10 for each week, which amounts to \(10 \times 4 = 40\) dollars.

Therefore, her total earnings for April are \(270 + 40 = 310\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
310"
"To calculate the total amount of money Jason earned, we need to multiply the number of times he performed each task by the corresponding amount he earns for that task, and then sum these amounts.

- For emptying the dishwasher: Jason emptied the dishwasher 6 times, and he earns $0.50 for each time. So, the earnings from emptying the dishwasher are \(6 \times 0.50 = 3.00\) dollars.
- For doing laundry: Jason did laundry once, and he earns $3.00 for each time. So, the earnings from doing laundry are \(1 \times 3.00 = 3.00\) dollars.
- For taking the trash out: Jason took the trash out twice, and he earns $0.75 for each time. So, the earnings from taking the trash out are \(2 \times 0.75 = 1.50\) dollars.
- For cleaning his room: Jason cleaned his room once, and he earns $1.50 for each time. So, the earnings from cleaning his room are \(1 \times 1.50 = 1.50\) dollars.

Now, we sum these amounts to find the total earnings:
\[3.00 + 3.00 + 1.50 + 1.50 = 9.00\]

So, Jason earned a total of $9.00 in the two-week period."
"First, let's determine the amount of blood in one shark. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and each whale has 40 gallons of blood, we can calculate the amount of blood in one shark as follows:

\[ \text{Blood in one shark} = 3 \times 40 \text{ gallons} = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have. Since each shark has 120 gallons of blood, ten sharks will have:

\[ \text{Blood in ten sharks} = 10 \times 120 \text{ gallons} = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:

\[ 1200 \text{ gallons} \]"
"To calculate the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day, we need to add up all the groups of people who entered.

1. In the morning, 50 people entered.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people.

Now, we sum these numbers:

\[
50 \text{ (morning)} + 40 \text{ (10:00)} + 80 \text{ (twice 10:00)} + 150 \text{ (evening)} = 320

So, the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day is 320."
"Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, which means she bought 5 * 5 = 25 red pens. She bought twice the amount of black pens, so she bought 5 * 2 = 10 packs of black pens, which means she bought 10 * 5 = 50 black pens. Therefore, the total number of pens Alain has is 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens.

The final numerical answer is 75."
"First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600, so the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \]

Next, we need to find the cost per bottle of cognac. The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 + (0.5 \times 60) = 60 + 30 = 90 \]

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as he does of scotch. Since he bought 10 bottles of scotch, he buys:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

The total cost for the cognac is:

\[ \text{Total cost of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \]

Now, we can find the total amount John spends on everything by adding the cost of the scotch and the cost of the cognac:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2400 \]"
"To determine the total number of trees Mr. Julius planted over the two days, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted on the first day:
- Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
- He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which means he planted \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

So, the total number of trees planted on the first day is:
\[ 20 \text{ (White Oak)} + 40 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 60 \text{ trees} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted on the second day:
- Mr. Julius planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day, which means he planted \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
- He planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day. The number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the first day was 40, so \(\frac{1}{4}\) more than 40 is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]
Thus, the number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is:
\[ 40 + 10 = 50 \]

So, the total number of trees planted on the second day is:
\[ 30 \text{ (White Oak)} + 50 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 80 \text{ trees} \]

Finally, the total number of trees planted over the two days is:
\[ 60 \text{ (first day)} + 80 \text{ (second day)} = 140 \text{ trees} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{140} \]"

"First, let's determine the number of fish with red stripes. Since one-third of the fish have red stripes, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of fish with red stripes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

Next, we need to find out how many fish are left after accounting for the fish with red stripes. This is:

\[
\text{Remaining fish} = 66 - 22 = 44
\]

Now, we need to find out how many of these remaining fish have blue stripes. Since 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of fish with blue stripes} = \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
\]

Finally, to find the total number of fish that have either red or blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes:

\[
\text{Total number of fish with red or blue stripes} = 22 + 20 = 42

"First, let's calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had:

- Two eyeshadow palettes, each with four colors: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors
- Three makeup sets, each with six colors: \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors

So, the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had is \(8 + 18 = 26\) colors.

Her sister steals one of the palettes, which means Amy loses 4 colors. So, the number of colors left after the theft is \(26 - 4 = 22\) colors.

Amy then uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since each makeup set has 6 colors, half of that set would be \(6 / 2 = 3\) colors. Therefore, after using up half of one makeup set, the number of colors left is \(22 - 3 = 19\) colors.

The final numerical answer is 19."
"First, let's determine the height of Mattison's house and the height of the first floor.

Mattison's height is 60 inches. The two-story house is 7 times as high as Mattison is:
\[ \text{Height of the house} = 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

The first floor is thrice as high as Mattison is:
\[ \text{Height of the first floor} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Since the house is two stories, the height of the second floor is the total height of the house minus the height of the first floor:
\[ \text{Height of the second floor} = 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height from the floor to the roof of the second floor is the height of the second floor:
\[ \text{Height from the floor to the roof of the second floor} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 240 \]"
"First, let's calculate how many shells team Alphas found. They found 40% of the 700 shells:

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 + x = 12 \]

Simplifying the left side:
\[ 8 + x = 12 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:

"To find the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed per day for each setting and then multiply by the number of days it was used at that setting.

1. **Low setting:**
   - Removes 1 liter of water per day.
   - Brian used it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed at low setting = 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters.

2. **Medium setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the low setting.
   - Therefore, it removes 2 liters of water per day.
   - Brian used it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed at medium setting = 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters.

3. **High setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting.

"First, let's calculate the volume of the jar:

\[ \text{Volume of the jar} = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we calculate the volume occupied by the jelly beans, considering the packing efficiency:

\[ \text{Volume occupied by jelly beans} = \text{Volume of the jar} \times \text{packing efficiency} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Now, we can find the number of jelly beans that fit in the jar:

\[ \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{\text{Volume occupied by jelly beans}}{\text{Volume of one jelly bean}} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880 \]

Given that 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can find the number of red jelly beans:

\[ \text{Number of red jelly beans} = 0.30 \times 2880 = 864 \]

The true number of red jelly beans is given as 900. Therefore, the difference between Tim's guess and the true number of red jelly beans is:

"To determine the total amount Pauline spent on visits to the museum, we need to break down the problem into steps.

1. **Initial Cost Calculation:**
   - Pauline visits the museum three times a year.
   - The initial cost per visit is $2.
   - Over one year, the total cost is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) dollars.
   - Over 5 years, the total cost is \(5 \times 6 = 30\) dollars.

2. **Cost Increase Calculation:**
   - The cost of one visit increased by 150% after 5 years.
   - A 150% increase means the new cost is \(2 + (2 \times 1.5) = 2 + 3 = 5\) dollars per visit.
   - Over the next 3 years, the total cost for these visits is \(3 \times 5 \times 3 = 45\) dollars.

3. **Total Cost Calculation:**
   - The total amount spent over the 8 years (5 years + 3 years) is the sum of the costs from the first 5 years and the next 3 years.
   - Total cost = \(30 + 45 = 75\) dollars.

Thus, the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is \(\boxed{75}\)."
"To determine how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups required and then multiply by the time each group spends.

1. There are 10 students in each of the 3 grades (grades 4, 5, and 6), so the total number of students is:
   \[
   10 \text{ students/grade} \times 3 \text{ grades} = 30 \text{ students}
   \]

2. Only 8 students can try the escape room at a time, so the number of groups needed is:
   \[
   \lceil \frac{30 \text{ students}}{8 \text{ students/group}} \rceil = \lceil 3.75 \rceil = 4 \text{ groups}
   \]

3. Each group spends 45 minutes in the escape room, so the total time required is:
   \[
   4 \text{ groups} \times 45 \text{ minutes/group} = 180 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Therefore, it will take 180 minutes for everyone to try the escape room."

"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, so the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find the value of \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece:

\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much of his secret seasoning Aiden will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many pounds of meat are needed to make 80 meatballs.
2. Calculate the amount of seasoning needed based on the amount of meat.

First, we know that Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat. To find out how many pounds of meat are needed for 80 meatballs, we divide the number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound:

\[
\text{Pounds of meat needed} = \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds of meat}
\]

Next, we know that Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of his secret seasoning for every pound of ground beef. Therefore, for 5 pounds of meat, the amount of seasoning needed is:

\[
\text{Amount of seasoning needed} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly made as \( C \) and the number of brownies as \( B \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, which can be written as:
\[ B = 3C - 2 \]

Carly's class has 5 people, and each person gets 2 treats. Therefore, the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

The total number of treats is the sum of the cupcakes and brownies:
\[ C + B = 10 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]

Adding 2 to both sides:
\[ 4C = 12 \]

Dividing both sides by 4:
\[ C = 3 \]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of a basic manicure and a basic pedicure without any discounts:
- Basic manicure: $35
- Basic pedicure: $40

The total cost for both services without any discounts is:
\[ 35 + 40 = 75 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount for getting both services:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 75 = 0.20 \times 75 = 15 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ 75 - 15 = 60 \]

Karen also wants to add nail art on each of her fingers. There are 10 fingers in total (2 fingers per hand), and each nail art service costs $3:
\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \]

Finally, add the cost of the nail art to the discounted total cost of the services:
\[ 60 + 30 = 90 \]

So, Karen would pay in all:

"Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as \( K \).

According to the problem, Shelley has 8 paintings more than Kim, so Shelley has \( K + 8 \) paintings.

Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, and we know Samantha has 27 paintings. Therefore, we can write the equation for the number of paintings Samantha has as:
\[ K + 8 - 12 = 27 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ K - 4 = 27 \]

To find \( K \), we add 4 to both sides of the equation:
\[ K = 27 + 4 \]
\[ K = 31 \]

So, Kim has 31 paintings. The final numerical answer is:

"To find the final price of the toy after the price changes, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price of the toy in December after an 80% increase.
2. Calculate the price of the toy in January after a 50% decrease from the December price.

**Step 1: Calculate the price in December.**

The original price in November was $40. An 80% increase means the price increased by 80% of $40.

\[ \text{Increase in December} = 40 \times \frac{80}{100} = 40 \times 0.8 = 32 \]

So, the price in December is:

\[ \text{Price in December} = 40 + 32 = 72 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the price in January.**

The price in December was $72. A 50% decrease means the price decreased by 50% of $72.

\[ \text{Decrease in January} = 72 \times \frac{50}{100} = 72 \times 0.5 = 36 \]

So, the price in January is:

\[ \text{Price in January} = 72 - 36 = 36 \]

The final price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"First, let's calculate the standard fee for a 1-hour lesson, which is $80.

Next, we calculate the reduced fee for a lesson given to a veteran, which is 25% off the standard rate. The reduced rate is:
\[ 80 \times (1 - 0.25) = 80 \times 0.75 = 60 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount of money Charlie makes from the 4 lessons at the standard rate:
\[ 4 \times 80 = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the total amount of money he makes from the 2 lessons given to veterans:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the amounts from both types of lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie makes for the day:
\[ 320 + 120 = 440 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is:
\[ \boxed{440} \]"
"To find Sally's mean score, we need to follow these steps:

1. Sum all the scores.
2. Divide the sum by the number of scores.

Let's start by summing the scores:
\[ 50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 \]

Adding these step by step:
\[ 50 + 80 = 130 \]
\[ 130 + 80 = 210 \]
\[ 210 + 60 = 270 \]
\[ 270 + 40 = 310 \]
\[ 310 + 90 = 400 \]
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \]
\[ 500 + 70 = 570 \]
\[ 570 + 60 = 630 \]

The total sum of the scores is 630. Now, we need to divide this sum by the number of scores, which is 9.

"First, let's determine how many apples Walter ate. He bought 60 apples and ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of them:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ apples}
\]

So, the number of apples remaining after Walter ate 24 is:

\[
60 - 24 = 36 \text{ apples}
\]

Next, Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. We calculate 25% of 36:

\[
0.25 \times 36 = 9 \text{ apples}
\]

So, the number of apples remaining after giving 9 apples to his sister is:

\[
36 - 9 = 27 \text{ apples}
\]

Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. The total amount of money he received is:

"If Regina wrote 9 novels last year and this is 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year, we can set up the following equation to find the number of novels she has written this year:

\[ 9 = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{novels this year} \]

To find the number of novels she has written this year, we can rearrange the equation to solve for the number of novels this year:

\[ \text{novels this year} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} \]

Now, let's calculate the value:

\[ \text{novels this year} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \]

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

The final numerical answer is 12."
"To find the percentage of the distance Michael has covered, we first need to calculate the total distance he travels in 3 days.

Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr. There are 24 hours in a day, so in 3 days, the total number of hours is:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 72 \text{ hours} \]

The total distance Michael travels in 72 hours at 50 km/hr is:
\[ 72 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ km/hr} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

The distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. To find the percentage of the total distance that Michael has covered, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{\text{Distance covered}}{\text{Total distance}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 0.6 \times 100 = 60\% \]

"First, let's calculate the cost of the cheese per week:
- Cheddar cheese costs $3.00.
- Gruyere cheese costs twice the amount of cheddar cheese, which is \(2 \times 3.00 = 6.00\) dollars.

So, the total cost of cheese per week is \(3.00 + 6.00 = 9.00\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of making macaroni and cheese per week:
- The pasta costs $1.00 a box.
- The total cost of cheese per week is $9.00.
- Therefore, the total cost per week is \(1.00 + 9.00 = 10.00\) dollars.

"First, let's calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms. Since it takes 15 minutes per classroom, the total time required is:
\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert the total time into hours because the workday is given in hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
\[ 1200 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

The custodian works 8 hours per day. To find out how many days it will take to complete the cleaning, we divide the total hours required by the hours worked per day:
\[ 20 \text{ hours} \div 8 \text{ hours/day} = 2.5 \text{ days} \]

Since the custodian has 5 days to complete the cleaning, they will have 2.5 days to clean all the classrooms, which is within the given timeframe.

Now, to find out what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning classrooms, we need to calculate the total time spent cleaning per day and then find the percentage of that time relative to the 8-hour workday.

The total time spent cleaning in 2.5 days is 20 hours. The average time spent cleaning per day is:
\[ 20 \text{ hours} \div 2.5 \text{ days} = 8 \text{ hours/day} \]

To find the percentage of the day spent cleaning, we use the formula:
\[ \left( \frac{\text{Time spent cleaning per day}}{\text{Total hours in a workday}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 100\% \]

So, the custodian spends 100% of their day, on average, cleaning classrooms."
"First, let's determine the capacity of each shelf:

- Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase:

- The total capacity of one bookcase is the sum of the capacities of all the shelves: \(10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books.

Given that Elly has 110 books, we need to determine how many bookcases are required to hold all of them:

- The number of bookcases needed is the total number of books divided by the capacity of one bookcase: \(110 \div 55 = 2\).

Therefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, which can be written as:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

The total number of ice cubes is the sum of the strawberry and blueberry cubes, which is given as 116:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:
\[ S = 20 \]

Now, substituting \( S = 20 \) back into the equation for \( B \):

Next, let's determine the number of candles. There are 8 rooms in the house, and half of these rooms (4 rooms) have small candles, while the other half (4 rooms) have medium candles. Each small candle provides light for half a room, and each medium candle provides light for a full room. Since there are 4 small candles for each of the 4 rooms with small candles, the total number of small candles is:
\[4 \times 4 = 16\]

Since there are 4 medium candles for each of the 4 rooms with medium candles, the total number of medium candles is:
\[4 \times 4 = 16\]

Adding the small and medium candles together, the total number of candles is:
\[16 + 16 = 32\]

Now, we add the total number of flashlights and candles to find the final answer:
\[20 + 32 = 52\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[52\]"

"To solve this problem, let's break down the time it takes John to solve each side of the Rubik's cube.

1. The first side takes 5 minutes.
2. The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so each takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes.
3. The fourth and fifth sides each take half as long as the first side, so each takes \(\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\) minutes.

Now, let's sum up the time for all six sides:

- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes

Adding these times together:

\[ 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 \]

So, the total time it takes John to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes."
"If there were 20 helmets, and Dominick saw half as many robots as helmets, then there were \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) robots.

Since Dominick also saw half as many helmets as footballs, and there were 20 helmets, then there were \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \) footballs.

Therefore, the total number of items Dominick saw is \( 20 \text{ (helmets)} + 10 \text{ (robots)} + 40 \text{ (footballs)} = 70 \).

The final numerical answer is 70."
"First, we need to determine how many hours Tim spends dealing with calls in a single day. Since he spends 6 hours each day at work and it takes him 15 minutes to deal with each call, we need to convert the hours into minutes to make the calculation easier. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 360 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calls he can handle in one day. Since it takes him 15 minutes to handle one call, we divide the total minutes he works in a day by the time it takes to handle one call:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ minutes/day}}{15 \text{ minutes/call}} = 24 \text{ calls/day} \]

Now, to find out how many calls he deals with during a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of calls he handles in one day by the number of days in the week:

\[ 24 \text{ calls/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 120 \text{ calls/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much longer it will take for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish, we need to calculate the drying time for both scenarios and then find the difference.

For the old varnish:
- It takes 7 minutes for one painting to dry.
- For 6 paintings, the total drying time is \(7 \text{ minutes/painting} \times 6 \text{ paintings} = 42 \text{ minutes}\).

For the new varnish:
- It takes 12 minutes for one painting to dry.
- For 6 paintings, the total drying time is \(12 \text{ minutes/painting} \times 6 \text{ paintings} = 72 \text{ minutes}\).

Now, we find the difference in drying times:
- The difference is \(72 \text{ minutes} - 42 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}\).

So, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry as it would with the old varnish.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total amount of water Crista needs every day, we can break down the problem into parts based on the amount of water each group of plants needs.

1. **Plants needing half a cup of water:**
   - Number of plants: 4
   - Water per plant: 0.5 cups
   - Total water for these plants: \(4 \times 0.5 = 2\) cups

2. **Plants needing 1 cup of water:**
   - Number of plants: 8
   - Water per plant: 1 cup
   - Total water for these plants: \(8 \times 1 = 8\) cups

3. **Plants needing a quarter of a cup of water:**
   - Number of plants: \(20 - 4 - 8 = 8\)
   - Water per plant: 0.25 cups
   - Total water for these plants: \(8 \times 0.25 = 2\) cups

Now, we sum up the total water needed for all the plants:
- Total water = Water for half a cup plants + Water for 1 cup plants + Water for quarter cup plants
- Total water = \(2 + 8 + 2 = 12\) cups

Therefore, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time Phineas spends hopping and swimming.

Phineas needs to travel a total of 200 yards. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, he will travel 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.

The time taken to hop 100 yards on land at a speed of 20 yards per minute is:
\[ \text{Time hopping} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

The time taken to swim 100 yards in water at a speed of 10 yards per minute is:
\[ \text{Time swimming} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards/minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

The total time to return home is the sum of the time spent hopping and the time spent swimming:
\[ \text{Total time} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

Therefore, the total cost for Bob to build his project is $14.00."
"To determine the total cost of the phone plan, we need to calculate the cost of the additional phones and then add it to the cost of the main phone.

Given:
- The main phone costs $20.
- The main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone.

Let's denote the cost of each additional phone as \( x \). Therefore, the main phone costs \( 2x \). Since the main phone costs $20, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2x = 20 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

So, each additional phone costs $10.

There are five phones in total, with one being the main phone and the other four being additional phones. The cost of the additional phones is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Now, we add the cost of the main phone to the cost of the additional phones to find the total cost of the phone plan:
\[ 20 + 40 = 60 \]

Thus, the total cost of the whole phone plan is:
\[ 60 \]"
"To determine how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.**

Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day. Since one dozen equals 12 doughnuts, we have:
\[ 10 \text{ dozen} = 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ doughnuts per day} \]

June has 30 days, so the total number of doughnuts made in June is:
\[ 120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts.**

Each doughnut is sold for $2, so the total revenue is:
\[ 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \times 2 \text{ dollars/doughnut} = 7200 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Derrick makes in June if he sells all the doughnuts is:

"To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the number of people present each day and then sum them up.

1. **First Day:**
   Conor found 50 people at the beach.

2. **Second Day:**
   The number of people on the second day was 20 more than on the first day.
   \[
   50 + 20 = 70 \text{ people}
   \]

3. **Third Day:**
   The total number of people on the third day was twice the number that were there on the second day.
   \[
   2 \times 70 = 140 \text{ people}
   \]

4. **Average for the Rest of the Week:**
   Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the rest of the week (which includes the fourth, fifth, and sixth days).

5. **Number of People for the Rest of the Week:**
   Since there are 3 days left in the week and the average is 60 people per day:
   \[

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount pop, which is \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels.
3. In the next 30 seconds, four times the initial amount pop, which is \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels.
4. In the final 30 seconds, half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, which is \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) kernels.

Now, let's sum up the total number of kernels that popped in the first 120 seconds:
\[ 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 \]

After the pan is taken off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds pop from the residual heat. The number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds is 40, so a quarter of that is:
\[ \frac{40}{4} = 10 \]

Adding these to the initial 200 kernels, the total number of kernels that Garrett has to eat is:
\[ 200 + 10 = 210 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many marbles Dallas has after dropping 4 of them in the playground. Dallas initially had some marbles and after dropping 4, he has 21 marbles. So, we can calculate the number of marbles Dallas had before dropping them as follows:

\[ \text{Marbles Dallas had before dropping} = 21 + 4 = 25 \]

Now, we know that Mazie originally had 52 marbles and after giving some to Dallas and Darla, Dallas ends up with 21 marbles. Since Dallas had 25 marbles before dropping 4, the 4 marbles he dropped were not from Mazie but from his own collection. This means that the 21 marbles Dallas has now are from the total 52 marbles minus the marbles given to Darla.

Let's denote the number of marbles given to Darla as \( x \). Therefore, the number of marbles Dallas received from Mazie is \( 21 - x \). Since Dallas originally had 25 marbles and ended up with 21 after giving 4 to the playground, the marbles he received from Mazie must be \( 21 - 4 = 17 \). This means:

\[ 21 - x = 17 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 21 - 17 = 4 \]

So, Darla received 4 marbles. To find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we need to determine the total number of marbles given to both Dallas and Darla. Dallas received 17 marbles from Mazie, and Darla received 4 marbles. Therefore, the total number of marbles given to both is:

\[ 17 + 4 = 21 \]

Since Dallas originally had 25 marbles and ended up with 21, the total number of marbles given to both is indeed 21. Therefore, the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"

- Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day.
- Therefore, one pig eats \(4 \times 2 = 8\) pounds of feed per day.

Next, we calculate the total feed consumption for all five pigs in one day:
- Five pigs each eat 8 pounds of feed per day.
- Therefore, the total feed consumption for five pigs in one day is \(5 \times 8 = 40\) pounds.

Now, we determine the total feed consumption for one week (7 days):
- Five pigs consume 40 pounds of feed per day.
- Therefore, in one week, they consume \(40 \times 7 = 280\) pounds of feed.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. To find out how much feed is left after a week, we subtract the total feed consumed from the initial amount:
- Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed.
- The pigs consumed 280 pounds of feed in a week.
- Therefore, the amount of feed left is \(300 - 280 = 20\) pounds.

The final numerical answer is:
20"
"First, we need to calculate the total number of hot dogs required for the party. John invited 20 people and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs, so:

\[ 20 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ hot dogs/guest} = 40 \text{ hot dogs} \]

John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party, so we subtract these from the total required:

\[ 40 \text{ hot dogs} - 4 \text{ hot dogs} = 36 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Next, we need to determine how many packs of hot dogs John needs to buy. Each pack contains 6 hot dogs, so we divide the number of hot dogs needed by the number of hot dogs per pack:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ hot dogs}}{6 \text{ hot dogs/pack}} = 6 \text{ packs} \]

Each pack costs $2, so the total cost for the packs is:

\[ 6 \text{ packs} \times 2 \text{ dollars/pack} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, John needs to spend:

\[ \boxed{12} \text{ dollars} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the cupcakes and cookies.

Frances sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each:
\[ 20 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$2/\text{cupcake} = \$40 \]

She sells 40 cookies at $1 each:
\[ 40 \text{ cookies} \times \$1/\text{cookie} = \$40 \]

So, the total revenue from selling the cupcakes and cookies is:
\[ \$40 + \$40 = \$80 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the five trays of cookies.

Each tray costs $4:
\[ 5 \text{ trays} \times \$4/\text{tray} = \$20 \]

Now, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find out how much money Frances has left:
\[ \$80 - \$20 = \$60 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$60 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Street**: There are 5 children.
2. **Second Street**: Each of the 5 children is joined by another child. Therefore, the number of children becomes \(5 + 5 = 10\).
3. **Third Street**: Each of the 10 children is joined by another 2 children. Therefore, the number of children becomes \(10 + (10 \times 2) = 10 + 20 = 30\).

On the third street, the original 5 children then give up and leave the group. So, we subtract these 5 children from the total of 30 children.

The final number of children following the truck is \(30 - 5 = 25\).

The final numerical answer is:
25"
"To find out how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to subtract the number of meals she has already given out from the total number of meals she has.

First, let's add up the meals given out:
- Meals given out on Friday: 64
- Meals given out on Saturday: 30
- Meals given out on Sunday: 48

Total meals given out = 64 + 30 + 48

Now, let's calculate the total:
Total meals given out = 64 + 30 + 48 = 142

Now, we subtract the total meals given out from the total meals she had initially:
Meals left to distribute = 1,360 - 142

Let's calculate this:
Meals left to distribute = 1,360 - 142 = 1,218

So, the number of meals left to distribute is 1,218."
"To determine the total amount of money James has, we need to convert each type of coin into cents and then sum them up.

- A quarter is worth 25 cents.
- A nickel is worth 5 cents.
- A dime is worth 10 cents.

James has:
- 1 quarter = 25 cents
- 2 nickels = 2 * 5 = 10 cents
- 7 dimes = 7 * 10 = 70 cents

25 cents (quarter) + 10 cents (nickels) + 70 cents (dimes) = 105 cents

So, the final numerical answer is 105."
"To find the total age of all the siblings, we need to calculate the ages of all the family members and then sum them up.

1. The ages of the sisters are all 16 years old. Since there are 3 sisters, the total age for the sisters is:
   \[
   3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ years}
   \]

2. One of the brothers is 12 years old. The older brother is twice the age of the younger brother, so the older brother is:
   \[
   12 \times 2 = 24 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. The total age of the brothers is:
   \[
   12 + 24 = 36 \text{ years}
   \]

4. Now, we sum the total ages of all the siblings:

The total age of all the siblings is 84 years."
"First, let's calculate the time Charisma spends on meditation each day. She meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes in the evening, which totals to 30 minutes per day.

Next, let's calculate the time she spends on yoga each week. She practices yoga for 1 hour (60 minutes) 5 days a week, so she spends 5 * 60 = 300 minutes on yoga each week.

Now, let's calculate the total time spent on meditation and yoga in one week. Since she meditates for 30 minutes each day and there are 7 days in a week, she spends 30 * 7 = 210 minutes on meditation each week. Adding the time spent on yoga, she spends 210 + 300 = 510 minutes on meditation and yoga each week.

Finally, to find out how much time she has spent on meditation/yoga practice in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly total by 4:

510 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 2040 minutes.

So, the total time spent on meditation/yoga practice in 4 weeks is 2040 minutes."
"To find the total square footage of the quilt, we need to calculate the square footage contributed by each type of t-shirt and then sum them up.

For the small t-shirts:
\[ 11 \text{ small t-shirts} \times 3 \text{ square feet per small t-shirt} = 33 \text{ square feet} \]

For the medium t-shirts:
\[ 8 \text{ medium t-shirts} \times 4 \text{ square feet per medium t-shirt} = 32 \text{ square feet} \]

For the large t-shirts:
\[ 6 \text{ large t-shirts} \times 6 \text{ square feet per large t-shirt} = 36 \text{ square feet} \]

Now, we sum up the square footage from all the t-shirts:
\[ 33 \text{ square feet} + 32 \text{ square feet} + 36 \text{ square feet} = 101 \text{ square feet} \]

So, the total square footage of the quilt is 101 square feet."
"First, let's determine the number of seeds in a large sunflower. A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since one dozen equals 12, a small sunflower has:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds} \]

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36 seeds, we calculate:

\[ 0.50 \times 36 = 18 \text{ seeds} \]

Adding this to the 36 seeds of the small sunflower gives the number of seeds in a large sunflower:

\[ 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds} \]

Now, to find the total number of seeds in both a small and a large sunflower, we add the seeds from both:

\[ 36 + 54 = 90 \text{ seeds} \]

So, the total number of sunflower seeds altogether is:

\[ 90 \]"

"To determine how much money the company will receive for selling the chocolate bars during two weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of bars produced in two weeks.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling those bars.

First, let's find out how many bars are produced in two weeks. Since the company produces 5000 bars per day, in two weeks (which is 14 days), the number of bars produced is:
\[ 5000 \text{ bars/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 70000 \text{ bars} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling these bars. The company sells each bar for $2, so the total revenue is:
\[ 70000 \text{ bars} \times 2 \text{ dollars/bar} = 140000 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the company will receive \(\boxed{140000}\) dollars for selling the produced chocolate bars during two weeks."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts with the buy one get one 50% off deal.

The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, he gets the second T-shirt at 50% off the original price.

The discounted price of the second T-shirt is:
\[ 8 \times 0.5 = 4 \]

So, the total cost for the two T-shirts is:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes after the 40% discount.

The original price of the shoes is $40. The discount is 40%, so the price Jake pays is:
\[ 40 \times (1 - 0.40) = 40 \times 0.60 = 24 \]

Now, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends:
\[ 12 + 24 = 36 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is:

- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds at $8 per pound = 1.5 * $8 = $12
- Special honey: 2 pounds at $10 per pound = 2 * $10 = $20

Total cost for one jar = $12 (passion fruit) + $12 (jackfruit) + $20 (honey) = $44

Now, let's calculate the profit for one jar:
- Selling price of one jar = $50
- Cost of one jar = $44
- Profit per jar = $50 - $44 = $6

Finally, let's calculate the profit for 10 jars:
- Profit for 10 jars = 10 * $6 = $60

So, Matthew would earn $72 if he agrees to the offer."
"First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate returns, he starts filling in 9 holes a day, but the dog continues to dig 6 holes every night. So, the net number of holes filled each day is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/day} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take to fill in all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

To find out how many weeks it takes, we divide the number of days by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes. The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine the average enrollment at Butler High School. Since Butler High School enrolls an average of \( \frac{3}{4} \) as many students as Norman High School, we can calculate the enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

\[ \text{Enrollment at Butler High School} = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Enrollment at Norman High School} \]

Given that the enrollment at Norman High School is 4000 students, we substitute this value into the equation:

\[ \text{Enrollment at Butler High School} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 = 3000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School. We do this by subtracting the enrollment at Butler High School from the enrollment at Norman High School:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Enrollment at Norman High School} - \text{Enrollment at Butler High School} \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Difference} = 4000 - 3000 = 1000 \]

Therefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how much money each person raised individually.

Alexandra raised $430.

Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so:
\[ \text{Kim's amount} = 430 + 320 = 750 \]

Next, we need to find out how much Sarah raised. We know that Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, and Sarah raised $300, so:
\[ \text{Maryam's amount} = 300 + 400 = 700 \]

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money raised by adding the amounts raised by each person:
\[ \text{Total amount} = \text{Alexandra's amount} + \text{Kim's amount} + \text{Sarah's amount} + \text{Maryam's amount} \]
\[ \text{Total amount} = 430 + 750 + 300 + 700 \]

Adding these amounts together:
\[ 430 + 750 = 1180 \]
\[ 1180 + 300 = 1480 \]
\[ 1480 + 700 = 2180 \]

"First, let's determine the speed of Aaron and Vanessa. We know that Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa. If Aaron completes his part of the race in 16 minutes for 4 miles, then the time it takes for Aaron to run one mile is:

\[ \text{Time for Aaron to run one mile} = \frac{16 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ miles}} = 4 \text{ minutes per mile} \]

Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed is twice that of Aaron. Therefore, the time it takes for Vanessa to run one mile is:

\[ \text{Time for Vanessa to run one mile} = \frac{4 \text{ minutes per mile}}{2} = 2 \text{ minutes per mile} \]

Vanessa ran 4 miles, so the total time it took her to complete her part of the race is:

\[ \text{Total time for Vanessa} = 4 \text{ miles} \times 2 \text{ minutes per mile} = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to calculate the total selling price of the 50 watermelons. The vendor made a profit of 25% on the cost price of $80.

The profit amount is calculated as:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Cost Price} \times \text{Profit Percentage} = 80 \times \frac{25}{100} = 80 \times 0.25 = 20 \]

So, the total selling price is:
\[ \text{Total Selling Price} = \text{Cost Price} + \text{Profit} = 80 + 20 = 100 \]

Now, to find the selling price of each watermelon, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:
\[ \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{\text{Total Selling Price}}{\text{Number of Watermelons}} = \frac{100}{50} = 2 \]

So, each watermelon was sold for $2."
"First, let's determine James's current age. Since Dora will be 12 in 3 years, she is currently 9 years old. James is now twice as old as Dora, so James is currently \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

Since James is currently 18 years old, and he was born when his father John was 19, we can calculate John's current age. Since James is 18 years old and he was born when John was 19, John is now \(19 + 18 = 27\) years old.

Next, we need to determine the age of John's youngest son. The youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest son is currently \(32 - 27 = 5\) years old. In 3 years, the youngest son will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in that time.

First, let's find out how many oranges each can peel in one minute:
- Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in one minute, she peels \( \frac{1}{3} \) of an orange.
- Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in one minute, she peels \( \frac{1}{4} \) of an orange.

Next, we calculate how many oranges each can peel in one hour (60 minutes):
- In one hour, Ana peels \( 60 \times \frac{1}{3} = 20 \) oranges.
- In one hour, Jane peels \( 60 \times \frac{1}{4} = 15 \) oranges.

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane in one hour:
- The difference is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \).

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

From the information given, we can set up the following equations:
\[ C + K = 20 \]
\[ 2C + 4K = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

To solve for \( C \) and \( K \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ C + 2K - C - K = 15 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 20 - 15 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is 5.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of slices available from the 7 pizzas. Since each pizza is cut into 8 slices, we can calculate the total number of slices as follows:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to share these 56 slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends, which makes a total of 4 people. To find out how many slices each person can have, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people:

\[ \frac{56 \text{ slices}}{4 \text{ people}} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

So, each of them can have 14 slices. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 14 \]"
