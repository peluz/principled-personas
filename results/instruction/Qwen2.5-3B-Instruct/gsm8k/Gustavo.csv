"First, let's determine how many eggs Janet has left after eating and baking.

Janet starts with 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and bakes 4 eggs. So, the number of eggs she has left is:

\[ 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 \]

Janet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg. Therefore, the amount she makes every day is:

\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 18 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of white fiber required and then sum it with the amount of blue fiber.

Given:
- The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.
- The robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber.

First, calculate the amount of white fiber:
- White fiber = 1/2 * Blue fiber
- White fiber = 1/2 * 2 bolts
- White fiber = 1 bolt

Now, sum the blue and white fiber to find the total number of bolts:
- Total bolts = Blue fiber + White fiber
- Total bolts = 2 bolts + 1 bolt
- Total bolts = 3 bolts

The final numerical answer is 3."
"First, we need to calculate the new value of the house after the repairs and the increase in value.

The initial value of the house is $80,000. Josh adds $50,000 in repairs, so the total cost before the increase is:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

The value of the house increases by 150%. To find the increase in value, we calculate 150% of $130,000:
\[ 130,000 \times 1.5 = 195,000 \]

Adding this increase to the total cost gives the new value of the house:
\[ 130,000 + 195,000 = 325,000 \]

The profit Josh made is the new value of the house minus the total cost:
\[ 325,000 - 130,000 = 195,000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 195,000 \]"
"James runs 3 sprints each day, and each sprint is 60 meters long. Therefore, in one day, he runs:

\[ 3 \text{ sprints/day} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 180 \text{ meters/day} \]

Since he runs 3 times a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:

\[ 180 \text{ meters/day} \times 3 \text{ days/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 540 meters."
"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she gives her flock in the morning and afternoon.

Wendi gives her flock 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. Therefore, the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
\[ 15 + 25 = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Since Wendi has a flock of 20 chickens and she feeds each chicken three cups of feed per day, the total amount of feed needed for the entire flock is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed in the final meal, we subtract the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total amount of feed needed for the day:
\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Thus, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:
\[ 20 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of 16 glasses, considering the pricing structure.

1. The first glass costs $5.
2. Every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $5 * 0.60 = $3.

So, for every pair of glasses, the cost is $5 + $3 = $8.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can pair them up into 8 pairs (16 / 2 = 8).

The total cost for 8 pairs of glasses is 8 pairs * $8 per pair = $64.

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses.

\[
\boxed{64}
\]"
"To solve this problem, we will first determine the number of sheep in each city based on the given relationships and the number of sheep in Seattle.

1. Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. Therefore, Charleston has \(4 \times 20 = 80\) sheep.
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Therefore, Toulouse has \(2 \times 80 = 160\) sheep.

Now, we will add the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together:

\[160 + 80 + 20 = 260\]

So, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is 260."
"To determine the total time Carla needs to download the 200 GB file, we need to break down the process into parts and calculate the time for each part.

1. **First 40% of the download:**
   - 40% of 200 GB is \(0.40 \times 200 = 80\) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \(80 \div 2 = 40\) minutes.

2. **Windows update installation:**
   - This takes 20 minutes.

3. **Restarting the download:**
   - After the update, Carla has to start the download from the beginning, which means she has to download the first 80 GB again.
   - The time to download the first 80 GB again is also \(80 \div 2 = 40\) minutes.

Adding these times together:
- Time for the first 40% download: 40 minutes
- Time for the Windows update: 20 minutes
- Time to download the first 40% again: 40 minutes

Total time = \(40 + 20 + 40 = 100\) minutes.

The final numerical answer is 100 minutes."
"First, let's calculate the distance John traveled during the initial 3 hours at 60 mph:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during this time.

Then, he drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph:
\[ \text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]

After that, he drives for the remaining time at 80 mph. The total time spent driving is 4 hours, and he already spent 3.5 hours (3 hours + 0.5 hours), so the remaining time is:
\[ 4 \, \text{hours} - 3.5 \, \text{hours} = 0.5 \, \text{hours} \]

The distance covered during the last 0.5 hours at 80 mph is:
\[ \text{Distance} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 40 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, let's add up all the distances:
\[ 180 \, \text{miles} + 15 \, \text{miles} + 40 \, \text{miles} = 235 \, \text{miles} \]

Since John started 180 miles away from home, the distance he is from home at the end of those 4 hours is:
\[ 235 \, \text{miles} - 180 \, \text{miles} = 55 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 55 \]"
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break it down into regular hours and overtime hours.

Eliza's regular rate is $10 per hour. For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
\[ 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \]

For the overtime hours, she works 5 hours over the regular 40 hours. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate:
\[ 1.2 \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$12/\text{hour} \]

Her earnings for the overtime hours are:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

Adding the earnings from regular hours and overtime hours gives her total earnings for the week:
\[ \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \]

So, Eliza's earnings for this week are:
\[ \$460 \]"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the number of downloads for each month and then sum them up.

1. **First Month:**
   The number of downloads in the first month is given as 60.

2. **Second Month:**
   The number of downloads in the second month is three times the number of downloads in the first month.
   \[
   \text{Downloads in the second month} = 3 \times 60 = 180
   \]

3. **Third Month:**
   The number of downloads in the third month is 30% less than the number of downloads in the second month.
   \[
   \text{Downloads in the third month} = 180 - (0.30 \times 180) = 180 - 54 = 126
   \]

4. **Total Downloads Over Three Months:**
   \[
   \text{Total downloads} = \text{First month} + \text{Second month} + \text{Third month} = 60 + 180 + 126 = 366

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money from the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point at which the profit becomes positive.

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:
- Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons.
- Each lemon is sold for $1.5.
- Therefore, the annual revenue from lemons is \(7 \times 1.5 = 10.5\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the annual cost of maintaining the tree:
- The cost to water and feed the tree is $3 per year.

Now, we can determine the net profit each year:
- Net profit per year = Annual revenue from lemons - Annual cost of maintenance
- Net profit per year = \(10.5 - 3 = 7.5\) dollars.

Carlos initially invests $90 to plant the tree. We need to find out how many years it will take for the net profit to cover this initial investment.

Let \(n\) be the number of years it takes to start earning money. The total net profit after \(n\) years is \(7.5n\). We set this equal to the initial investment to find \(n\):
\[7.5n = 90\]

Solving for \(n\):
\[n = \frac{90}{7.5} = 12\]

Therefore, it will take 12 years before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree.

The final numerical answer is:
12"
"Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had as \( x \).

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

3. She then sold half of what was left at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]

4. According to the problem, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

Let's solve this equation step by step.

First, simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
\[
\frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
\]
\[
\frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2x}{3} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 = 5
\]
\[
\frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{x}{3} + 1 = 5
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
\frac{2x - x}{3} - 1 = 5
\]
\[
\frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5
\]
Add 1 to both sides:
\[
\frac{x}{3} = 6
\]
Multiply both sides by 3:
\[
x = 18
\]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners. Let's verify this by checking the steps:

1. She sold \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) vacuum cleaners at the green house, leaving her with \( 18 - 6 = 12 \) vacuum cleaners.
2. She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, leaving her with \( 12 - 2 = 10 \) vacuum cleaners.
3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) vacuum cleaners, leaving her with \( 10 - 5 = 5 \) vacuum cleaners.

Since the final number of vacuum cleaners left is indeed 5, the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had is correct. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{18}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we have:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after those who enrolled in contemporary dance have been accounted for:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Now, 25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

The rest of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance. To find out how many students that is, we subtract the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance from the remaining students:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of students in hip-hop dance}}{\text{Total number of students}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.60 \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the entire students that enrolled in hip-hop dance is 60%."
"To determine which purchase plan maximizes profit, we need to calculate the future value of each item based on the given market growth rates.

For the jewelry:
- Current value: $5,000
- Market growth rate: 2.5% or 0.025 in decimal form
- Future value of jewelry = Current value * (1 + growth rate)
- Future value of jewelry = $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,000 * 1.025 = $5,125

For the electronic gadgets:
- Current value: $8,000
- Market growth rate: 1.2% or 0.012 in decimal form
- Future value of electronic gadgets = Current value * (1 + growth rate)
- Future value of electronic gadgets = $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,000 * 1.012 = $8,096

Now, we calculate the profit for each option:
- Profit from jewelry = Future value of jewelry - Current value of jewelry
- Profit from jewelry = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets = Future value of electronic gadgets - Current value of electronic gadgets
- Profit from electronic gadgets = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Comparing the profits:
- Profit from jewelry: $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets: $96

The merchant would maximize profit by choosing the jewelry, which would result in a profit of $125."
"To determine the total distance covered by each train over the two days, we need to add the distances traveled in both directions.

1. The first day, the train travels 80 miles west.
2. The second day, the train travels 150 miles north.

The total distance covered by each train is the sum of these two distances:
\[ 80 \text{ miles} + 150 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles} \]

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles."
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from both teaching and coaching separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her annual earnings from teaching:
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual teaching hours = 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year
Annual teaching earnings = 1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her annual earnings from coaching:
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual coaching hours = 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year
Annual coaching earnings = 750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year

Now, we sum up her annual earnings from both teaching and coaching:
Annual salary = Annual teaching earnings + Annual coaching earnings
Annual salary = $35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

The final numerical answer is $57,500."
"To determine how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs Claire uses per day.
2. Calculate the number of eggs Claire uses per week.
3. Calculate the number of eggs Claire uses in 4 weeks.
4. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.

Step 1: Claire uses 3 eggs per day.

Step 2: There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Step 3: Over 4 weeks, she will use:
\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Step 4: Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, we convert 84 eggs into dozens:
\[ \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozen} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 7 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour over the entire 12-mile trail.

First, let's calculate the total time Marissa has already spent hiking:
- She took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles.
- She took another 1 hour to walk the next 2 miles.
So, she has already spent 2 hours hiking.

Let's denote the remaining distance as \( x \) miles. The time taken to walk the remaining distance is \( \frac{x}{v} \) hours, where \( v \) is the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance.

The total distance is 12 miles, and she has already covered 6 miles (4 miles + 2 miles). Therefore, the remaining distance is:
\[ x = 12 - 6 = 6 \text{ miles} \]

The total time for the entire hike is the sum of the time already spent and the time for the remaining distance:
\[ \text{Total time} = 2 + \frac{6}{v} \]

Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour over the entire 12-mile trail. The formula for average speed is:
\[ \text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 4 = \frac{12}{2 + \frac{6}{v}} \]

To find \( v \), we solve the equation:
\[ 4 = \frac{12}{2 + \frac{6}{v}} \]
\[ 4 \left(2 + \frac{6}{v}\right) = 12 \]
\[ 8 + \frac{24}{v} = 12 \]
\[ \frac{24}{v} = 4 \]
\[ v = \frac{24}{4} \]
\[ v = 6 \]

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles at a speed of 6 miles per hour to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \]"
"First, let's determine the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the amount of water in the orange drink is:

\[ \text{Water in orange drink} = 10 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ liters} \]

Next, let's determine the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is:

\[ \text{Water in pineapple drink} = 15 \times \frac{3}{5} = 9 \text{ liters} \]

After pouring the orange drink, we spill one liter, so we have:

\[ 10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters of orange drink} \]

The total volume of the mixture after adding the orange drink to the pineapple drink is:

\[ 9 + 15 = 24 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we need to find the total amount of water in the 24 liters of the mixture. The total amount of water from the orange drink is \(\frac{20}{3}\) liters, and the total amount of water from the pineapple drink is 9 liters. Therefore, the total amount of water in the mixture is:

\[ \frac{20}{3} + 9 = \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3} \text{ liters} \]

So, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture is:

\[ \frac{47}{3} \]

To provide the final numerical answer:

\[ \boxed{\frac{47}{3}} \]"

"To find the original price of the book, we need to understand that Kyle paid 75% of the original price (since he got a 25% discount). Let's denote the original price by \( P \). Therefore, we have:

\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we need to solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's calculate the value of \( P \).
```python
# Calculation
original_price = 19.50 / 0.75
original_price

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered except for the boxes of pizza.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
The cost of 4 apples is \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Adding these together gives:
\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\] dollars.

Marie paid a total of $50. If we subtract the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples from the total amount paid, we can find out how much she spent on the boxes of pizza:
\[50 - 33 = 17\] dollars.

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, we can determine the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered by dividing the amount spent on pizza by the cost per box:
\[17 \div 8.50 = 2\] boxes.

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza. The final numerical answer is:
\[2\]"
"To find out how much Mishka spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of each type of clothing item and then sum them up.

For the shorts:
3 pairs * $16.50 per pair = $59.50

For the pants:
3 pairs * $22.50 per pair = $67.50

For the shoes:
3 pairs * $42 per pair = $126.00

Now, we add the costs together:
$59.50 + $67.50 + $126.00 = $253.00

So, Mishka spent $253.00 on all the clothing items."
"To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of servings she will consume and then the total cost based on the price per carton.

First, calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days:
\[ \text{Total servings} = 60 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ serving/day} = 60 \text{ servings} \]

Next, determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need:
\[ \text{Number of cartons} = \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

Now, calculate the total cost for 4 cartons:

"To determine how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to calculate the distance from his first stop to his second stop.

Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, so the distance from the start to his first stop is 20 miles.

His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip is 60 miles, the distance to his second stop is:
\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \text{ miles} \]

The distance between his first and second stops is the difference between the distance to his second stop and the distance to his first stop:
\[ 45 - 20 = 25 \text{ miles} \]

So, the number of miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops is 25 miles."
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

The cost of the first pair of high heels is $33. The cost of the second pair of high heels is twice the cost of the first pair, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ B = 99 + 5 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = 104 \]

So, the cost of the boots is \( 104 \) dollars.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen based on the given ratio and total age.

Given:
- The ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11.
- The total age of Darrell and Allen is 162.

Let's denote Darrell's age as \(7x\) and Allen's age as \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The sum of their ages is:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]
\[18x = 162\]
\[x = \frac{162}{18}\]
\[x = 9\]

Now, we can find their current ages:
- Darrell's age: \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\)
- Allen's age: \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\)

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is:
\[109\]"
"To find the average guess, we first need to determine each friend's guess and then calculate the average.

1. The first friend's guess is 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half of the first friend's guess:
   \[
   \text{Second friend's guess} = \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60
   \]
3. The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess:
   \[
   \text{Third friend's guess} = 80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100
   \]

Now, we calculate the average of these guesses:
\[
\text{Average guess} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80

"To determine the total number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs in a week, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total hours John spends on one dog per day.
2. Multiply the daily hours by the number of dogs to get the total hours per day.
3. Multiply the total daily hours by the number of days in a week to get the total weekly hours.

Step 1: Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business.
Step 2: John takes care of 10 dogs, so the total hours per day is:
\[ 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} \times 10 \text{ dogs} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Step 3: There are 7 days in a week, so the total hours per week is:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs in a week is 35 hours."
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these as equations:
\[ G + S = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins \( S \) is 40, we can find the number of gold coins \( G \) using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins."
"First, let's determine how many jewels Aaron has. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Since Raymond has 40 jewels, we can calculate half of Raymond's jewels as follows:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Now, we add 5 to this number to find out how many jewels Aaron has:

\[
20 + 5 = 25
\]

So, Aaron has 25 jewels. Next, we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. The problem states that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Therefore, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:

\[
25 - 2 = 23
\]

Thus, Siobhan has 23 jewels. The final numerical answer is:

"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points he scores in the second 20 minutes, we calculate 25% of 4 points and add it to the original 4 points:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]
So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \text{ points} \]

Adding the points from both periods, we get:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \text{ points} \]

The total number of points Mike scored is:

"First, let's determine the cost of one yogurt. Since 4 yogurts cost $5.00, the cost of one yogurt is:

\[ \text{Cost of one yogurt} = \frac{5.00}{4} = 1.25 \]

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so the cost of 2 yogurts per day is:

\[ \text{Cost of 2 yogurts per day} = 2 \times 1.25 = 2.50 \]

Over 30 days, the total cost for Terry to eat 2 yogurts a day is:

\[ \text{Total cost over 30 days} = 2.50 \times 30 = 75.00 \]

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John makes from selling his lego sets. He has 13 lego sets and sells each for $15.

\[ \text{Total money from lego sets} = 13 \times 15 = 195 \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money John spends on the video games. He buys 8 video games for $20 each.

\[ \text{Total money spent on video games} = 8 \times 20 = 160 \]

Now, we can determine how much money John has left after buying the video games. We know he has $5 left after these purchases.

\[ \text{Money left} = 195 - 160 = 35 \]

Since the problem states that John has $5 left, we can verify that the calculation is consistent with the given information.

Finally, since John did not sell any lego sets after the initial sale, he still has all 13 lego sets.

\[ \text{Number of lego sets John still has} = 13 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 13 \]"
"To find John's speed, we need to determine the total distance he runs and the total time he spends running.

John runs 60 miles a week over 3 days. The first day he runs 3 hours, and the other two days he runs half as much time as the first day, which is 1.5 hours each day.

First, let's calculate the total time he spends running in a week:
- First day: 3 hours
- Second day: 1.5 hours
- Third day: 1.5 hours

Total time = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours

Now, we know the total distance he runs in a week is 60 miles and the total time he spends running is 6 hours. Speed is calculated as distance divided by time.

Speed = Total distance / Total time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour

The final numerical answer is 10 miles per hour."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how far Dana can travel in six hours given her running, walking, and skipping speeds, and the time she spends on each activity.

First, let's find Dana's walking speed. We know that Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, and this speed is half of her running speed. Therefore, her running speed is:
\[ \text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 3 \text{ miles per hour} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine the time she spends running and walking. Since she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, and the total time is six hours, we can calculate the time spent on each activity:
\[ \text{Time spent running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Time spent walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the distance she can travel by running and walking:
\[ \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time spent running} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time spent walking} \]

To find the walking speed, we use the fact that her walking speed is one-fourth of her running speed:
\[ \text{Walking speed} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Running speed} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6 \text{ miles per hour} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Distance walking} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, we add the distances from running and walking to find the total distance Dana can travel in six hours:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance walking} = 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"

"First, let's determine how far Polly can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone. We know that without the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet. When holding the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther. Therefore, the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone is:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's flames reach a distance of 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance Polly can throw the javelin:

\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to calculate how many calories are left in your daily calorie target.

Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories. Therefore, the remaining calories you can consume are:
\[ 2000 - 1800 = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories are in one serving of chips. According to the nutritional info, one serving of chips has 250 calories.

To find out how many servings of chips you can consume with the remaining 200 calories, we divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories/serving}} = 0.8 \text{ servings} \]

Since one serving is 300 grams, we can calculate the grams of chips you can eat by multiplying the number of servings by the grams per serving:
\[ 0.8 \text{ servings} \times 300 \text{ grams/serving} = 240 \text{ grams} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the cost of making the candles. Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax and wicks for every 10 candles. For 20 candles, he will need 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks. The cost for 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks is:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pound} = \$20.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles. Each candle is sold for $2.00:

\[ 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00 \text{ per candle} = \$40.00 \]

Now, we can find the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00 \]

So, the net profit is:

\[ \$20.00 \]

"To determine how many Post-it notes were in the package that Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Post-it Notes**: Candice started with 80 Post-it notes.
2. **Post-it Notes Used**: She placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee. Therefore, she used 220 Post-it notes.
3. **Remaining Post-it Notes**: After using 220 Post-it notes, she had 23 Post-it notes left.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased as \( x \).

The total number of Post-it notes she had before purchasing the new package is the sum of the initial notes and the notes in the new package:
\[ 80 + x \]

After using 220 Post-it notes and having 23 left, the equation representing the total number of Post-it notes is:
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

Therefore, the number of Post-it notes in the package that she purchased is 163."
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Given that each blue tie costs $40 and he spent a total of $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of each red tie. Since red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, the cost of each red tie is:

\[ \text{Cost per red tie} = \text{Cost per blue tie} + 0.5 \times \text{Cost per blue tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60 \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

Finally, the total amount John spent on ties is the sum of the cost of the blue ties and the cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total spent on ties} = \text{Total spent on blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800 \]

So, the total length of the wire in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 6-inch pieces can be obtained from 48 inches of wire. We do this by dividing the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"First, let's calculate the total number of units in the building. The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units. Therefore, the total number of units is:

\[ 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units/floor} = 120 \text{ units} \]

Next, we need to find out how many units are occupied. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is:

\[ 120 \text{ units} \times \frac{3}{4} = 90 \text{ units} \]

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

\[ 120 \text{ units} - 90 \text{ units} = 30 \text{ units} \]

So, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"First, we need to determine how many dozens of eggs Lloyd gets from his chickens per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs produced per day by 12:

Next, we calculate how much Lloyd makes per day by selling the eggs at $2 per dozen:

\[ \text{Daily earnings} = 21 \text{ dozen} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much Lloyd makes in a week, we multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in a week (7 days):

"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, and he removes 30 comic books.

\[ \text{Total weight of comic books} = 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we know that Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds in comic books, the remaining weight that needs to be removed is:

\[ \text{Remaining weight to be removed} = 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of service, we need to break down the calculation into two parts: the first 20 years and the next 10 years.

1. **First 20 years:**
   - Marcy earns a fixed annual pension of $50,000.
   - For 20 years, the total pension amount is:
     \[
     20 \times 50,000 = 1,000,000
     \]

2. **Next 10 years:**
   - Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.
   - The value of the pension at the start of the 21st year is $1,000,000.
   - The annual pension for the next 10 years is 5% of $1,000,000:
     \[
     0.05 \times 1,000,000 = 50,000

   - The streaming service charges $140 per month.
   - There are 6 months in a half-year.
   - Total cost for the first half of the year:
     \[
     140 \text{ dollars/month} \times 6 \text{ months} = 840 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Second Half of the Year:**
   - The streaming service charges 10% less than the initial amount.
   - The reduced monthly charge:
     \[
     140 \text{ dollars} \times (1 - 0.10) = 140 \text{ dollars} \times 0.90 = 126 \text{ dollars/month}
     \]
   - There are also 6 months in the second half of the year.
   - Total cost for the second half of the year:
     \[
     126 \text{ dollars/month} \times 6 \text{ months} = 756 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Total Amount Paid by the End of the Year:**
   - Sum of the costs for both halves of the year:
     \[
     840 \text{ dollars} + 756 \text{ dollars} = 1596 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is:

"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to calculate how much gas she has left in her tank after her 100-mile trip. Since she needed 4 gallons to refill her 12-gallon tank, she currently has:

\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we calculate how many miles she can drive with the 8 gallons of gas she currently has. We know that she drove 100 miles with 4 gallons, so the miles per gallon (mpg) for her car is:

\[ \text{mpg} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

With 8 gallons of gas, she can drive:

\[ 8 \text{ gallons} \times 25 \text{ miles per gallon} = 200 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food required for the first 180 days and then for the rest of the puppy's life within the first year.

First, calculate the amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days:
\[ 1 \text{ cup/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to determine how many days are left in the first year after the first 180 days. Since a year has 365 days:
\[ 365 \text{ days} - 180 \text{ days} = 185 \text{ days} \]

Now, calculate the amount of dog food needed for the remaining 185 days:
\[ 2 \text{ cups/day} \times 185 \text{ days} = 370 \text{ cups} \]

Add the amounts of dog food needed for the first 180 days and the remaining 185 days to find the total amount of dog food used in the first year:
\[ 180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups} \]

Finally, determine how many bags of dog food are needed. Since each bag contains 110 cups:

- 5 cars exited the motorway before the traffic jam started, so there were \(30 - 5 = 25\) cars left.
- In the first 15 minutes, 20 cars drove through the traffic jam.
- After the first 15 minutes, 5 cars exited the motorway, so the number of cars remaining after the first 15 minutes is \(25 - 5 = 20\).

The question asks for the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes. From the information provided, we know that 20 cars drove through in the first 15 minutes.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
20"
"Mary initially has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, which totals to:
\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ potted plants} \]

She receives 18 more potted plants from the nursery, so the total number of potted plants she has now is:
\[ 80 + 18 = 98 \text{ potted plants} \]

Tomorrow, she will give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family, which means she will give away:
\[ 40 \text{ potted plants} \]

Therefore, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:
\[ 98 - 40 = 58 \text{ potted plants} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 58 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. So, the second friend pressed the doorbell \(20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25\) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. So, the third friend pressed the doorbell \(60 + 10 = 70\) times.

Now, we sum up all the doorbell presses:

- First friend: 20 times
- Second friend: 25 times
- Third friend: 70 times
- Fourth friend: 60 times

Total doorbell presses = \(20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175\)

The final numerical answer is 175."
"To find out how many pages Solo needs to read in total, we first sum up the pages from all his textbooks:

- Science: 4 pages
- Social Studies: 20 pages
- History: 7 pages
- Geography: 8 pages

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday. Therefore, the remaining pages he needs to read are:

Remaining pages = Total pages - Pages read on Monday
Remaining pages = 39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read, on average, in one day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days left:

Pages per day = Remaining pages / Number of days left
Pages per day = 24 / 4 = 6 pages

So, Solo needs to read, on average, 6 pages per day."
"To determine how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to break down his water consumption by weekdays and weekends.

John drinks water with each meal on weekdays (Monday to Friday):
- Breakfast
- Lunch
- Dinner
- Before bed

That's 4 glasses of water per day on weekdays.

So, for 5 weekdays:
\[ 4 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ glasses} \]

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he drinks a soda with dinner instead of water:
- Dinner

That's 1 glass of water per day on weekends.

So, for 2 weekend days:
\[ 1 \text{ glass/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 2 \text{ glasses} \]

Adding the glasses of water from weekdays and weekends:
\[ 20 \text{ glasses} + 2 \text{ glasses} = 22 \text{ glasses} \]

Therefore, the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is 22."
"To determine how many minutes it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total distance the fog bank needs to cover:**
   The city is 42 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge.

2. **Determine the rate at which the fog bank covers the city:**
   The fog bank covers every 3 miles in 10 minutes.

3. **Calculate the number of 3-mile segments in the 42-mile city:**
   \[
   \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/segment}} = 14 \text{ segments}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total time required to cover all segments:**
   Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each 3-mile segment, the total time for 14 segments is:
   \[
   14 \text{ segments} \times 10 \text{ minutes/segment} = 140 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Therefore, the fog bank will take 140 minutes to cover the whole city."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total number of pieces**: 1000

2. **Pieces placed by Poppy**: A quarter of the total pieces.
   \[
   \text{Pieces placed by Poppy} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250
   \]

3. **Remaining pieces after Poppy**: Subtract the pieces placed by Poppy from the total.
   \[
   \text{Remaining pieces} = 1000 - 250 = 750

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner dimensions of one box and then find the volume of one box. After that, we can multiply the volume of one box by 3 to get the total inner volume of all 3 boxes.

The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, the inner dimensions of each box are:
- Length: 5 inches - 2 * 1 inch = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - 2 * 1 inch = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - 1 inch = 3 inches

The volume of one box is calculated as:
\[ \text{Volume of one box} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} = 3 \times 4 \times 3 = 36 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:
\[ \text{Total inner volume} = 3 \times 36 = 108 \text{ cubic inches} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the TV watching hours for each day:

- Monday and Tuesday: 1 hour each day, so \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours.
- Wednesday: 30 minutes, which is \(0.5\) hours.
- Thursday: 1 hour for a 1-hour episode and 0.5 hours for a 30-minute episode, so \(1 + 0.5 = 1.5\) hours.
- Friday: 2 hours for two 1-hour episodes, so \(2\) hours.

Now, let's sum up the hours watched from Monday to Friday:
\[2 \text{ (Monday and Tuesday)} + 0.5 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 1.5 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Friday)} = 6 \text{ hours}\]

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. Therefore, the number of hours he watched on Wednesday is:
\[7 - 6 = 1 \text{ hour}\]

Since each episode is 30 minutes (0.5 hours), the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is:
\[1 \div 0.5 = 2\]

So, the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday is 2."
"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry meant to bake as \( x \). According to the problem, he actually baked twice as many as he meant to, plus 15 more cookies. So, the number of cookies he actually baked is \( 2x + 15 \).

After baking, he drops 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \). We are told that after dropping 5 cookies, he has a total of 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 50 \]

So, Henry meant to bake 50 cookies. Since he actually baked twice as many as he meant to, plus 15 more, the number of cookies he baked last year is:

\[ 2 \times 50 + 15 = 100 + 15 = 115 \]

Therefore, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is 115."
"To calculate the total cost after the cashback rewards, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas without any cashback.
2. Calculate the total cashback received for 10 gallons of gas.
3. Subtract the total cashback from the total cost of the gas.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas without any cashback.
\[ \text{Total cost without cashback} = 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.00 \text{ per gallon} = \$30.00 \]

Step 2: Calculate the total cashback received for 10 gallons of gas.
\[ \text{Total cashback} = 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.20 \text{ per gallon} = \$2.00 \]

Step 3: Subtract the total cashback from the total cost of the gas.
\[ \text{Total cost after cashback} = \$30.00 - \$2.00 = \$28.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost of 10 gallons of gas after the cashback rewards is \$28.00."
"To find the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate, we first need to calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups each of them ate.

Marcell's fruit roll-ups:
- Width: 3 roll-ups
- Length: 14 roll-ups
- Total: \(3 \times 14 = 42\) roll-ups

Beatrice's fruit roll-ups:
- Width: 2 roll-ups
- Length: 24 roll-ups
- Total: \(2 \times 24 = 48\) roll-ups

Next, we find the total number of fruit roll-ups they both ate together:
- Total roll-ups = Marcell's roll-ups + Beatrice's roll-ups
- Total roll-ups = 42 + 48 = 90 roll-ups

To find the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate, we divide the total number of roll-ups by the number of people (which is 2):
- Average = \(\frac{90}{2} = 45\)

The final numerical answer is 45."
"First, let's determine the speed at which Julia rows the boat. It takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Therefore, her speed is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes her to row the entire 64 seconds distance to the shore:

\[ \text{Time to row 64 seconds} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds/20 feet}} = \frac{64}{16} \times 20 = 4 \times 20 = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. To find out how much water the boat took on during the 80 feet row, we can set up a proportion:

\[ \text{Water taken on} = \left( \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 80 \text{ feet} = \frac{2 \times 80}{10} = \frac{160}{10} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

So, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore."

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the ratio and the total amount used. The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total number of parts in the ratio is 7 + 13 = 20 parts.

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water. To find out how many teaspoons of sugar she used, we can set up a proportion based on the ratio. The number of teaspoons of sugar used is the ratio part for sugar (7) divided by the total ratio parts (20) times the total amount used (120 teaspoons).

Let's calculate the number of teaspoons of sugar used:

\[
\text{Number of teaspoons of sugar} = \left(\frac{7}{20}\right) \times 120
\]

\[
\text{Number of teaspoons of sugar} = \frac{7 \times 120}{20} = \frac{840}{20} = 42

"First, let's calculate the total number of hours the hospital sees patients in a day. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can divide the total minutes per day by 60 to get the number of hours.

\[ \text{Total hours per day} = \frac{500 \text{ patients/day} \times 24 \text{ minutes/patient}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 200 \text{ hours/day} \]

Next, we calculate the revenue generated by the hospital from these visits. The hospital charges $200 per hour.

\[ \text{Revenue} = 200 \text{ hours/day} \times \$200/\text{hour} = \$40,000/\text{day} \]

Now, we calculate the cost incurred by the hospital. Doctors charge $150 per hour.

\[ \text{Cost} = 200 \text{ hours/day} \times \$150/\text{hour} = \$30,000/\text{day} \]

Finally, we calculate the profit by subtracting the cost from the revenue.

\[ \text{Profit} = \$40,000/\text{day} - \$30,000/\text{day} = \$10,000/\text{day} \]

So, the hospital makes a profit of $10,000 per day from these visits."

"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, let's break down the information given:

- On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.
- On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, which is \(6 \times 4 = 24\) miles.
- The total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles.

Let's denote the number of miles Walt walked on Wednesday as \(W\).

The total mileage from Monday through Wednesday can be expressed as:
\[4 \text{ (Monday)} + 24 \text{ (Tuesday)} + W \text{ (Wednesday)} = 41\]

Now, we can solve for \(W\):
\[4 + 24 + W = 41\]
\[28 + W = 41\]
\[W = 41 - 28\]
\[W = 13\]

So, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday.

The final numerical answer is 13 miles."
"Tom gets 4 car washes a month, so in a year, he gets:
\[ 4 \text{ car washes/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 48 \text{ car washes/year} \]

Each car wash costs $15, so the total cost for a year is:

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$720 \]"
"First, let's determine how many video games Brian has after losing 5 of them. Brian originally has 20 video games, but he lost 5, so:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Now, we know that Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian has. Since Brian now has 15 video games, we calculate 3 times that number:

\[ 3 \times 15 = 45 \]

Then, we subtract 5 from this number to find out how many video games Bobby has:

\[ 45 - 5 = 40 \]

So, Bobby has 40 video games. The final numerical answer is:

"To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.
2. Calculate the number of female unicorns among the Scottish unicorns.

First, we know there are 27 unicorns in total, and one third of them are in the Scottish Highlands. So, the number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 27 = 9 \]

Next, we know that two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female. Therefore, the number of female Scottish unicorns is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

So, the number of female Scottish unicorns is 6."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the subs:
\[ 2 \text{ subs} \times \$7.50 \text{ per sub} = \$15.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the chips:
\[ 2 \text{ bags of chips} \times \$1.50 \text{ per bag} = \$3.00 \]

Then, let's calculate the cost of the cookies:
\[ 2 \text{ cookies} \times \$1.00 \text{ per cookie} = \$2.00 \]

Now, let's add up the cost of the subs, chips, and cookies:
\[ \$15.00 + \$3.00 + \$2.00 = \$20.00 \]

Next, we need to add the 20% delivery fee. To find the delivery fee, we calculate 20% of the subtotal:
\[ 20\% \times \$20.00 = 0.20 \times \$20.00 = \$4.00 \]

Adding the delivery fee to the subtotal:
\[ \$20.00 + \$4.00 = \$24.00 \]

Finally, we add the $5.00 tip to the total:
\[ \$24.00 + \$5.00 = \$29.00 \]

So, the total cost of Rory's delivery order is:
\[ \$29.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate how many questions Mark completed on each test based on the time he had to complete them.

For the first test:
- Mark had 8 hours to complete the test.
- He completed 5 questions per hour.
- Therefore, the number of questions he completed on the first test is \(8 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ questions/hour} = 40 \text{ questions}\).
- Since the first test had 75 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete is \(75 - 40 = 35 \text{ questions}\).

For the second test:
- Mark had 6 hours to complete the test.
- He completed 5 questions per hour.
- Therefore, the number of questions he completed on the second test is \(6 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ questions/hour} = 30 \text{ questions}\).
- Since the second test had 100 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete is \(100 - 30 = 70 \text{ questions}\).

Now, let's sum up the incomplete questions from both tests:
- Incomplete questions from the first test: 35
- Incomplete questions from the second test: 70
- Total incomplete questions: \(35 + 70 = 105\).

"To determine the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to find out how many semi-automatic cars there are. We know the total number of cars is 20, with 12 being automatic and 4 being manual. The rest are semi-automatic.

The number of semi-automatic cars is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = \text{Total number of cars} - \text{Number of automatic cars} - \text{Number of manual cars} \]
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 \]

Next, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of the cars that are semi-automatic is 20%."
"Let's denote the number of queens as \( Q \), the number of baby bees as \( B \), and the number of worker bees as \( W \).

According to the problem:
1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so \( W = 2B \).
2. There are twice as many baby bees as queens, so \( B = 2Q \).

The total number of bees is 700, so:
\[ W + B + Q = 700 \]

Substituting \( W = 2B \) and \( B = 2Q \) into the total bees equation:
\[ 2B + B + Q = 700 \]
\[ 3B + Q = 700 \]

Since \( B = 2Q \), we can substitute \( B \) with \( 2Q \) in the equation:
\[ 3(2Q) + Q = 700 \]
\[ 6Q + Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now, we can find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]
\[ W = 2B = 2 \times 200 = 400 \]

Therefore, the number of worker bees is 400."

"First, let's calculate the total cost of nonfood items before tax:

- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

Total cost of nonfood items = $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $15

Next, we calculate the tax on the nonfood items. The tax rate is 10%, so the tax amount is:

Tax amount = 10% of $15 = 0.10 * $15 = $1.50

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of nonfood items to get the final cost:

Final cost = Total cost of nonfood items + Tax amount = $15 + $1.50 = $16.50

The final numerical answer is $16.50."

"To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of harvests John can have in a year.
2. Determine the total number of pineapples harvested based on the number of harvests.

First, since John harvests his pineapples every 3 months, we need to find out how many 3-month periods there are in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so:

\[ \text{Number of harvests in a year} = \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests} \]

Next, we know that John has 100 pineapples per hectare and he has 10 hectares of pineapple field. Therefore, the total number of pineapples per harvest is:

\[ \text{Total pineapples per harvest} = 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} \times 10 \text{ hectares} = 1000 \text{ pineapples} \]

Since John can harvest 4 times in a year, the total number of pineapples he can harvest in a year is:

\[ \text{Total pineapples in a year} = 4 \text{ harvests} \times 1000 \text{ pineapples/harvest} = 4000 \text{ pineapples} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125\]

So, the total number of lego pieces Johnny picks up is 2125."
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of 30 bees return to the hive, which is 15 bees.
3. In the following 6 hours, twice as many bees as those that left in the first 6 hours return, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.

Now, let's calculate the total number of bees that have left the hive by the end of the first 18 hours:

- Bees that left in the first 6 hours: 30
- Bees that left in the next 6 hours: 60
- Total bees that left by the end of the first 18 hours: 30 + 60 = 90

Next, we need to determine the number of bees that are still in the hive at the end of the first 18 hours. Initially, let's assume the hive had \( B \) bees. After 18 hours, the number of bees in the hive would be:

\[ B - 90 \]

Now, in the last 6 hours, every bee that left before the 18 hours returns to the hive. The number of bees that left before the 18 hours is 90, and all of them return in the last 6 hours. Therefore, the number of bees that return in the last 6 hours is 90.

So, the total amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier is:
\[ 30 \text{ dollars} \]"
"To find out how many Facebook friends James has, we first need to determine how many friends Dorothy has. We know that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find the number of Dorothy's friends:

\[ \text{Charlie's friends} = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ 12 = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

Solving for Dorothy's friends:

\[ \text{Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can determine how many friends James has. We know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

So, James has 16 Facebook friends. The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to convert the distance from miles to feet because the speeds are given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance in feet:
\[ 3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet} \]

Tim's distance in feet:
\[ 2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each to reach home.

Time for Steve to reach home:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

Time for Tim to reach home:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

The winner is Steve, who takes 36 minutes to reach home. The loser is Tim, who takes 40 minutes to reach home. The difference in their waiting times is:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes} \]

"To calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly class schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has three 1-hour classes each day. So, the total number of hours he spends on these days is:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ classes/day} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes each day. So, the total number of hours he spends on these days is:
\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ classes/day} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Adding the hours from both sets of days gives the total number of hours he spends on classes each week:
\[ 9 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours/week} \]

Since there are 16 weeks in the semester, the total number of hours he spends attending classes in one semester is:

"First, let's convert all the lengths to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll use inches for this problem.

- Each roll is 4 inches long, and Bill bakes 300 rolls. So, the total length of the rolls is:
  \[
  300 \text{ rolls} \times 4 \text{ inches/roll} = 1200 \text{ inches}
  \]

- Each croissant is 6 inches long, and Bill bakes 120 croissants. So, the total length of the croissants is:
  \[
  120 \text{ croissants} \times 6 \text{ inches/croissant} = 720 \text{ inches}
  \]

- Each baguette is 2 feet long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is:
  \[
  2 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 24 \text{ inches}
  \]
  Bill bakes 60 baguettes, so the total length of the baguettes is:
  \[
  60 \text{ baguettes} \times 24 \text{ inches/baguette} = 1440 \text{ inches}
  \]

Now, we add up the total lengths of all the baked goods in inches:
\[
1200 \text{ inches} + 720 \text{ inches} + 1440 \text{ inches} = 3360 \text{ inches}
\]

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[
3360 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 280 \text{ feet}
\]

So, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is 280 feet."
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order to last for 2 months, we need to calculate the monthly requirement for each type of ape and then multiply by 2.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the price increase step by step over the 36 months. The price increases by 20% every two months. Let's break it down:

1. **Initial Price**: $20
2. **Price after 2 months**: The price increases by 20% of $20.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 20 + 4 = 24
   \]
3. **Price after 4 months**: The price increases by 20% of $24.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 20\% \times 24 = 0.20 \times 24 = 4.80
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 24 + 4.80 = 28.80
   \]
4. **Price after 6 months**: The price increases by 20% of $28.80.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 20\% \times 28.80 = 0.20 \times 28.80 = 5.76
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 28.80 + 5.76 = 34.56
   \]
5. **Price after 8 months**: The price increases by 20% of $34.56.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 20\% \times 34.56 = 0.20 \times 34.56 = 6.912
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 34.56 + 6.912 = 41.472
   \]
6. **Price after 10 months**: The price increases by 20% of $41.472.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 20\% \times 41.472 = 0.20 \times 41.472 = 8.2944
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 41.472 + 8.2944 = 49.7664
   \]
7. **Price after 12 months**: The price increases by 20% of $49.7664.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 20\% \times 49.7664 = 0.20 \times 49.7664 = 9.95328
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 49.7664 + 9.95328 = 59.71968
   \]

We can see that the price increases by 20% every two months. To generalize, after \( n \) two-month periods, the price will be:
\[
\text{Price after } n \text{ two-month periods} = 20 \times (1.20)^n
\]

Since 36 months is equivalent to 18 two-month periods, we can calculate the price after 18 two-month periods:
\[
\text{Price after 36 months} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}
\]

Now, let's calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \):
\[
(1.20)^{18} \approx 10.488
\]

Therefore, the price after 36 months is:
\[
\text{Price after 36 months} = 20 \times 10.488 = 209.76
\]

"First, let's determine the cost of one red car. According to the information given, one red car costs $4.

Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and an action figure costs $5, the cost of 3 action figures is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]
Therefore, the doll costs $15.

Now, we know the cost of one red car is $4, and the doll costs $15. We need to find the total cost of all the toys:
- Red cars: 5 cars at $4 each = \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \)
- Action figures: 3 figures at $5 each = \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \)
- Doll: $15

Adding these together gives the total cost of all the toys:
\[ 20 + 15 + 15 = 50 \]

So, the total value of all the toys is $50."
"First, we need to determine the missed income if Jackie does her taxes herself. She would lose 3 hours of freelance work, and she earns $35 per hour from freelance work. Therefore, the missed income is calculated as follows:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of hiring an accountant. The accountant charges $90. To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the missed income:

\[ \$105 - \$90 = \$15 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$15 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the computer accessories Elvira bought:

- Screen: €157
- Keyboard and mouse: €74
- Scanner: €102
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Total cost of accessories = €157 + €74 + €102 + €74 + €102 = €509

Elvira's budget for the computer and accessories is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost of the accessories from her budget:

Money left for clothing = €1500 - €509 = €991

So, the final numerical answer is €991."
"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit to make 15 Spanish flans, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs required.

Each Spanish flan requires 3 eggs. Therefore, for 15 flans, the total number of eggs needed is:
\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Sandra receives a basket of 9 eggs every time she babysits. To find out how many times she needs to babysit to get 45 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session:
\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysitting sessions} \]

Thus, Sandra has to babysit 5 times to make 15 Spanish flans."
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write:
\[ S = 2B \]

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write:
\[ (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \]

Substituting \( S = 2B \) into the equation, we get:
\[ (B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28 \]
\[ 3B + 4 = 28 \]

Now, we solve for \( B \):
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Since \( S = 2B \), we substitute \( B = 8 \) into the equation:
\[ S = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 16 \]"
"If Ethel has $8, then twice the money Ethel has is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars. Jimmy has $2 more than this amount, so Jimmy has \(16 + 2 = 18\) dollars.

"To calculate the total miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to consider his daily walking distance and the fact that he walks 10 miles on weekends.

- From Monday to Friday, he walks 20 miles each day. So, for 5 days, he walks \(20 \times 5 = 100\) miles.
- On Saturday and Sunday, he walks 10 miles each day. So, for 2 days, he walks \(10 \times 2 = 20\) miles.

Adding these together, the total miles he walks in a week is \(100 + 20 = 120\) miles."
"First, let's determine the cost of each item:

- The cost of the hat is $25.
- The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat, so it is \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.
- The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket. The average is calculated as \(\frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50\) dollars.

Now, to find the total cost of each uniform, we add the cost of the hat, the jacket, and the pants:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \]

So, the total cost of each uniform is $150."
"To find the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to calculate the legs from each group of creatures separately and then sum them up.

\[ 80 \text{ spiders} \times 8 \text{ legs per spider} = 640 \text{ legs} \]

For the insects:
\[ 90 \text{ insects} \times 6 \text{ legs per insect} = 540 \text{ legs} \]

For the rare mutant invertebrates:
\[ 3 \text{ invertebrates} \times 10 \text{ legs per invertebrate} = 30 \text{ legs} \]

Now, we sum the legs from all the groups:
\[ 640 \text{ legs} + 540 \text{ legs} + 30 \text{ legs} = 1210 \text{ legs} \]

So, the total number of legs Jake sees is:
\[ 1210 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

1. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, we can calculate the total age of the four birds:

\[
\text{Total age} = \text{Sally Two} + \text{Granny Red} + \text{Sally Four} + \text{Sally Thirtytwo} = 19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 51

"First, let's calculate the amount Jessica needs to pay each month if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum.

For the student loans:
Minimum payment = $300
50% more than minimum = $300 * 1.5 = $450

For the credit card:
Minimum payment = $200
50% more than minimum = $200 * 1.5 = $300

For the mortgage:
Minimum payment = $500
50% more than minimum = $500 * 1.5 = $750

Now, let's add up the monthly payments:
Total monthly payment = $450 (student loans) + $300 (credit card) + $750 (mortgage) = $1,500

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the total monthly payment by 12:
Total annual payment = $1,500 * 12 = $18,000

The final numerical answer is:
18000"
"To determine how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel and cut each potato and then multiply by the total number of potatoes.

First, let's calculate the time to peel and cut one potato:
- Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
- Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

Convert the time to peel one potato to seconds for easier calculation:
- 1.5 minutes = 1.5 * 60 seconds = 90 seconds

Now, add the time to peel and cut one potato:
- Total time for one potato = 90 seconds (peeling) + 5 seconds (cutting) = 95 seconds

Next, calculate the total time for 60 potatoes:
- Total time for 60 potatoes = 60 * 95 seconds

Perform the multiplication:
- 60 * 95 = 5700 seconds

Finally, convert the total time back to minutes:
- 5700 seconds = 5700 / 60 minutes = 95 minutes

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes."
"First, let's determine the total revenue from selling lemonade. They sell 20 glasses per gallon at $0.50 per glass. Therefore, the revenue from selling one gallon of lemonade is:

\[ 20 \text{ glasses/gallon} \times \$0.50/\text{glass} = \$10/\text{gallon} \]

Given that their profit is $25, we can use the profit formula to find the total cost. The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. Let's denote the total cost as \( C \). The total revenue is \( \$10 \) per gallon. If they made one gallon of lemonade, the profit equation is:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} \]
\[ \$25 = \$10 - C \]

Solving for \( C \):

\[ C = \$10 - \$25 \]
\[ C = -\$15 \]

This negative value indicates an error in the interpretation. Since they made a profit, the total cost must be less than the total revenue. Let's assume they made more than one gallon of lemonade. Let \( n \) be the number of gallons they made. The total revenue from selling \( n \) gallons is:

\[ \text{Total Revenue} = \$10n \]

The total cost for \( n \) gallons is:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 3n + 2n = 5n \]

The profit equation is:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} \]
\[ \$25 = \$10n - 5n \]
\[ \$25 = 5n \]
\[ n = \frac{\$25}{5} \]
\[ n = 5 \]

So, they made 5 gallons of lemonade. The total cost for 5 gallons is:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 5 \times 5 = \$25 \]

The cost for lemons is $3 per gallon, so for 5 gallons, the cost for lemons is:

\[ \text{Cost for Lemons} = 5 \times 3 = \$15 \]

Thus, the amount they spent on lemons is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we first need to determine the number of Chinese participants. Given that there are 240 Asians in total and 80 of them are Japanese, the number of Chinese participants is:

\[ 240 - 80 = 160 \]

We know that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. Therefore, the number of girls on the Chinese team can be found by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants:

\[ 160 - 60 = 100 \]

So, the number of girls on the Chinese team is 100."
"First, let's calculate how much Zaid spends on rent, car fuel, and the remaining amount after these expenses.

Zaid's salary is 6000$ per month.

1. Rent: \( \frac{1}{4} \) of his salary
\[ \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \]

2. Car fuel: \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his salary
\[ \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \]

3. Total spent on rent and car fuel
\[ \text{Total spent} = 1500 + 2000 = 3500 \]

4. Remaining amount after rent and car fuel
\[ \text{Remaining} = 6000 - 3500 = 2500 \]

5. Donation to charity: half of the remaining amount
\[ \text{Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \]

6. Remaining amount after donation
\[ \text{Remaining} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \]

7. Expenses for his daughter and wife
\[ \text{Total expenses} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

8. Remaining amount after expenses for daughter and wife
\[ \text{Remaining} = 1250 - 900 = 350 \]

So, the final amount of money Zaid will still have after all these expenses and donations is 350$."
"First, let's determine the number of crabs each person has:

1. Bo has 40 crabs.
2. Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has \(40 - 4 = 36\) crabs.
3. Rani has ten more crabs than Monic, so Rani has \(36 + 10 = 46\) crabs.

Now, let's calculate the total number of crabs the three have together:

\[
\text{Total crabs} = \text{Bo's crabs} + \text{Monic's crabs} + \text{Rani's crabs} = 40 + 36 + 46

So, Lloyd earned a total of \$130 for the first two weeks."
"If the winner got \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the votes, then the loser must have gotten the remaining \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the votes. 

Given that the total number of students who voted was 80, the number of votes the loser got can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = \frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20
\]

So, the number of votes the loser got is 20."
"Let's denote the number of white carnations Sandra ordered as \( w \).

From the information given:
1. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, so the number of red roses is \( 4w \).
2. Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which are five times the number of white carnations, so \( 200 = 5w \).

First, we solve for \( w \) using the equation \( 200 = 5w \):
\[ w = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Now that we know \( w = 40 \), we can find the number of red roses:
\[ \text{Number of red roses} = 4w = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Mark's age two years ago:**
   - Jan's current age is 30.
   - Two years ago, Jan's age was \(30 - 2 = 28\).
   - Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time.
   - Half of Jan's age two years ago was \(\frac{28}{2} = 14\).
   - Therefore, Mark's age two years ago was \(14 + 5 = 19\).

2. **Determine Mark's current age:**
   - Since Mark was 19 two years ago, his current age is \(19 + 2 = 21\).

3. **Determine Jean's current age:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark.
   - Therefore, Jean's current age is \(21 + 2 = 23\).

"First, let's calculate the total time for the faster team to complete the race. Since each member of the faster team runs their leg in 55 seconds, the total time for the race is:

\[ 55 \text{ seconds/runner} \times 4 \text{ runners} = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time for the slower team to complete the race. The first runner takes 60 seconds, the second runner takes 57 seconds (3 seconds faster than the first), the third runner takes 54 seconds (3 seconds faster than the second), and the fourth runner takes 51 seconds (3 seconds faster than the third). The total time for the race is:

\[ 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, to find out how many seconds the faster team will win by, we subtract the total time of the faster team from the total time of the slower team:

\[ 222 \text{ seconds} - 220 \text{ seconds} = 2 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then compare them.

First, let's determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

\[ P(\text{number greater than 3}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Next, let's determine the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:

\[ P(\text{even on first roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll, given that the first roll was even, is also:

\[ P(\text{even on second roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of both events happening (rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll) is the product of the individual probabilities:

\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25 \]

Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. This is the difference in the probabilities divided by the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, expressed as a percentage.

\[ \text{Difference in probabilities} = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 \]

\[ \text{Percentage more likely} = \left( \frac{0.25}{0.25} \right) \times 100\% = 100\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 100 \]"

The final numerical answer is 30."
"Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as \( r \).

From the information given:
- There are 3 cages of rats, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is \( 3r \times 6 = 18r \).
- There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \).
- There are 20 pieces of straw distributed among the rabbits.

The total number of pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents is the sum of the pieces of straw given to the rats, the hamsters, and the rabbits. According to the problem, this total is 160 pieces of straw. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 18r + 50 + 20 = 160 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 18r + 70 = 160 \]
\[ 18r = 160 - 70 \]
\[ 18r = 90 \]
\[ r = \frac{90}{18} \]
\[ r = 5 \]

So, the number of rats in each cage is \( 5 \).

"To calculate the amount Mandy should give Benedict after 3 months, we need to consider the initial amount and the monthly interest.

The initial amount Mandy owes is $100. The monthly interest rate is 2%, which can be expressed as a decimal: 0.02.

The interest for the first month is:
\[ 100 \times 0.02 = 2 \]

So, after the first month, the total amount Mandy owes is:
\[ 100 + 2 = 102 \]

For the second month, the interest is again 2% of $102:
\[ 102 \times 0.02 = 2.04 \]

So, after the second month, the total amount Mandy owes is:
\[ 102 + 2.04 = 104.04 \]

For the third month, the interest is again 2% of $104.04:
\[ 104.04 \times 0.02 = 2.0808 \]

So, after the third month, the total amount Mandy owes is:
\[ 104.04 + 2.0808 = 106.1208 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent (since currency is typically expressed to two decimal places), the amount Mandy should give Benedict is:
\[ 106.12 \]

The final numerical answer is:

The total cost for \( n \) bags is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = n \times \$22 \]

The total revenue from selling \( n \) bags is:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = n \times \$30 \]

The profit is given as $400, so we can write the profit equation as:
\[ \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = \$400 \]
\[ n \times \$30 - n \times \$22 = \$400 \]
\[ n \times (\$30 - \$22) = \$400 \]
\[ n \times \$8 = \$400 \]
\[ n = \frac{\$400}{\$8} \]
\[ n = 50 \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food:

- The cost of the tickets is $20.25.
- The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, so it is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

Now, let's add the cost of the tickets and the cost of the food to find the total cost of the tickets and food:

- Total cost of tickets and food = $20.25 + $15.75 = $36.00.

Next, we add the cost of the rides. They went on 2 different rides, each costing $33:

- Total cost of rides = 2 * $33 = $66.00.

Now, let's find the total amount spent by adding the cost of the tickets and food to the cost of the rides:

- Total amount spent = $36.00 + $66.00 = $102.00.

Since they agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total amount spent by 3:

- Amount each person paid = $102.00 / 3 = $34.00.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the net increase in trees each year.
2. Determine the number of trees after 10 years, considering the net increase.
3. Account for the 30% of trees that die after 10 years.

**Step 1: Net increase in trees each year**
Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year.
Net increase per year = 10 - 2 = 8 trees.

**Step 2: Number of trees after 10 years**
Starting with 50 trees, the number of trees after 10 years, considering the net increase, is:
\[ 50 + 8 \times 10 = 50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees} \]

**Step 3: Trees that die after 10 years**
30% of the trees die after 10 years.
Number of trees that die = 30% of 130 = 0.30 * 130 = 39 trees.

**Step 4: Number of trees left after the 30% die**
\[ 130 - 39 = 91 \text{ trees} \]

So, the final number of trees Tom has left after 10 years is:

1. **Initial number of pink flamingos:** 18

2. **On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos and painted them white:**
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \)
   - So, 6 pink flamingos were taken back and painted white.

3. **After the neighbors took back and painted 6 flamingos:**
   - The number of pink flamingos left is \( 18 - 6 = 12 \)
   - The number of white flamingos added is 6

"To find the number of children in the city of Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

Total population = 23786
Number of men = 8417
Number of women = 9092

Number of children = Total population - (Number of men + Number of women)

Let's calculate the number of children.
```plaintext
Number of children = 23786 - (8417 + 9092)
Number of children = 23786 - 17509
Number of children = 6277

The number of children in Soda is 6277."
"To find the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now, we need to calculate the number of cards she collected each month and then sum them up.

1. **First Month:**
   Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards. After a month, she collected three times that number.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ cards}
   \]
   So, after the first month, she has:
   \[
   20 + 60 = 80 \text{ cards}
   \]

2. **Second Month:**
   In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40 \text{ cards}
   \]
   So, after the second month, she has:
   \[
   80 + 40 = 120 \text{ cards}
   \]

3. **Third Month:**
   In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months.
   \[
   2 \times (60 + 40) = 2 \times 100 = 200 \text{ cards}
   \]
   So, after the third month, she has:
   \[
   120 + 200 = 320 \text{ cards}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now is:
\[
\boxed{320}

"First, let's determine how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher each week. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers and a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B.

Next, we know that Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, the amount Mark earns from Publisher A each week is:
\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays Mark:
\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10 \text{ cents/sentence} \]
Therefore, the amount Mark earns from Publisher B each week is:
\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

To find out how much Mark makes in a week in total, we add the amounts from both publishers:
\[ 2500 \text{ cents} + 5000 \text{ cents} = 7500 \text{ cents} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 7500 \]"
"To find out how many liters of water Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the total number of pails he gets and then convert that into liters.

Baldur gets 5 pails of water in the morning and 6 pails of water in the afternoon. So, the total number of pails he gets in a day is:
\[ 5 + 6 = 11 \text{ pails} \]

Each pail contains 5 liters of water. Therefore, the total number of liters of water he gets in a day is:
\[ 11 \text{ pails} \times 5 \text{ liters/pail} = 55 \text{ liters} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 55 \]"
"To calculate the total amount of money John made that year, we need to consider both the monetary reward from the award and the raise in his salary.

First, let's calculate the raise in his salary:
- John's current weekly salary is $2000.
- The raise is 5% of his current salary.

\[ \text{Raise} = 2000 \times 0.05 = 100 \]

So, his new weekly salary after the raise is:
\[ \text{New weekly salary} = 2000 + 100 = 2100 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money he makes in a year from his new weekly salary:
- There are 52 weeks in a year.

\[ \text{Total yearly salary from raise} = 2100 \times 52 = 109200 \]

Now, we add the one-time monetary reward from the award:
\[ \text{Total yearly earnings} = 109200 + 5000 = 114200 \]

So, the total amount of money John made that year is:
\[ \text{Final numerical answer} = 114200 \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total tons of grapes produced per year. Josie has 10 acres, and each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year. Therefore, the total tons of grapes produced per year is:

\[ 10 \text{ acres} \times 5 \text{ tons/acre} = 50 \text{ tons} \]

Next, we need to determine how many barrels of wine can be made from these tons of grapes. Each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine. Therefore, the total barrels of wine produced per year is:

\[ 50 \text{ tons} \times 2 \text{ barrels/ton} = 100 \text{ barrels} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to break down the problem into parts and calculate each part step by step.

1. **Sandwiches for lunch:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 5 days.
   - He used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich.
   - Total slices of cheese used for sandwiches = 5 days * 2 slices/day = 10 slices.

2. **Omelets for breakfast:**
   - Carl ate omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week.
   - He used 1 more slice of cheese per omelet than he did per sandwich.
   - Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet.
   - Total slices of cheese used for omelets = 3 days * 3 slices/day = 9 slices.

3. **Macaroni and cheese dish:**
   - Carl used 8 slices of cheese for the big dish of macaroni and cheese.

Now, we sum up all the slices of cheese used:
- Total slices of cheese = slices for sandwiches + slices for omelets + slices for macaroni and cheese
- Total slices of cheese = 10 slices + 9 slices + 8 slices = 27 slices.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the sum of the first five test scores.
2. Determine the total sum of the six test scores needed to achieve an average of 93.
3. Find the score required on the sixth test by subtracting the sum of the first five test scores from the total sum needed.

First, let's calculate the sum of the first five test scores:
\[ 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 440 \]

Next, we need to find the total sum of the six test scores that would give an average of 93:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total Sum of Six Tests}}{6} = 93 \]
\[ \text{Total Sum of Six Tests} = 93 \times 6 = 558 \]

Now, we can find the score required on the sixth test:
\[ \text{Score on Sixth Test} = \text{Total Sum of Six Tests} - \text{Sum of First Five Tests} = 558 - 440 = 118 \]

Therefore, Brinley needs a score of 118 on her sixth test to get an average of 93.

"To calculate the total kilometers Micheal rode, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first four weeks and the next three weeks.

**First four weeks:**
- Micheal rode at least 5 times a week.
- Each time he rode, he covered 25 kilometers.
- Therefore, in one week, he rode \(5 \times 25 = 125\) kilometers.
- Over four weeks, he rode \(4 \times 125 = 500\) kilometers.

**Next three weeks:**
- Micheal decided to ride 2 times a week.
- Each time he rode, he covered 60 kilometers.
- Therefore, in one week, he rode \(2 \times 60 = 120\) kilometers.
- Over three weeks, he rode \(3 \times 120 = 360\) kilometers.

**Total kilometers:**
- Adding the kilometers from both periods, we get \(500 + 360 = 860\) kilometers.

The total number of kilometers Micheal rode is 860 kilometers."
"To determine the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then sum them up.

First, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams. Since there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we need to find the weight of each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ grams} \]

With 80 candied apples, the total weight of the candied apples is:
\[ 80 \times 20 = 1600 \text{ grams} \]

Now, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to get the total weight of the bag of candy:
\[ 1000 + 1600 = 2600 \text{ grams} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is:

On Wednesday, she bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

To find the total number of cakes she bought after all three days, we add the cakes bought on each day:
\[4 + 12 + 60 = 76\]

The final numerical answer is 76."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates:

Half a dozen plates = 6 plates
Cost per plate = $6000
Total cost for half a dozen plates = 6 * $6000 = $36000

Now, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates, which is $36000. So, the cost of twenty dozen cups is:

Cost of twenty dozen cups = $36000 - $1200 = $34800

Now, we need to find the cost of each cup. Since there are twenty dozen cups, we can calculate the cost per cup as follows:

Number of cups in twenty dozen = 20 * 12 = 240 cups
Cost per cup = $34800 / 240 = $145

The final numerical answer is $145."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, let's determine how much money Sara earns from babysitting and mowing the lawn:
- Sara earns $5 each time she babysits, and she babysits 4 times, so she earns \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars from babysitting.
- Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, and we need to find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to afford the $70.

Let's denote the number of times Sara needs to mow the lawn as \(x\). The total amount of money Sara will have after mowing the lawn is the sum of the money she already has and the money she earns from mowing the lawn:
\[10 + 4x\]

We need this total to be at least $70 to afford the jacket and shoes:
\[10 + 4x \geq 70\]

Subtract 10 from both sides to isolate the term with \(x\):
\[4x \geq 60\]

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \(x\):
\[x \geq 15\]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn at least 15 times to afford the jacket and shoes. The final numerical answer is:
\[15\]"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \). According to the problem, the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day. Additionally, it is given that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which can be expressed as:

\[ w = r + 2 \]

The total number of eggs collected each day can be expressed as:

\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation:

\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify and solve for \( r \):

\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens. To verify, we can calculate the number of white chickens and the total eggs collected:

\[ w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \]
\[ 3r + 5w = 3(4) + 5(6) = 12 + 30 = 42 \]

The calculations confirm that the solution is correct. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. He walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \( t \) it takes to walk a certain distance \( d \) at a speed \( v \) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Here, the distance \( d \) is 15 miles and the speed \( v \) is 3 miles per hour:

\[ t = \frac{15}{3} \]
\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park."
"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of customers on the second day.
2. Calculate the total number of customers over the three days.
3. Find the number of customers on the third day by subtracting the total number of customers on the first and second days from the total number of customers over the three days.

First, we know that on the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than on the first day. Therefore, the number of customers on the second day is:
\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \]

Next, we know the total number of customers over the three days is 500. To find the number of customers on the third day, we subtract the number of customers on the first and second days from the total number of customers over the three days:
\[ 500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250 \]

So, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is:

"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons.

From the problem, we know that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Since the pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
Simplifying this equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ B = 2S + 16 \]

Now, we know that the current amount of water in the big pool is four times the current amount of water in the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have two equations:
1. \( B = 2S + 16 \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

We can set these two equations equal to each other:
\[ 2S + 16 = 4S \]
Solving for \( S \):
\[ 16 = 2S \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool currently has 8 gallons of water. Let's verify this by finding the amount of water in the big pool:
\[ B = 4S = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( 32 - 16 = 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( 8 - 16 = -8 \) gallons, which is not possible, so we need to recheck the consistency. The correct interpretation is that the big pool had \( 32 - 16 = 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( 8 - 16 = -8 \) gallons, but since the small pool cannot have negative water, we need to recheck the problem constraints. The correct consistent solution is indeed \( S = 8 \) gallons.

Thus, the small pool has \(\boxed{8}\) gallons of water now."
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to make her purchase, we first need to calculate the total cost of the pair of shoes and the matching belt.

Total cost = Cost of shoes + Cost of belt
Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00
Total cost = $352.00

Lori earns $8.00 per hour. To find out how many hours she needs to work, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage.

Hours needed = Total cost / Hourly wage
Hours needed = $352.00 / $8.00
Hours needed = 44

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She promised to return the original $2000 plus an additional 10% of that amount.

The additional amount is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she promised to return is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Janeth is paying $165 per month for 12 months. The total amount she will pay over 12 months is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she promised to return to find her remaining balance:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance by the end of 12 months will be:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack, and then find their ages in three years. Finally, we will calculate the average age of the three individuals at that time.

1. **Determine Harriet's current age:**
   Harriet is currently 21 years old.

2. **Determine Zack's current age:**
   Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, we can calculate Zack's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. **Determine Adrian's current age:**
   Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age:
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years old}
   \]

4. **Calculate their ages in three years:**
   - Harriet's age in three years:
     \[
     \text{Harriet's age in 3 years} = 21 + 3 = 24
     \]
   - Zack's age in three years:
     \[

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna, and then subtract the points scored by Naomi and Yuri from the total points.

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. So, Yuri's score is:
   \[
   \text{Yuri's score} = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44
   \]
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna's score is:
   \[
   \text{Brianna's score} = 68 + 17 = 85
   \]

Now, we can calculate the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[
\text{Total points by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna} = 68 + 44 + 85 = 197

"First, let's calculate the total number of cards James has after the changes:

- Initial fire type cards: 30
- Initial grass type cards: 20
- Initial water type cards: 40

After losing 8 water type cards:
- Water type cards left: 40 - 8 = 32

After buying 14 new grass type cards:
- Grass type cards now: 20 + 14 = 34

Now, the total number of cards James has is:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 34
- Water type: 32

Total number of cards = 30 + 34 + 32 = 96

The number of water type cards left is 32. To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 = \frac{1}{3} \times 100 \approx 33.33\% \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33%.

- Base burrito: $6.50
- Extra meat: $2.00
- Extra cheese: $1.00
- Avocado: $1.00
- 2 sauces at $0.25 each: $0.25 * 2 = $0.50

Now, let's add these costs together:

$6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $11.00

Next, we add the extra $3.00 for chips and a drink:

"First, let's determine how many pieces Kalinda and her mom can place together per minute.

Kalinda places 4 pieces per minute.
Her mom places half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

Together, they can place \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces per minute.

The puzzle has 360 pieces. To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can place together per minute:

\[ \text{Time in minutes} = \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

\[ \text{Time in hours} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

1"
"First, let's determine how many watermelons were ready for harvest after the first two months. Since 30% of the 120 watermelons were ready, we calculate:

\[ 120 \times 0.30 = 36 \]

So, Ashlyn took home 36 watermelons. This means the number of watermelons remaining after she took home the first batch is:

\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest two weeks later. Since 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready, we calculate:

\[ 84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 63 \]

This means 63 watermelons were ready for harvest two weeks later. Therefore, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:

\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 21 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the cars before tax and registration fees. Each car costs $20,000, and Mark buys 12 cars.

\[ \text{Total cost of cars} = 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000 \]

Next, we calculate the tax on the cars. The tax rate is 10%.

\[ \text{Tax on cars} = 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000 \]

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of the cars to get the total cost before registration fees.

\[ \text{Total cost before registration} = 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000 \]

Then, we calculate the registration fees. Each car has a registration fee of $1,000, and Mark has 12 cars.

\[ \text{Total registration fees} = 12 \times 1,000 = 12,000 \]

Finally, we add the total registration fees to the total cost before registration fees to get the final amount Mark pays.

\[ \text{Total amount paid} = 264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 276,000 \]"
"On Monday, Robert collects 20 shells. Since Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, Kylie collects 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.

The final numerical answer is 50."
"If there were 50 ants and half as many bugs as ants, then the number of bugs is:

\[ \text{Number of bugs} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

To find the total number of insects in the garden, we add the number of ants and the number of bugs:

\[ \text{Total number of insects} = \text{Number of ants} + \text{Number of bugs} = 50 + 25 = 75 \]

So, the total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many penguins are left after some of them have moved from the snow to the ocean and the cave.

1. First, we calculate one-third of the total penguins:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
   \]
   So, 12 penguins jump into the ocean.

2. Next, we calculate another one-third of the total penguins:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
   \]
   So, 12 penguins go into the cave.

3. To find out how many penguins are left sunbathing, we subtract the number of penguins that moved from the total number of penguins:
   \[
   36 - 12 - 12 = 12
   \]

Therefore, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is 12."
"To determine how many vines Steve needs, we first need to calculate how many cherry tomatoes he eats per week.

Steve eats 6 cherry tomatoes per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the number of tomatoes he eats in a week is:
\[ 6 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ tomatoes/week} \]

Next, we need to determine how many tomatoes one vine can produce in a week. According to the information given, a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week.

To find out how many vines are needed to produce 42 tomatoes per week, we divide the total number of tomatoes Steve eats per week by the number of tomatoes one vine can produce per week:
\[ \frac{42 \text{ tomatoes/week}}{3 \text{ tomatoes/vine/week}} = 14 \text{ vines} \]

Therefore, Steve needs 14 vines to produce enough tomatoes for his weekly consumption. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we first need to calculate the total number of pizza slices required.

John has 20 friends, and each friend will have 4 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices needed is:
\[ 20 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many pizzas are required to provide these 80 slices. Each pizza is sliced into 8 portions.

To find the number of pizzas needed, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 10 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the process Ram uses to make new pens from the empty ones. Ram can make one full pen by mixing the ink from five empty pens. This means that for every five empty pens, he gets one new full pen.

Ram initially buys 25 pens. Since he can make one new pen from five empty pens, we can determine how many new pens he can make from the 25 empty pens he has:

\[ \text{Number of new pens} = \frac{25}{5} = 5 \]

After making these 5 new pens, Ram will have used up 25 empty pens, and he will have 5 new full pens. Now, he has 5 new full pens, and he can continue the process of making new pens from the empty ones. However, since he only has 5 empty pens now, he can only make one more pen from these 5 empty pens:

\[ \text{Number of additional new pens} = \frac{5}{5} = 1 \]

So, after making the additional pen, Ram will have:

\[ 5 + 1 = 6 \]

Therefore, the total number of pens Ram gets to have is:

\[ 25 \text{ (initial pens)} + 6 \text{ (new pens)} = 31 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 31 \]"

2. Joan is five years older than Jessa. Therefore, Joan's age is:
   \[
   20 + 5 = 25 \text{ years}
   \]
3. Mary is two years younger than Joan. Therefore, Mary's age is:
   \[
   25 - 2 = 23 \text{ years}

The sum of the ages of the three girls is \(\boxed{68}\)."
"First, let's calculate the number of students who went out through exit A. Since 30% of the students went out through exit A, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Students through exit A} = 1000 \times 0.30 = 300 \]

After students have left through exit A, the remaining number of students is:

\[ \text{Remaining students} = 1000 - 300 = 700 \]

Next, we calculate the number of students who went out through exit B. According to the problem, 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B:

\[ \text{Students through exit B} = 700 \times \frac{3}{5} = 420 \]

The number of students who went out through exit C is the rest of the students after those who went through exits A and B have left. Therefore, we subtract the number of students who went through exits A and B from the total number of students:

\[ \text{Students through exit C} = 700 - 420 = 280 \]

So, the number of students who went out through exit C is:

\[ \text{Final answer: } 280 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's start by determining how many candies Robert has. We know that John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find out how many candies Robert has:

\[ \text{John's candies} = 2 \times \text{Robert's candies} \]
\[ 54 = 2 \times \text{Robert's candies} \]
\[ \text{Robert's candies} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Now that we know Robert has 27 candies, we can determine how many candies James has. We know that James has 6 more candies than Robert:

\[ \text{James's candies} = \text{Robert's candies} + 6 \]
\[ \text{James's candies} = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Next, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's candies} - \text{James's candies} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

So, John has 21 more candies than James. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of pen pals Mike has left after stopping being pen pals with 2 of them. Initially, he had 5 pen pals, so after stopping being pen pals with 2, he has:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals} \]

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each pen pal sends:

\[ 2 \text{ letters/week} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 10 \text{ pages/week} \]

Since there are 3 pen pals, the total number of pages sent by all pen pals in a week is:

\[ 3 \text{ pen pals} \times 10 \text{ pages/pen pal/week} = 30 \text{ pages/week} \]

Mike responds in kind, so he also writes 30 pages a week. He can write a page every 6 minutes, so the total time he spends writing in minutes is:

\[ 30 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 180 \text{ minutes/week} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 3 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"To determine how many minutes Jason has left on his phone plan, we need to calculate the total minutes he has used and subtract that from his plan's total minutes.

First, calculate the total minutes Jason has used:
- Jason uses 15 minutes per day for his boss.
- There are 30 days in the month.

So, the total minutes used for his boss calls is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Additionally, Jason has used 300 extra minutes for other people.

Therefore, the total minutes used in the month is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin initially had 24 fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin had \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Now Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, so Colby took \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. Now Griffin has \(9 - 2 = 7\) fries left.
5. After receiving fries from Ginger, Griffin had 27 fries. So, the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin is \(27 - 7 = 20\).

Therefore, the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin is 20."
"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( F \).

Given:
- There are 4 snails in the first aquarium.
- There are 32 snails in the second aquarium.
- The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in both aquariums.
- Both aquariums have the same number of fish.

First, calculate the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums:
\[ \text{Difference in snails} = 32 - 4 = 28 \]

According to the problem, this difference is twice the number of fish in both aquariums:
\[ 28 = 2 \times (2F) \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]

Now, solve for \( F \):
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} = 7 \]

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist works for the movie:

- She works 6 hours each day.
- She needs the makeup done 4 times a week.
- The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.

Total hours worked = 6 hours/day * 4 days/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours.

Next, let's calculate the total cost before the discount:

- The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.
- She worked 120 hours.

Total cost before discount = 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000.

Now, let's calculate the discount:

- She gives a 10% discount.

Discount amount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.10 * $30,000 = $3,000.

Finally, let's calculate the total cost after the discount:

Total cost after discount = Total cost before discount - Discount amount = $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000.

So, Jean paid $27,000."

"First, we need to determine the total length of the redwood tree in feet, which is given as 200 feet.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before any damage. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can find the total weight by dividing the total length of the tree by the length of each section and then multiplying by the weight per section.

\[
\text{Total weight before damage} = \left(\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}}\right) \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 20 \times 400 = 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to account for the damage caused by the termites. The termites ate 30% of the tree's wood, which means 70% of the tree remains. We calculate the remaining weight as follows:

\[
\text{Remaining weight} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70 = 5600 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the final weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten is:

"Let's denote the number of apples Jamal has as \( J_a \) and the number of bananas Jamal has as \( J_b \).

From the information given:
1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, so if Andrea has 52 apples, then Jamal has \( 52 - 8 = 44 \) apples.
2. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so \( J_b = J_a + 4 \).
3. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so if Jamal has \( J_b \) bananas, then Andrea has \( \frac{J_b}{2} \) bananas. Since Andrea has 52 apples, we can use this to find the number of bananas Jamal has.

First, let's find the number of bananas Jamal has:
\[ J_b = J_a + 4 = 44 + 4 = 48 \]

Now, let's find the number of bananas Andrea has:

"To determine the total amount of flour Carla will need, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she is making and then determine the total amount of flour required based on the given ratio.

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, which totals to:
\[ 36 + 30 = 66 \text{ cookies} \]

We know that 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies. To find out how many cups of flour are needed for 66 cookies, we can set up a proportion based on the given ratio:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{66 \text{ cookies}} \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 66 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} \]
\[ x = \frac{132}{12} \]
\[ x = 11 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow."
"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we first need to calculate how many pennies are in two thirds of the total pennies.

Given that there are 9,300 pennies in the cup, we calculate two thirds of 9,300 as follows:

\[
\text{Number of pennies in the stack} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9300

"First, let's determine the number of trees each person has.

Chris has 6 trees.

Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, so:
\[ \text{Number of trees Ferdinand has} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has, so:
\[ \text{Number of trees Harry has} = 2 \times 3 + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11 \]

Now, to find out how many more trees are in Harry's yard than Ferdinand's yard, we subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has:
\[ \text{Difference} = 11 - 3 = 8 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"First, let's determine how much money each girl has:

- Carmen has $100.
- Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125.
- Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has $125 + $50 = $175.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money all three girls have combined:

- Carmen: $100
- Samantha: $125
- Daisy: $175

Total = $100 + $125 + $175 = $400

The final numerical answer is 400."
"First, let's calculate the total price of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

The selling price of the house is $350,000.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price:
\[ \text{Brokerage Fee} = 350,000 \times 0.05 = 17,500 \]

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price:
\[ \text{Transfer Fee} = 350,000 \times 0.12 = 42,000 \]

Now, let's calculate the total price of the house including both fees:
\[ \text{Total Price} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500 \]

Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. To find out how much more the total price of the house is than her budget, we subtract her budget from the total price:
\[ \text{Difference} = 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500 \]

So, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget."
"First, let's calculate the transfer fees. The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Transfer Fees} = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000 \]

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee. The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000 \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount paid for the transfer fees and the brokerage fee.

\[ \text{Total Fees} = 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000 \]

Mr. Tan also paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount of the house. To find the net proceeds, we subtract the total fees and the loan amount from the selling price.

\[ \text{Net Proceeds} = 400,000 - 32,000 - 250,000 = 118,000 \]

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is $118,000."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes for the oil to heat up to 400 degrees. We know it takes 20 minutes to heat the oil to 300 degrees, and it then takes 40% longer to heat it to 400 degrees.

40% of 20 minutes is:
\[ 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the additional time needed to heat the oil to 400 degrees is 8 minutes. Therefore, the total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that it takes 5 minutes less time to cook the chicken than it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees. So, the cooking time is:
\[ 28 - 5 = 23 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees and the time it took to cook the chicken:
\[ 28 + 23 = 51 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken is:
\[ 51 \text{ minutes} \]"
"To calculate the total amount spent by the real estate agent on buying all the ads, we need to calculate the cost for the newspaper ads and the television ads separately, and then sum them up.

For the newspaper ads:
Cost per newspaper ad = $5
Number of newspaper ads = 50
Total cost for newspaper ads = $5 * 50 = $250

For the television ads:
Cost per television ad = $75
Number of television ads = 15
Total cost for television ads = $75 * 15 = $1125

Now, we add the total costs for both types of ads:
Total cost = Total cost for newspaper ads + Total cost for television ads
Total cost = $250 + $1125 = $1375

The real estate agent spent $1375 on buying all the ads."

"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and then sum them up.

1. The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
2. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has \(300 + 12 = 312\) M&Ms.
3. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, so it has \(300 / 2 = 150\) M&Ms.

Now, we sum the M&Ms from all three bags:
\[ 300 + 312 + 150 = 762 \]

So, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"To determine the total number of windows in John's houses, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum the results.

1. **Windows in Bedrooms:**
   - Each house has 3 bedrooms.
   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.
   - Therefore, the number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is \(3 \text{ bedrooms} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows}\).
   - Since John has 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms of both houses is \(6 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 12 \text{ windows}\).

2. **Additional Windows:**
   - Each house has an additional 4 windows not connected to bedrooms.
   - Therefore, the total number of additional windows in one house is 4.
   - For both houses, the total number of additional windows is \(4 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 8 \text{ windows}\).

3. **Total Windows:**
   - Adding the windows from the bedrooms and the additional windows gives us the total number of windows.
   - Total windows = windows in bedrooms + additional windows = \(12 + 8 = 20\).

Thus, the total number of windows between the houses is 20."
"To find out the change the cashier gives back, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items the mother bought. The items and their respective costs are:

- Cocoa: $4.20
- Laundry: $9.45
- Pasta: $1.35

The total cost is the sum of these amounts:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 4.20 + 9.45 + 1.35 \]

Let's calculate the total cost:

\[ 4.20 + 9.45 = 13.65 \]
\[ 13.65 + 1.35 = 15.00 \]

So, the total cost of the items is $15.00. The mother pays with $20.00. The change she should receive is:

\[ \text{Change} = 20.00 - 15.00 = 5.00 \]

Therefore, the change the cashier gives back is $5.00."
"First, let's determine the number of stitches for each part of the sweater:

- The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
- The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body, which is \( \frac{900}{10} = 90 \) stitches.
- The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is \( 2 \times 90 = 180 \) stitches.

Now, let's add up the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette:
\[ 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 \]

The total number of stitches for the whole sweater is 1800. Therefore, the number of stitches for the two sleeves combined is:
\[ 1800 - 1170 = 630 \]

Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches for each sleeve is:
\[ \frac{630}{2} = 315 \]

So, each sleeve takes 315 stitches. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 315 \]"
"To calculate the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the cost for the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately, and then add them together.

"First, let's calculate the number of lines Sean has to memorize for each part of his role.

1. **Solo Song:**
   - The solo song has 54 lines.
   - Sean has to memorize all 54 lines of the solo song.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song.
   - Number of lines in the first scene = 2 * 54 = 108 lines.
   - Sean has to memorize a third of the lines in the first scene.
   - Number of lines Sean has to memorize in the first scene = 1/3 * 108 = 36 lines.

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the solo song.
   - Number of lines in the second scene = 54 + 6 = 60 lines.
   - Sean has to memorize four-fifths of the lines in the second scene.
   - Number of lines Sean has to memorize in the second scene = 4/5 * 60 = 48 lines.

Now, let's sum up the total number of lines Sean has to memorize:

- Solo song: 54 lines
- First scene: 36 lines
- Second scene: 48 lines

Total lines Sean has to memorize = 54 + 36 + 48 = 138 lines.

"First, let's determine how many cards had the letter A on them. Since 2/5 of the cards had the letter A, we calculate:

\[ \text{Cards with letter A} = \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \]

Next, we find out how many cards remained after removing the cards with the letter A:

\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 80 - 32 = 48 \]

Then, we calculate how many of these remaining cards had the letter B on them. Since 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B, we have:

\[ \text{Cards with letter B} = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]

Now, we find out how many cards remained after removing the cards with the letter B:

\[ \text{Remaining cards after B} = 48 - 24 = 24 \]

Next, we calculate how many of these remaining cards had the letter C on them. Since 5/8 of the remaining cards had the letter C, we have:

\[ \text{Cards with letter C} = \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \]

Finally, we find out how many cards had the letter D on them. This is the number of cards remaining after removing the cards with the letters A, B, and C:

\[ \text{Cards with letter D} = 24 - 15 = 9 \]

So, the number of cards that had the letter D on them is 9."
"To calculate the total time Matthew will take to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we need to calculate the time for each type of hole separately and then sum them up.

For the small holes:
- Time to dig one small hole = 3 minutes
- Number of small holes = 30
- Total time for small holes = 3 minutes/hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes

For the large holes:
- Time to dig one large hole = 10 minutes
- Number of large holes = 15
- Total time for large holes = 10 minutes/hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes

Now, we add the total time for both types of holes:
- Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert the total time from minutes to hours:
- Total time in hours = 240 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours

The final numerical answer is 4 hours."
"If the sum of Mico and Marco's current ages is 20, then in 10 years, their ages will each increase by 10 years. Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

\[ 20 + 10 + 10 = 40 \]

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40."
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, which translates to \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. This can be written as \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

First, we substitute the expression for \( R \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Next, we expand and simplify the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old. To verify, we can calculate Ruby's current age:
\[ R = 6S = 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

In 9 years, Sam will be \( 6 + 9 = 15 \) years old, and Ruby will be \( 36 + 9 = 45 \) years old. Checking the condition that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
\[ 45 = 3 \times 15 \]
This is true, confirming our solution.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of spots a mamba has. Since a cobra has 70 spots and a mamba has half as many spots as a cobra, a mamba has:

\[ \text{Spots per mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and all the mambas. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, so the total number of spots for the cobras is:

\[ \text{Total spots for cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots, so the total number of spots for the mambas is:

\[ \text{Total spots for mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Now, we find the combined total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas:

\[ \text{Total spots combined} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of the total number of spots:

\[ \text{Half the total spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot altogether, we need to calculate the number of stories each wrote in both weeks and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of stories each wrote in the second week:
- Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week and doubled that in the second week, so she wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories in the second week.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week and doubled that in the second week, so he wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories in the second week.
- Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week and doubled that in the second week, so she wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories in the second week.

Next, we sum up the total number of stories written by each of them over the two weeks:
- Alani wrote \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories in total.
- Braylen wrote \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories in total.
- Margot wrote \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories in total.

"To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we first need to calculate the total number of stars accounted for by the rows of 8 and 6 stars, and then subtract that from the total number of stars on the flag.

The total number of stars on the flag is 76. There are three rows of 8 stars and two rows of 6 stars. Let's calculate the number of stars in these rows:

- Three rows of 8 stars: \(3 \times 8 = 24\)
- Two rows of 6 stars: \(2 \times 6 = 12\)

Adding these together gives the number of stars in the rows of 8 and 6 stars:

\[24 + 12 = 36\]

Now, we subtract the number of stars in the rows of 8 and 6 stars from the total number of stars on the flag to find the number of stars in the rows of 5 stars:

\[76 - 36 = 40\]

Since each row of 5 stars contains 5 stars, we divide the number of stars in the rows of 5 stars by 5 to find the number of rows:

\[40 \div 5 = 8\]

Therefore, the number of rows of 5 stars is 8."
"First, we need to calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so:

Next, we need to determine how many trucks are required to transport 6000 pounds, given that each truck can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds. We do this by dividing the total weight by the capacity of one truck:

\[ \frac{6000 \text{ pounds}}{2000 \text{ pounds/truck}} = 3 \text{ trucks} \]

Therefore, the number of trucks needed is 3."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, the speed of the car in the slow lane is:

\[ \text{Speed of slow lane car} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it took the car in the fast lane to travel 480 miles. The time taken can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the fast lane:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{fast lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Since the car in the slow lane traveled the same distance (480 miles) but at a different speed (30 miles/hour), we can calculate the time it took for the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance using the same formula:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{slow lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

\[ 16 \text{ hours} \]"
"To find out how many medals have been given out for counting, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of medals Izzy has.
2. Calculate the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together.
3. Use the information that this total is 10 times less than the number of medals given out to find the total number of medals given out.

First, let's find out how many medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, we can calculate:

\[ \text{Medals Izzy has} = 22 - 5 = 17 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:

\[ \text{Total medals Ali and Izzy have} = 22 + 17 = 39 \]

According to the problem, this total (39 medals) is 10 times less than the number of medals given out. This means that the number of medals given out is 10 times the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have:

\[ \text{Total medals given out} = 39 \times 10 = 390 \]

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 390."
"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available:

- Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars.
- There are 8 packets.

So, the total number of chocolate bars is:

Next, let's determine how many chocolate bars the adults will get:

- There are 4 adults.
- Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars.

So, the total number of chocolate bars for the adults is:
\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars/adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, we can find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children:

\[ 40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

There are 8 children, and we need to distribute the remaining 16 chocolate bars equally among them:

\[ \frac{16 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars/child} \]

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars."
"Susan works for a total of 3 hours (from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m.), which is equivalent to 180 minutes. She pauses for half an hour, which is 30 minutes, so she actually works for 150 minutes.

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we can calculate her earnings as follows:

\[ \text{Earnings per minute} = \frac{5}{10} = 0.5 \, \text{dollars per minute} \]

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 150 \times 0.5 = 75 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 75."
"First, let's determine the initial points for each player:

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Next, we check if any of the players get an extra point in the fourth round. The extra point is given to players who have over 20 points.

- Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point.
- Jim has 18 points, so he does not get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point.

Now, we add the extra points to their initial points:

- Mike's new total is \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
- Jim's total remains \(18\) points.
- Tony's new total is \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

Finally, we calculate the total points for all three players:

First, let's calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day by the household. There are 5 members, and each consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since they eat rice at lunch and dinner, each person consumes 0.4 kg of rice per day.

\[ \text{Daily consumption per person} = 0.2 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 0.4 \, \text{kg/day} \]

\[ \text{Total daily consumption for 5 people} = 0.4 \, \text{kg/day/person} \times 5 \, \text{people} = 2 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week. There are 7 days in a week.

\[ \text{Weekly consumption} = 2 \, \text{kg/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 14 \, \text{kg/week} \]

Finally, we determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{14 \, \text{kg/week}} = 3 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target.

First, let's calculate the total crates sold:
- He was closed on Monday and Friday, so he didn't sell any crates on those days.
- He sold 20 crates over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday).
- He sold 15 crates on Tuesday.
- He sold 12 crates on Wednesday.
- He sold 18 crates on Thursday.

Adding these together:
\[ 20 \text{ (weekend)} + 15 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 12 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 18 \text{ (Thursday)} = 65 \text{ crates} \]

Sam's target was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off by, we subtract the crates he sold from his target:
\[ 120 - 65 = 55 \]

So, Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 55 \]"
"To determine the total cost of the antique desk to Carmen, we need to calculate the bids she placed and the bids placed by the other bidders.

Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so she bids 3 times. Each of her bids increases by $50. Therefore, her bids are:
1. First bid: $200
2. Second bid: $200 + $50 = $250
3. Third bid: $250 + $50 = $300

The other 3 bidders each bid once, and since they bid in sequence, their bids are:
1. First bidder: $200
2. Second bidder: $200 + $50 = $250
3. Third bidder: $250 + $50 = $300

Carmen wins with her third bid of $300. To find out how much she spent, we sum up all her bids:
\[ 200 + 250 + 300 = 750 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 750 \]"
"To calculate the total amount John pays for driving a year, we need to consider the cost of miles driven and the monthly bonus, then scale it up to a yearly amount.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven in a year:
- Distance to work one way: 30 miles
- Round trip distance: 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles
- Miles driven per day: 60 miles
- Days per week: 5 days
- Weeks per year: 50 weeks
- Total miles driven per year: 60 miles/day * 5 days/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles

Next, let's calculate the cost of the miles driven:
- Cost per mile: $2
- Total cost for miles driven: 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000

Now, let's calculate the total bonus paid in a year:
- Bonus per month: $150
- Months per year: 12 months
- Total bonus per year: $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800

Finally, let's calculate the total amount paid in a year:
- Total cost for miles driven: $30,000
- Total bonus paid per year: $1,800
- Total amount paid per year: $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800

The final numerical answer is $31,800."

"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the folding process. When a piece of paper is folded vertically, it creates two pages on each side of the fold. This means that each piece of paper can be used to print two pages.

Given that the tabloid is 32 pages long, we can calculate the number of pieces of paper required as follows:

1. Each piece of paper can print 2 pages.
2. For 32 pages, the number of pieces of paper needed is \( \frac{32}{2} = 16 \).

Therefore, the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid is 16."
"Annika spent half of $50 on food and snacks, which is $50 / 2 = $25. After spending $25 on food and snacks, she had $50 - $25 = $25 left. She then spent an additional $10 on rides. Therefore, the amount left after spending on rides is $25 - $10 = $15.

The final numerical answer is 15."
"To determine the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of books sold in the first year:**
   - Elise sold 45 books this year.
   - She sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year.
   - Therefore, the number of books sold in the first year is \( 45 \times 2 = 90 \) books.

2. **Calculate the total number of books sold in the first two years:**
   - Total books sold in the first year: 90 books.
   - Total books sold in the current year: 45 books.
   - Total books sold in the first two years: \( 90 + 45 = 135 \) books.

3. **Determine the total number of books sold in the three years:**
   - Total books in the collection: 250 books.
   - Total books sold in the first two years: 135 books.
   - Total books sold in the three years: \( 250 - 50 = 200 \) books (since there are currently 50 unsold books).
   - Therefore, the number of books sold in the third year: \( 200 - 135 = 65 \) books.

4. **Calculate the total amount of money earned in the second year:**
   - Each book sells for $20.
   - Books sold in the second year: 45 books.
   - Total money earned in the second year: \( 45 \times 20 = 900 \) dollars.

Thus, the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is **900 dollars**."
"To determine how much money Watson made in April, we need to calculate his earnings from his hourly wage and his weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate Watson's daily earnings:
- Watson works 10 hours a day.
- He earns $10 per hour.

\[ \text{Daily earnings} = 10 \, \text{hours/day} \times 10 \, \text{\$/hour} = 100 \, \text{\$/day} \]

Next, let's calculate his weekly earnings:
- Watson works 5 days a week.
- He earns $100 per day.

\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 100 \, \text{\$/day} \times 5 \, \text{days/week} = 500 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Since Watson received a $300 bonus each week if the company performed well, his total weekly earnings when the company performed well are:

\[ \text{Total weekly earnings} = 500 \, \text{\$/week} + 300 \, \text{\$/week} = 800 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Now, we need to determine how many weeks are in April. April typically has 4 weeks.

\[ \text{Total earnings for April} = 800 \, \text{\$/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 3200 \, \text{\$} \]

Therefore, Watson made $3200 in April if the company performed very well for the whole month."
"John beats 80% of the 20 people he arm wrestles, which means he beats 16 people (since 20 * 0.8 = 16). Therefore, he loses to 4 people (since 20 - 16 = 4).

The final numerical answer is 4."
"First, let's determine how many loaves of bread are sold in the morning. Since two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning, we calculate:

\[
\text{Morning sales} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
\]

Next, we find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales:

\[
\text{Loaves left after morning} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
\]

In the afternoon and evening, half of the remaining loaves are sold equally. Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening combined is:

\[
\text{Afternoon and evening sales combined} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
\]

Since the loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[
\text{Afternoon sales} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ loaves}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
5

"First, we need to determine how much weight Joey loses in a single week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so the weight loss per week is:

\[ \text{Weight loss per week for Joey} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in 1 week, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds. Therefore, to lose the same amount of weight (2 pounds) that Joey loses in 1 week, Sandy will take:

\[ \text{Number of weeks for Sandy} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the savings on the ice cream. The original price of one tub of ice cream is $13, and it is now sold at $11. The discount per tub is:

\[ 13 - 11 = 2 \]

So, the savings on one tub of ice cream is $2. For two tubs of ice cream, the total savings would be:

\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \]

Next, let's calculate the savings on the milk. The discount on one packet of milk is $0.5. For four packets of milk, the total savings would be:

\[ 0.5 \times 4 = 2 \]

Now, we add the savings from the ice cream and the milk to find the total savings:

\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \]

So, the total amount saved if you buy 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine the number of new limbs Helena's serum will cause a person to grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and extra legs that grow based on the given growth rates.

The serum makes a person grow an extra arm every three days and an extra leg every five days.

First, let's calculate the number of extra arms:
- In fifteen days, the number of times an extra arm grows is the number of multiples of three within fifteen days.
- The multiples of three within fifteen days are 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15.
- Therefore, the number of extra arms grown is 5.

Next, let's calculate the number of extra legs:
- In fifteen days, the number of times an extra leg grows is the number of multiples of five within fifteen days.
- The multiples of five within fifteen days are 5 and 10.
- Therefore, the number of extra legs grown is 2.

Now, we add the number of extra arms and extra legs to find the total number of new limbs:
- Total new limbs = Number of extra arms + Number of extra legs
- Total new limbs = 5 + 2 = 7

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
6 business suits * $100 each = $600

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
3 suitcases * $50 each = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit:
5 * $100 (cost of one business suit) = $500
$700 more than $500 = $5700
So, the flight ticket costs $5700.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
Cost of business suits: $600
Cost of suitcases: $150
Cost of flight ticket: $5700
Total cost: $600 + $150 + $5700 = $6450

Theo wishes to save $2000 for the trip, so the amount he can spend is:
Total amount he has - Amount he wants to save = $6000 - $2000 = $4000

Finally, let's subtract the total cost of the items he has already bought from the amount he can spend:
Amount he can spend - Total cost of items = $4000 - $6450 = -$2450

Since the result is negative, it means Theo does not have enough money to cover all the expenses and save $2000. He needs an additional $2450 to cover everything. Therefore, he cannot spend any money on gifts for his business partners in South Africa with the current budget and expenses. The answer is $0."
"To determine the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum up the results.

First, let's identify the number of people in the family and their daily egg consumption:
- There are 5 people in the family.
- 3 people eat 3 eggs each day.
- The remaining 2 people eat 2 eggs each day.

Calculate the daily egg consumption for the 3 people who eat 3 eggs each:
\[ 3 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ eggs/person/day} = 9 \text{ eggs/day} \]

Calculate the daily egg consumption for the 2 people who eat 2 eggs each:
\[ 2 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ eggs/person/day} = 4 \text{ eggs/day} \]

Now, add the daily egg consumption of both groups to find the total daily egg consumption:
\[ 9 \text{ eggs/day} + 4 \text{ eggs/day} = 13 \text{ eggs/day} \]

Next, calculate the total weekly egg consumption by multiplying the daily consumption by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):
\[ 13 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 91 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Therefore, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week."
"If Quinn is 30 years old, and Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, then Jane is:

So, the final numerical answer is 32."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old six years ago.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since six years have passed, Noah is now \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Let the current population of Chile be \(P\).
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was \(P / 2\).

4. **Relate the population of Chile six years ago to Noah's age:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age.
   - Therefore, \(P / 2 = 3000 \times 20\).

5. **Calculate the current population of Chile:**
   - Solve for \(P\):
     \[
     P / 2 = 3000 \times 20
     \]
     \[
     P / 2 = 60000
     \]
     \[
     P = 60000 \times 2
     \]
     \[
     P = 120000
     \]

The population of Chile now is \(\boxed{120000}\)."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so it is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players in the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve for \( D \), we first combine the terms on the left side of the equation:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 3D + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{6D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{7D}{2} \]

So the equation becomes:
\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

To isolate \( D \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Then we divide both sides by 7:
\[ D = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 30 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha initially invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we account for the people who couldn't come due to illness. This number is 8.

Then, we account for the people who couldn't come due to previous commitments. This number is \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the number of people who couldn't come due to illness, which is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \).

Therefore, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Finally, the number of people who show up for the party is the total number of people invited minus the number who couldn't come: \(24 - 10 = 14\).

The final numerical answer is 14."
"First, let's determine the number of marbles Solomon received from his father. Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna. His father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Therefore, the number of marbles Solomon received from his father is:

"First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Height (or depth) = 5 feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 5 = 120 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is given as $0.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = V \times \text{cost per cubic foot} \]
\[ C = 120 \times 0.1 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The number of girls is 3 times the number of boys.
2. The number of nongendered children is 1/10 the number of boys.
3. The classroom has 30 boys.

First, calculate the number of girls:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 3 \times \text{Number of boys} = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

Next, calculate the number of nongendered children:
\[ \text{Number of nongendered children} = \frac{1}{10} \times \text{Number of boys} = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3 \]

Now, add up all the children in the classroom:
\[ \text{Total number of children} = \text{Number of boys} + \text{Number of girls} + \text{Number of nongendered children} \]
\[ \text{Total number of children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 \]

"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and there are 45 electric wires, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles.

Let \( P \) be the number of electric poles and \( W \) be the number of electric wires. According to the ratio, we have:
\[ \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Given \( W = 45 \), we can substitute this value into the proportion:
\[ \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \]

To find \( P \), we solve the equation:
\[ P = \frac{45}{3} \]
\[ P = 15 \]

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

\[

"At the beginning, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 25 + 15 = 40 people.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left, which means 1/4 * 40 = 10 people left.

If 22 men stayed at the party, this means that 22 - 10 = 12 men left the party.

Since 12 men left, the number of women who left is 10 - 12 = -2, which is not possible. This indicates an inconsistency in the problem statement because the number of women who left cannot be negative. However, based on the given information, we can calculate the number of women who stayed.

Since 10 people in total left, and 22 men stayed, the number of women who stayed is 10 - (22 - 25) = 10 - (-3) = 10 + 3 = 13 women.

Therefore, the number of women left at the party is 13."
"First, we need to determine the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book and the book costs $4, we can calculate the cost of the magazine as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of magazine} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cost of book} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of the pen, which is $1 less than the cost of the magazine. Therefore:

\[ \text{Cost of pen} = \text{Cost of magazine} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 \]

So, the cost of the pen is $1."
"First, let's determine the total number of pencils Jam has. We know that Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. Let's denote the number of pencils in each box as \( x \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation step by step:

\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]
\[ 3x = 26 - 2 \]
\[ 3x = 24 \]
\[ x = \frac{24}{3} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, each box contains 8 pencils. Now, we can calculate the total number of pencils Jam has:

\[ 3 \times 8 + 2 = 24 + 2 = 26 \]

Jam has 26 pencils. Meg has 46 pencils. To find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Now, we need to determine how many boxes are needed to store 72 pencils. Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 9 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the weakening of the coffee due to the cooling and the addition of cream.

First, let's determine how many ice cubes are used to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we can calculate the number of ice cubes used as follows:

\[ \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \]

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, the total weakening due to the ice cubes is:

\[ \text{Total weakening due to ice cubes} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters} \]

Next, we need to consider the weakening due to the addition of cream. The problem states that any added liquid weakens the coffee. Since Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, this adds an additional weakening of 15 milliliters to the coffee.

Therefore, the total weakening of the coffee is the sum of the weakening due to the ice cubes and the weakening due to the cream:

\[ \text{Total weakening} = 60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters} \]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 75 \]"
"If 5 people leave with 7 new records between them, and each person can trade 2 old records for 1 new record, then the total number of new records traded is 7. Since each new record traded comes from 2 old records, the total number of old records brought in is \(7 \times 2 = 14\).

The final numerical answer is 14."
"First, let's determine the number of junior and senior programmers.

Given that the total number of employees is 100 and the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:
\[ \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers is:
\[ \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Next, we know that each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total amount paid to junior programmers per month is:
\[ \text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

The senior programmers are paid $400 more than the junior programmers, so each senior programmer is paid:
\[ \text{Payment to each senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400 \]

Therefore, the total amount paid to senior programmers per month is:
\[ \text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

Finally, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers:
\[ \text{Total payment to all programmers} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 224000 \]"
"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the number of people on the bus becomes \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on, so the number of people on the bus becomes \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).

We are given that at the third stop, there were 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

2. He eats 2 on his way to school: \(24 - 2 = 22\) lollipops.
3. He passes 14 lollipops to his friends: \(22 - 14 = 8\) lollipops.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which means he buys \(2 \times 14 = 28\) lollipops: \(8 + 28 = 36\) lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night: \(36 - 3 = 33\) lollipops.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning: \(33 - 2 = 31\) lollipops.

So, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is 31."
"The phone is currently at 60% charged and needs to reach 100% charge. The recharging rate is 1 percentage point per 3 minutes. To find out how many percentage points are needed to fully charge the phone, we subtract the current charge from 100%:

100% - 60% = 40%

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, it will take:

40% * 3 minutes/percentage point = 120 minutes to fully charge the phone.

To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60:

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 17 - 3 = 14 \text{ lollipops} \]

The final numerical answer is 14."
"To determine the final amount the customer paid, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip.
2. Apply the rewards to the current shopping trip.
3. Apply the coupon to the discounted price.

**Step 1: Calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip.**

The customer earns $1 off for every $20 spent. They spent $80, so the rewards earned are:
\[ \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ rewards} \]

**Step 2: Apply the rewards to the current shopping trip.**

The customer used their rewards, so the price of the current shopping trip is reduced by $4:
\[ 43 - 4 = 39 \]

**Step 3: Apply the coupon to the discounted price.**

The coupon takes twice the amount of rewards off the price. Since the rewards are $4, the coupon takes off:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the coupon amount from the discounted price:
\[ 39 - 8 = 31 \]

Therefore, the customer paid:
\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"First, let's calculate the net pay for Job A.

Job A:
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours per year: 2000
- Total annual income before tax: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- State tax rate: 20%
- State tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net pay for Job A: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Next, let's calculate the net pay for Job B.

Job B:
- Annual income before tax: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax rate on net income: 10%
- Tax on net income: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay for Job B: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, let's find the difference in net pay between the two jobs.

Difference in net pay: $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate compared to the other job."
"To find the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of ruined castles:
   - 40 percent of 220 castles are ruined.
   - Number of ruined castles = 40% of 220 = 0.40 * 220 = 88 castles.

2. Calculate the number of unmanned ruined castles:

   - Number of unmanned ruined castles = 50% of 88 = 0.50 * 88 = 44 castles.

Therefore, the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland is 44."
"First, let's calculate the total cost for each offer.

For Furniture United:
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 installments of $350 each

Total cost for Furniture United = Advance payment + (Number of installments * Monthly installment amount)
Total cost for Furniture United = $1,350 + (6 * $350)
Total cost for Furniture United = $1,350 + $2,100
Total cost for Furniture United = $3,450

For Cozy Homes:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 installments of $250 each

Total cost for Cozy Homes = Advance payment + (Number of installments * Monthly installment amount)
Total cost for Cozy Homes = $1,100 + (9 * $250)
Total cost for Cozy Homes = $1,100 + $2,250
Total cost for Cozy Homes = $3,350

Now, let's find the cost difference between the two offers.

Cost difference = Total cost for Furniture United - Total cost for Cozy Homes
Cost difference = $3,450 - $3,350
Cost difference = $100

The cost difference between the two offers is $100."
"First, we need to find the total number of paintball guns that Nick, Richard, Jason (DJ), and RJ have combined.

- DJ has 8 guns.
- Nick has 10 guns.
- RJ has 1 gun.
- Richard has 5 guns.

Adding these together:

\[ 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24 \]

So, they have a total of 24 paintball guns.

To find out how many guns each person would have if they shared them equally, we divide the total number of guns by the number of people, which is 4.

\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \]

Therefore, if they share the guns equally, each person would have 6 guns."
"To determine the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we can break down the problem into two parts: the sugar needed for the suckers and the sugar needed for the fudge.

First, calculate the sugar needed for the suckers:
- Each batch of suckers requires 30 ounces of sugar.
- Mason needs to make 8 batches of suckers.
- Therefore, the total sugar needed for the suckers is \( 30 \text{ ounces/batch} \times 8 \text{ batches} = 240 \text{ ounces} \).

Next, calculate the sugar needed for the fudge:
- Each batch of fudge requires 70 ounces of sugar.
- Mason needs to make 1 batch of fudge.
- Therefore, the total sugar needed for the fudge is \( 70 \text{ ounces/batch} \times 1 \text{ batch} = 70 \text{ ounces} \).

Now, add the sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge to find the total amount of sugar Mason needs:
- Total sugar needed = sugar for suckers + sugar for fudge
- Total sugar needed = 240 ounces + 70 ounces = 310 ounces.

The final numerical answer is 310 ounces."
"To find the final value of all Maria's shares, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the initial value of all shares.
2. Calculate the value of the shares after the first year's increase.
3. Calculate the value of the shares after the second year's decrease.

**Step 1: Initial Value of All Shares**

Maria buys 8 shares at $8 each.
\[ \text{Initial Value} = 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8/\text{share} = \$64 \]

**Step 2: Value After the First Year's Increase**

The stock price increases by 50%.
\[ \text{Increase} = 50\% \times \$64 = 0.50 \times \$64 = \$32 \]
\[ \text{Value After First Year} = \$64 + \$32 = \$96 \]

**Step 3: Value After the Second Year's Decrease**

The stock price decreases by 25%.
\[ \text{Decrease} = 25\% \times \$96 = 0.25 \times \$96 = \$24 \]
\[ \text{Value After Second Year} = \$96 - \$24 = \$72 \]

The final value of all Maria's shares is:
\[ \$72 \]

"First, let's determine how many hot dogs Thomas ate. Since Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, we can calculate the number of hot dogs Thomas ate as follows:

\[ \text{Thomas's hot dogs} = 3 \times \text{Luke's hot dogs} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Next, we need to find out how many hot dogs John ate. John ate half the amount that Thomas ate, so:

\[ \text{John's hot dogs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Thomas's hot dogs} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \]

Now, to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's hot dogs} - \text{Luke's hot dogs} = 3 - 2 = 1 \]

So, John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The number of students in the smallest group would then be \( x - 10 \).

Given that the total number of students is 200, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two equal groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60."
"Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \) and the number of chickens as \( H \). According to the problem, the total number of animals is 60, and there are twice as many chickens as cows. This gives us the following equations:

\[ H + C = 60 \]
\[ H = 2C \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( C \):

\[ 2C + C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:

\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each:

\[ \text{Total legs} = (4 \times C) + (2 \times H) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = (4 \times 20) + (2 \times 40) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 80 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 160 \]

So, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is 160."
"Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week. After 4 weeks, he would have added \(4 \times 1 = 4\) balls. So, he would have started juggling with \(3 + 4 = 7\) balls. However, when he slips and drops 3 balls, he loses 1 ball and has 2 balls caught by the crowd. Therefore, the number of balls Josh has left to juggle is \(7 - 3 + 2 = 6\).

"To solve this problem, let's first establish the weights of each animal based on the given information:

1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. A pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, so a blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
3. A pink frog weighs the same as a green toad, so a green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
4. A pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, so a yellow snake weighs \(50 + 10 = 60\) pounds.
5. A pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than a red bird, so a red bird weighs \(50 - 20 = 30\) pounds.

Now, let's calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, including the container itself:

- Weight of one pink frog: 50 pounds
- Weight of one blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Weight of one green toad: 50 pounds
- Weight of one yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Weight of one red bird: 30 pounds
- Weight of the container: 20 pounds

Adding these weights together:

\[ 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 \]

So, the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is 260 pounds."

"First, let's calculate the daily revenue from tractors:
- They sold 10 tractors a day.
- Each tractor was sold for $100.

So, the daily revenue from tractors is:
\[ 10 \text{ tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate the daily revenue from silos:
- They sell 5 silos a day.
- Each silo is sold for $220.

So, the daily revenue from silos is:
\[ 5 \text{ silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day} \]

Now, we need to find the percentage increase in daily revenue from making silos compared to making tractors:
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New revenue} - \text{Old revenue}}{\text{Old revenue}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\$1100 - \$1000}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{\$100}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage more they are making per day now is:

"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming.

Boating time: 6 hours
Swimming time: 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours

Total time for boating and swimming: 6 hours + 3 hours = 9 hours

Next, let's calculate the total time he spent watching the shows.

Number of shows: 3
Duration of each show: 2 hours
Total show time: 3 shows * 2 hours/show = 6 hours

The 6 hours of watching shows is 30% of the total time spent. Let's denote the total time spent as \( T \).

So, 30% of \( T \) is 6 hours:
\[ 0.30 \times T = 6 \]
\[ T = \frac{6}{0.30} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we know the total time \( T \) is 20 hours. John spent 40% of his time sightseeing. Let's calculate the time spent sightseeing.

"First, let's calculate the total cost for the mini-golf and go-karts:

- Cost for one round of mini-golf: $5
- Cost for two rides on go-karts: $10 * 2 = $20

So, the total cost for mini-golf and go-karts is $5 + $20 = $25.

Now, we subtract this amount from the total budget to find out how much money is left for arcade tokens and snacks:

- Total budget: $90
- Total cost for mini-golf and go-karts: $25

Money left for arcade tokens and snacks: $90 - $25 = $65.

Morgan wants to have $5 in arcade tokens, so the remaining money for snacks and other expenses is:

- Money left: $65
- Money for arcade tokens: $5

Money left for snacks and other expenses: $65 - $5 = $60.

Since the question asks how many friends she can invite, and we don't have any information about the cost of snacks or other expenses for each friend, we can only determine how much money is left for snacks and other expenses. Assuming that the cost for snacks and other expenses per friend is negligible or not specified, the remaining $60 can be used for snacks and other expenses for her and her friends.

Therefore, she can invite as many friends as she wants with the remaining $60 for snacks and other expenses. However, if we are to strictly adhere to the question and not consider the cost of snacks or other expenses for each friend, the number of friends she can invite is theoretically unlimited with the remaining budget. 

Given the constraints and the information provided, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate how much Marisa spends on lollipops each day. She buys 4 lollipops every day, and each lollipop costs 25 cents. Therefore, the cost of the lollipops each day is:

\[ 4 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 100 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, 100 cents is equivalent to 1 dollar. So, Marisa spends $1 on lollipops each day.

Next, let's determine how much money Marisa has in her pocket every day after buying the lollipops. She gets $5 as pocket money every day, so the change she saves each day is:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars} - 1 \text{ dollar} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much money Marisa saves in her piggy bank over 5 days. Since she saves $4 each day, over 5 days she saves:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how much money Billy spent on gumballs. He bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, so the total cost for the gumballs is:

\[ 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Since he took half of his change and spent it on gumballs, the total amount of money he had initially was twice the amount he spent on gumballs:

\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Billy started with $10, so the amount of money he spent on candy is:

\[ 10 - 4 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of the candy is $1.5 per pound. To find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we divide the total amount spent on candy by the cost per pound:

"First, let's calculate the total distance of one complete trip from the first city to the third city and back to the first city.

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city back to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the second and third city trip, which is \(100 - 50 = 50\) miles.

So, the total distance for one complete round trip is:
\[75 + 100 + 50 = 225 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[225 \times 3 = 675 \text{ miles}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance traveled in one day by the service interval:
\[18000 \div 675 = 26.6667\]

Since the train cannot go a fraction of a day between services, we round up to the next whole number. Therefore, the train goes between services every 27 days.

The final numerical answer is:
\[27\]"
"First, let's determine the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed. The collie bed requires the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. A Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds of stuffing and a chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing. The average amount of stuffing for a collie bed is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Stuffing for collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the 4 chihuahua beds:

\[
\text{Total stuffing for chihuahua beds} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

Then, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the 3 collie beds:

\[
\text{Total stuffing for collie beds} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the total stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds to find the overall total:

\[
\text{Total stuffing} = 8 + 15 = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

The final numerical answer is:

\[
23

"First, let's calculate the time John spent driving to his friend's house. The distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, and he drives at a speed of 70 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time taken to drive to his friend's house is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} = \frac{200 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{200}{70} \text{ hours} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 2.857 \text{ hours} \]

Next, John took a detour that added 10 miles to his trip, making the total distance to his friend's house 210 miles. The time taken for this detour is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{210}{70} \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the time John spent driving back home. The distance home is 240 miles, and he drives at a speed of 80 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{back home}} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = \frac{240}{80} \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, the total time for the trip is the sum of the time taken to drive to his friend's house, the time taken for the detour, and the time taken to drive back home:

\[ \text{Total Time} = \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} + \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} + \text{Time}_{\text{back home}} \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{20}{7} + 3 + 3 \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{20}{7} + 6 \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{20}{7} + \frac{42}{7} \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{62}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 8.857 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time for the trip is:

\[ \frac{62}{7} \text{ hours} \]

Let's convert this to a decimal for clarity:

\[ \frac{62}{7} \approx 8.857 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 8.857 \text{ hours} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of boys at Small Tree School. Since there are 96 fourth-graders in total and 43 of them are girls, the number of boys is:

\[ 96 - 43 = 53 \]

Next, we need to find out how many boys were present on Friday. On Friday, 4 boys were absent. Therefore, the number of boys present on Friday is:

\[ 53 - 4 = 49 \]

So, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School who were present on Friday is 49."
"If there are 6 girls in the park and twice the number of boys, then there are \(2 \times 6 = 12\) boys in the park. Therefore, the total number of kids in the park is \(6 + 12 = 18\).

"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test, we start by calculating the total points she has already scored on her first two tests.

First test score: 15 points
Second test score: 18 points

Total points from the first two tests:
\[ 15 + 18 = 33 \]

Jane needs a total of at least 42 points across all three tests. To find the minimum score she needs on the third test, we subtract the total points she has already scored from the required total:

\[ 42 - 33 = 9 \]

Therefore, the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass is 9.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 9 \]"
"Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as \( C \). According to the problem, \( C = 3 \).

The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is \( 4C - 5 \). Substituting \( C = 3 \) into this equation, we get:
\[ 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]

The number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is \( 3 \) times the number of shoplifters, which is \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \).

Now, we know the total number of customers kicked out is 50. The total number of customers and shoplifters and those for physical violence is:
\[ C + (4C - 5) + 3(4C - 5) = 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 \]

The number of customers kicked out for other reasons is the total number of customers kicked out minus the number of customers and shoplifters and those for physical violence:
\[ 50 - 31 = 19 \]

So, the number of customers kicked out for other reasons is 19."
"To determine how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we need to first establish the points Erin had after scoring 14 points.

Given:
- Sara scored 8 points.
- Erin now has three times more points than Sara.

First, calculate the points Erin has now:
\[ \text{Erin's current points} = 3 \times \text{Sara's points} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Erin scored 14 points to reach her current total of 24 points. Therefore, the points Erin had before scoring the 14 points are:
\[ \text{Erin's points before} = \text{Erin's current points} - \text{points scored} = 24 - 14 = 10 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. Each picture frame costs $20 and an additional 20% for etching. The total cost per picture frame is:

\[ 20 + (20 \times 0.20) = 20 + 4 = 24 \]

Since there are 44 seniors, the total cost for the picture frames is:

\[ 44 \times 24 = 1056 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the pins. Two seniors will receive pins, and each pin costs $5:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the cords for the officers. One-fourth of the seniors are officers, so:

\[ \frac{44}{4} = 11 \]

Each cord costs $12, so the total cost for the cords is:

\[ 11 \times 12 = 132 \]

Finally, we sum up all the costs:

\[ 1056 + 10 + 132 = 1200 \]

The total amount spent on the senior gifts is:

\[ \boxed{1200} \]"
"To determine the total cost for Ethan if he makes his own hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the savings from the DIY option and then subtract that from the original cost.

The original cost of the wallpaper is $400. The DIY option saves 20% of this cost. First, we calculate 20% of $400:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.20 \times 400 = 80 \]

This means Ethan saves $80 by making his own wallpaper. Therefore, the total cost for Ethan if he makes his own wallpaper is:

\[ 400 - 80 = 320 \]

So, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.
On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday, which is \(14 \times 2 = 28\) pairs.
On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount sold on Saturday, which is \(28 \div 2 = 14\) pairs.

The total number of pairs sold without considering returns is \(14 + 28 + 14 = 56\) pairs.

Six pairs were returned, so the number of pairs sold after returns is \(56 - 6 = 50\) pairs.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 50."

So, the final numerical answer is 5."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of pieces of equipment and then calculate the cost of the functioning pieces.

1. Let's denote the total number of pieces of equipment as \( N \).
2. According to the problem, 40% of the total number of pieces were faulty. Therefore, the number of faulty pieces is \( 0.4N \).
3. Consequently, the number of functioning pieces is \( N - 0.4N = 0.6N \).

The total cost of the equipment is $400,000. Since the faulty pieces are returned, the company only pays for the functioning pieces. The cost of the functioning pieces is therefore \( 0.6N \) times the cost per piece. However, since we don't have the cost per piece, we can directly calculate the total cost of the functioning pieces as a fraction of the total cost.

The cost of the functioning pieces is:
\[ 0.6 \times 400000 = 240000 \]

So, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $240,000."
"Mary gets 1 kg of milk from half of her 30 sheep, which is 15 sheep. So, she gets 15 sheep * 1 kg/sheep = 15 kg of milk from these sheep. From the other half of the sheep, which is also 15 sheep, she gets 15 sheep * 2 kg/sheep = 30 kg of milk. Therefore, the total amount of milk she collects every day is 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

"First, we need to determine how many pupils like blue. Since half of the class likes blue, we calculate:

\[
\text{Pupils who like blue} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Next, we find out how many pupils are left after accounting for those who like blue:

\[
\text{Remaining pupils} = 40 - 20 = 20
\]

One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green, so we calculate:

\[
\text{Pupils who like green} = \frac{20}{4} = 5
\]

The rest of the pupils like yellow. To find out how many pupils like yellow, we subtract the number of pupils who like green from the remaining pupils:

\[
\text{Pupils who like yellow} = 20 - 5 = 15
\]

Thus, the number of pupils who like the color yellow is:

\[
15

"First, we need to determine how many apples Lucy sold on Monday. Given that she sold all the apples she picked on Monday and received $56 from selling them at $4 per piece, we can calculate the number of apples sold on Monday as follows:

\[ \text{Number of apples sold on Monday} = \frac{\$56}{\$4/\text{apple}} = 14 \text{ apples} \]

Next, we need to find out how many apples Lucy picked on Tuesday and Wednesday. According to the problem, on Tuesday, she picked 12 apples. On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday:

\[ \text{Number of apples picked on Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ apples} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of apples picked over the three days by summing the apples picked on each day:

\[ \text{Total number of apples} = \text{Apples picked on Monday} + \text{Apples picked on Tuesday} + \text{Apples picked on Wednesday} \]
\[ \text{Total number of apples} = 14 + 12 + 24 = 50 \]

Thus, the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days is:

"To determine how many socks Lindsay has missed, we first need to calculate the total number of socks she has washed.

A pair of socks consists of 2 socks. Lindsay washes 10 pairs, so the number of socks from the pairs is:
\[ 10 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ socks per pair} = 20 \text{ socks} \]

She also washes 15 loose socks. Therefore, the total number of socks she has washed is:
\[ 20 \text{ socks from pairs} + 15 \text{ loose socks} = 35 \text{ socks} \]

Lindsay started with 50 socks. To find out how many socks she has missed, we subtract the number of socks she has washed from the total number of socks:

"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including the interest, and then divide that by five.

The formula to calculate the total amount to be paid, including interest, is:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} \times (1 + \text{Interest Rate})^{\text{Time}} \]

Here, the principal (P) is $3,650, the interest rate (r) is 10% or 0.10, and the time (t) is 5 months. Since the interest rate is given as an annual rate, we need to adjust it for the time period. However, since the interest is compounded monthly, we can use the formula directly with the given values.

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 \times (1 + 0.10)^5 \]

First, calculate \( (1 + 0.10)^5 \):
\[ (1 + 0.10)^5 = 1.10^5 \approx 1.61051 \]

Now, multiply this by the principal:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 \times 1.61051 \approx 5874.4115 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the total amount Karan has to pay is approximately $5874.41.

Next, we need to divide this total amount by the number of months (5) to find the monthly payment:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{5874.4115}{5} \approx 1174.8823 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is approximately $1174.88.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

For Cho:
Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 14 km/h × 8 h = 112 km

For Chloe:
Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 9 km/h × 5 h = 45 km

Now, we find the difference in the distances:
Difference = Distance of Cho - Distance of Chloe
Difference = 112 km - 45 km = 67 km

So, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe."
"First, let's determine the number of silver and gold pesos Anna has:

- Axel has 50 silver pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so Anna has \(2 \times 50 = 100\) silver pesos.
- Axel has 80 gold pesos. Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so Anna has \(80 + 40 = 120\) gold pesos.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pesos they have together:

- Axel's total: \(50\) silver pesos + \(80\) gold pesos = \(130\) pesos.
- Anna's total: \(100\) silver pesos + \(120\) gold pesos = \(220\) pesos.

Adding their totals together:

So, the total number of pesos they have together is 350."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make:

- Each pitcher holds 12 cups.
- She can make 3 pitchers of lemonade.

So, the total number of cups is:
\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups/pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling all the lemonade:

- She sells each cup for $1.
- She has 36 cups.

So, the total revenue is:
\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1/\text{cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to determine the cost of making the lemonade:

- She spent $18 to buy the supplies.

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue:
\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Millie sells all the lemonade, and she sells an average of 4 cups per hour. To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours the lemonade stand is open:

\[ \frac{\$18}{4 \text{ cups/hour}} = \$4.50/\text{hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially as \( L \).

According to the problem, he sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. We know that \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land is equal to 12.8 hectares.

To find the total amount of land \( L \), we can set up the following equation:

\[ \frac{2}{5} L = 12.8 \]

To solve for \( L \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[ L = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} \]

"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 50\% \times 52 = 0.5 \times 52 = 26 \]

Since the choir is evenly split between boys and girls, the number of boys is also 26.

Next, we need to find out how many female members are performing. Since the choir decides to perform with just its female members, the number of female members performing is:

\[ \text{Number of female members performing} = 26 \]

On the day of the performance, half of the female members can't make it to the show because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of female members who can't make it is:

\[ \text{Number of female members who can't make it} = \frac{26}{2} = 13 \]

This means the number of female members who do make it to the show is:

\[ \text{Number of female members who make it} = 26 - 13 = 13 \]

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them, so the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

\[ \text{Total number of people who sang} = 13 + 3 = 16 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many popsicles Betty and Sam each have based on the given ratio and total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. Together, they have a total of 165 popsicles.

First, we find the sum of the parts of the ratio:
\[ 5 + 6 = 11 \]

This means that the total number of popsicles (165) is divided into 11 parts. To find the number of popsicles in one part, we divide the total number of popsicles by 11:
\[ \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can find out how many popsicles Betty and Sam have individually:
- Betty has \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \) popsicles.
- Sam has \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the monthly cost of the streaming services after the 20% savings for bundling.

Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 each, so together they cost $20. With a 20% savings, the savings amount is:
\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \]

So, the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus after the savings is:
\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \]

Now, let's add the cost of Netflix, which is $10 a month:
\[ 16 + 10 = 26 \]

Tim's cable package costs $60 a month. Therefore, the amount of money he saves by cancelling his cable package and subscribing to the streaming services is:
\[ 60 - 26 = 34 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 34 \]"
"First, let's convert all the time spent into the same unit. We'll use minutes for this calculation.

- Time spent writing a song: 4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes
- Time spent recording: half of the time spent writing = 240 / 2 = 120 minutes
- Time spent editing: 90 minutes

Now, let's calculate the total work time in minutes:
- Total work time = Time spent writing + Time spent recording + Time spent editing
- Total work time = 240 + 120 + 90 = 450 minutes

Next, we calculate the percentage of the total work time spent editing:
- Percentage spent editing = (Time spent editing / Total work time) * 100
- Percentage spent editing = (90 / 450) * 100 = 0.2 * 100 = 20%

The final numerical answer is 20%."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of books Wendy wants to place in the shelving system.

- Erica made 20 cards.
- Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made cards, with each box containing 15 cards. Therefore, the total number of cards her dad brought is \(2 \times 15 = 30\).

Adding these together, Erica has \(20 + 30 = 50\) cards initially.

Next, we account for the cards she passed out and received:

- Erica passed out 24 cards to her classmates.
- She received 17 cards from family and friends.

To find out how many cards Erica has left, we subtract the cards she passed out and received from the total number of cards she had initially:

\[ 50 - 24 - 17 = 50 - 41 = 9 \]

So, the final number of Valentine's cards Erica has is 9."
"First, let's determine how many slices Jenny gives to Bill and Mark.

Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's add the slices given to Bill and Mark:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny eats 2 slices. So, the total number of slices given away or eaten is:
\[ 7 + 2 = 9 \text{ slices} \]

Since the pizza originally had 12 slices, the number of slices left is:
\[ 12 - 9 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"Mark currently has $50 in his bank account. The bike costs $300. Therefore, he needs an additional $300 - $50 = $250 to buy the bike. Since he earns $10 per day, the number of days he needs to save is $250 / $10 = 25 days.

The final numerical answer is 25."
"First, let's determine the number of millipedes. Nancy saw 1/3 as many millipedes as spiders. Since she saw 90 spiders, the number of millipedes is:

\[ \text{Number of millipedes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30 \]

Next, we need to find the number of stink bugs. The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of stink bugs} = 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48 \]

Now, we can find the total number of bugs by adding the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs together:

\[ \text{Total number of bugs} = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168 \]

So, the total number of bugs Nancy counted is:

\[ 168 \]"
"If Erica is 30 years old, and Beth is 5 years older than Erica, then Beth is 30 + 5 = 35 years old. Since Alice is 7 years older than Beth, Alice is 35 + 7 = 42 years old. The difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 42 - 30 = 12 years. 

The final numerical answer is 12."

"To determine the builder's annual earnings, we need to calculate the number of days he works in a year and then multiply that by his daily wage.

First, let's calculate the number of days the builder works in a month:
- The builder works 6 days a week.
- There are 4 weeks in a month.

So, the number of days the builder works in a month is:
\[ 6 \text{ days/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 24 \text{ days/month} \]

Next, we calculate the number of days the builder works in a year:
- There are 12 months in a year.

So, the number of days the builder works in a year is:
\[ 24 \text{ days/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 288 \text{ days/year} \]

Now, we calculate the total earnings for the year:
- The builder gets paid $50 every day.

So, the total earnings for the year are:
\[ 288 \text{ days/year} \times 50 \text{ dollars/day} = 14400 \text{ dollars/year} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for a quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for:
- 3 cups of flour
- 1 cup of milk

For a quadruple batch, the amounts are:
- Flour: \( 3 \text{ cups} \times 4 = 12 \text{ cups} \)
- Milk: \( 1 \text{ cup} \times 4 = 4 \text{ cups} \)

Next, we need to determine how many bags of flour and bottles of milk are required.

Flour is sold in 2-cup bags:
- \( \frac{12 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups per bag}} = 6 \text{ bags} \)

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles:
- \( \frac{4 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups per bottle}} = 2 \text{ bottles} \)

Finally, to find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:
- \( 6 \text{ bags} - 2 \text{ bottles} = 4 \)

"To determine the energy saved by Mel, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the energy consumption of the air conditioner per hour.
2. Determine the daily energy consumption after the reduction.
3. Calculate the total energy saved in 30 days.

First, the air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour. Reducing the usage by 5 hours a day means the new usage is 8 - 5 = 3 hours a day.

The daily energy consumption after the reduction is:
\[ 900 \text{ watts/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 2700 \text{ watt-hours/day} \]

To convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours, we divide by 1000:
\[ 2700 \text{ watt-hours/day} = 2.7 \text{ kilowatt-hours/day} \]

Now, to find the total energy saved in 30 days:
\[ 2.7 \text{ kilowatt-hours/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 81 \text{ kilowatt-hours} \]

So, the total kilowatt-hours of electric energy saved in 30 days is 81 kilowatt-hours. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of stripes on all the zebras Jane counted.

- Two zebras with 17 stripes each: \(2 \times 17 = 34\) stripes
- One zebra with 36 stripes: \(36\) stripes
- One zebra with half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes: \(36 / 2 = 18\) stripes

Now, let's add up all the stripes:
\[34 + 36 + 18 = 88\]

There are a total of 3 zebras, so to find the average number of stripes per zebra, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras:
\[88 / 3 = 29.3333...\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[29.3333...\]

In a more precise form, it can be written as \(29.\overline{3}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of meat and cheese required and then calculate the cost based on the given prices.

First, let's calculate the total number of sandwiches needed:
- There are 20 people and each sandwich serves 4 people.
- Therefore, the total number of sandwiches required is \( \frac{20}{4} = 5 \) sandwiches.

Next, we calculate the total amount of meat and cheese needed:
- Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.
- For 5 sandwiches, the total amount of meat needed is \( 5 \times 1 = 5 \) pounds.
- For 5 sandwiches, the total amount of cheese needed is \( 5 \times 1 = 5 \) pounds.

Now, we calculate the cost of the meat and cheese:
- The cost of meat is $7.00 per pound.
- The cost of cheese is $3.00 per pound.
- The total cost for the meat is \( 5 \times 7 = 35 \) dollars.
- The total cost for the cheese is \( 5 \times 3 = 15 \) dollars.

Finally, we add the costs of the meat and cheese to find the total amount spent:
- Total cost = Cost of meat + Cost of cheese = \( 35 + 15 = 50 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
50"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of cannolis**: Allan initially has 40 cannolis.
2. **Corn to cannolis ratio**: There is twice as much corn as cannolis. Therefore, initially, Allan has \(2 \times 40 = 80\) corns.
3. **Cannolis after buying more**: Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new total of cannolis is \(40 + 60 = 100\).
4. **Corn after buying fewer**: Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought, so he bought \(60 - 40 = 20\) fewer corns. Therefore, the new total of corns is \(80 - 20 = 60\).

Now, we need to find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house:

\[
\text{Total} = \text{Number of corns} + \text{Number of cannolis} = 60 + 100 = 160
\]

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is **160**."
"Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day. He has already completed half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which means he has taken 5,000 steps so far. He then took an additional 1,000 steps with his friend, bringing the total to 6,000 steps. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps. 

To find out how many steps he took during his jog, we can subtract the steps he had left from his goal:

\[ 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 \]

So, Elliott took 8,000 steps during his jog."
"First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:
\[ \text{Total words} = \text{Number of pages} \times \text{Words per page} = 45 \times 200 = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, let's determine how long it will take Toby to read the entire book:
\[ \text{Time to read the book} = \frac{\text{Total words}}{\text{Words per minute}} = \frac{9000}{300} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby plans to leave the airport in 60 minutes and it takes 10 minutes to get there. Therefore, he needs to start reading 70 minutes before he needs to be at the airport:
\[ \text{Time to start reading} = 60 - 10 = 50 \text{ minutes before the airport} \]

Since it takes 30 minutes to read the book, Toby will finish reading 30 minutes before he needs to be at the airport. Therefore, he will be:
\[ 50 - 30 = 20 \text{ minutes early} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is sold in a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. Sally bought 2 pounds of taffy.

For the first pound, the cost is $3.
For the second pound, the cost is $3 - $1.50 = $1.50 (since it's half off).

So, the total cost for the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50 and the magnets cost $0.25 each. Sally bought 4 magnets.

The total cost for the seashells and magnets is $1.50 + 4 * $0.25 = $1.50 + $1.00 = $2.50.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items Sally bought:
Total cost = Cost of taffy + Cost of seashells and magnets
Total cost = $4.50 + $2.50 = $7.00.

Sally's parents gave her $10 to spend. So, the amount of money Sally has left is:
Money left = Initial amount - Total cost
Money left = $10 - $7.00 = $3.00.

The final numerical answer is $3.00."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the two packs of fireworks. The first pack costs $400, and the second pack costs twice as much, which is $800. Adding these together gives:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost of the two packs of fireworks. A 20% discount means Tim pays 80% of the total cost. So, we calculate 80% of $1200:

\[ 1200 \times 0.80 = 960 \]

Now, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted cost of the fireworks:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

We know that 5% of the candles are dangerous and have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. Additionally, 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode. Therefore, 1% of the candles are dangerous and do not have the defect.

First, let's find out how many candles are dangerous:
\[ 50000 \times 0.05 = 2500 \text{ candles} \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these dangerous candles have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. Since 5% of the candles are dangerous and have the defect:

"Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees as \( A \).

From the problem, we know:
- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples.
- Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
- Joanne's sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
- Joanne's sister doesn't take any apples from the average trees, so she contributes 0 apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is:
\[ 30 + 15 + A \]

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne's sister is:
\[ 60 + 45 + 0 = 105 \]

The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500:
\[ (30 + 15 + A) + (60 + 45) = 500 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 45 + A + 105 = 500 \]
\[ 150 + A = 500 \]
\[ A = 500 - 150 \]
\[ A = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees."
"Let's denote the number of camels as \( C \) and the number of dromedaries as \( D \).

From the problem, we have two equations:
1. The total number of heads: \( C + D = 180 \)
2. The total number of humps: \( 2C + D = 304 \)

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, we can express \( C \) in terms of \( D \) from the first equation:
\[ C = 180 - D \]

Next, we substitute \( C \) in the second equation:
\[ 2(180 - D) + D = 304 \]
\[ 360 - 2D + D = 304 \]
\[ 360 - D = 304 \]
\[ -D = 304 - 360 \]
\[ -D = -56 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

To find the number of camels, we substitute \( D = 56 \) back into the first equation:
\[ C + 56 = 180 \]
\[ C = 180 - 56 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

To verify, we check the humps:
\[ 2C + D = 2(124) + 56 = 248 + 56 = 304 \]

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days. He traveled 200 kilometers every day, so the total distance for the first 4 days is:
\[ 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \]

Next, we need to find out how far he traveled in the next two days. The total distance for these two days is 30% of the distance he traveled in the first four days. So, we calculate 30% of 800 km:
\[ 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \]

Now, let's add up the distances for the first 6 days:
\[ 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} = 1040 \text{ km} \]

During the next day, Tom didn't travel at all, so the distance for that day is 0 km. For the remaining 5 days of the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers each day. So, the total distance for the last 5 days is:
\[ 300 \text{ km/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 1500 \text{ km} \]

Now, we can find the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip by adding the distances from the first 6 days and the last 5 days:
\[ 1040 \text{ km} + 1500 \text{ km} = 2540 \text{ km} \]

So, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:

"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:

\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of both pairs of jeans:

\[ 28 + 22 = 50 \]

Cole saved a total of $6. According to the problem, he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. Let's denote the total savings as \( S \). Since he saved $6 in total, we have:

\[ S = 6 \]

The savings from the jogger jeans is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]

The savings from the tattered jeans is:

\[ 6 - 2 = 4 \]

Now, we need to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. We already know the original cost of the tattered jeans is $28 and the original cost of the jogger jeans is $22. The difference in cost is:

\[ 28 - 22 = 6 \]

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 more than the tattered jeans. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the cost of the soup. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. The bagel costs $4.

To find 25% of $4:
\[ 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]

So, the soup costs:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Next, we know the cake costs half of the price of the bagel. The bagel costs $4, so:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the dinner by adding the cost of the soup, the bagel, and the cake:
\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \]

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for the dinner she ordered."
"Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( x \).

Kenny keeps \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his cards, so he sells \( \frac{2}{3} \) of them. The number of cards he sells is \( \frac{2}{3}x \).

He sells each card for $1.5, so the total amount of money he earns from selling the cards is \( 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}x = x \).

According to the problem, after spending $50 on the ticket, he has $50 left. This means the total amount of money he earned from selling the cards is $100 (the cost of the ticket plus the $50 he has left).

So, we can set up the equation:

Each of these 18 guests was supposed to have 2 hotdogs, so the total number of hotdogs prepared was:

\[ 18 \times 2 = 36 \]

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. Since only 36 hotdogs were prepared, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:

\[ 40 - 36 = 4 \]

So, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 4."
"First, let's determine the number of letters in Indras' sister's name. We know that Indras' name has 6 letters. Half of the letters in Indras' name is:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name, so:

\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Now, we add the number of letters in both names:

\[ 6 + 7 = 13 \]

So, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is:

\[ 13 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Mixing bowls: $20.00
- Utensils: 5 utensils at $5.00 each, so 5 * $5.00 = $25.00

Total cost before discount = $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Now, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost:

Discount amount = 20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount:

Final amount = $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

So, the final numerical answer is $132.00."

2. Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus. Therefore, Prince Arthur slew \( \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \) dragons.
3. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. Therefore, Prince Walter slew \( 2 \times 75 = 150 \) dragons.
4. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. Therefore, Prince Bruce slew \( \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30 \) dragons.

The final numerical answer is 30."
"First, we need to determine how much gas is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we can calculate the amount of gas per container as follows:

\[ \text{Gas per container} = \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5 \text{ containers}} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Josey needed \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a container, so we calculate the amount of gas she needed:

\[ \text{Gas needed by Josey} = \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to convert gallons to pints. Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we can convert \( \frac{3}{4} \) gallons to pints as follows:

\[ \text{Gas needed by Josey in pints} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints per gallon} = \frac{3 \times 8}{4} = \frac{24}{4} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, let's determine how much money George spent on chips. We know he got 3 bags of chips, and each bag costs 40 cents. Therefore, the total cost for the chips is:
\[ 3 \times 40 \text{ cents} = 120 \text{ cents} \]

Since George spent $5, which is 500 cents, and he had 1% of his money left after buying the chips, we can calculate how much money he had left:
\[ 500 \text{ cents} \times 0.01 = 5 \text{ cents} \]

This means the amount of money George spent on chips and candy bars combined is:
\[ 500 \text{ cents} - 5 \text{ cents} = 495 \text{ cents} \]

Since he spent 120 cents on chips, the amount of money he spent on candy bars is:
\[ 495 \text{ cents} - 120 \text{ cents} = 375 \text{ cents} \]

Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so the number of candy bars George bought is:
\[ \frac{375 \text{ cents}}{75 \text{ cents per candy bar}} = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of candy bars George bought is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"

\[ 34 + 22 = 56 \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of people sharing the oranges. Sitti and Juris are sharing with their 6 other friends, so the total number of people is:

\[ 2 + 6 = 8 \]

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people:

\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

So, everyone will get 7 oranges. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 7 \]"
"First, let's determine the amount of onions Antoine uses. The recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, and he doubles that amount:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00 \text{ per pound} = \$8.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box is $2.00:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00 \text{ per box} = \$4.00 \]

The total cost for the ingredients is the sum of the cost of the onions and the beef stock:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is:

\[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00 \text{ per serving} \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is:

\[ \$2.00 \]

Final numerical answer:

"To determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to calculate the time it takes for Bernadette to drive to the theater and then find the difference between Bernadette's and Wayne's arrival times.

First, we know that it takes Wayne four minutes to drive to the theater. According to the problem, the drive from Bernadette’s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne’s hotel. Therefore, the time it takes Bernadette to drive to the theater is:
\[ 4 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to drive to the theater, he will arrive at the theater in:
\[ 4 \text{ minutes} + 4 \text{ minutes} = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

To arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, Bernadette should leave:
\[ 8 \text{ minutes} - 5 \text{ minutes} = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 3 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first.

"First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of Billie's bedroom in feet is:
\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area formula for a rectangle, which is:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

Given that the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, we can find the width:
\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{width} \]
\[ \text{width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we can calculate the perimeter of the rectangle using the formula:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

"First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven. Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour.

\[ \text{Temperature increase from oven} = 3 \, \text{hours} \times 5 \, \text{degrees/hour} = 15 \, \text{degrees} \]

Next, let's calculate the temperature decrease due to the window. Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.

\[ \text{Temperature decrease from window} = \left(\frac{30 \, \text{minutes}}{10 \, \text{minutes}}\right) \times 2 \, \text{degrees} = 3 \times 2 \, \text{degrees} = 6 \, \text{degrees} \]

Now, let's find the final temperature by adding the temperature increase from the oven and subtracting the temperature decrease from the window from the initial temperature.

\[ \text{Initial temperature} = 40 \, \text{degrees} \]
\[ \text{Final temperature} = 40 \, \text{degrees} + 15 \, \text{degrees} - 6 \, \text{degrees} = 49 \, \text{degrees} \]

"First, let's convert all times to minutes for easier calculation:
- Jon's swim time: 40 minutes
- Jon's bike ride time: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 60 + 20 = 80 minutes
- Jon's run time: 50 minutes

Now, let's calculate James's times:
- James's swim time: Jon's swim time minus 10% of Jon's swim time
  \[ \text{James's swim time} = 40 - (0.10 \times 40) = 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]
- James's bike ride time: Jon's bike ride time plus 5 minutes
  \[ \text{James's bike ride time} = 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]
- James's run time: We need to find this.

The total time for Jon is:
\[ \text{Jon's total time} = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes} \]

Let \( x \) be James's run time in minutes. Then James's total time is:
\[ \text{James's total time} = 36 + 85 + x = 121 + x \]

We know that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[ 121 + x = 170 + 10 \]
\[ 121 + x = 180 \]
\[ x = 180 - 121 \]
\[ x = 59 \]

So, James's run time is 59 minutes. The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine how many miles the horse runs. The horse runs at a speed of 32 miles per hour for 30 minutes, which is half an hour. Therefore, the distance the horse runs is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 32 \text{ miles/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of hay the horse eats. For every mile the horse runs, it eats 1/2 a bail of hay. Therefore, for 16 miles, the horse eats:

\[ \text{Hay consumed} = 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail/mile} = 8 \text{ bails} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the hay. Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost for 8 bails is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars/bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which means he has:

\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the hay, the change Michael has is:

"Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as \( P \).

The cost of the super ticket is $20, and it includes one popcorn and one soda for an extra $1. So, the total cost for the super ticket is $20 + $1 = $21.

The cost of buying a movie ticket for $12 and a popcorn and a soda at regular price is $12 + \( P \) + $3 = $15 + \( P \).

According to the problem, you saved $2 by buying the super ticket instead of buying the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda separately. Therefore, the cost of buying the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda separately is $2 more than the cost of the super ticket.

We can set up the equation as follows:
\[ 15 + P = 21 + 2 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[ 15 + P = 23 \]

To find \( P \), we subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:
\[ P = 23 - 15 \]
\[ P = 8 \]

So, the regular price of popcorn is $8.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the initial cost per balloon and then calculate the new cost per balloon after the price increase. Finally, we will use this new cost to find out how much Bentley paid for 170 balloons.

First, let's find the initial cost per balloon. The total cost for 20 balloons was $900. Therefore, the cost per balloon initially is:
\[ \text{Initial cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Two days later, the cost per balloon increased by $20. So, the new cost per balloon is:
\[ \text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost for 170 balloons at the new price:
\[ \text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = 170 \times 65 \]

Let's perform the multiplication:
\[ 170 \times 65 = 170 \times (60 + 5) = (170 \times 60) + (170 \times 5) \]
\[ 170 \times 60 = 10200 \]
\[ 170 \times 5 = 850 \]
\[ 10200 + 850 = 11050 \]

So, the total cost for Bentley to fill 170 balloons after the price increase is:
\[ \boxed{11050} \]"

"First, let's determine the value of the sapphires Jenna trades away. Jenna trades 3 sapphires, and each sapphire is worth $800. Therefore, the value of the sapphires she trades is:

\[ 3 \text{ sapphires} \times \$800 \text{ per sapphire} = \$2400 \]

Next, we need to determine how many sapphires Jenna has left after the trade. Initially, she had 8 sapphires and traded 3, so she has:

\[ 8 - 3 = 5 \text{ sapphires} \]

Now, we calculate the total value of the sapphires Jenna has left:

\[ 5 \text{ sapphires} \times \$800 \text{ per sapphire} = \$4000 \]

Jenna also receives 2 rubies in the trade. Each ruby is worth $1200, so the value of the rubies she receives is:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

For one raised bed, the volume is:

\[ V = 8 \text{ feet} \times 2 \text{ feet} \times 2 \text{ feet} = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:

\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 \text{ cubic feet} = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \text{ cubic feet}}{2 \text{ cubic feet per bag}} = 160 \text{ bags} \]

"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll use inches.

1 foot = 12 inches

The shark's length is 10 feet, which is:
\[ 10 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 120 \text{ inches} \]

Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is:
\[ 2 \times 6 \text{ inches} = 12 \text{ inches} \]

To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Length of remoras}}{\text{Length of shark}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{120 \text{ inches}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{10} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

"To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion. First, we need to find out how many kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both.

The number of kids allergic to dairy is 9.
The number of kids allergic to peanuts is 6.
The number of kids allergic to both is 3.

Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion, the number of kids allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Allergic to dairy or peanuts} = \text{Allergic to dairy} + \text{Allergic to peanuts} - \text{Allergic to both} \]
\[ \text{Allergic to dairy or peanuts} = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both. Since there are 32 kids in total, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:
\[ \text{Not allergic to anything} = \text{Total kids} - \text{Allergic to dairy or peanuts} \]
\[ \text{Not allergic to anything} = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is 20."

   - Brett is currently 14 years old, so three times his current age is \( 3 \times 14 = 42 \).
   - Therefore, in four years, Angela will be 42 years old.

3. **Determine Angela's current age:**
   - If Angela will be 42 years old in four years, her current age is \( 42 - 4 = 38 \).

So, Angela is currently 38 years old."
"To calculate the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during the two weeks, we need to consider the cost of his morning and afternoon rides.

First, let's determine the number of rides Paul took each day:
- Morning ride: 1
- Afternoon ride: 1

So, the total number of rides per day is:
\[ 1 + 1 = 2 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of rides over the 14 days:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ rides} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the morning rides:
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- Total cost for morning rides:
\[ 28 \text{ rides} \times 6 \text{ dollars/ride} = 168 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the afternoon rides:
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- Total cost for afternoon rides:
\[ 28 \text{ rides} \times 2 \text{ dollars/ride} = 56 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the total costs of the morning and afternoon rides to find the total amount spent:
\[ 168 \text{ dollars} + 56 \text{ dollars} = 224 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is:
\[ 224 \text{ dollars} \]"
"First, let's determine how many oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, let's add the total number of oranges brought by both Brianne and Ashley:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Each Greek orange pie requires three oranges. To find out how many pies they can make, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed per pie:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ oranges}}{3 \text{ oranges/pie}} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 40 \]"
"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let's denote the number of guests by \( n \).

**Cost at the first venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Cost of food per guest: $5
- Total cost at the first venue: \( 200 + 5n \)

**Cost at the second venue:**
- Cost per guest: $25
- Cost of food per guest: $5 (already included in the price)
- Total cost at the second venue: \( 25n \)

We need to find the value of \( n \) for which the costs at both venues are equal. Therefore, we set the two cost equations equal to each other:

\[ 200 + 5n = 25n \]

Next, we solve for \( n \):

1. Subtract \( 5n \) from both sides of the equation:
   \[ 200 = 25n - 5n \]
   \[ 200 = 20n \]

2. Divide both sides by 20:
   \[ n = \frac{200}{20} \]
   \[ n = 10 \]

Thus, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \( 10 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \( D \). According to the problem, Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects. Additionally, David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects. The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ D = 9 \]

So, David found 9 insects. Since Lily found 7 more than David, Lily found:

\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Therefore, the number of insects Lily found is 16."

"First, let's calculate the number of gifts Cherrie buys for her 5 friends. Two of her friends want 5 gifts each, and the other three friends want 2 gifts each.

For the two friends who want 5 gifts each:
\[ 2 \text{ friends} \times 5 \text{ gifts per friend} = 10 \text{ gifts} \]

For the three friends who want 2 gifts each:
\[ 3 \text{ friends} \times 2 \text{ gifts per friend} = 6 \text{ gifts} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of gifts for her friends:
\[ 10 \text{ gifts} + 6 \text{ gifts} = 16 \text{ gifts} \]

Cherrie also decides to get 10 more random gifts as a surprise. So, we add these to the total:
\[ 16 \text{ gifts} + 10 \text{ gifts} = 26 \text{ gifts} \]

Therefore, the total number of gifts Cherrie bought is:

"If the chair is 3 feet wide, and the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, then the rug is:

\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet wide} \]

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Therefore, twice the width of the rug is:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ feet} \]

So, the length of the couch is:

\[ 16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet} \]

The final numerical answer is 18."
"Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( S \). Suzie bought four packs of gum in total, with two packs being strawberry. She also bought one pack of grape gum for $2 and a small pack of green apple gum for half the price of the grape gum, which is $1.

The total cost of the gum can be expressed as:
\[ 2S + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2."
"First, let's determine how many 2 x 4 pieces Frederick can buy with $24. Each 2 x 4 costs $4.

\[ \text{Number of 2 x 4 pieces} = \frac{\$24}{\$4} = 6 \]

Next, let's determine how many 2 x 8 pieces Frederick can buy with $24. Each 2 x 8 costs $6.

\[ \text{Number of 2 x 8 pieces} = \frac{\$24}{\$6} = 4 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of popsicle sticks he can get from each type of wood.

For 2 x 4 pieces:
\[ \text{Total sticks from 2 x 4} = 6 \times 200 = 1200 \]

For 2 x 8 pieces:
\[ \text{Total sticks from 2 x 8} = 4 \times 400 = 1600 \]

Since Frederick is buying the cheapest lumber (2 x 4 pieces), he will use 6 pieces of 2 x 4.

The total number of popsicle sticks he can make is:

\[ \text{Total sticks} = 1200 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 1200 \]"
"To determine the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his sled dogs, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
2. Determine the number of pairs of legs (since each pair of snowshoes is for one pair of legs).
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of pairs of legs.

First, we know that each dog has 4 legs and there are 6 dogs:
\[ 4 \text{ legs/dog} \times 6 \text{ dogs} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Since each pair of snowshoes covers one pair of legs, we need to find out how many pairs of legs there are:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs/pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs of legs} \]

Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, so the total cost for 12 pairs of snowshoes is:
\[ 12 \text{ pairs} \times 12 \text{ dollars/pair} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is:
\[ 144 \text{ dollars} \]"
"To determine how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate her total weekly cost without the bus pass and then compare it to the cost of the bus pass.

First, let's calculate her total weekly cost without the bus pass:
- Janet takes two bus trips each day.
- She takes five bus trips per day.
- Therefore, her total bus trips per week are \(2 \times 5 = 10\) trips.
- Each bus trip costs her $2.20.
- Thus, her total weekly cost without the bus pass is \(10 \times 2.20 = 22.00\) dollars.

Next, we compare this to the cost of the weekly bus pass:
- The weekly bus pass costs $20.

Now, we calculate the savings by subtracting the cost of the bus pass from her total weekly cost without the bus pass:
- Savings = Total weekly cost without the bus pass - Cost of the bus pass
- Savings = $22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00

Therefore, Janet would save $2.00 by buying the weekly bus pass."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Farm's Cows and Sheep:**
   - The farm has 30 cows.
   - The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has \(2 \times 30 = 60\) cows.

2. **Zoo's Cows and Sheep:**
   - The zoo has 20 sheep.
   - The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has \(\frac{20}{2} = 10\) sheep.

3. **Total Animals:**
   - The farm has 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.
   - The zoo has 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.
   - Combined, the farm and zoo have 40 + 80 = 120 animals.

"To determine how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we start by understanding the relationship between the quantities bought by Sophia and Rose. According to the problem, Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.

Given:
- Rose bought 12 onions.
- Rose bought 4 potatoes.

Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as \( S_o \) and the number of potatoes Sophia bought as \( S_p \).

From the problem, we know:
\[ 4 \times (S_o + S_p) = 12 + 4 \]

First, calculate the total number of onions and potatoes Rose bought:
\[ 12 + 4 = 16 \]

Now, set up the equation:
\[ 4 \times (S_o + S_p) = 16 \]

Divide both sides of the equation by 4 to find \( S_o + S_p \):
\[ S_o + S_p = \frac{16}{4} \]
\[ S_o + S_p = 4 \]

Thus, Sophia bought a total of 4 onions and potatoes. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we first need to calculate the total number of calories he needs to burn to lose 30 pounds. Given that he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose one pound, the total calories he needs to burn to lose 30 pounds is:

\[ 3500 \text{ calories/pound} \times 30 \text{ pounds} = 105000 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to determine the number of days from December 31st to July 19th. We can break this down into months:

- December: 31 days
- January: 31 days
- February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
- March: 31 days
- April: 30 days
- May: 31 days
- June: 30 days
- July (up to July 19th): 19 days

Adding these together gives:

\[ 31 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 221 \text{ days} \]

Now, to find the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to maintain, we divide the total calories he needs to burn by the number of days:

\[ \frac{105000 \text{ calories}}{221 \text{ days}} \approx 475.64 \text{ calories/day} \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, Andy needs to maintain a daily calorie deficit of approximately 476 calories each day to reach his goal."

\[ 500 - 100 = 400 \]

Next, Julie spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs:

\[ 0.25 \times 400 = 100 \]

Therefore, after buying CDs, the remaining amount of money Julie had is:

\[ 400 - 100 = 300 \]

So, the final amount of money Julie had left is $300."
"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, the house cost three times as much as the lot, so we can write:

\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]

Combining like terms, we have:

\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

To find \( L \), we divide both sides by 4:

\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000 \]

Now that we know the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):

\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000 \]

So, the house cost $90,000. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the canvas bags that Tara bought. She bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each, and each pack costs $4.

Total cost = Number of packs × Number of bags per pack × Cost per pack
Total cost = 8 × 5 × $4
Total cost = 40 × $4
Total cost = $160

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the canvas bags. Tara sold each of the 40 bags for $8.

Total revenue = Number of bags sold × Price per bag
Total revenue = 40 × $8
Total revenue = $320

Now, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $320 - $160
Profit = $160

So, Tara earned a profit of $160 on her canvas bags."

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has. He has four $10 bills and six $20 bills.

The total amount from the $10 bills is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

The total amount from the $20 bills is:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of money Ali has:
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \]

Ali gives half of this total money to his sister:
\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \]

So, the remaining amount of money Ali has is:
\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \]

Ali uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining amount to buy dinner:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = \frac{3 \times 80}{5} = \frac{240}{5} = 48 \]

"First, let's calculate Ada's daily electric consumption before and after adding the new device.

**Before adding the new device:**
- Daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour
- Cost per kilowatt per hour: $1.50

Daily cost before:
\[ 12 \, \text{kWh/day} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$18.00/\text{day} \]

**After adding the new device:**
- Daily consumption: 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour
- Cost per kilowatt per hour: $1.50

Daily cost after:
\[ 14 \, \text{kWh/day} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$21.00/\text{day} \]

Next, we calculate the weekly cost for both scenarios.

**Weekly cost before:**
\[ \$18.00/\text{day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = \$126.00/\text{week} \]

**Weekly cost after:**

The difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is \$21.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which the people can paint and then scale it up for 5 people.

1. One person can paint half a house in 5 days. Therefore, one person can paint a whole house in 10 days.
2. The rate of painting for one person is \(\frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}}\).
3. If 5 people are working together, their combined rate of painting is \(5 \times \frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{2 \text{ days}}\).
4. This means that 5 people can paint a whole house in 2 days.

To convert this into hours, we multiply the number of days by 24 (since there are 24 hours in a day):

\[2 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 48 \text{ hours}\]

So, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ophelia has 20 sofas.
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. Therefore, Ophelia has \(20 + 2 = 22\) chairs.
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. Therefore, Jenna has \(3 \times 22 = 66\) chairs.
4. Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, Ophelia also has 22 sofas (as calculated earlier).
5. Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so Jenna has \(66 - 2 = 64\) sofas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have together:

- Ophelia's total: \(20\) sofas + \(22\) chairs = \(42\)
- Jenna's total: \(64\) sofas + \(66\) chairs = \(130\)

Adding their totals together:

\[42 + 130 = 172\]

Next, we add the hours for the two weeks where he worked out 5 hours each week:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

Then, we add the hours for the week where he worked out 6 hours:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/week} \times 1 \text{ week} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we sum all these hours together:
\[ 24 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:
\[ 40 \]"
"Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

On the first stop, 8 people get off. Then, 5 times as many people as those who got off get on. So, \(5 \times 8 = 40\) people get on the bus. The number of people on the bus after the first stop is:
\[48 - 8 + 40 = 80\]

On the second stop, 21 people get off. Then, 3 times fewer people get on compared to those who got off. So, \(21 / 3 = 7\) people get on the bus. The number of people on the bus after the second stop is:
\[80 - 21 + 7 = 66\]

The final numerical answer is 66."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, Jame's current age is \( 27 - 5 = 22 \) years.

2. **Determine the cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 22 + 8 = 30 \) years old.
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \).
   - Therefore, Jame's cousin will be \( 60 - 5 = 55 \) years old in 8 years.

3. **Determine the cousin's current age:**
   - If Jame's cousin will be 55 in 8 years, then the cousin's current age is \( 55 - 8 = 47 \) years.

4. **Determine the age difference between Jame and his cousin:**
   - Jame is currently 22 years old.
   - Jame's cousin is currently 47 years old.
   - The age difference is \( 47 - 22 = 25 \) years.

The final numerical answer is 25."
"Let's break down the information given:

- The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400.
- The computer costs $1,100.
- The printer costs $400 less than the computer, so the printer costs $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the computer and the printer:
- Cost of the computer: $1,100
- Cost of the printer: $700
- Total cost of the computer and the printer: $1,100 + $700 = $1,800

Since the total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400, we can find the total cost of the 2 monitors by subtracting the total cost of the computer and the printer from the total cost:
- Total cost of the computer and the printer: $1,800
- Total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer: $2,400
- Total cost of the 2 monitors: $2,400 - $1,800 = $600

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the total cost of the 2 monitors by 2:
- Total cost of the 2 monitors: $600
- Cost of one monitor: $600 / 2 = $300

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is $300."
"To find out how many seashells each girl brought, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of boys and girls.
2. Calculate the total number of seashells brought by the boys.
3. Calculate the total number of seashells brought by the girls.

First, since there are 20 kids in total and they are divided into two equal groups of girls and boys, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

Next, each boy brought back 60 seashells. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is:
\[ 10 \text{ boys} \times 60 \text{ seashells/boy} = 600 \text{ seashells} \]

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. So, the total number of seashells brought by the girls is:
\[ 600 \text{ seashells} + 4 \times 600 \text{ seashells} = 600 \text{ seashells} + 2400 \text{ seashells} = 3000 \text{ seashells} \]

Since there are 10 girls, the number of seashells each girl brought is:
\[ \frac{3000 \text{ seashells}}{10 \text{ girls}} = 300 \text{ seashells/girl} \]

Thus, the number of seashells brought by each girl is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"If George has 3 candies left after eating 5, it means George originally had 3 + 5 = 8 candies. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George originally, Nick had 2 * 8 = 16 candies. Therefore, the final answer is 16."
"First, let's determine Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, we can calculate Alyana's age as follows:

Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4
Alyana's age = 10 - 4
Alyana's age = 6

Next, we need to find Anne's age. Since Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, we can calculate Anne's age as follows:

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2
Anne's age = 6 + 2
Anne's age = 8

Therefore, Anne is 8 years old."
"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and then sum them up.

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so its thickness is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so its thickness is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm.

Now, we sum the thicknesses of all four books:
\[31 + 50 + 45 + 62\]

Let's calculate the sum:
\[31 + 50 = 81\]
\[81 + 45 = 126\]
\[126 + 62 = 188\]

Therefore, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma still needs to make to complete her monthly goal of 72 vlogs, we can subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her monthly goal.

Vlogs made so far: 18 (first week) + 21 (second week) + 15 (third week) = 54 vlogs

Vlogs needed to reach the goal: 72 (monthly goal) - 54 (vlogs made so far) = 18 vlogs

So, Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete her 72 vlogs per month."
"To determine how much you ended up paying, we need to calculate the total cost including the tip.

First, calculate the tip:
\[ \text{Tip} = 20\% \text{ of } \$50 = 0.20 \times 50 = \$10 \]

Next, add the tip to the original bill:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$50 + \$10 = \$60 \]

Since you are to pay an additional 20% tip on the total cost, you are essentially paying the total cost. Therefore, you ended up paying:
\[ \$60 \]"
"First, let's determine the initial share of each boy when $18 is shared among 3 boys. Each boy gets:

\[
\frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ dollars}
\]

The eldest boy receives an additional $5, so his share becomes:

\[
6 + 5 = 11 \text{ dollars}
\]

The following day, the eldest boy adds another $10 to his share:

\[
11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars}
\]

The eldest boy then spends $8 from his total:

\[
21 - 8 = 13 \text{ dollars}
\]

After spending $8, the eldest boy has $13 left. He then triples the amount he had left after spending the $8:

\[
13 \times 3 = 39 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the final amount the eldest boy has is:

\[
\boxed{39}

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable parts. First, we need to determine the total amount Elvis needs to save in April and then figure out how much he needs to save in the second half of the month.

April has 30 days. Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125. Therefore, he needs to save $1125 in April.

Let's denote the number of days in the first half of April as \( x \). Consequently, the number of days in the second half of April would be \( 30 - x \).

According to the problem, Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half. Let's denote the daily savings in the first half as \( y \). Therefore, the daily savings in the second half would be \( 2y \).

The total savings for the first half of April would be \( x \cdot y \), and the total savings for the second half of April would be \( (30 - x) \cdot 2y \).

The sum of these savings should equal Elvis's monthly target:
\[ x \cdot y + (30 - x) \cdot 2y = 1125 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ xy + 60y - 2xy = 1125 \]
\[ 60y - xy = 1125 \]
\[ y(60 - x) = 1125 \]

To find \( y \), we need to determine \( x \). Since \( x \) must be a whole number between 0 and 30, we can test values to find a suitable \( x \).

Let's test \( x = 15 \):
\[ y(60 - 15) = 1125 \]
\[ 45y = 1125 \]
\[ y = \frac{1125}{45} \]
\[ y = 25 \]

So, Elvis saves $25 per day in the first half of April. In the second half, he saves \( 2 \times 25 = 50 \) dollars per day.

To verify, let's calculate the total savings:
- First half: \( 15 \times 25 = 375 \) dollars
- Second half: \( 15 \times 50 = 750 \) dollars
- Total: \( 375 + 750 = 1125 \) dollars

The calculations confirm that Elvis needs to save $50 per day in the second half of April to meet his target.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the apples:
\[ 3 \text{ apples} \times \$1.50 \text{ per apple} = 3 \times 1.50 = \$4.50 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the oranges:
\[ 5 \text{ oranges} \times \$0.80 \text{ per orange} = 5 \times 0.80 = \$4.00 \]

Then, let's calculate the total cost of the peaches:
\[ 6 \text{ peaches} \times \$0.75 \text{ per peach} = 6 \times 0.75 = \$4.50 \]

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the fruits:
\[ \$4.50 + \$4.00 + \$4.50 = \$13.00 \]

Verna gave $20 to the seller. To find out how much change she received, we subtract the total cost of the fruits from the amount she gave:
\[ \$20.00 - \$13.00 = \$7.00 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$7.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Jairus earns for completing 20 tasks. Jairus earns $0.8 for each task, so for 20 tasks, he earns:

\[ 0.8 \times 20 = 16 \]

Next, let's calculate how much Jenny earns for completing 20 tasks. Jenny earns $0.5 for each task, so for 20 tasks, she earns:

\[ 0.5 \times 20 = 10 \]

Now, to find out how much more Jairus earns than Jenny, we subtract Jenny's earnings from Jairus's earnings:

\[ 16 - 10 = 6 \]

So, Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny."
"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars. The total amount of money is $100, so we can write the equation:

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets $20. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's amount as:

\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets $80. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 80 \]"
"Jeff walks 3 miles to work and 3 miles back home each day, so he walks a total of 6 miles each day. If he has to work 5 times a week, then the total number of miles he walks in a week is:

"To determine the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Rewriting**: Elise writes the entire alphabet twice.
   - The alphabet has 26 letters.
   - Therefore, writing it twice means \(26 \times 2 = 52\) letters.

2. **Second Rewriting**: Elise writes half of the alphabet once.
   - Half of the alphabet is \(26 / 2 = 13\) letters.
   - Therefore, writing half of the alphabet once means \(13\) letters.

3. **Third Rewriting**: Elise rewrites everything she has already written.
   - This includes the two full alphabets and the half alphabet.
   - The total number of letters already written is \(52 + 13 = 65\).
   - Rewriting everything means writing \(65\) letters again.

Now, we sum up all the letters written:
- First rewriting: \(52\) letters.
- Second rewriting: \(13\) letters.
- Third rewriting: \(65\) letters.

Adding these together:
\[ 52 + 13 + 65 = 130 \]

Therefore, the total number of letters Elise has written is:
\[ 130 \]"

"First, let's determine the daily recommended cups of coffee for Octavia. Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, if the daily recommended cups of coffee is \( R \), then Octavia drinks \( \frac{R}{2} \) cups of coffee.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks, so Juan drinks \( 10 \times \frac{R}{2} = 5R \) cups of coffee.

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. Therefore, Juan needs to reduce his coffee intake from \( 5R \) cups to 4 cups.

To find out by how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we calculate the difference between \( 5R \) and 4:

\[ 5R - 4 \]

Since the daily recommended cups of coffee for Octavia is \( R \), and we are not given the exact value of \( R \), we can express the reduction in terms of \( R \):

\[ 5R - 4 \]

Thus, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by \( 5R - 4 \) cups."

\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pages she can read in 105 minutes. We know that she can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. Therefore, the number of pages she reads per minute is:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of pages read in the first week:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages. So, the total number of pages read in two weeks is:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

Thus, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \) sandwiches. Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, which is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \) sandwiches. Together, they ate \( 4 + 3 = 7 \) sandwiches. Therefore, the number of sandwiches left is \( 12 - 7 = 5 \).

The final numerical answer is 5."
"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equation based on the information given.

Let \( S \) be Shiloh's current age, and let \( N \) be his nephew's current age.

From the problem, we know:
1. Shiloh is currently 44 years old, so \( S = 44 \).
2. In 7 years, Shiloh will be \( S + 7 \) years old.
3. In 7 years, his nephew will be \( N + 7 \) years old.
4. In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew, so \( S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \).

Now, substitute \( S = 44 \) into the equation:
\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3N + 21 \]
\[ 51 - 21 = 3N \]
\[ 30 = 3N \]
\[ N = 10 \]

So, his nephew is currently 10 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
10"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Tooth:**
   - The tooth fairy left $5.00.

2. **Next Three Teeth:**
   - For each of these teeth, the tooth fairy gave $1.00.
   - Total for these three teeth: \(3 \times 1.00 = 3.00\).

3. **Last Two Teeth:**
   - For the first of these last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of the previous three teeth, which is \( \frac{1.00}{2} = 0.50 \).
   - For the second of these last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of the previous two teeth, which is \( \frac{1.00}{2} = 0.50 \).
   - Total for these two teeth: \(0.50 + 0.50 = 1.00\).

Now, let's sum up all the amounts:

- First tooth: $5.00
- Next three teeth: $3.00
- Last two teeth: $1.00

Total amount: \(5.00 + 3.00 + 1.00 = 9.00\).

The tooth fairy left Sharon $9.00 in total."
"To find out how many goals all three teenagers scored, we need to determine the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna based on the information given about Richie.

Given:
- Richie scored 80 goals.
- Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark.
- Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna.

First, we calculate the number of goals scored by Mark:
\[ \text{Goals scored by Mark} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 20 = 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate the number of goals scored by Anna:
\[ \text{Goals scored by Anna} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 45 = 80 - 45 = 35 \]

Now, we sum the goals scored by all three teenagers:
\[ \text{Total goals} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} + \text{Goals scored by Mark} + \text{Goals scored by Anna} = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 \]

"First, let's determine how much money Peter spends on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. He buys one wooden action figure each day, and each wooden action figure costs $5. Therefore, the total cost for the wooden action figures is:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the wooden action figures, the remaining amount of money Peter has is:

\[ 70 \text{ dollars} - 20 \text{ dollars} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, Peter will spend the remaining $50 on plastic action figures, which cost $2 each. The number of plastic action figures he can buy is:

\[ \frac{50 \text{ dollars}}{2 \text{ dollars/plastic action figure}} = 25 \text{ plastic action figures} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week. He bought 4 wooden action figures and 25 plastic action figures, so the total number of action figures is:

\[ 4 + 25 = 29 \]

Thus, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is:

"To calculate the total cost, we need to add up all the expenses:

1. Cost of spaying the kitten: $200
2. Cost of 3 vaccines: $20 each, so 3 vaccines cost $20 * 3 = $60
3. Cost of repairing 4 broken vases: $12 each, so 4 vases cost $12 * 4 = $48

Now, we add these amounts together:

$200 (spaying) + $60 (vaccines) + $48 (repairing vases) = $308

So, the total cost so far is $308."
"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses he grows in a month and compare it to the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops.

First, let's calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a week:
\[ 40 \text{ roses/week} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of roses he grows in a month (assuming a month has 4 weeks):
\[ 40 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 160 \text{ roses/month} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by which the oven is off and then apply that same percentage to the 520 degrees required by the recipe.

First, let's find the percentage by which the oven is off when set to 450 degrees. The actual temperature is 468 degrees when the oven is set to 450 degrees.

The difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature is:
\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage by which the oven is off is:
\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

Now, we need to apply this 4% off percentage to the 520 degrees required by the recipe to find the correct temperature setting.

The temperature to be set is:
\[ 520 - (520 \times 0.04) = 520 - 20.8 = 499.2 \]

90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is 215 minutes."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we first need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and then subtract that from Herb's price.

Herb's house price = $76,000

30% of Herb's house price = 0.30 * $76,000 = $22,800

Juan's house price = Herb's house price - 30% of Herb's house price
Juan's house price = $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

Now, we add the prices of both houses to find the combined value:

Combined value = Herb's house price + Juan's house price
Combined value = $76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200

The final numerical answer is $129,200."
"First, let's determine the number of cups and dishes Judy initially bought.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups.

She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.

At the event, her friend brought 40 cups. Since Judy initially bought 12 cups, her friend brought \(40 - 12 = 28\) more cups than Judy bought.

Her friend also brought 20 more dishes than Judy bought. Since Judy bought 24 dishes, her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend.

Total cups brought:
\[12 \text{ (Judy's cups)} + 40 \text{ (friend's cups)} = 52 \text{ cups}\]

Total dishes brought:
\[24 \text{ (Judy's dishes)} + 44 \text{ (friend's dishes)} = 68 \text{ dishes}\]

The total number of utensils (cups and dishes) brought by the two is:
\[52 \text{ cups} + 68 \text{ dishes} = 120 \text{ utensils}\]

So, the discounted price of one box is:

\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

Since Pete is buying 2 boxes, the total cost for 2 boxes is:

\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost per pair of contacts. Since each box contains 90 single use contacts, 2 boxes will contain:

\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \]

Therefore, the cost per pair of contacts is:

\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total hours Jill worked.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so:
\[ \text{Total hours Jill worked} = 2 + 1 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Tabitha agreed to pay $10 per hour, so Jill's earnings are:
\[ \text{Jill's earnings} = 3 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$30 \]

Next, let's calculate the total hours John worked.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so:
\[ \text{John's hours on Saturday} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so:
\[ \text{John's hours on Sunday} = 3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, John's total hours worked are:
\[ \text{John's total hours} = 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ hours} \]

John's earnings are:
\[ \text{John's earnings} = 7 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$70 \]

Now, to find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill:

"First, let's calculate the total calories burned from aerobics and running.

For aerobics:
- Hannah spends 2 hours doing aerobics.
- Aerobics burn 500 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from aerobics = 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.

For running:
- Hannah spends 1 hour running.
- Running burns 600 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from running = 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.

Now, let's add the calories burned from both activities:
- Total calories burned = calories from aerobics + calories from running = 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories.

Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. To find out how many ml of water she needs to drink for 1600 calories, we can set up a proportion:

\[ \frac{100 \text{ ml}}{200 \text{ calories}} = \frac{x \text{ ml}}{1600 \text{ calories}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{100 \text{ ml} \times 1600 \text{ calories}}{200 \text{ calories}} = \frac{160000 \text{ ml-calories}}{200 \text{ calories}} = 800 \text{ ml} \]

So, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the note, the number of red jelly beans is 1% less than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \). Similarly, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of the red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

So, the number of blue jelly beans is 1500. Now we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

- Number of red jelly beans: \( 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \)
- Number of green jelly beans: \( 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \)

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 30."

For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. So, the additional cost for the porcelain crown is:
\[ 500 \]

The total cost for the dental work is:
\[ 4000 + 500 = 4500 \]

George has already put down a deposit of $600. Therefore, the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
\[ 4500 - 600 = 3900 \]

George makes $15 per hour at work. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
\[ \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \]

So, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 260 \]"
"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees, and the other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees. The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees and \( 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees. The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The measure of the largest angle in the triangle is \(\boxed{90}\) degrees."
"First, let's determine the total amount of money Colby has in cents.

- Quarters: 8 quarters * 25 cents = 200 cents
- Dimes: 6 dimes * 10 cents = 60 cents
- Nickels: 14 nickels * 5 cents = 70 cents
- Pennies: 15 pennies * 1 cent = 15 cents

Now, let's sum up all the cents:
200 cents (from quarters) + 60 cents (from dimes) + 70 cents (from nickels) + 15 cents (from pennies) = 345 cents

Each gumball costs 5 cents. To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of one gumball:
345 cents / 5 cents per gumball = 69 gumballs

The final numerical answer is 69."
"To determine the total number of legs in the pet store, we need to consider the number of legs each type of pet has and then multiply by the number of each type of pet.

- Dogs have 4 legs each.
- Cats have 4 legs each.
- Birds have 2 legs each.

Given:
- There are 5 dogs.
- There are 2 cats.
- There are 10 birds.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet:
- Total legs from dogs: \(5 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 20 \text{ legs}\)
- Total legs from cats: \(2 \text{ cats} \times 4 \text{ legs/cat} = 8 \text{ legs}\)
- Total legs from birds: \(10 \text{ birds} \times 2 \text{ legs/bird} = 20 \text{ legs}\)

Finally, we sum up the legs from all the pets:
\[20 \text{ legs (dogs)} + 8 \text{ legs (cats)} + 20 \text{ legs (birds)} = 48 \text{ legs}\]

The total number of legs in the pet store is 48."

- Total games after Year 3: 51 + 48 + 5 = 104 games

Therefore, the final number of games Steve has after 3 years is 104."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the plane. The speed can be calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken.

Speed = Distance / Time

Given that the plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, the speed is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same speed.

Time = Distance / Speed

For the additional 2000 miles:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, the additional hours required to travel an additional 2000 miles is 5 hours."
"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we can calculate the hourly rate for Ruiz as follows:

\[ \text{Ruiz's hourly rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. According to the problem, Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we can calculate the amount Marissa makes in one hour as follows:

\[ \text{Marissa's hourly rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 60 \text{ pounds per hour} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of chocolates Ruiz and Marissa make together in 12 hours. First, we calculate the total amount Ruiz makes in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Ruiz's total in 12 hours} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Marissa makes in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Marissa's total in 12 hours} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the totals together to find the combined total amount of chocolates made by Ruiz and Marissa in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Total amount of chocolates} = 720 \text{ pounds} + 540 \text{ pounds} = 1260 \text{ pounds} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much money Howard has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spends at the arcade over the three days and then subtract that from his initial amount of $100.

1. **Monday**: Howard spends $8.
2. **Tuesday**: He spends twice as much as he did on Monday, which is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
3. **Wednesday**: He spends 4 times as much as he did on Tuesday, which is \(4 \times 16 = 64\) dollars.

Now, we sum up the total amount spent over the three days:
\[ 8 + 16 + 64 = 88 \text{ dollars} \]

Howard originally had $100. After spending $88, the amount of money he has left is:
\[ 100 - 88 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"To calculate the total earnings from selling lemonade, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the earnings from the first four hours and the earnings from the next two hours.

For the first four hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.
- Total cups sold in four hours: \(15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ cups}\).
- Total earnings from the first four hours: \(60 \text{ cups} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = \$30\).

For the next two hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.
- Total cups sold in two hours: \(10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ cups}\).
- Total earnings from the next two hours: \(20 \text{ cups} \times \$0.60/\text{cup} = \$12\).

Adding the earnings from both periods:
- Total earnings: \(\$30 + \$12 = \$42\).

"First, let's determine the total number of rotations the tires go through in a month. Given that the car drives 400 miles a month and the tires rotate 725 times for every 2 miles, we can calculate the total rotations per month as follows:

\[ \text{Rotations per mile} = \frac{725}{2} \]
\[ \text{Rotations per month} = 400 \times \frac{725}{2} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of rotations per month:

\[ \text{Rotations per month} = 400 \times 362.5 = 145000 \]

Now, we know that each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations. To find out how many months the tires can last, we divide the total number of rotations each tire can handle by the number of rotations per month:

\[ \text{Months per tire} = \frac{10,440,000}{145000} \]

Let's calculate this value:

\[ \text{Months per tire} = 72 \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can find out how many years the tires can last by dividing the number of months per tire by 12:

\[ \text{Years per tire} = \frac{72}{12} = 6 \]

Therefore, the tires can last for 6 years before they need to be replaced. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To find out how much each pump costs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of washes Jackie can get from one bottle of shampoo.
2. Calculate the cost per pump.

First, the directions say that 2 pumps give 120 washes. Therefore, each pump gives:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washes per pump} \]

The jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00. To find the cost per pump in dollars, we divide the total cost by the number of pumps:
\[ \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 12.00 \text{ dollars per pump} \]

To convert the cost per pump from dollars to cents, we multiply by 100 (since 1 dollar = 100 cents):
\[ 12.00 \text{ dollars} \times 100 = 1200 \text{ cents} \]

So, the cost per pump is 1200 cents."
"First, let's calculate the discount on the shirt and the shorts.

The shirt's original price is $25, and it has a 30% off sale.
The discount on the shirt is \( 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \).

So, the shirt's sale price is \( 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \).

The shorts' original price is $35, and it also has a 30% off sale.
The discount on the shorts is \( 35 \times 0.30 = 10.50 \).

So, the shorts' sale price is \( 35 - 10.50 = 24.50 \).

Now, let's add the sale prices of the shirt and the shorts to find the total cost of the outfit.
The total cost is \( 17.50 + 24.50 = 42.00 \).

"To determine how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a week.
2. Determine the total amount of butter needed based on the number of dozens.

Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:

\[ \text{Total dozens of croissants} = 4 \, \text{dozen/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 28 \, \text{dozen} \]

It takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. Therefore, to find out how many pounds of butter are needed for 28 dozen croissants, we multiply the number of dozens by the amount of butter needed per dozen:

\[ \text{Total pounds of butter} = 28 \, \text{dozen} \times \frac{1}{4} \, \text{pound/dozen} = 7 \, \text{pounds} \]

So, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week."
"First, we need to calculate the cost to repave Monica's street. The cost is $194 per meter and the length of Monica's street is 150 meters.

\[ \text{Cost for Monica's street} = 150 \text{ meters} \times 194 \text{ dollars/meter} = 29100 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street. The length of Lewis' street is 490 meters.

\[ \text{Cost for Lewis' street} = 490 \text{ meters} \times 194 \text{ dollars/meter} = 94860 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we subtract the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis' street.

\[ \text{Difference in cost} = 94860 \text{ dollars} - 29100 \text{ dollars} = 65760 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the funding into two parts: the initial 5 months and the extended 5 months.

1. **Initial 5 months funding:**
   - John receives $100,000 for the first 5 months.

2. **Extended 5 months funding:**
   - The research takes 10 times longer than the initial 5 months, so it takes \(5 \times 10 = 50\) months in total.
   - The first 5 months cost $100,000.
   - The remaining 45 months (50 months - 5 months) cost 50% more per month than the initial $100,000 / 5 = $20,000 per month.
   - The new monthly funding for the extended period is \(20,000 \times 1.5 = 30,000\) dollars per month.
   - Therefore, the total funding for the extended 45 months is \(45 \times 30,000 = 1,350,000\) dollars.

3. **Total cost:**
   - Summing the initial and extended funding gives us \(100,000 + 1,350,000 = 1,450,000\) dollars.

\[ \text{Speed in Mb/hour} = 72 \text{ Mb/hour} \]

So, Ashley’s internet connection speed in Mb per hour is 72 Mb/hour."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the total number of cars towed over the week.

First, let's calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days:
- On the first day, the tow truck pulled 10 cars.
- On the second day, the tow truck pulled 10 cars.
- On the third day, the tow truck pulled 10 cars.

So, for the first three days, the total number of cars towed is:
\[ 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \]

Next, we need to calculate the number of cars towed on the remaining days of the week. There are four remaining days (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday), and the tow truck pulled four fewer cars each day than it did on the first three days. Therefore, the number of cars towed each of these days is:
\[ 10 - 4 = 6 \]

So, for the remaining four days, the total number of cars towed is:
\[ 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 24 \]

Now, we add the number of cars towed over the first three days to the number of cars towed over the remaining four days to get the total number of cars towed that week:
\[ 30 + 24 = 54 \]

Thus, the total number of cars towed that week is:
\[ \boxed{54} \]"
"First, we need to convert Adam's current height from inches to feet to compare it with the required height. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, Adam's height in feet is:

\[ 40 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{40}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The minimum height required to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. Therefore, Adam needs to grow:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Adam grows 2 inches per year, which is equivalent to \(\frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6}\) feet per year. To find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet, we divide \(\frac{2}{3}\) by \(\frac{1}{6}\):

\[ \frac{2}{3} \div \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Therefore, Adam will be tall enough to ride the roller coaster in 4 years. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 cars James sold:
\[ \text{Total cost of cars} = 10 \times \$25,000 = \$250,000 \]

Next, we calculate the amount the company paid to acquire these cars:
\[ \text{Cost to acquire the cars} = 30\% \times \$250,000 = 0.30 \times \$250,000 = \$75,000 \]

Now, we find the total profit from selling the cars:
\[ \text{Total profit} = \text{Total cost of cars} - \text{Cost to acquire the cars} = \$250,000 - \$75,000 = \$175,000 \]

James gets a 10% commission on the profits:
\[ \text{James's commission} = 10\% \times \$175,000 = 0.10 \times \$175,000 = \$17,500 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$17,500 \]"
"First, let's determine how many riders can stay upright on the wave. Since only 25% of the riders can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives, we calculate:

\[ 100 \text{ riders} \times 0.25 = 25 \text{ riders} \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 25 riders are women. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we calculate:

\[ 25 \text{ riders} \times 0.60 = 15 \text{ women} \]

Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright is the total number of riders who can stay upright minus the number of women who can stay upright:

\[ 25 \text{ riders} - 15 \text{ women} = 10 \text{ men} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 10 \]"
"First, let's find the price of the gold jewel. Given that the price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel, and the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

\[
\text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600
\]

Next, we need to find the price of the silver jewel. The problem states that the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of the gold jewel. Therefore, we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

\[
\text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
\]

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond jewel, the gold jewel, and the silver jewel:

\[
\text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800
\]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of truck stamps Max bought. Since he bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, and he bought 16 snowflake stamps, the number of truck stamps is:

\[ 16 + 3 = 19 \]

Next, we need to find out how many rose stamps Max bought. He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. Since he bought 19 truck stamps, the number of rose stamps is:

\[ 19 - 9 = 10 \]

Now, we can find the total number of stamps Max bought by adding the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps together:

\[ 16 + 19 + 10 = 45 \]

So, the total number of stamps Max bought is:

\[ 45 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between him and Bob.

First, let's calculate the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap. Since Bob is driving at 55 mph and Tom is driving at 70 mph, Tom is closing the gap at a rate of:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it will take for Tom to cover the 75-mile gap at this relative speed. The time \( t \) can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ t = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} \]

\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"If Naomi caught 17 fish, and Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, then Darren caught:
\[ 17 - 6 = 11 \text{ fish} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 14."
"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the maximum cost per class and then find out how many classes he can attend without exceeding this cost.

First, let's denote the total cost of the 10 classes as \( C \). The total cost is given as $60. If the cost per class exceeds $10, his parents will not sign him up again. Therefore, we need to find the maximum number of classes \( n \) such that the cost per class is not more than $10.

The cost per class if he attends \( n \) classes is:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{n} \]

We need to find the maximum \( n \) such that:
\[ \frac{60}{n} \leq 10 \]

Solving for \( n \):
\[ 60 \leq 10n \]
\[ n \geq \frac{60}{10} \]
\[ n \geq 6 \]

This means Manny can miss up to \( 10 - 6 = 4 \) classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \]"
"To determine the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we first need to find out how many customers each of them processes in a day.

Given:
- Jewel processes 50 customers per day.
- Julie processes twice as many customers as Jewel per day.

First, calculate the number of customers Julie processes per day:
\[ \text{Julie's daily customers} = 2 \times \text{Jewel's daily customers} = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Next, calculate the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel in one day:
\[ \text{Total daily customers} = \text{Jewel's daily customers} + \text{Julie's daily customers} = 50 + 100 = 150 \]

Now, to find the total weekly production, we multiply the total daily customers by the number of days in a week (7 days):
\[ \text{Total weekly customers} = \text{Total daily customers} \times 7 = 150 \times 7 = 1050 \]

Thus, the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel is:
\[ 1050 \]"
"First, let's determine how many miles Reggie ran. Since Paisley ran 4 miles and Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, we calculate:

\[ \text{Reggie's distance} = 5 \times \text{Paisley's distance} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. So, to find out how many miles Lynn ran, we subtract 3 miles from Reggie's distance:

\[ \text{Lynn's distance} = \text{Reggie's distance} - 3 = 20 - 3 = 17 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 17 \]"
"First, let's find the cost of one apple and one orange.

The cost of four apples is $5.20, so the cost of one apple is:
\[ \text{Cost of one apple} = \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \]

The cost of three oranges is $3.30, so the cost of one orange is:
\[ \text{Cost of one orange} = \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \]

Now, we need to find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

The cost of 5 apples is:
\[ \text{Cost of 5 apples} = 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \]

The cost of 5 oranges is:
\[ \text{Cost of 5 oranges} = 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 12.00 \]"
"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the hole:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel one cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) it will take him to dig the hole is:

\[ T = \text{volume} \times \text{time per cubic foot} \]
\[ T = 72 \times 3 = 216 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of each additional feature:

1. King cab upgrade: $7,500
2. Leather seats: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so $7,500 / 3 = $2,500
3. Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats, so $2,500 - $500 = $2,000
4. Upgraded exterior light package: $1,500

Now, let's sum up the costs of these features:

Total cost of additional features = $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $13,500

Finally, we add the base price of the truck to the total cost of the additional features:

Total cost of Bill's new truck = $30,000 (base price) + $13,500 (additional features) = $43,500

The final numerical answer is $43,500."

So, Tim will make $372000 in a year."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the wardrobe components:

1. **Cost of suits:**
   - James buys 10 suits.
   - Each suit costs $750.
   - Total cost for suits = 10 * $750 = $7500.

2. **Cost of dress pants:**
   - The cost of dress pants is 1/5 the cost of a suit.
   - Cost of one pair of dress pants = $750 / 5 = $150.
   - James buys 10 pairs of dress pants.
   - Total cost for dress pants = 10 * $150 = $1500.

3. **Cost of dress shirts:**
   - James buys 3 dress shirts per suit.
   - He buys 10 suits, so he buys 10 * 3 = 30 dress shirts.
   - Each dress shirt costs $60.

"To determine the total time Bill will take to dig the well, we need to calculate the time taken to dig through the soil and the time taken to dig through the clay separately, and then sum these times.

First, let's calculate the time to dig through the soil:
- Bill digs at a rate of 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He needs to dig 24 feet of soil.

\[
\text{Time to dig through soil} = \frac{\text{Distance through soil}}{\text{Rate through soil}} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}

1. **Determine the sales from green hats in the first month:**
   - The sales from red hats in the first month were $400.
   - The sales from green hats in the first month were twice the sales from red hats.
   - Therefore, the sales from green hats in the first month were \( 2 \times 400 = 800 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total sales in the first month:**
   - The total sales in the first month were the sum of the sales from red and green hats.
   - Total sales in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
   - Total sales in the first month = \( 400 + 800 = 1200 \) dollars.

3. **Determine the sales in the second month:**
   - The sales in the second month were \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total sales of the first month.
   - Sales in the second month = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \) dollars.

2. Sheep have 1 head and geese have 1 head.
3. The total number of animal legs is 70.
4. The total number of animal heads is 20.

From the information given, we can set up the following equations:
\[ 4S + 2G = 70 \]
\[ S + G = 20 \]

We can solve these equations step by step. First, let's solve the second equation for \( G \):
\[ G = 20 - S \]

Next, substitute \( G \) in the first equation:
\[ 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]
\[ 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ 2S + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2S = 30 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \( 15 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs. When there are 8 more dogs, he needs to buy toys for these additional dogs. Since each dog needs one toy, he needs 8 more toys. So, after the first purchase, he has 4 (initial toys) + 8 (additional toys) = 12 toys.

When James came back, there were twice as many more dogs than when he left, which means there were 8 * 2 = 16 more dogs. So, he needs to buy toys for these 16 dogs. After this purchase, he has 12 (toys after first purchase) + 16 (additional toys) = 28 toys.

However, when James came back again, 3 dogs were gone, so he no longer needed those toys. Therefore, he had to return 3 toys. So, the total number of toys he needs is 28 (toys after second purchase) - 3 (returned toys) = 25 toys.

Given:
- Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max.
- Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster.
- Summer has 23 more cookies than Max.
- Katarina has 68 cookies.

From the information, we can write the following equations:
1. \( K = M - 5 \)
2. \( M = C + 12 \)
3. \( S = M + 23 \)
4. \( K = 68 \)

First, we substitute \( K = 68 \) into the first equation to find \( M \):
\[ 68 = M - 5 \]
\[ M = 68 + 5 \]
\[ M = 73 \]

Next, we use \( M = 73 \) to find \( C \):
\[ M = C + 12 \]
\[ 73 = C + 12 \]
\[ C = 73 - 12 \]
\[ C = 61 \]

Now, we use \( M = 73 \) to find \( S \):
\[ S = M + 23 \]
\[ S = 73 + 23 \]
\[ S = 96 \]

Finally, we calculate the total number of cookies they have:
\[ \text{Total} = K + M + C + S \]

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( Tr \).

Given that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can write:
\[ T = Tr + 7 \]

We also know that the combined ages of the twins and the triplets are 44:
\[ T + T + Tr + Tr + Tr = 44 \]
\[ 2T + 3Tr = 44 \]

Substituting \( T = Tr + 7 \) into the equation:
\[ 2(Tr + 7) + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 2Tr + 14 + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr = 30 \]
\[ Tr = 6 \]

Now, substituting \( Tr = 6 \) back into the equation \( T = Tr + 7 \):
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Since each vaccine costs $20 and John needs 2 vaccines, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \]

Next, let's denote the cost of the heartworm check as \( H \). According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as \( T \). Therefore, we have:
\[ H = 0.6T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + H \]

Since \( H = 0.6T \), we can substitute \( H \) in the total bill equation:
\[ T = 40 + 0.6T \]

To find \( T \), we need to solve this equation. Subtract \( 0.6T \) from both sides:
\[ T - 0.6T = 40 \]
\[ 0.4T = 40 \]

Now, divide both sides by 0.4:
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.4} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:

"First, let's determine the points collected by each student:

1. Adam has collected 50 points.
2. Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. So, Betty's points are:
   \[
   50 + (0.30 \times 50) = 50 + 15 = 65 \text{ points}
   \]
3. Tom has 30 points less than Betty. So, Tom's points are:
   \[
   65 - 30 = 35 \text{ points}
   \]
4. Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. So, Marta's points are:
   \[
   3 \times 35 = 105 \text{ points}
   \]

Now, let's sum up the points collected by Adam, Betty, Tom, and Marta:
\[
50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 \text{ points}

"To determine the number of great grand-babies at the family reunion, we need to follow the lineage step by step.

1. **Great Grandma Jones has three children.**
   - Number of children = 3

2. **Each of her children has three children of their own (Great Grandma Jones' grandchildren).**
   - Number of grandchildren per child = 3
   - Total number of grandchildren = 3 children * 3 grandchildren per child = 9

3. **Each of these grandchildren has three babies of their own (Great Grandma Jones' great grand-babies).**
   - Number of great grand-babies per grandchild = 3
   - Total number of great grand-babies = 9 grandchildren * 3 great grand-babies per grandchild = 27

Therefore, if all of the family show up at the family reunion, there will be 27 great grand-babies for Great Grandma Jones to kiss."
"First, let's calculate how much Greta puts into her retirement account. She puts 50% of her $2400.00 paycheck into her retirement account:

\[ 2400 \times 0.50 = 1200 \]

So, she has $1200 left after putting money into her retirement account.

Next, we calculate how much she uses for her monthly car payment. She uses 20% of her $2400.00 paycheck for her car payment:

\[ 2400 \times 0.20 = 480 \]

So, she has $480 left after paying for her car.

Now, we subtract the amount spent on her car payment from the remaining amount after retirement contributions:

\[ 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Greta has left to spend is $720."
"To determine how many pairs of pencils are in the box, we first need to find out how many pencils are actually in the box. Initially, the box can hold 20 pencils, but 4 are missing. Therefore, the number of pencils currently in the box is:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \]

Next, we need to find out how many pairs of pencils are in the box. Since each pair consists of 2 pencils, we divide the number of pencils by 2:

\[ \frac{16}{2} = 8 \]

So, the number of pairs of pencils in the box is 8. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the total number of people in the group. Aiden and his 12 friends are going to the cinema, and they meet up with 7 more friends. So the total number of people is:

\[ 1 + 12 + 7 = 20 \]

Each person gets one seat, two drinks, and three snacks. Since each drink and each snack costs $2, we can calculate the cost for each person:

- Cost of drinks per person: \(2 \text{ drinks} \times \$2 \text{ per drink} = \$4\)
- Cost of snacks per person: \(3 \text{ snacks} \times \$2 \text{ per snack} = \$6\)

So, the total cost per person for drinks and snacks is:

\[ \$4 + \$6 = \$10 \]

Since there are 20 people in the group, the total cost for all the drinks and snacks is:

\[ 20 \text{ people} \times \$10 \text{ per person} = \$200 \]

Therefore, the group has spent a total of \$200 on drinks and snacks."
"First, let's determine the capacity of Gordy's truck. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, we can calculate Gordy's truck capacity as follows:

\[ \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = \text{Gissela's truck capacity} + 800 \]
\[ \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = 4000 + 800 \]
\[ \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = 4800 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that the combined capacity of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks is 11,600 pounds. Let's denote Gary's truck capacity as \( G \). Therefore, we can write the equation for the total capacity as:

\[ \text{Gissela's truck capacity} + \text{Gordy's truck capacity} + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11600 \]
\[ 4000 + 4800 + G = 11600 \]

Now, we solve for \( G \):

\[ 8800 + G = 11600 \]
\[ G = 11600 - 8800 \]
\[ G = 2800 \]

Thus, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2800 \]"
"If each female ate 3 dumplings and there are 6 females, then the total number of dumplings eaten by the females is:
\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \]

Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, each male ate:
\[ 3 + 1 = 4 \text{ dumplings} \]

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is:
\[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \]

Therefore, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is the sum of the dumplings eaten by the males and the females:
\[ 18 + 32 = 50 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 50 \]"
"First, we need to determine how much money Gerald and Julia received based on the given ratio of 3:2.

The total parts of the ratio are 3 + 2 = 5 parts.

Since the total amount of money is $100, each part of the ratio is worth $100 / 5 = $20.

Gerald's share is 3 parts, so he received 3 * $20 = $60.

After spending $10 on a book, Gerald has $60 - $10 = $50 left.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine the speed of Martha's turtle. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, we can find the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5.

The cat's speed is 15 feet/second. Therefore, the turtle's speed is:
\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Next, we need to find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. We do this by multiplying the turtle's speed by the time:
\[ \text{Distance the turtle can crawl} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of hours required to reach the goal of $6300, given that $2100 has already been raised in the first 3 hours and that the amount raised per hour is constant.

First, we calculate the amount raised per hour:
\[ \text{Amount raised per hour} = \frac{\text{Total amount raised in 3 hours}}{\text{Number of hours}} = \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

Next, we determine the remaining amount needed to reach the goal:
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = \text{Total goal} - \text{Amount already raised} = 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Now, we calculate the number of additional hours required to raise the remaining amount:
\[ \text{Number of additional hours} = \frac{\text{Remaining amount}}{\text{Amount raised per hour}} = \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

Finally, we add the initial 3 hours to the additional hours to find the total number of hours required:
\[ \text{Total number of hours} = \text{Initial hours} + \text{Additional hours} = 3 + 6 = 9 \]

So, the total number of hours they have to fundraise in total to reach their goal is 9 hours."
"To find the percent of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the percentage of water used by the city for industrial purposes.
2. Subtract the industrial usage percentage from 100% to find the non-industrial usage percentage.

First, we know that Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. Out of this 40%, 80% is used for industrial purposes. Therefore, the percentage of water used by the city for industrial purposes is:
\[ 40\% \times 80\% = 40\% \times 0.80 = 32\% \]

Next, to find the percentage of water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the industrial usage percentage from 100%:
\[ 100\% - 32\% = 68\% \]

So, the percent of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is 68%."

"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of baked good:

- Croissants: 5 croissants * $3.00 each = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls * $2.50 each = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches * $4.00 each = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 blueberry muffins * $1.00 each = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:

Total cost = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $49.00

Marcus gets a 10% discount on his purchase. To find the discount amount:

Discount amount = 10% of $49.00 = 0.10 * $49.00 = $4.90

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final bill:

"To determine how much more candy Amy has after two weeks compared to Ginger, we need to calculate the amount of candy each of them eats over that period and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the number of days in two weeks:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ days} \]

Next, we calculate how much candy Ginger eats in 14 days:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Then, we calculate how much candy Amy eats in 14 days:
\[ 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we find out how much candy Ginger has left after 14 days:

"First, let's determine the original price of each computer. The company planned to buy each computer for $700, but the price increased by 10%. To find the new price, we calculate 10% of $700 and add it to the original price.

\[ \text{Increase in price} = 700 \times \frac{10}{100} = 700 \times 0.10 = 70 \]

So, the new price of each computer is:

\[ \text{New price} = 700 + 70 = 770 \]

Now, the company wanted to buy 500 computers at the new price of $770 each. To find the total amount of money they paid, we multiply the new price by the number of computers:

\[ \text{Total amount paid} = 770 \times 500 \]

Let's calculate this value.
```python
# Given values
original_price_per_computer = 700
number_of_computers = 500
price_increase_percentage = 10

# Calculate the new price per computer
increase_in_price = original_price_per_computer * (price_increase_percentage / 100)
new_price_per_computer = original_price_per_computer + increase_in_price

# Calculate the total amount paid
total_amount_paid = new_price_per_computer * number_of_computers
total_amount_paid

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of taps Helga makes with both her feet over the 5-minute period, considering the different tap rates for different parts of her dance.

First, let's calculate the number of taps when her arms are at her sides:
- Right foot tap rate: 300 taps per minute
- Left foot tap rate: 250 taps per minute
- Combined tap rate: 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute

For 3 minutes (since she raises her arms for 2 minutes, she dances with her arms at her sides for 5 - 2 = 3 minutes):
\[ 550 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 1650 \text{ taps} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of taps when her arms are raised:
- Right foot tap rate: 200 taps per minute
- Left foot tap rate: 200 taps per minute
- Combined tap rate: 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute

For 2 minutes:
\[ 400 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 800 \text{ taps} \]

Now, we add the taps from both parts of the dance:

\[ 8 \times 12 + 4 = 96 + 4 = 100 \text{ inches} \]

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( x \) inches. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the number of windows in the students' cars and teachers' cars.

For the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars.
- Each car has 4 windows.
- Therefore, the total number of windows in the students' cars is \(64 \times 4 = 256\) windows.

For the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each car has 2 windows.
- Therefore, the total number of windows in the teachers' cars is \(32 \times 2 = 64\) windows.

Next, we calculate the number of windows Hannah smashes.

For the students' cars:
- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.
- A quarter of 256 windows is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64\) windows.

For the teachers' cars:
- Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows.
- Three-quarters of 64 windows is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48\) windows.

Finally, we add the number of windows smashed in both categories:
- Total windows smashed = 64 (students) + 48 (teachers) = 112 windows.

To find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplifying the fraction:
\[ \frac{60}{150} = \frac{2}{5} \]

Now, calculate the percentage:
\[ \left( \frac{2}{5} \right) \times 100 = 40\% \]

So, the percentage of blue spools is:

"At 8:00, there were 5000 people lined up to vote. By midday (12:00), 2/5 of the people had voted.

First, calculate the number of people who voted by midday:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000 \]

So, the number of people who had not voted by midday is:
\[ 5000 - 2000 = 3000 \]

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. The remaining people after midday were 3000, so 2/3 of 3000 voted by 16:00:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000 \]

Therefore, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is:
\[ 3000 - 2000 = 1000 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1000 \]"
"To determine how many packs of gum Parker will need for 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will chew in 30 days.
2. Determine how many packs of gum are needed based on the total number of pieces.

First, we calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will chew in 30 days:
\[ \text{Total pieces of gum} = \text{Pieces per day} \times \text{Number of days} \]
\[ \text{Total pieces of gum} = 4 \times 30 = 120 \]

Next, we determine how many packs of gum are needed. Since each pack contains 15 pieces of gum:
\[ \text{Number of packs} = \frac{\text{Total pieces of gum}}{\text{Pieces per pack}} \]
\[ \text{Number of packs} = \frac{120}{15} = 8 \]

Therefore, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of smores needed:

- There are 9 kids, and each wants 2 smores, so the kids will need \(9 \times 2 = 18\) smores.
- There are 6 adults, and each will eat 1 smore, so the adults will need \(6 \times 1 = 6\) smores.
- Therefore, the total number of smores needed is \(18 + 6 = 24\) smores.

Next, we need to determine how many graham cracker bases are required to make 24 smores. Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large smores, we need to find out how many sleeves are required for 24 smores:

- Each sleeve makes 8 smores, so for 24 smores, they will need \(\frac{24}{8} = 3\) sleeves.

Since each box contains 3 sleeves, they will need 1 box to have 3 sleeves.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the ages of Dora's father and mother based on the information provided and then calculate the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother.

1. **Dora's Age:**
   Dora is 15 years old.

2. **Dora's Father's Age:**
   According to the problem, Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age.
   \[
   \text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8
   \]
   Substituting Dora's age:
   \[
   \text{Father's age} = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38
   \]

3. **Dora's Mother's Age:**
   Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father.
   \[
   \text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4
   \]
   Substituting the father's age:
   \[
   \text{Mother's age} = 38 - 4 = 34
   \]

4. **Total Combined Age:**
   Now, we sum the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother.
   \[
   \text{Total combined age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age}

"First, let's calculate the total weight of Cindy's math and science books. Since each of these books weighs 2 pounds and there are two of them, the total weight for these books is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds/book} \times 2 \text{ books} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know the weight of her French book is 4 pounds and her English book is 3 pounds. So, the total weight of these two books is:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} + 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

The history book weighs twice as much as her English book. Since her English book weighs 3 pounds, the history book weighs:
\[ 2 \times 3 \text{ pounds} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add up the weights of all the books to find the total weight Cindy is carrying:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} + 7 \text{ pounds} + 6 \text{ pounds} = 17 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is:

"First, let's calculate the number of votes candidate B received. Candidate A received 20% of the votes, and candidate B received 50% more than candidate A's votes.

Candidate A's votes:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ votes} \]

Candidate B's votes:
\[ 50\% \text{ more than candidate A's votes} = 20 + (0.50 \times 20) = 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ votes} \]

Now, let's find out how many votes candidate C received. The total number of votes is 100, and we know the votes for candidates A and B.

Votes for candidate C:
\[ 100 - (\text{votes for candidate A} + \text{votes for candidate B}) = 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \text{ votes} \]

So, candidate C received 50 votes."
"First, let's determine how many apples Beck has initially. Since Boris has 100 apples and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, we can calculate the number of apples Beck has as follows:

\[ \text{Beck's initial apples} = \text{Boris's apples} - 23 = 100 - 23 = 77 \]

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. So, we need to update the number of apples each person has after this transaction:

\[ \text{Boris's apples after giving 10 to Beck} = 100 - 10 = 90 \]
\[ \text{Beck's apples after receiving 10 from Boris} = 77 + 10 = 87 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after this transaction:

\[ \text{Difference in apples} = \text{Boris's apples} - \text{Beck's apples} = 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of water used for the giant cubes. Peter makes 3 giant cubes, and each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water.

\[ 3 \text{ giant cubes} \times 4 \text{ ounces per cube} = 12 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of water used for the medium cubes. Peter makes 7 medium cubes, and each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water.

\[ 7 \text{ medium cubes} \times 2 \text{ ounces per cube} = 14 \text{ ounces} \]

Then, let's calculate the total amount of water used for the small cubes. Peter makes 8 small cubes, and each small cube uses 0.5 ounces of water.

\[ 8 \text{ small cubes} \times 0.5 \text{ ounces per cube} = 4 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, let's add up the total amount of water used for all the cubes.

\[ 12 \text{ ounces} + 14 \text{ ounces} + 4 \text{ ounces} = 28 \text{ ounces} \]

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. To find out how much water he has left, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount.

\[ 32 \text{ ounces} - 28 \text{ ounces} = 4 \text{ ounces} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"If Clara has 20 books and Clara has two times as many books as Steven, then Steven has half the number of books Clara has. Therefore, Steven has \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) books.

Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so Alice has \( 10 + 6 = 16 \) books.

To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has: \( 20 - 16 = 4 \).

Thus, Clara has 4 more books than Alice. The final numerical answer is 4."
"First, let's determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. Since a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar and a gallon jar costs $5, we can calculate the cost of a half-gallon jar as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of gallon jar} - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars:

\[ \text{Total cost for 10 gallon jars} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \]

Then, we calculate the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars:

\[ \text{Total cost for 16 half-gallon jars} = 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

Finally, we add the two totals to find the overall amount of money Cecelia spent:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 50 + 48 = 98 \]

"Let's break down the information given:

- Total number of students = 50
- Number of students who like to bake = 10
- Number of students who like to play basketball = 5
- The rest like to either play video games or play music.

Let's denote the number of students who like to play video games as \( V \) and the number of students who like to play music as \( M \).

From the problem, we know that \( M = 2 \times 5 = 10 \).

The total number of students can be represented as the sum of those who like to bake, play basketball, play video games, and play music:

\[ 10 + 5 + V + M = 50 \]

Substituting \( M = 10 \) into the equation:

\[ 10 + 5 + V + 10 = 50 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 25 + V = 50 \]

Solving for \( V \):

\[ V = 50 - 25 \]
\[ V = 25 \]

So, the number of students who like to play video games is 25."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many students would be in each group if the activity is divided into 12 groups.

First, we calculate the number of students per group if there are 12 groups:
\[ \text{Number of students per group} = \frac{54 \text{ students}}{12 \text{ groups}} = 4.5 \text{ students per group} \]

Since the number of students per group must be a whole number, it is not possible to divide 54 students into 12 groups of equal size. Therefore, the question is asking for the number of additional groups needed to form, which implies we need to find out how many groups are needed to have whole groups of students.

Given that 54 students need to be divided into groups of equal size, the number of students per group must be a divisor of 54. The divisors of 54 are: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, and 54. The largest number of groups that can be formed with whole students is when each group has 1 student, which would be 54 groups. However, the problem specifies 12 groups, which is not possible with 54 students.

To form groups of 1 student each, we need:
\[ 54 \text{ groups} \]

Since the activity is currently divided into 12 groups, the number of additional groups needed is:
\[ 54 - 12 = 42 \]

Thus, the number of additional groups needed to form is:

"To calculate the total number of chairs Candy can rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during a single weekday and a single weekend day:
- Weekdays: 60 chairs per day
- Weekends: 100 chairs per day

Next, we need to determine the number of weekdays and weekend days in a 4-week month:
- There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a single week.
- Therefore, in a 4-week month, there are \(5 \times 4 = 20\) weekdays and \(2 \times 4 = 8\) weekend days.

Now, we can calculate the total number of chairs rented during a 4-week month:
- Chairs rented during weekdays: \(60 \times 20 = 1200\)
- Chairs rented during weekends: \(100 \times 8 = 800\)
- Total chairs rented in one 4-week month: \(1200 + 800 = 2000\)

Finally, we need to find out how many chairs are rented in two 4-week months:
- Total chairs rented in two 4-week months: \(2000 \times 2 = 4000\)

"First, let's determine how many small stickers Lorraine trades for large buttons. She starts with 30 small stickers and trades 90% of them:

\[ 30 \times 0.90 = 27 \text{ small stickers} \]

Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she trades 27 small stickers for 27 small buttons.

Next, let's calculate how many large stickers she trades for large buttons. She starts with 40 large stickers and trades 50% of them:

\[ 40 \times 0.50 = 20 \text{ large stickers} \]

Since each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons, and a large button is worth three small buttons, each large sticker is worth 1 large button. Therefore, trading 20 large stickers for large buttons gives her 20 large buttons.

Now, let's determine how many large stickers she has left after trading 20 for large buttons. She started with 40 large stickers and traded 20, so she has:

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ large stickers} \]

She trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons. Since each large sticker is worth 1 large button, and a large button is worth three small buttons, each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons. Therefore, trading 20 large stickers for small buttons gives her:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ small buttons} \]

Now, let's sum up all the buttons Lorraine has by the end. She has 27 small buttons from trading small stickers, 20 large buttons from trading large stickers, and 60 small buttons from trading the remaining large stickers. The total number of buttons is:

\[ 27 + 20 + 60 = 107 \]

Therefore, the total number of matches Joey played in one week is 7."
"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, so it is \( 2x \).

The total number of votes cast is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is \( x + 2x = 3x \).

We know the total number of people on the council is 33, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x \):
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Thus, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Extra-small (XS) shirts**: 11 students need size extra-small.
2. **Small (S) shirts**: Twice as many students need size small as extra small. Therefore, the number of students needing size small is \(2 \times 11 = 22\).
3. **Medium (M) shirts**: Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size medium is \(22 - 4 = 18\).
4. **Large (L) shirts**: Half as many students need size large as size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size large is \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\).
5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts**: Six more students need size extra-large than large. Therefore, the number of students needing size extra-large is \(9 + 6 = 15\).

Now, we sum up the number of students needing each size to find the total number of shirts ordered:

\[
11 \text{ (XS)} + 22 \text{ (S)} + 18 \text{ (M)} + 9 \text{ (L)} + 15 \text{ (XL)} = 75

Since these 18 Pomeranian puppies represent two thirds of all the puppies Jana has, we can find the total number of puppies by setting up the following equation:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Total Puppies} = 18 \]

To find the total number of puppies, we solve for the total:
\[ \text{Total Puppies} = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 27 \]

So, Jana has 27 puppies in total."
"First, let's determine how much money Jayden has after his sister gives him half of her allowance.

Ava's allowance is $90, so half of that is:
\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

Jayden initially had $70, and his sister gave him $45, so now Jayden has:
\[ 70 + 45 = 115 \]

The camera costs $200, so the amount of money Jayden still needs to buy the camera is:
\[ 200 - 115 = 85 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 85 \]"
"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The first house needs \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the second house, so the first house needs \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases.
- The third house needs double the first house, so the third house needs \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) cases.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{5}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{5} \):
\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{5} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. The third house needs double the first house, which is:
\[ 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = 2 \times \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 100 \]"

"To determine how much money Sam would have to spend to make 4 liters of juice, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of oranges needed for 4 liters of juice.
2. Calculate the cost of the oranges needed.

First, we know that 1 liter of juice requires 5 kilograms of oranges. Therefore, for 4 liters of juice, Sam would need:
\[ 4 \text{ liters} \times 5 \text{ kg/liter} = 20 \text{ kg} \]

Next, we know that each kilogram of oranges costs $3. Therefore, the cost for 20 kilograms of oranges is:
\[ 20 \text{ kg} \times 3 \text{ dollars/kg} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Sam would have to spend to make 4 liters of juice is:

"First, let's determine how many books Ahmed read in one hour. According to the problem, Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in one hour. Since Ezra read 300 books, we can set up the following equation to find out how many books Ahmed read:

\[ \text{Ahmed's books} = \frac{\text{Ezra's books}}{2} = \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

So, Ahmed read 150 books in one hour.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of books Ezra has read after deciding to read 150 more books. Initially, Ezra read 300 books, and he decided to read 150 more:

\[ \text{Ezra's total books} = 300 + 150 = 450 \]

Now, we add the number of books Ahmed and Ezra have read together:

\[ \text{Total books} = \text{Ahmed's books} + \text{Ezra's total books} = 150 + 450 = 600 \]

Therefore, the total number of books they have read altogether is:

"To calculate Tanya's earnings for the two days, we need to break down her earnings for each day and then sum them up.

**Monday:**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She also earns an additional $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Monday:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} \times 5 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 20 \times 5 \times 15 = \$1500 \]

Next, calculate the additional earnings for Monday:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} > 3 \text{ classes} \]
\[ 4 \text{ classes} - 3 \text{ classes} = 1 \text{ extra class} \]
\[ 1 \text{ extra class} \times \$5 = \$5 \]

So, the total earnings for Monday are:
\[ \$1500 + \$5 = \$1505 \]

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She does not earn the additional $5 per day since she does not teach more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Wednesday:
\[ 2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 2 \times 2 \times 15 = \$60 \]

Since she does not teach more than 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5 per day.

So, the total earnings for Wednesday are:
\[ \$60 \]

Now, sum up the earnings for both days:
\[ \$1505 + \$60 = \$1565 \]

Therefore, Tanya earned a total of \$1565 for these two days of teaching."
"To determine how many more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total sales for each type of scent and then find the difference.

The perfume company sold:
- 5 vanilla scents
- 2 fruity scents

To find out how many more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents, we subtract the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold:

\[ 5 \text{ (vanilla scents sold)} - 2 \text{ (fruity scents sold)} = 3 \]

So, 3 more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount Bennet makes from selling the eggplants.

He sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total from the eggplants is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

Bennet wants to make a total of $135. To find out how much he needs to make from selling the corn, we subtract the amount he already has from the total he wants to make:
\[ 135 - 60 = 75 \]

Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the remaining amount he needs by the number of ears of corn:
\[ \frac{75}{25} = 3 \]

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total hours Tatiana has available over the weekend:

\[ 7 \text{ hours (Saturday)} + 5 \text{ hours (Sunday)} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we subtract the time she spends reading:

\[ 12 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours (reading)} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Now, she plays video games for \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the remaining time after reading:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time she spends playing video games is 3 hours. Now, we can calculate the time she spends playing soccer:

\[ 9 \text{ hours (remaining after reading)} - 3 \text{ hours (video games)} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, to find the percentage of her weekend that she spends playing soccer, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent playing soccer}}{\text{Total weekend hours}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{12 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the percentage of her weekend that Tatiana spends playing soccer is 50%."

"To determine how long Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time he spends driving to the museum and the time he spends driving back home, and then add the time he spends at the museum.

First, calculate the time it takes to drive to the museum:
- Distance to the museum: 150 miles
- Speed: 75 mph

Time to drive to the museum = Distance / Speed = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

Since the return trip is the same distance and speed, the time to drive back home is also 2 hours.

Total driving time = Time to drive to the museum + Time to drive back home = 2 hours + 2 hours = 4 hours

Jack spends 6 hours at the museum.

Total time gone from home = Total driving time + Time at the museum = 4 hours + 6 hours = 10 hours

The final numerical answer is 10."
"First, let's calculate the total number of wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles.

"First, let's break down the information given:

- Mike has 600 movies in total.
- A third of the movies are in various series, which means \( \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \) movies are in series.
- The remaining movies are \( 600 - 200 = 400 \) movies.
- 40% of the remaining 400 movies are older movies, which means \( 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \) movies are older.
- The rest of the remaining movies are not in series or older, which is \( 400 - 160 = 240 \) movies.

Now, let's calculate the cost of replacing the movies:

- The cost for the series movies is $6 each, so the total cost for the series movies is \( 200 \times 6 = 1200 \) dollars.
- The cost for the older movies is $5 each, so the total cost for the older movies is \( 160 \times 5 = 800 \) dollars.
- The cost for the remaining movies is $10 each, so the total cost for the remaining movies is \( 240 \times 10 = 2400 \) dollars.

Adding these costs together gives the total cost of replacing the movies:

\[ 1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 4400."

"First, let's calculate the distance the Llesis family drove. They drove for 6 hours at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.

\[ \text{Distance driven} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 50 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, let's determine the hiking speed. The hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half the driving speed.

\[ \text{Hiking speed} = \frac{50}{2} - 5 = 25 - 5 = 20 \, \text{miles/hour} \]

Given that they hiked for 1.5 hours at this speed, we can calculate the distance they hiked.

\[ \text{Distance hiked} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 20 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, to find the total distance to their vacation spot, we add the distance driven and the distance hiked.

\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance driven} + \text{Distance hiked} = 300 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 330 \, \text{miles} \]

The final numerical answer is 330 miles."
"Let's denote the number of enemies Ava jumps on as \( E_A \) and the number of berries she collects as \( B_A \). Similarly, let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumps on as \( E_E \) and the number of berries she collects as \( B_E \).

Given:
- Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma: \( E_A = E_E + 8 \)
- Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma: \( B_A = B_E + 3 \)
- Ava finishes 4 seconds slower than Emma, which means she has 4 seconds less on the timer, so she gets 30 points less than Emma: \( 30 \times 4 = 120 \) points less.

Now, let's calculate the scores for both Ava and Emma.

Ava's score:
- Points from enemies: \( 10 \times (E_E + 8) \)
- Points from berries: \( 5 \times (B_E + 3) \)
- Points from time: \( 30 \times (60 - 4) = 30 \times 56 = 1680 \) (since she finishes 4 seconds slower, she has 56 seconds left on the timer)

Emma's score:
- Points from enemies: \( 10 \times E_E \)
- Points from berries: \( 5 \times B_E \)
- Points from time: \( 30 \times 60 = 1800 \) (since she finishes the level in the full 60 seconds)

Now, let's calculate the difference in their scores.

Difference in points from enemies:
\[ 10 \times (E_E + 8) - 10 \times E_E = 10 \times 8 = 80 \]

Difference in points from berries:
\[ 5 \times (B_E + 3) - 5 \times B_E = 5 \times 3 = 15 \]

Difference in points from time:
\[ 1800 - 1680 = 120 \]

Total difference in scores:

The difference between their two scores is 215 points."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each. Then, we subtract this amount from the total cost to find the combined cost of the other two pizzas. Finally, we divide this amount by 2 to find the cost of each of the other two pizzas.

The total cost of the four pizzas is 64 dollars. The cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each is:
\[ 30 + 30 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting this from the total cost gives the combined cost of the other two pizzas:
\[ 64 - 60 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the combined cost of these two pizzas by 2:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, each of the other two pizzas cost 2 dollars. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"To solve this, let's break down the problem into parts:

1. **Normal Days (3 days):** They ride their bikes thrice a day.
   - Number of rides per normal day = 3
   - Number of rides per normal day = 3 * 1 = 3
   - Total rides for 3 normal days = 3 * 3 = 9

2. **Special Days (2 days):** They ride their bikes twice the times they do on normal days.
   - Number of rides per special day = 2 * 3 = 6
   - Total rides for 2 special days = 2 * 6 = 12

Now, let's add the total rides from both types of days:
- Total rides in a week = Rides on normal days + Rides on special days
- Total rides in a week = 9 + 12 = 21

"Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as \( w \) and the number of orange fish he bought as \( o \). We know that the total number of fish he bought from the pet store is \( o + w = 17 \).

After adding these fish to his pond, the total number of orange fish became \( 3 + o \) and the total number of white fish became \( 4 + w \). According to the problem, after adding the new fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish. This gives us the equation:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( o + w = 17 \)
2. \( 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \)

Let's solve the second equation first:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]
\[ 3 + o = 8 + 2w \]
\[ o - 2w = 5 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( o + w = 17 \)
2. \( o - 2w = 5 \)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use elimination. First, we'll eliminate \( o \) by subtracting the second equation from the first:
\[ (o + w) - (o - 2w) = 17 - 5 \]
\[ o + w - o + 2w = 12 \]
\[ 3w = 12 \]
\[ w = 4 \]

Now that we have \( w = 4 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( o \):
\[ o + 4 = 17 \]
\[ o = 13 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish and 13 orange fish. The number of white fish Bob bought at the store is \( 4 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total distance Andy travels in a week. Since he goes to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days. The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, so the round trip distance is \(5 \times 2 = 10\) miles per day. Therefore, the total distance he travels in a week is \(10 \times 5 = 50\) miles.

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of gas Andy consumes in a week. Given that his car's fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon, the number of gallons consumed per week is \( \frac{50 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons} \).

Finally, we calculate the cost of the gas consumed in a week. If the price of gas is $3 per gallon, then the cost per week is \( 5 \text{ gallons} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars} \).

So, the final numerical answer is 15."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie has in quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, and she has 140 quarters, the total amount in quarters is:

\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie has in twenties. Since each twenty is worth $20, and she has 10 twenties, the total amount in twenties is:

\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Carrie spent 3/5 of the twenties. So, the amount spent on twenties is:

"First, we need to determine the temperature difference that needs to be prevented for the pipes to freeze. The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. The temperature during the night is 33 degrees colder than during the day, so the night temperature is:

\[ 45 \text{ degrees} - 33 \text{ degrees} = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

Since the night temperature is 12 degrees, we need to calculate how many degrees above 32 degrees the temperature needs to be to prevent the pipes from freezing:

\[ 32 \text{ degrees} - 12 \text{ degrees} = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs are needed to raise the temperature by 20 degrees, we divide the required temperature increase by the temperature increase per log:

\[ \text{Special hourly rate} = 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Now, let's break down Jamie's pay for the day:
- For the first 8 hours, she earns her regular hourly rate.
- For the additional 3 hours (since she worked 11 hours in total), she earns her special hourly rate.

Let's calculate the total pay:
\[ \text{Pay for regular hours} = 8 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ dollars/hour} = 160 \text{ dollars} \]
\[ \text{Pay for special hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ dollars/hour} = 90 \text{ dollars} \]
\[ \text{Total pay} = 160 \text{ dollars} + 90 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Jamie was paid \(\boxed{250}\) dollars for her work on last Tuesday."
"The number of male lions is half the number of female lions, so there are \(12 / 2 = 6\) male lions. Adding the female lions, male lions, and lion cubs together, the total number of lions in the enclosure is \(12 + 6 + 14 = 32\).

The final numerical answer is 32."
"To find out how much money Mike will have left over after purchasing the jeans, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discount amount on the jeans.
2. Subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the sale price.
3. Subtract the sale price from the $50.00 bill to find out how much money Mike will have left over.

First, let's calculate the discount amount:
\[ \text{Discount amount} = \text{Original price} \times \text{Discount percentage} \]
\[ \text{Discount amount} = \$40.00 \times 0.25 \]
\[ \text{Discount amount} = \$10.00 \]

Next, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the sale price:
\[ \text{Sale price} = \text{Original price} - \text{Discount amount} \]
\[ \text{Sale price} = \$40.00 - \$10.00 \]
\[ \text{Sale price} = \$30.00 \]

Finally, we subtract the sale price from the $50.00 bill to find out how much money Mike will have left over:
\[ \text{Money left over} = \text{Amount paid} - \text{Sale price} \]
\[ \text{Money left over} = \$50.00 - \$30.00 \]
\[ \text{Money left over} = \$20.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$20.00 \]"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of employees after three months.
2. Calculate the total salary paid to all employees in one month.
3. Multiply the monthly total salary by the number of months (3).

**Step 1: Number of employees after three months**

- Initial number of employees: 200
- New employees hired each month: 20
- Number of months: 3

Number of new employees hired in three months:
\[ 20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees} \]

Total number of employees after three months:
\[ 200 \text{ initial employees} + 60 \text{ new employees} = 260 \text{ employees} \]

**Step 2: Monthly total salary**

Each employee is paid $4000 per month.

Total monthly salary for 260 employees:
\[ 260 \text{ employees} \times 4000 \text{ dollars/employee} = 1040000 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Total salary paid after three months**

Total salary paid in three months:
\[ 1040000 \text{ dollars/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 3120000 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 3120000 \]"
"To find the total time they will be caroling, we need to add the duration of ""Deck the Halls"" twice and the duration of ""Jingle Bells"" once.

""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long, so twice it will be:
\[ 150 \text{ seconds} \times 2 = 300 \text{ seconds} \]

""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long.

Adding these together:
\[ 300 \text{ seconds} + 240 \text{ seconds} = 540 \text{ seconds} \]

The total time they will be caroling is 540 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the hourly wages for both Billy and Sally, and then determine the total earnings for 20 hours for each. Finally, we will find the difference in their earnings.

First, let's determine Billy's hourly wage at different points in time:

1. **Initial Hourly Wage:**
   - Billy's initial hourly wage was $10 per hour.

2. **After 2 months:**
   - Billy received a raise of $0.50 per hour.
   - New hourly wage = $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

3. **On his first anniversary:**
   - Billy received another raise of $1.00 per hour.
   - New hourly wage = $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for 20 hours for Billy at each of these hourly rates:

1. **Initial Hourly Wage ($10 per hour):**
   - Total earnings = $10/hour * 20 hours = $200.

2. **After 2 months ($10.50 per hour):**
   - Total earnings = $10.50/hour * 20 hours = $210.

3. **On his first anniversary ($11.50 per hour):**
   - Total earnings = $11.50/hour * 20 hours = $230.

Next, we calculate Sally's hourly wage. Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's initial salary:

- Sally's starting hourly wage = $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

Now, we calculate the total earnings for 20 hours for Sally:

- Total earnings = $10.50/hour * 20 hours = $210.

Finally, we find the difference in their total earnings:

- Difference in earnings = Billy's total earnings - Sally's total earnings
- Difference in earnings = $230 - $210 = $20.

Thus, Billy will earn $20 more than Sally in 20 hours. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{20}

"First, let's calculate the cost of 3 loaves of bread:
- The cost of one loaf of bread is $2.
- Therefore, the cost of 3 loaves of bread is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of 2 bagels:
- The cost of one bagel is $1.
- Therefore, the cost of 2 bagels is \(2 \times 1 = 2\) dollars.

Now, to find out how much more 3 loaves of bread cost than 2 bagels, we subtract the cost of 2 bagels from the cost of 3 loaves of bread:
- The difference is \(6 - 2 = 4\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is:
4"
"To find the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita, we first need to determine how many points Nikita scored. According to the problem, Nikita scored 11 more than half as many points as Pierson.

Pierson's score is 278 points. Half of Pierson's score is:
\[ \frac{278}{2} = 139 \]

Nikita's score is 11 more than this value:
\[ 139 + 11 = 150 \]

Now, we add Pierson's and Nikita's scores together to find the total:
\[ 278 + 150 = 428 \]

The total points scored by Pierson and Nikita is:
\[ 428 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of students and teachers in the school.

The school has 40 classes with an average of 25 students per class:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 25 \text{ students/class} = 1000 \text{ students} \]

The school also has 40 classes with an average of 3 teachers per class:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 3 \text{ teachers/class} = 120 \text{ teachers} \]

Each child plants 1 tree, so the number of trees planted by the students is:
\[ 1000 \text{ students} \times 1 \text{ tree/student} = 1000 \text{ trees} \]

Each teacher plants 2 trees, so the number of trees planted by the teachers is:
\[ 120 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ trees/teacher} = 240 \text{ trees} \]

Adding the trees planted by the students and the teachers gives the total number of trees planted:
\[ 1000 \text{ trees} + 240 \text{ trees} = 1240 \text{ trees} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1240 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:

- Puppies: 3
- Koalas: 5
- Zebras: 2
- Frogs: 4

Total stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Let's denote the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy as \( x \).

The total number of stuffed animals after buying \( x \) goats will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30%. Therefore, the equation representing this situation is:

\[ \frac{x}{14 + x} = 0.30 \]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by \( 14 + x \):

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Expanding the right side:

\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Subtract \( 0.30x \) from both sides to isolate \( x \):

\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]

\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Divide both sides by 0.70:

\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]

\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total hours Kris has already played.

For the first 2 weeks (14 days), Kris plays for half an hour every day:
\[ 14 \text{ days} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/day} = 7 \text{ hours} \]

For the next week (7 days), Kris plays for 2 hours every day:
\[ 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/day} = 14 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's add the hours from both periods to find the total hours played so far:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} + 14 \text{ hours} = 21 \text{ hours} \]

Kris needs a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. To find out how many more hours she needs to play, we subtract the hours she has already played from the total required hours:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} - 21 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

So, Kris still needs to play 9 more hours to earn the achievement."
"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled by the first car:
- The first car travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance traveled by the first car is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled by the second car:
- The second car travels at an average speed of 70 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance traveled by the second car is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed}_2 \times \text{Time} = 70 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled by the two cars:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_2 - \text{Distance}_1 = 140 \, \text{miles} - 120 \, \text{miles} = 20 \, \text{miles}
\]

Thus, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car. The final numerical answer is:
\[

"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the ring before the premium is added. The cost of the diamond is $600 and the cost of the gold is $300. So, the total cost before the premium is:

\[ 600 + 300 = 900 \]

Next, we need to calculate the premium. The premium is 30% of the total cost before the premium. So, we calculate 30% of $900:

\[ 0.30 \times 900 = 270 \]

Now, we add the premium to the total cost before the premium to find the final amount James paid:

\[ 900 + 270 = 1170 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1170 \]"
"First, let's calculate the pass rates for each grade:

- For third graders: \( \frac{340}{500} = 0.68 \) or 68%
- For fourth graders: \( \frac{40}{100} = 0.40 \) or 40%
- For fifth graders: The pass rate is twice that of fourth graders, so \( 2 \times 0.40 = 0.80 \) or 80%

Next, we calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students:

- Third graders: 340
- Fourth graders: 40
- Fifth graders: 400

Total number of students: \( 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 \)

Total number of students who passed: \( 340 + 40 + 400 = 780 \)

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students:

\[ \text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{780}{1000} = 0.78 \]

So, the school's overall pass rate is 78%."
"To determine how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has.
2. Determine the total area of the mosaic he can make with the chips he has.
3. Calculate the length of the mosaic based on the area and the height.

First, let's find out how many glass chips Milo has:
- Each bag contains 72 chips.
- Milo has two bags.
- Therefore, the total number of chips is \( 72 \times 2 = 144 \) chips.

Next, we need to find out how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips:
- It takes 12 chips to make every square inch.
- Therefore, the total area in square inches is \( \frac{144}{12} = 12 \) square inches.

Now, we know the height of the mosaic is 3 inches, and we need to find the length:
- The area of the mosaic is 12 square inches.
- The height is 3 inches.
- Therefore, the length can be calculated as \( \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Height} \).
- So, \( 12 = \text{Length} \times 3 \).
- Solving for the length, we get \( \text{Length} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \) inches.

Thus, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts of tea:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Now, let's add the quarts of tea consumed by all the students:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

We know that there are 10 quarts of tea left from the party. Therefore, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we convert the total quarts to gallons:
\[ \frac{48}{4} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"Dale initially had 100 candies and sold 150, which means he is short by 50 candies (150 - 100 = 50). After ordering 100 more candies, he now has 100 (initial) + 100 (new order) = 200 candies. To find out how many candies he still needs to sell, we subtract the number of candies he has from the total number of candies he ordered, which is 200 - 150 = 50.

The final numerical answer is 50."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students on campus at the end of each month and then determine the total number of additional students who joined by the end of May.

Starting with 10 students at the beginning of the year, the number of students doubles every month.

- At the end of January: \(10 \times 2 = 20\) students
- At the end of February: \(20 \times 2 = 40\) students
- At the end of March: \(40 \times 2 = 80\) students
- At the end of April: \(80 \times 2 = 160\) students
- At the end of May: \(160 \times 2 = 320\) students

Now, we calculate the total number of additional students who joined by the end of May:

- Additional students in January: \(20 - 10 = 10\)
- Additional students in February: \(40 - 20 = 20\)
- Additional students in March: \(80 - 40 = 40\)
- Additional students in April: \(160 - 80 = 80\)
- Additional students in May: \(320 - 160 = 160\)

Summing these additional students:

\[10 + 20 + 40 + 80 + 160 = 310\]

Therefore, the number of additional students who would have joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year, is 310."
"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we first need to determine the total number of branches he climbed during the week.

Given that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs and he made $105 during the week, we can calculate the total number of branches he climbed by dividing the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\text{Total money made}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} \]

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = 420 \]

Since he made this amount of money during the week, and there are 7 days in a week, we can find the average number of branches he climbed per day by dividing the total branches climbed by the number of days in the week:

\[ \text{Branches climbed per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches climbed}}{\text{Number of days in a week}} = \frac{420}{7} \]

\[ \text{Branches climbed per day} = 60 \]

So, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day."
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose initially picks:

- For the first 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals.
- For the next 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals.
- For the next 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals.
- For the last 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals.

Adding these together gives the total number of petals before any are dropped:
\[15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\] petals.

Rose drops 1 flower of each type, so she drops:
- 1 flower with 5 petals,
- 1 flower with 6 petals,
- 1 flower with 4 petals,
- 1 flower with 7 petals.

The total number of petals dropped is:
\[5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\] petals.

"First, let's determine the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean to make S'mores. John makes 9 S'mores and DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so together they make:

\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \text{ S'mores} \]

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they use 18 marshmallows in total. They started with 35 marshmallows and dropped 3 on the ground, so the number of marshmallows left is:

\[ 35 - 18 - 3 = 14 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Now, we need to determine how many S'mores they can make with the remaining 14 marshmallows. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they can make:

\[ 14 \text{ S'mores} \]

Since John and DeSean are sharing the remaining marshmallows equally, each of them can have:

\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ S'mores} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the total play time for each person in minutes. Jack and his two significantly worse friends can each play for 20 minutes. The friend who is significantly better can play for 1.5 times 20 minutes, which is 30 minutes.

The total play time for Jack and his two significantly worse friends is:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

The play time for the friend who is significantly better is:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total play time for all four friends is:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Since they play for 4 hours, we need to convert 4 hours into minutes:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to determine how many 20-minute intervals fit into 240 minutes:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/game}} = 12 \text{ games} \]

"Let's denote the amount of each ingredient Tanya uses as follows:
- Let \( S \) be the amount of salt.
- Let \( O \) be the amount of oil.
- Let \( F \) be the amount of fragrance.
- Let \( C \) be the amount of citrus zest.
- Let \( G \) be the amount of sugar.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S = G \) (same amount of salt as sugar)
2. \( F = C \) (same amount of fragrance as citrus zest)
3. \( O = 2S \) (twice as much oil as salt)
4. \( S = C \) (twice as much salt as zest)

Since \( S = C \) and \( F = C \), we can say \( S = F = C \).

The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces:
\[ S + O + F + C + G = 10 \]

Substituting the relationships into the equation:
\[ S + 2S + S + S + S = 10 \]
\[ 6S = 10 \]
\[ S = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \]

Since \( O = 2S \):
\[ O = 2 \times \frac{5}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \]

Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \( \frac{10}{3} \) ounces. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of tins of cat food Kimberly bought. She bought 8 packages of cat food, and each package contains 11 tins. So, the total number of tins of cat food is:

\[ 8 \times 11 = 88 \text{ tins} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of tins of dog food Kimberly bought. She bought 6 packages of dog food, and each package contains 6 tins. So, the total number of tins of dog food is:

\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \text{ tins} \]

Now, to find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we subtract the total number of tins of dog food from the total number of tins of cat food:

\[ 88 - 36 = 52 \]

So, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 52 \]"
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now we can find out how many cards Becca has:
\[ 3P + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

So, Becca has 153 cards. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 153 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of each color of eggs Cindy has:

- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: twice as many as green eggs, so \(2 \times 5 = 10\)
- Pink eggs: one fewer than blue eggs, so \(10 - 1 = 9\)
- Yellow eggs: one-third as many as pink eggs, so \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\)

Now, let's add up all the eggs:

- Total eggs = Green eggs + Blue eggs + Pink eggs + Yellow eggs
- Total eggs = \(5 + 10 + 9 + 3\)

Let's calculate the total:
```python
# Number of each color of eggs
green_eggs = 5
blue_eggs = 2 * green_eggs
pink_eggs = blue_eggs - 1
yellow_eggs = pink_eggs // 3

# Total number of eggs
total_eggs = green_eggs + blue_eggs + pink_eggs + yellow_eggs
total_eggs
```
```output
python
# Number of each color of eggs
green_eggs = 5
blue_eggs = 2 * green_eggs
pink_eggs = blue_eggs - 1
yellow_eggs = pink_eggs // 3

# Total number of eggs
total_eggs = green_eggs + blue_eggs + pink_eggs + yellow_eggs
total_eggs
```
```output
Done
```
The total number of eggs Cindy had altogether is \(5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27\).

So, the final numerical answer is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"First, let's calculate the shipping cost. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound plus $0.08 per mile.

The cost for the weight of the book is:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.35/\text{pound} = \$1.40 \]

The cost for the distance is:
\[ 20 \text{ miles} \times \$0.08/\text{mile} = \$1.60 \]

So, the total shipping cost is:
\[ \$1.40 + \$1.60 = \$3.00 \]

Next, we calculate the refundable amount from Amazon. Since Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, the refundable amount is:
\[ 32 \text{ dollars} \times 0.75 = \$24.00 \]

Now, we calculate the total cost Milly will incur:
\[ \text{Cost of the book} + \text{Shipping cost} = 32 \text{ dollars} + 3 \text{ dollars} = \$35.00 \]

Finally, the amount of money Milly will lose is the total cost minus the refundable amount:
\[ 35 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = \$11.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"

"To calculate the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to consider the time spent on each activity and then sum them up.

1. **Time spent on TikTok videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week.
   - Each video is 4 minutes long.
   - Therefore, the time spent on TikTok videos each week is \(18 \times 4 = 72\) minutes.
   - For a month with four weeks, the time spent on TikTok videos is \(72 \times 4 = 288\) minutes.

2. **Time spent writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Since 1 hour equals 60 minutes, 2 hours equal \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes.
   - For a month with four weeks, the time spent writing songs is \(120 \times 4 = 480\) minutes.

3. **Time spent on makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup.
   - For a week, the time spent on makeup is \(15 \times 6 = 90\) minutes.
   - For a month with four weeks, the time spent on makeup is \(90 \times 4 = 360\) minutes.

Now, we sum up all the time spent:
- Time on TikTok videos: 288 minutes
- Time writing songs: 480 minutes
- Time on makeup: 360 minutes

Total time spent in a month is \(288 + 480 + 360 = 1128\) minutes.

"To determine how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to work through the relationships given step by step.

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain \(12 \times 1 = 12\) inches.
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain \(4 \times 12 = 48\) inches.
4. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain \(10 \times 48 = 480\) inches.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert 480 inches to feet:

\[ 480 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 40 \text{ feet} \]"
"Mason travels at a rate of 8 miles per hour for 4 hours, so the distance he covers in the first part of his journey is:
\[ 8 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 32 \text{ miles} \]

Then, he travels for another 6 hours at the same rate, so the distance he covers in the second part of his journey is:
\[ 8 \text{ miles/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 48 \text{ miles} \]

Adding both distances together gives the total distance traveled:
\[ 32 \text{ miles} + 48 \text{ miles} = 80 \text{ miles} \]

"To solve this problem, let's first establish the relationship between the number of kangaroos, their speed, and the time it takes for them to cross the highway.

Given:
- 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway.

Let's denote:
- The speed of one kangaroo as \( v \).
- The time taken by 3 kangaroos to cross the highway as \( t = 18 \) hours.

The distance \( D \) across the highway can be calculated using the formula:
\[ D = \text{speed} \times \text{time} \]
\[ D = v \times 18 \]

Now, we need to find out how long it will take for 4 turtles to cross the same distance. Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).

Let \( t' \) be the time it takes for 4 turtles to cross the highway. Using the distance formula again:
\[ D = \text{speed of one turtle} \times t' \]
\[ D = \left(\frac{v}{2}\right) \times t' \]

Since the distance \( D \) is the same for both the kangaroos and the turtles, we can set the two expressions for \( D \) equal to each other:
\[ v \times 18 = \left(\frac{v}{2}\right) \times t' \]

Solving for \( t' \):
\[ 18 = \frac{t'}{2} \]
\[ t' = 18 \times 2 \]
\[ t' = 36 \]

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 36 hours to cross the highway. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 36 \]"

"First, let's calculate the total number of slices from the large apples:
- Each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces.
- Adam decides to slice 3 large apples.
- Therefore, the total number of slices from the large apples is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) slices.

Next, let's calculate the total number of slices from the small apples:
- Each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces.
- Adam decides to slice 5 small apples.
- Therefore, the total number of slices from the small apples is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) slices.

Now, let's find the total number of slices Adam has:
- Total slices from large apples: 15
- Total slices from small apples: 15
- Therefore, the total number of slices Adam has is \(15 + 15 = 30\) slices.

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:
- Total slices Adam has: 30
- Slices Adam eats: 15
- Therefore, the number of slices left is \(30 - 15 = 15\) slices.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to have to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to calculate the current daily milk production and then find out how much additional milk is needed.

The current daily milk production from 3 cows is:
\[ 5 \text{ liters/cow/day} \times 3 \text{ cows} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The additional milk needed is:
\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed to produce the additional 10 liters of milk is:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow/day}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs to have 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The final numerical answer is:

- There are 20 students in total.
- 5 students are good at math only.
- 8 students perform well in English only.
- The rest are good at both math and English.

First, we calculate the number of students who are good at both math and English. Since the total number of students is 20, and we know the number of students who are good at math only and those who perform well in English only, we can find the number of students who are good at both by subtracting the sum of students who are good at math only and those who perform well in English only from the total number of students.

Let's denote:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down year by year:

1. In the first year, the town builds 12 homes.
2. In the second year, they build three times the number of homes built in the first year. So, they build \(3 \times 12 = 36\) homes.
3. In the third year, they double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total number of homes built in the first two years is \(12 + 36 = 48\). Therefore, in the third year, they build \(2 \times 48 = 96\) homes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of homes built over the three years:
- First year: 12 homes
- Second year: 36 homes
- Third year: 96 homes

"Let's denote the ages as follows:
- Let \( S \) be my age.
- Let \( B \) be my brother's age.
- Let \( M \) be my mom's age.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. I am three years younger than my brother: \( S = B - 3 \)
2. I am two years older than my sister: \( S = T + 2 \), where \( T \) is my sister's age.
3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age: \( M = 3B - 1 \)
4. The sum of our ages is 87: \( S + B + T + M = 87 \)

Since \( S = T + 2 \), we can substitute \( T \) with \( S - 2 \). Now, we can substitute \( S \), \( B \), and \( M \) in the sum equation:

\[ S + B + (S - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ S + B + S - 2 + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 2S + 4B - 3 = 87 \]
\[ 2S + 4B = 90 \]
\[ S + 2B = 45 \]

We also know from the first relationship that \( S = B - 3 \). Substitute \( S \) in the equation \( S + 2B = 45 \):

\[ (B - 3) + 2B = 45 \]
\[ 3B - 3 = 45 \]

"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first calculate the total number of glue sticks required for the 27 students. Each student needs 2 glue sticks, so:

\[ 27 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ glue sticks/student} = 54 \text{ glue sticks} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of glue sticks are required to get at least 54 glue sticks. Since glue sticks come in packs of 8, we divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:

\[ \frac{54 \text{ glue sticks}}{8 \text{ glue sticks/pack}} = 6.75 \text{ packs} \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks. To ensure he has enough glue sticks, we calculate the total number of glue sticks in 7 packs:

\[ 7 \text{ packs} \times 8 \text{ glue sticks/pack} = 56 \text{ glue sticks} \]

Since 56 glue sticks is more than the 54 needed, Mr. Jackson will have some extra glue sticks left over. Thus, the number of packs he needs to buy is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Amount of Water**: The initial amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

2. **After the First Day**: The amount of water doubles. Therefore, the amount of water after the first day is:
   \[
   4000 \text{ gallons} \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **After the Second Day**: The amount of water doubles again. Therefore, the amount of water after the second day is:
   \[
   8000 \text{ gallons} \times 2 = 16000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

4. **After the Third Day**: The volume of water increases by 6000 gallons. Therefore, the amount of water after the third day is:
   \[
   16000 \text{ gallons} + 6000 \text{ gallons} = 22000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

Thus, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point after the third day is 22000 gallons."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of new infections each day and add them to the total number of infected people.

- **Day 0**: Initially, there are 10 infected people.
- **Day 1**: Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others, so the number of new infections is \(10 \times 6 = 60\). Therefore, the total number of infected people after Day 1 is \(10 + 60 = 70\).
- **Day 2**: Now there are 70 infected people, and each of them infects 6 others. So, the number of new infections is \(70 \times 6 = 420\). Therefore, the total number of infected people after Day 2 is \(70 + 420 = 490\).
- **Day 3**: Now there are 490 infected people, and each of them infects 6 others. So, the number of new infections is \(490 \times 6 = 2940\). Therefore, the total number of infected people after Day 3 is \(490 + 2940 = 3430\).

So, the total number of people infected after three days is 3430."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Rafaela received as tips. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate the total as follows:

\[ \text{Total tips for Rafaela} = 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Julieta received as tips. Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To find out how much less, we calculate 10% of Rafaela's total tips:

\[ \text{10% of Rafaela's tips} = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]

So, Julieta received:

\[ \text{Total tips for Julieta} = 800 - 80 = 720 \]

Now, to find out how much money Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether, we add their individual totals:

\[ \text{Total tips for both} = 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1520 \]"
"Jennifer initially had 12 oranges. She gave 2 oranges to each of her 3 daughters, which totals 2 * 3 = 6 oranges given to her daughters. Her only son received 3 oranges. Therefore, the total number of oranges given away is 6 + 3 = 9 oranges. 

To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we subtract the total number of oranges given away from the initial number of oranges: 12 - 9 = 3 oranges.

"First, let's determine the number of green cars. Since there are 12 red cars and 2 fewer green cars than red cars:

\[ \text{Number of green cars} = 12 - 2 = 10 \]

Next, we calculate the number of blue cars. The number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars:

\[ \text{Number of blue cars} = 3 \times 10 = 30 \]

Now, we can find the total number of red, green, and blue cars:

\[ \text{Total of red, green, and blue cars} = 12 + 10 + 30 = 52 \]

Given that the total number of cars in the rink is 75, we can find the number of yellow cars by subtracting the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:

\[ \text{Number of yellow cars} = 75 - 52 = 23 \]

So, the number of yellow cars is 23."
"Let's denote the number of books Anne has as \( A \), the number of books Sofie has as \( S \), and the number of books Fawn has as \( F \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S = A + 25 \)
2. \( A = F - 12 \)
3. \( S + A + F = 85 \)

We can substitute the expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \) into the third equation. First, we express \( A \) and \( S \) in terms of \( F \):
- From \( A = F - 12 \), we get \( S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \).

Now, substitute \( S \) and \( A \) in the total books equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
\[ 3F = 84 \]
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Use the total revenue to find the cost of the chickens.

First, let's calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell. He plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his 300 chickens:
\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \text{ chickens}

"To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we first need to determine how many glasses Micah sold.

The total number of glasses sold by Julie, Micah, and Mitchell is 32. Julie sold 14 glasses. Since the boys sold an equal number of glasses, we can denote the number of glasses sold by each boy as \( x \).

The equation representing the total sales is:
\[ 14 + x + x = 32 \]
\[ 14 + 2x = 32 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ 2x = 32 - 14 \]
\[ 2x = 18 \]
\[ x = 9 \]

So, each boy sold 9 glasses. Since Julie sold 14 glasses, the difference in the number of glasses sold by Julie and Micah is:
\[ 14 - 9 = 5 \]

Therefore, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost for Sarah to buy the rope for her friend. The rope is 20 meters long and costs $2 per meter.

\[
\text{Total cost for the rope} = 20 \text{ meters} \times \$2/\text{meter} = \$40
\]

Sarah will use the profit from selling the rope to buy a new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter. To find out how many meters of the new rope she can buy, we need to determine how much money she will have after selling the original rope.

\[
\text{Money left after selling the rope} = \$40
\]

Now, we need to find out how many meters of the new rope she can buy with $40.

\[
\text{Meters of new rope} = \frac{\$40}{\$1.5/\text{meter}} = \frac{40}{1.5} = \frac{400}{15} = \frac{80}{3} \approx 26.67 \text{ meters}
\]

Since the new rope costs $1.5 per meter, the total cost for the new rope is:

\[
\text{Total cost for the new rope} = 26.67 \text{ meters} \times \$1.5/\text{meter} = \$40
\]

Since the total cost for the new rope is exactly $40, Sarah will have no money left over after buying the new rope.

\[
\text{Money left over} = \$40 - \$40 = \$0

"First, let's calculate the cost of each item Kelly is purchasing:

1. **Bacon:**
   - Kelly has 5 packs of bacon.
   - The total cost for the bacon is $10.
   - Cost per pack of bacon = $10 / 5 = $2.

2. **Chicken:**
   - Kelly has 6 packets of chicken.
   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - Cost per packet of chicken = 2 * $2 = $4.
   - Total cost for the chicken = 6 * $4 = $24.

3. **Strawberries:**
   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries.
   - Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   - Total cost for the strawberries = 3 * $4 = $12.

4. **Apples:**
   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples.
   - Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   - Cost per pack of apples = $4 / 2 = $2.
   - Total cost for the apples = 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's sum up the total cost of all the items:
- Total cost = Cost of bacon + Cost of chicken + Cost of strawberries + Cost of apples
- Total cost = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60.

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget:
- Money left = Budget - Total cost
- Money left = $65 - $60 = $5.

"Let's denote the usual runtime of Elaina's concerts as \( x \) minutes. According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, so the final concert is \( 2x \) minutes long. Additionally, at the end of the final concert, she performs a 15-minute encore. Therefore, the total runtime of the final concert, including the encore, is \( 2x + 15 \) minutes.

We are given that the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. So we can set up the following equation:
\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants, so we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. We find the number of flowering plants by subtracting the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:

\[ \text{Number of flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25 \]

To find what percent of the total plants are flowering plants, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 25 \]"
"To find out how fast a whirligig spins, we need to first determine the speed of the thingamabob. We know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, we can calculate the speed of the thingamabob as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{\text{Speed of whatchamacallit}}{11} = \frac{121 \text{ meters/second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters/second} \]

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can determine the speed of the whirligig. We know that a whirligig spins five times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of the whirligig is:

\[ \text{Speed of whirligig} = 5 \times \text{Speed of thingamabob} = 5 \times 11 \text{ meters/second} = 55 \text{ meters/second} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 55 \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the yogurt. Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, and the salad costs $6, the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the salad and the yogurt:
- Salad: $6
- Yogurt: $3

The total cost for the salad and the yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.

Ellen pays a total of $11 for her goods every day. Therefore, the cost for the two carrots she eats every day is $11 - $9 = $2.

Since she eats two carrots every day, the cost for one carrot is $2 / 2 = $1.

"Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( x \).

From the first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times.
From the second week, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5x \) times.

The total number of times she mowed lawns is \( x + 3x + 5x = 9x \).

Given that Joe paid her $6 for mowing his lawn, we can calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns as \( 6 \times 9x = 54x \).

Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. Therefore, the amount she made from lemonade sales is \( 80 - 54x \).

To find the exact amount, we need to determine \( x \). However, the problem does not provide enough information to find the exact value of \( x \). We can only express the amount made from lemonade sales in terms of \( x \).

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of \( x \), we cannot determine a numerical value for the lemonade sales amount. But if we assume the simplest case where \( x = 1 \) (which is a common assumption in such problems if not specified otherwise), then the amount made from lemonade sales would be:

\( 80 - 54 \times 1 = 80 - 54 = 26 \).

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine Carl's weight. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, we can calculate Carl's weight as follows:

Carl's weight = Martin's weight + 16 kg
Carl's weight = 55 kg + 16 kg
Carl's weight = 71 kg

Next, we find Christian's weight, which is 8 kg more than Carl's weight:

Christian's weight = Carl's weight + 8 kg
Christian's weight = 71 kg + 8 kg
Christian's weight = 79 kg

Finally, we determine Harry's weight, which is 5 kg less than Christian's weight:

Harry's weight = Christian's weight - 5 kg
Harry's weight = 79 kg - 5 kg
Harry's weight = 74 kg

The weight of Harry is 74 kg."

"To find the total distance Dijana and Anis rowed on that Sunday, we first need to calculate the distance Anis rowed.

Dijana rowed 50 miles.

Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. This means Anis rowed 50 miles plus an additional 1/5 of 50 miles.

First, calculate 1/5 of 50 miles:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles} \]

So, Anis rowed:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Now, to find the total distance both rowed, we add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis:
\[ 50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles} \]

The total distance the two of them rowed on that day is 110 miles."

"First, let's determine how many pages each person read over the two days.

Yesterday:
- Denise read 10 pages.
- Daniel read 13 pages.

Today:
- Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.
- Daniel was not able to read any pages today, so he read 0 pages today.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages each person read over the two days:
- Denise's total: \(10 + 18 = 28\) pages.
- Daniel's total: \(13 + 0 = 13\) pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total number of pages Daniel read from the total number of pages Denise read:
\[ 28 - 13 = 15 \]

So, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup, we need to first understand the capacity of the pot in terms of adult and child bowls.

The pot can fill:
- 4 adult's bowls
- 8 child's bowls

Since Calvin is an adult, he will have one bowl of soup. His wife is also an adult, so she will have one bowl of soup as well. This accounts for 2 adult bowls. The remaining bowls will be for the two children.

The pot can fill 8 child's bowls, and we have already used 2 adult bowls (1 for Calvin and 1 for his wife). Therefore, the remaining bowls are:
\[ 8 - 2 = 6 \text{ child's bowls} \]

Since there are two children, we need to determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup. We divide the remaining bowls by the number of children:
\[ \frac{6 \text{ child's bowls}}{2 \text{ children}} = 3 \text{ times} \]

Thus, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup 3 times.

"To determine the amount of material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we first need to calculate the material required for each type of mask.

For small masks:
- 4 small masks require 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, 1 small mask requires \( \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \) yards of material.
- For 20 small masks, the material required is \( 20 \times 0.5 = 10 \) yards.

For large masks:
- 3 large masks require 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, 1 large mask requires \( \frac{2.25}{3} = 0.75 \) yards of material.
- For 8 large masks, the material required is \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \) yards.

Adding the material required for both types of masks:
- Total material required = material for small masks + material for large masks
- Total material required = 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards.

The final numerical answer is 16 yards."
"To find the average price per ticket, we first need to determine the total number of tickets Deepa has purchased. Since she has seen each of the 9 movies three times, the total number of tickets is:

\[ 9 \text{ movies} \times 3 \text{ times per movie} = 27 \text{ tickets} \]

Deepa has spent a total of $216 on these tickets. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets:

\[ \text{Average price per ticket} = \frac{216}{27} \]

\[ \text{Average price per ticket} = 8 \]

So, the average price she paid per ticket is $8."
"To determine Harold's free time, we need to calculate the total time he spends on activities and subtract that from the total hours in a day.

1. Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. He works for 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.
3. He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, let's add up the time spent on these activities:
- Sleep: 10 hours
- Work: 8 hours
- Dog walking: 1 hour

Total time spent on activities = 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 hours.

"To solve this problem, let's establish the ages of Duncan and Adam based on the information provided.

1. Duncan's current age is 60 years.
2. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \(60 - 8 = 52\) years.
3. Let Adam's current age be \(A\).
4. Four years ago, Adam's age was \(A - 4\).

According to the problem, eight years ago, Duncan's age was two times Adam's age four years ago. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[52 = 2 \times (A - 4)\]

Now, let's solve for \(A\):

\[52 = 2A - 8\]
\[52 + 8 = 2A\]
\[60 = 2A\]
\[A = 30\]

So, Adam's current age is 30 years. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

\[30 + 8 = 38\]

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the size of Farmer Smith's farm. Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

Twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm is:
\[ 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ acres} \]

Adding 100 acres to this amount gives the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \text{ acres} \]

Now, to find the total number of acres for both farms, we add the size of Farmer Brown's farm to the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 200 + 500 = 700 \text{ acres} \]

So, the total number of acres for both farms together is 700 acres."
"First, let's determine how many packages Colby completes per hour. According to the problem, he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. So, we calculate:

"Let's denote the number of red balloons as \( R \) and the number of yellow balloons as \( Y \). According to the problem, \( R = 20 \).

Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon, so the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is \( 2R \). Given that \( R = 20 \), the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \).

The total number of pieces of bologna thrown at all balloons is 58. Therefore, the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons is \( 58 - 40 = 18 \).

Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, the number of yellow balloons \( Y \) can be found by dividing the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons by 3. So, \( Y = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).

Thus, the number of yellow balloons is 6. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Julia and Nadine spent and then determine how much their mother gave them.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items they bought:
- The cake costs $11.
- They bought 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons. Since the balloons cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, the cost per balloon is $0.5 / 2 = $0.25. Therefore, the cost for 12 balloons is 12 * $0.25 = $3.
- They bought 2 tubs of ice cream, each costing $7, so the total cost for the ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
\[ 11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \]

This means Julia and Nadine spent a total of $28. Since they combined their allowances, the total amount given by their mother is $28. Since they each received the same amount, we divide the total amount by 2:
\[ \frac{28}{2} = 14 \]

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total cups of tea**: Lana has 27 cups of tea.
2. **Rows of tea cups**: She divides these cups into 3 rows, so each row has \( \frac{27}{3} = 9 \) cups.
3. **Tea types in each row**: In each row, she brews an equal amount of chamomile and mint tea. Therefore, each row has \( \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \) cups of chamomile tea and \( 4.5 \) cups of mint tea.
4. **Cups of cinnamon tea**: She uses the remaining cups to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea. Since the total number of cups is 27, the number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea is \( 27 - 15 = 12 \). Since there are 3 rows, and each row has 4.5 cups of chamomile and mint tea, the total number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea is \( 3 \times 4.5 = 13.5 \), but since we know it's 12, it means the distribution is correct.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which the sloth picks berries and then use that rate to find out how many berries he can pick up in the given time.

First, let's break down the information:
- The sloth takes 4 hours to make a trip down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up.
- The sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

Since the sloth takes 4 hours to pick up berries, we can calculate the number of berries he picks up in 4 hours. Let's denote the number of berries he picks up in 4 hours as \( B \).

Given that he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we can set up the following proportion:
\[ \frac{B}{4 \text{ hours}} = \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{8 \text{ hours}} \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{8 \text{ hours}} \times 4 \text{ hours} \]
\[ B = 3 \text{ berries/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} \]
\[ B = 12 \text{ berries} \]

So, the sloth picks up 12 berries in 4 hours. To find out how many berries he picks up per trip, we divide the total number of berries by the number of trips:
\[ \text{Number of trips} = \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{12 \text{ berries/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips} \]

Since he makes 2 trips in 8 hours, the number of berries he picks up per trip is:
\[ \text{Berries per trip} = \frac{12 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 6 \text{ berries/trip} \]

Therefore, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip is:
\[ 6 \]

The final numerical answer is:

Next, we need to calculate how much water will be left in the tank after 6 days, given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. The total amount of water removed from the tank over 6 days is:

\[ \text{Total water removed} = 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[ \text{Remaining water} = 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

- A mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll.
- Therefore, a mini cinnamon roll has \( \frac{600}{3} = 200 \) calories.
- Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls.
- So, the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls are \( 200 \times 200 = 40000 \) calories.

For the mini blueberry muffins:
- A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
- A mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin.
- Therefore, a mini blueberry muffin has \( \frac{450}{3} = 150 \) calories.
- Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins.
- So, the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins are \( 300 \times 150 = 45000 \) calories.

Adding the calories from both types of pastries:
- Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls: 40000 calories.
- Total calories from mini blueberry muffins: 45000 calories.
- Therefore, the total calories from all pastries are \( 40000 + 45000 = 85000 \) calories.

The final numerical answer is 85000."
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the five days and then divide that total by the number of days.

Let's break it down:

- On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
- On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday. So, for each of these days, she removed \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
- On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
- On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days:

\[ \text{Total Junebugs} = 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 \]

Let's add these numbers:

\[ 39 + 78 = 117 \]
\[ 117 + 78 = 195 \]
\[ 195 + 48 = 243 \]
\[ 243 + 57 = 299 \]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days is 299.

To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days (which is 5):

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{299}{5} \]

Let's perform the division:

\[ \frac{299}{5} = 59.8 \]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is 59.8."
"To find out how much farther the bus traveled than the car, we first need to calculate the distance each traveled.

The distance traveled by the bus can be calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For the bus:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

For the car:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find out how much farther the bus traveled than the car:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to calculate the difference between the total number of toys Sophie has and the number of toys she already has.

The total number of toys Sophie has is 62.

The number of building blocks is 31.
The number of stuffed animals is 8.
The number of stacking rings is 9.

First, we add up the number of building blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings:
\[ 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 \]

Next, we subtract this sum from the total number of toys to find out how many bouncy balls there are:
\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

Therefore, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is 14."
"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old:
   \[
   P + Pa + J = 100
   \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   Pa = J + 10
   \]

3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = Pa + J
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now, we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, we can find Paul's age:
\[
Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]

And Peter's age:
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

So, Peter's age is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"Initially, Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons, which totals to \(4 \times 2 = 8\) water balloons. Maria also received 2 water balloons, so the total number of water balloons at this point is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Then, her mom gave each person 3 more water balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional water balloons is \(5 \times 3 = 15\).

Adding these to the previous total, the girls had \(10 + 15 = 25\) water balloons in total.

The final numerical answer is 25."
"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes of stuff available for the yard sale.

1. The 10 people donate 5 boxes each, so the total donation is:
   \[
   10 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ boxes/person} = 50 \text{ boxes}
   \]

2. They also have 10 boxes already owned by the charity group.

3. Adding the donated boxes to the owned boxes:
   \[

"First, let's calculate the total distance Zoey spits her seeds. Zoey has 40 seeds and spits each one 10 feet. So, the total distance Zoey spits is:
\[ 40 \text{ seeds} \times 10 \text{ feet/seed} = 400 \text{ feet} \]

Next, let's calculate the total distance Sydney spits her seeds. Sydney has 35 seeds and spits each one 12 feet. So, the total distance Sydney spits is:
\[ 35 \text{ seeds} \times 12 \text{ feet/seed} = 420 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we need to find the average total distance spat by both Zoey and Sydney. To do this, we add the total distances and divide by the number of people (which is 2):
\[ \text{Average total distance} = \frac{400 \text{ feet} + 420 \text{ feet}}{2} = \frac{820 \text{ feet}}{2} = 410 \text{ feet} \]

The average total distance spat is:

"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the daily, monthly, and total widget production for each machine, and then calculate the revenue from selling those widgets.

First, let's calculate the daily widget production for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1440 widgets/day
- WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1080 widgets/day

Next, let's calculate the monthly widget production for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: 1440 widgets/day * 30 days/month = 43200 widgets/month
- WidgetMaster 9000: 1080 widgets/day * 30 days/month = 32400 widgets/month

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling the widgets for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: 43200 widgets/month * $6/widget = $259,200/month
- WidgetMaster 9000: 32400 widgets/month * $6/widget = $194,400/month

Finally, let's find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000:
- Difference in revenue: $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

The final numerical answer is $64,800."
"To determine how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the total cost for his stay under both options and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost if Cameron pays for a 24-hour stay:
- The initial 12-hour stay costs 1600 pesos.
- The additional 12 hours cost 12 * 70 pesos = 840 pesos.
- Therefore, the total cost for a 24-hour stay is 1600 + 840 = 2440 pesos.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Cameron pays for the additional hours after the initial 12 hours:
- The initial 12-hour stay costs 1600 pesos.
- The additional hours from 12 pm to 10 am the next morning is 10 pm - 12 pm = 10 hours.
- The cost for these additional hours is 10 * 70 pesos = 700 pesos.
- Therefore, the total cost for the additional hours is 1600 + 700 = 2300 pesos.

Now, we find the savings by subtracting the total cost for the additional hours from the total cost for a 24-hour stay:
- Savings = 2440 - 2300 = 140 pesos.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. So, we calculate twice the amount each goat needs and then subtract 3 pounds:

\[ \text{Hay per sheep} = 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep. There are 15 goats, and each needs 5 pounds of hay:

\[ \text{Hay for goats} = 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

There are 12 sheep, and each needs 7 pounds of hay:

\[ \text{Hay for sheep} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the hay needed for the goats and the sheep gives us the total amount of hay needed:

\[ \text{Total hay} = 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate John's earnings for the week:
\[ \text{Earnings} = \text{Hourly Wage} \times \text{Hours Worked} = 50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the gas:
\[ \text{Cost of Gas} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the remaining money after spending on gas:
\[ \text{Remaining Money} = \text{Earnings} - \text{Cost of Gas} = 300 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so we subtract that from the remaining money:
\[ \text{Money After Deposit} = \text{Remaining Money} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of 5 pencils:
\[ \text{Cost of Pencils} = 5 \times 10 \text{ dollars/pencil} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the cost of the pencils from the money after the deposit:
\[ \text{Money After Buying Pencils} = \text{Money After Deposit} - \text{Cost of Pencils} = 150 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, let's determine how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with the remaining money:
\[ \text{Number of Pens} = \frac{\text{Money After Buying Pencils}}{\text{Cost of One Pen}} = \frac{100 \text{ dollars}}{25 \text{ dollars/pen}} = 4 \text{ pens} \]

"First, let's calculate the distance James swims. He swims 60% of the 20-mile lake, which is:

\[ 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes for James to swim 12 miles at a pace of 2 miles per hour:

\[ \text{Time to swim 12 miles} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

James then rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is:

\[ \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

After resting, James swims the remaining 8 miles (20 miles - 12 miles) at half the speed, which is:

\[ \text{Speed for the remaining distance} = \frac{2 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile/hour} \]

The time it takes for James to swim the remaining 8 miles at 1 mile per hour is:

\[ \text{Time to swim remaining 8 miles} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, the total time it took James to get across the lake is the sum of the swimming time, the resting time, and the swimming time for the remaining distance:

\[ \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours} \]

"Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as \( A \), by Bahati as \( B \), and by Dinar as \( D \).

From the problem, we know:
1. \( B = A + 20 \)
2. \( B = D + 10 \)
3. \( B + A + D = 45 \)

First, we can express \( D \) in terms of \( A \) using the first two equations:
\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]
Since \( B = A + 20 \), we can substitute \( B \) in the second equation:
\[ A + 20 = D + 10 \]
Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = A + 10 \]

Now we substitute \( B \) and \( D \) in terms of \( A \) into the total points equation:
\[ (A + 20) + A + (A + 10) = 45 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]

"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up early.

1. **Total sleep time**: Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Converting this to minutes:
   \[
   8 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Time spent sleepwalking**: Kim sleepwalked from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. The duration of sleepwalking is:
   \[
   2:38 \text{ a.m.} - 2:15 \text{ a.m.} = 23 \text{ minutes}

\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \). According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls. We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so we can set up the equation:

\[ 2J = 2 \]

Solving for \( J \):

\[ J = 1 \]

Now we can determine the number of balls each boy carried:
- Jeffrey carried \( J = 1 \) ball.
- Jason carried \( 2J = 2 \) balls.
- Jordan carried \( 4J = 4 \times 1 = 4 \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is:

\[ 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 7."
"To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the number of holes at the end of the first day.
3. Calculate the number of holes at the end of the third day.
4. Find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
- First day: 10 holes
- Second day: 13 holes
- Third day: 8 holes (but they filled in 2 holes, so they actually dug 8 - 2 = 6 holes)

Total holes by the end of the third day = 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 holes.

The island had four times as many holes by the end of the third day as it did at the end of the first day. So, the number of holes at the end of the first day is:
\[ \text{Holes at the end of the first day} = \frac{29}{4} = 7.25 \]

Since the number of holes must be a whole number, and considering the context of digging holes, it seems there might be a slight discrepancy in the interpretation. However, for the purpose of this problem, we'll assume the number of holes at the end of the first day is 7 (as it's the closest whole number).

Now, let's find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day. The number of holes at the end of the third day is 29, and the number of holes at the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day, which is 4 * 7 = 28 holes.

Therefore, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[ \text{Holes dug on the fourth day} = 29 - 28 = 1 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of corn chips given the conditions. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of corn chips each person received:**
   - Amora received 70 corn chips.
   - Lainey received 70 corn chips.
   - Collins received 15 more corn chips than either Amora or Lainey.

2. **Calculate the number of corn chips Collins received:**
   - Collins received \(70 + 15 = 85\) corn chips.

3. **Sum the total number of corn chips:**
   - Total corn chips = Corn chips received by Amora + Corn chips received by Lainey + Corn chips received by Collins
   - Total corn chips = \(70 + 70 + 85\)

4. **Perform the addition:**
   - Total corn chips = \(70 + 70 + 85 = 225\)

Thus, the total number of corn chips is 225.

\[
\boxed{225}

"To find the cost of the travel tickets, we need to calculate 50% more than the cost of the supplies. The supplies cost $400 in total.

First, calculate 50% of $400:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

Next, add this amount to the original cost of the supplies to find the total travel cost:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

So, the travel cost is $600.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 600 \]"
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( X = S + 5 \)
2. \( S = 4A - 13 \)
3. \( X + S + A = 339 \)

First, we substitute the expressions for \( X \) and \( S \) from the first two equations into the third equation.

Substituting \( X = S + 5 \) and \( S = 4A - 13 \) into \( X + S + A = 339 \):

\[ (4A - 13) + 5 + (4A - 13) + A = 339 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 4A - 13 + 5 + 4A - 13 + A = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Add 21 to both sides:

\[ 9A = 360 \]

Divide by 9:

\[ A = 40 \]

Now, we can find \( S \) using \( S = 4A - 13 \):

\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

The final numerical answer is:
147"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

   - There are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode.
   - Let \( E \) be the number of episodes.
   - Let \( M \) be the number of minutes per episode.
   - Given \( M = 20 \) minutes.
   - According to the problem, \( E = \frac{M}{2} \).

2. **Calculate the number of episodes:**
   - Substitute \( M = 20 \) into the equation \( E = \frac{M}{2} \):
     \[
     E = \frac{20}{2} = 10
     \]

3. **Calculate the total time spent watching the show:**
   - Each episode is 20 minutes long.
   - There are 10 episodes.
   - Total time \( T \) is given by:
     \[
     T = E \times M = 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show is 200 minutes."
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance flown in each segment of the journey and then sum these distances.

1. **First Segment:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Direction: Norttherly
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \)

3. **Third Segment:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \)

Now, we sum the distances of all segments to find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes:

\[ 300 \text{ miles} + 36 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 446 \text{ miles} \]

The distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is **446 miles**."
"First, let's determine the total number of brownies Greta had initially:

- For herself, she made 1 dozen brownies.
- At her office party, she received 1/2 dozen brownies.
- At her friends' surprise party, she received 4 dozen brownies.

So, the total number of brownies she received is:
1 dozen + 1/2 dozen + 4 dozen = 1 + 0.5 + 4 = 5.5 dozen brownies.

Since 1 dozen equals 12 brownies, we convert the total number of brownies to individual pieces:
5.5 dozen * 12 brownies/dozen = 66 brownies.

Next, we account for the brownies eaten during the party:
1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. Converting 1 1/2 dozen to individual pieces:
1 1/2 dozen * 12 brownies/dozen = 1.5 * 12 = 18 brownies.

Now, we subtract the brownies eaten from the total number of brownies:
66 brownies - 18 brownies = 48 brownies.

Therefore, the number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is 48."
"To find the total age of Nani, his brother, and his sister, we need to calculate the ages of each family member and then sum them up.

1. Nani's age is given as 8 years.
2. Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is \( 8 \times 2 = 16 \) years.
3. Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. So, her age is \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \) years.

Now, we sum up the ages of Nani, his brother, and his sister:
\[ 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 \]

The total age of all three family members is 30."

"First, let's determine the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington initially had and how many she gave away:

- Total boxes bought: 12
- Boxes given to mom: 2
- Boxes given to sister: 2

Total boxes given away = 2 + 2 = 4

So, the number of boxes Mrs. Harrington kept is:
12 - 4 = 8

Each box contains 20 oranges, so the total number of oranges is:
12 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 240 oranges

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges, so the number of oranges she kept is:
1/4 * 240 oranges = 60 oranges

"To solve this problem, let's first determine the number of states in the USA. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the United States has 50 states.

Given that India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, we can calculate the number of states in India as follows:
- Half the number of states in the USA is \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \).
- India has 4 more than this, so the number of states in India is \( 25 + 4 = 29 \).

Now, to find the total number of states in both countries together, we add the number of states in India and the number of states in the USA:
- Total number of states = Number of states in India + Number of states in the USA
- Total number of states = 29 + 50 = 79

The final numerical answer is 79."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Tyler wants to buy:
- Dictionary: $18
- Dinosaur book: $13
- Children's cookbook: $8

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Tyler has already saved $14. Therefore, the additional amount he needs to earn is:
Additional amount needed = Total cost - Amount saved
Additional amount needed = $39 - $14 = $25

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn the additional $25, we divide the additional amount needed by his hourly wage:
Hours needed = Additional amount needed / Hourly wage
Hours needed = $25 / $5 = 5 hours

So, Tyler has to work 5 hours to afford his books."
"First, let's determine how many cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 30 cherries and 10 more than Richard, we can calculate Richard's cherries as follows:

\[ \text{Richard's cherries} = \text{Robert's cherries} - 10 = 30 - 10 = 20 \]

Now, we know the total number of cherries is 60. We can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting the number of cherries Richard and Robert have from the total:

\[ \text{Jerry's cherries} = \text{Total cherries} - (\text{Richard's cherries} + \text{Robert's cherries}) = 60 - (20 + 30) = 60 - 50 = 10 \]

Finally, to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Robert's cherries} - \text{Jerry's cherries} = 30 - 10 = 20 \]

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's define the current ages of Emil's dad and brother as \(D\) and \(B\) respectively.

Given:
- Emil is currently 19 years old.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.

First, let's determine the age of Emil's dad when he turns 24:
- Emil will be 24 years old.
- At that time, his dad will be \(24 + (24 - 19) = 24 + 5 = 29\) years old.
- According to the problem, at that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad:
  \[
  24 = \frac{1}{2} \times 29
  \]
  This equation is not directly useful for finding the current ages but confirms the future age relationship.

Next, let's determine the age of Emil's brother when Emil turns 24:
- Emil will be 24 years old.
- At that time, his brother will be \(24 - (24 - 19) = 24 - 5 = 19\) years old.
- According to the problem, at that time, Emil will be twice as old as his brother:
  \[
  24 = 2 \times 19
  \]
  This equation is not directly useful for finding the current ages but confirms the future age relationship.

Now, we need to find the current ages of Emil's dad and brother:
- Emil's current age is 19.
- When Emil is 24, his dad will be 29, so his dad's current age is \(29 - 5 = 24\).
- When Emil is 24, his brother will be 19, so his brother's current age is \(19 - 5 = 14\).

Finally, the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is:

"First, let's find out how many students are football players. Since 20% of the class are football players, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 30 = \frac{20}{100} \times 30 = 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are football players. This means the remaining number of students is:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining 24 students are cheerleaders or part of the band. Since 25% of the remaining students are cheerleaders or part of the band, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 24 = \frac{25}{100} \times 24 = 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are either cheerleaders or part of the band. Therefore, the total number of students leaving early is the sum of the football players and the cheerleaders/band members:

"First, let's convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches to match the units of the flower width. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

\[ 111 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 1332 \text{ inches} \]

Each flower is 12 inches wide, and there needs to be 1.5 feet (which is 18 inches) between every plant. Therefore, the total space taken by one plant and the space between it and the next plant is:

\[ 12 \text{ inches} + 18 \text{ inches} = 30 \text{ inches} \]

To find out how many plants can fit in the flower bed, we divide the total length of the flower bed by the space taken by one plant and the space between it and the next plant:

\[ \frac{1332 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/plant}} = 44.4 \]

Since Pat can't plant a fraction of a plant, she can plant 44 plants. Pat already owns 17 plants, so she needs to buy:

\[ 44 - 17 = 27 \text{ plants} \]

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for the new plants is:

\[ 27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars} \]

"First, let's determine how much Jessica sets aside each month for fancy shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly paycheck.

\[ \text{Amount set aside per month} = 25\% \times \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times \$2,000.00 = \$500.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how much she can spend on shoes in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the monthly amount by 12.

\[ \text{Amount set aside per year} = \$500.00 \times 12 = \$6,000.00 \]

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. To find out how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we divide the total amount she can spend on shoes by the cost of one pair of shoes.

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes} = \frac{\$6,000.00}{\$1,000.00} = 6 \]

So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, the time required to peel 90 shrimp is:

\[ \text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to saute 30 shrimp. Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, the time required to saute 90 shrimp is:

\[ \text{Time to saute 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/10 minutes}} = 3 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Emily can peel and saute simultaneously, the total time required to peel and saute 90 shrimp is the longer of the two times calculated, which is 30 minutes.

So, the final numerical answer is 30 minutes."

   - No cooling, so the temperature increases by 2 degrees per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Temperature change: \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ degrees}\)

Now, let's sum up the temperature changes:
- Total cooling: \(6 \text{ degrees} + 12 \text{ degrees} = 18 \text{ degrees}\)
- Total warming: \(4 \text{ degrees}\)

Net temperature change: \(18 \text{ degrees} - 4 \text{ degrees} = 14 \text{ degrees}\)

Since the air conditioner was off for 2 hours, the room would have warmed up by 4 degrees during that time. Therefore, the final temperature is 4 degrees higher than the starting temperature.

The final temperature is 4 degrees higher than the starting temperature, so the room is 4 degrees higher than the starting temperature. The question asks for how many degrees lower than the starting temperature the final temperature is, which is the negative of the above result.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
-4

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's father when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Bill's father saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Since his father was 30 years old when he saw the comet, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw it for the second time.

3. **Determine the age difference between the first and second sightings:**
   - The comet orbits the sun every 75 years, so the second sighting was 75 years after the first sighting.
   - Therefore, Bill was 90 years old 75 years after he was \(x\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.
   - This gives us the equation: \(x + 75 = 90\).

4. **Solve for \(x\):**
   - \(x = 90 - 75 = 15\).

So, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

The final numerical answer is:
15"
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, let's break down the information given:

1. He writes a check for the electric bill once per month.
2. He writes a check for the gas bill once per month.
3. He writes a check to the church twice per month.
4. He writes a check to the pest and lawn service quarterly (which is 4 times per year).

First, let's calculate the number of checks he writes for the electric and gas bills:
- Electric bill: 12 checks per year (once per month)
- Gas bill: 12 checks per year (once per month)

Next, let's calculate the number of checks he writes for the church:
- Church: 24 checks per year (twice per month)

Finally, let's calculate the number of checks he writes for the pest and lawn service:
- Pest and lawn service: 4 checks per year (quarterly)

Now, we sum up all the checks:
- Electric bill: 12 checks
- Gas bill: 12 checks
- Church: 24 checks
- Pest and lawn service: 4 checks

Total number of checks per year = 12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52 checks

The final numerical answer is 52."
"Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as \( F \). According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4}F \). The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany, so the number of flights to France is \( \frac{1}{4}F \) and the number of flights to Germany is also \( \frac{1}{4}F \).

The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, which is half the number of flights the first plane makes. Therefore, the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day is:
\[ F = 2 \times 44 = 88 \]

Now, we can find the number of flights to France by calculating \( \frac{1}{4}F \):
\[ \frac{1}{4}F = \frac{1}{4} \times 88 = 22 \]

So, the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day is \( 22 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 22 \]"
"First, let's determine the duration of each wolf's howl.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so:
\[ \text{Chikote's howl duration} = 2 \times 20 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Igneous howls for as long as Tobias and Chikote combined, so:
\[ \text{Igneous's howl duration} = 20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} = 60 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, let's find the combined duration of all three wolves' howls in seconds:
\[ \text{Combined duration} = 20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} + 60 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ seconds} \]

To convert the combined duration from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):
\[ \text{Combined duration in minutes} = \frac{120 \text{ seconds}}{60} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Adam's parents gave him. Adam's mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much, which is $6 * 2 = $12. So, the total amount of money given by his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Adam spent $30 on trousers. To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount given by his parents from the amount he spent on trousers.

So, the calculation is:
\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

Therefore, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the ages of the children as follows:
- Akbar's age = 3 years
- Alessandro's age = 4 years
- Helene's age = \( H \) years
- Wilfred's age = \( W \) years

We know the total age of the children is 20 years:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

We are also given that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{3 + 4 + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene is twice the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now we substitute \( H = 10 \) into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Therefore, Wilfred's age is 3 years. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Walter has collected from his neighbors and the online fund:

- From neighbors: $500
- From online fund: $1500

Total collected so far: $500 + $1500 = $2000

Next, we need to determine how much Walter's lawyer will contribute. The lawyer will donate three times as much as everyone else donates. To find out how much everyone else has donated, we need to add the $200 given by Walter's friend to the total collected so far:

- Total collected so far: $2000
- Amount given by Walter's friend: $200

Total amount donated by everyone else: $2000 + $200 = $2200

Now, we calculate the lawyer's contribution, which is three times the amount donated by everyone else:

- Amount donated by everyone else: $2200
- Lawyer's contribution: 3 * $2200 = $6600

So, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6600."
"First, we need to calculate the total number of cookies. Since there were 100 guests and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies/guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies} \]

The bride decided to give half of the cookies to the church next door. Therefore, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500 \text{ cookies}}{2} = 750 \text{ cookies} \]

Each person in the church next door got 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church next door, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people} \]

So, the number of people in the church next door is 50."
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the distribution of the watermelon slices among the family members. Let's denote the total volume of the watermelon as \( V \).

Given that there are 2 adults and 4 kids, and each adult's slice is twice as big as each kid's slice, we can set up the following relationships:

Let \( x \) be the volume of each kid's slice. Then, the volume of each adult's slice is \( 2x \).

The total volume of the watermelon is the sum of the volumes of all slices:
\[ V = 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

Each adult gets \( 2x \) volume, and there are 2 adults, so the total volume of the slices for the adults is:
\[ 2 \times 2x = 4x \]

The percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is calculated as:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Volume of each adult's slice}}{\text{Total volume of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon."
"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones will spend on checking on the inpatients. He has 9 inpatients, and it takes him 20 minutes per inpatient.

\[ 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes per inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's convert the 180 minutes into hours:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the total time he will spend on his appointments. He has 10 appointments, and each appointment takes 30 minutes.

\[ 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes per appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's convert the 300 minutes into hours:

\[ 300 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's add the time spent on inpatients and appointments:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 5 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Doctor Jones is spending 9 hours at the clinic that day. Therefore, the time left for him to update his records is:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to complete all the steps and then subtract this total from the desired serving time of 5:00 pm.

1. Time to make the cake batter: 20 minutes
2. Time to bake the cake: 30 minutes
3. Time to cool the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
4. Time to frost the cake: 10 minutes

Now, let's add up all these times:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Convert 180 minutes into hours and minutes:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Jordan needs 3 hours to complete the cake from start to finish. If she wants the cake to be ready by 5:00 pm, we subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm:
\[ 5:00 \text{ pm} - 3 \text{ hours} = 2:00 \text{ pm} \]

Therefore, the latest time of day that Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

The final numerical answer is:

- Fixed cost per session: $25
- Variable cost per student per session: $1.50
- Number of students: 10
- Total variable cost per session: $1.50 * 10 = $15
- Total cost per session: $25 + $15 = $40

Next, let's calculate the total earnings per session:
- Number of days the studio is rented per week: 3
- Number of weeks in a month: 4 (assuming a 4-week month)
- Total sessions per week: 3
- Total sessions per month: 3 * 4 = 12
- Total earnings per session: $40

Finally, let's calculate the total earnings for the month:

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"To find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we first need to determine the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes.

Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars. Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes is:
\[ \text{Chocolate bars per box (Peter)} = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]

Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars. Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes is:
\[ \text{Chocolate bars per box (Martha)} = \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

Now, to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we subtract the number of chocolate bars per box for Martha from the number of chocolate bars per box for Peter:

"First, let's determine the number of female porcupines in the park. Given that the total population of porcupines is 50 and the number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population, we can calculate the number of female porcupines as follows:

\[ \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the number of babies born each month is:

\[ \text{Number of babies born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120 \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[ \text{Total number of babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440 \]

The initial population of porcupines is 50. After a year, the total number of porcupines in the park will be the initial population plus the total number of babies born in a year:

\[ \text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1490 \]"
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the swimming pool. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:

\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

\[ \text{Volume} = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. We know that 1 cubic foot is approximately equal to 7.48 gallons. Therefore:

\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = 1400 \times 7.48 \]

\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = 10472 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:

\[ \text{Cost} = 10472 \times 0.10 \]

\[ \text{Cost} = 1047.20 \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is $1047.20."

"First, we calculate the distance Matteo traveled. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Matteo:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 55 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance Shandy traveled:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} = 45 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the distance Matteo traveled from the distance Shandy traveled:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many laps each person can run:

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) laps.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps.

Now, to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run:

\[10 - 5 = 5\]

So, Bethany can run 5 more laps than Quinn. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days and then subtract this from the tank's total capacity.

First, let's determine the amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B on the first day:

- Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity on the first day.
- The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, so Wanda pumped \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons on the first day.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda, so she pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons on the first day.

Next, let's determine the amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B on the second day:

- Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day, so she pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons on the second day.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day, so she pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons on the second day.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank over the two days:

- Total water pumped by Wanda: \( 4500 + 3000 = 7500 \) gallons.
- Total water pumped by Ms. B: \( 3375 + 1125 = 4500 \) gallons.
- Total water pumped into the tank: \( 7500 + 4500 = 12000 \) gallons.

Finally, we subtract the total amount of water pumped into the tank from the tank's total capacity to find out how many gallons are remaining:

- Remaining gallons: \( 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \) gallons.

The final numerical answer is 6000 gallons."
"Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as \( C \).

First, we know that the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour for 5 hours. This means that after 5 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ C \times (1 - 0.09)^5 = C \times 0.91^5 \]

Calculating \( 0.91^5 \):
\[ 0.91^5 \approx 0.652 \]

So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is approximately:
\[ C \times 0.652 \]

Next, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour for 3 hours. This means that after another 3 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ C \times 0.652 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = C \times 0.652 \times 0.93^3 \]

Calculating \( 0.93^3 \):
\[ 0.93^3 \approx 0.812 \]

So, after 8 hours, the charge remaining is approximately:
\[ C \times 0.652 \times 0.812 \approx C \times 0.528 \]

We know that after 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%, or 0.28. Therefore:
\[ C \times 0.528 = 0.28 \]

Solving for \( C \):
\[ C = \frac{0.28}{0.528} \approx 0.531 \]

So, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 53.1%."
"First, let's calculate Janet's total weekly earnings. She earns $10 per hour from her job and $15 per hour from tips, so her total hourly wage is:

\[ 10 + 15 = 25 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Since she works 40 hours a week, her weekly earnings are:

\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ dollars per week} \]

Next, we need to determine how much she needs to save to buy the car. The down payment for the car is $10,000. She wants to save 20% of this amount:

\[ 10000 \times 0.20 = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to save $2000 at a rate of $1000 per week. We do this by dividing the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:

\[ \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

So, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment for the car. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased:

- Peaches: 3 peaches * $0.50/peach = $1.50
- Pears: 4 pears * $0.50/pear = $2.00
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00/kiwi = $2.00
- Apples: 5 apples * $0.75/apple = $3.75

Now, let's sum these amounts to find the total cost of the fruits he has already bought:

Total cost of purchased fruits = $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar has $10 to spend, so the remaining amount he can spend on plums is:

Remaining amount = $10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75 is:

Number of plums = $0.75 / $0.25/plum = 3 plums

So, the final numerical answer is 3."
"First, we need to determine the total number of pieces of sweets Anne purchased. Since she bought a box containing 15 packs and each pack has 60 pieces, the total number of pieces is calculated as follows:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept 2 packs for herself. The number of pieces in these 2 packs is:

\[ 2 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

The number of pieces of sweets that Anne gave to her friends is the total number of pieces minus the number of pieces she kept:

\[ 900 \text{ pieces} - 120 \text{ pieces} = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne gave these 780 pieces to her 10 friends equally. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide the number of pieces given to friends by the number of friends:

\[ \frac{780 \text{ pieces}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 78 \text{ pieces/friend} \]

So, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 78 \]"
"To calculate the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating compounded price increases:

\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (1 + \text{Rate})^{\text{Number of Years}} \]

Given:
- Initial Price = $120
- Rate = 5% = 0.05
- Number of Years = 3

Let's calculate the final price:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years would be $139."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many selfies and portraits Olivia uploaded to her albums. We know that she uploaded a total of 72 pictures into 8 albums, with 3 albums being selfies only and 2 albums being portraits only. This means the remaining albums are for other types of pictures.

First, let's calculate the number of albums that are not selfies or portraits:
\[ 8 \text{ total albums} - 3 \text{ selfies} - 2 \text{ portraits} = 3 \text{ other albums} \]

Since the 3 other albums are not specified as selfies or portraits, we can assume they are neither. This means the selfies and portraits are the only types of pictures in the albums.

Next, we need to determine how many pictures are in the selfies and portraits albums. Since the number of pictures in each album is the same, we divide the total number of pictures by the total number of albums:
\[ \frac{72 \text{ pictures}}{8 \text{ albums}} = 9 \text{ pictures per album} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of selfies and portraits:
- Number of selfies = 3 albums * 9 pictures per album = 27 pictures
- Number of portraits = 2 albums * 9 pictures per album = 18 pictures

Therefore, the total number of selfies and portraits is:
\[ 27 \text{ selfies} + 18 \text{ portraits} = 45 \text{ pictures} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 45 \]"
"To determine how long James spends reading, we first need to find out how many minutes it takes him to read one page. Since it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can calculate the time it takes to read one page by dividing 10 minutes by 3 pages:

\[ \text{Time per page} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages. We do this by multiplying the time it takes to read one page by 18:

\[ \text{Time to read 18 pages} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes} \]

Let's perform the multiplication:

\[ 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, James spends 60 minutes reading. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the current number of guests in the hotel, we need to account for the changes in the number of guests over the day.

1. Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.
2. 24 guests checked out early, so the number of guests decreased by 24:
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76
   \]
3. 15 guests checked out late, so the number of guests decreased by 15:
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61
   \]
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, twice that number is:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30
   \]
   Adding these 30 guests to the current total:
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91
   \]
5. After dinner was served, 7 more people checked in:
   \[
   91 + 7 = 98
   \]

Therefore, the current number of guests in the hotel is 98."

"First, let's determine the number of easy, average, and difficult questions in the quiz.

- Total questions: 60
- Easy questions: 40% of 60 = 0.40 * 60 = 24 questions
- Average and difficult questions combined: 60 - 24 = 36 questions
- Since the average and difficult questions are equally divided, there are 36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct. So, the number of easy questions she is sure to get correct is:
\[ 75\% \text{ of } 24 = 0.75 \times 24 = 18 \]

Aries is sure to get half of the average and difficult questions correct. So, the number of average and difficult questions she is sure to get correct is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \text{ of } 18 = 9 \]

Adding these up, the total number of questions Aries is sure to get correct is:
\[ 18 \text{ (easy)} + 9 \text{ (average)} + 9 \text{ (difficult)} = 36 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 36 \]"
"First, let's determine the price of a large stuffed animal. Since each small stuffed animal costs $4 and large stuffed animals cost three times as much, the price of a large stuffed animal is:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( L \). According to the problem, the number of small stuffed animals sold is twice the number of large stuffed animals sold, so the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2L \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as the sum of the earnings from the large stuffed animals and the small stuffed animals. The earnings from the large stuffed animals are \( 12L \) dollars, and the earnings from the small stuffed animals are \( 4 \times 2L = 8L \) dollars. The total earnings are given as $120, so we can set up the following equation:
\[ 12L + 8L = 120 \]
\[ 20L = 120 \]
\[ L = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

Since the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2L \), we have:
\[ 2L = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"

"First, let's calculate Suzanne's earnings from selling cookies and cupcakes.

Earnings from cookies = Number of cookies sold × Price per cookie
Earnings from cookies = 80 × $1
Earnings from cookies = $80

Earnings from cupcakes = Number of cupcakes sold × Price per cupcake
Earnings from cupcakes = 60 × $4
Earnings from cupcakes = $240

Total earnings = Earnings from cookies + Earnings from cupcakes
Total earnings = $80 + $240
Total earnings = $320

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave away a total of:
Total given away = $10 × 2
Total given away = $20

Money left = Total earnings - Total given away
Money left = $320 - $20
Money left = $300

The final numerical answer is $300."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the ore mining rate with a steel pickaxe:**
   - A dwarf with an iron pickaxe mines 12 pounds per day.
   - A dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 50% more than a dwarf with an iron pickaxe.
   - 50% of 12 pounds is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6\) pounds.
   - Therefore, a dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines \(12 + 6 = 18\) pounds per day.

2. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in one day:**
   - Each dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 18 pounds per day.
   - 40 dwarves would mine \(18 \times 40 = 720\) pounds per day.

3. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month:**
   - There are 30 days in the month.
   - The total ore mined in a month is \(720 \times 30 = 21600\) pounds.

The final numerical answer is 21600 pounds."
"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to use the information that the prices are proportional. Let's denote the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches as \( x \).

First, we calculate the cost per sandwich for each package:
- For the first package with 2 sandwiches for $3, the cost per sandwich is:
  \[
  \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
  \]
- For the second package with 4 sandwiches for $6, the cost per sandwich is:
  \[
  \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
  \]

Since the prices are proportional, the cost per sandwich for the third package (8 sandwiches) should also be $1.5. Therefore, we can set up the following proportion to find \( x \):
\[
\frac{x}{8} = 1.5
\]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 8:
\[
x = 1.5 \times 8 = 12
\]

Thus, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost \(\boxed{12}\) dollars."

"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst due to the gust of wind. Sally initially had 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst.

\[ \text{Red balloons that burst} = 25 \times \frac{40}{100} = 25 \times 0.4 = 10 \]

So, the number of red balloons remaining is:

\[ \text{Remaining red balloons} = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Next, Sally accidentally released half of the yellow balloons. She initially had 12 yellow balloons.

\[ \text{Yellow balloons released} = 12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons remaining is:

\[ \text{Remaining yellow balloons} = 12 - 6 = 6 \]

Sally found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her remaining balloons.

\[ \text{Blue balloons added} = 8 \times \frac{75}{100} = 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \]

Now, let's sum up all the remaining balloons Sally carried into the school:

\[ \text{Total balloons} = \text{Remaining red balloons} + \text{Remaining yellow balloons} + \text{Blue balloons added} \]
\[ \text{Total balloons} = 15 + 6 + 6 = 27 \]

"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of the different scenarios and their outcomes.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of the substitute teacher collecting the homework: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of having to turn in the homework: 50% or 0.50

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having the normal teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of getting an extension from the normal teacher: 40% or 0.40
   - Probability of not getting an extension from the normal teacher: 60% or 0.60
   - Probability of Marcus convincing the teacher his dog ate the assignment: 20% or 0.20
   - Probability of not convincing the teacher: 80% or 0.80

Now, let's calculate the overall probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework:

- **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
  - Probability of having to turn in the homework: 50% or 0.50

- **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
  - Probability of not getting an extension: 60% or 0.60
  - Probability of having to turn in the homework: 100% or 1.00 (since he doesn't get an extension and can't convince the teacher)

Now, we combine these probabilities:

- Probability of having a substitute teacher and having to turn in the homework: \(0.50 \times 0.50 = 0.25\)
- Probability of having the normal teacher and not getting an extension: \(0.50 \times 0.60 = 0.30\)
- Probability of having the normal teacher, getting an extension, and having to turn in the homework: \(0.50 \times 0.40 \times 0 = 0\) (since he gets an extension)

Adding these probabilities together:

\[0.25 + 0.30 = 0.55\]

So, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:

"First, we need to determine the total number of seats that are not occupied by graduates and faculty. The Fine Arts Center has a capacity of 6000 seats. After accounting for 950 seats for graduates and 300 seats for faculty, the number of seats available for distribution to graduates' friends and family is:

\[ 6000 - 950 - 300 = 5750 \]

Next, we need to split these 5750 seats equally among the 950 graduates. To find out how many tickets each graduate will receive, we divide the number of available seats by the number of graduates:

\[ \frac{5750}{950} = 6.052631578947368 \]

Since the number of tickets must be a whole number, we round down to the nearest whole number, as partial tickets are not practical. Therefore, each graduate will receive 6 tickets.

"First, let's calculate the total amount Jim borrowed during his college years. He borrowed $50,000 per year for 4 years, so the total amount borrowed is:

\[ 50,000 \times 4 = 200,000 \]

Next, let's determine his income after graduating from college. His original income was $25,000 per year, and his income tripled, so his new income is:

\[ 25,000 \times 3 = 75,000 \]

Now, let's calculate the total income he would have earned if he had not gone to college. He would have earned $25,000 per year for 4 years, so the total income he would have earned is:

\[ 25,000 \times 4 = 100,000 \]

The money lost from not working while in school is the difference between the total income he would have earned and the total income he actually earned:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Monday's Deliveries**: The post office delivered 425 letters.
2. **Tuesday's Deliveries**: The number of letters delivered on Tuesday is 17 more than one-fifth of the number delivered on Monday. 
   - One-fifth of Monday's deliveries: \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \)
   - Tuesday's deliveries: \( 85 + 17 = 102 \)
3. **Wednesday's Deliveries**: The number of letters delivered on Wednesday is 5 more than twice the number delivered on Tuesday.
   - Twice Tuesday's deliveries: \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \)

"To find out how much Johnny's dad lost on average that day, we need to calculate the total amount lost and then divide it by the number of races.

1. **First Race:**
   - Johnny's dad lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost.
   - Amount lost in the first race = $5.
   - Twice the amount lost in the first race = $5 * 2 = $10.
   - Amount won in the second race = $10 + $1 = $11.
   - Since he won, this is a positive amount, but for the purpose of calculating loss, we consider the negative of this amount.
   - Amount lost in the second race = -$11.

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Amount won in the second race = $11.
   - 1.5 times the amount won in the second race = $11 * 1.5 = $16.5.
   - Amount lost in the third race = $16.5.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost:
- Total amount lost = Amount lost in the first race + Amount lost in the second race + Amount lost in the third race.
- Total amount lost = $5 + (-$11) + $16.5 = $5 - $11 + $16.5 = $10.5.

To find the average amount lost per race, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races:
- Number of races = 3.
- Average amount lost per race = Total amount lost / Number of races = $10.5 / 3 = $3.5.

"To determine the number of hours each painter put in, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days the painters worked.
2. Determine the total number of hours worked by all painters.
3. Calculate the total number of hours worked by each painter.

First, let's calculate the total number of days the painters worked. Since they worked for 3 weeks, and each week has 7 days, the total number of days is:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days} \]

Next, we know that each painter worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day each day. Therefore, the total number of hours worked by all painters is:
\[ 21 \text{ days} \times \frac{3}{8} \text{ days/hour} = \frac{63}{8} \text{ hours} \]

Since there are 4 painters, the total number of hours worked by each painter is:
\[ \frac{63}{8} \text{ hours} \div 4 = \frac{63}{8} \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{63}{32} \text{ hours} \]

To convert \( \frac{63}{32} \) hours into a decimal, we perform the division:
\[ \frac{63}{32} = 1.96875 \]

Therefore, the number of hours each painter put in is:
\[ 1.96875 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1.96875 \]"
"Let's denote the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, Rory retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2}) = 2 \cdot 19 \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now that we know \( x = 6 \), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

So, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to apply the depreciation rate of 21% per year to the initial price of $20,000 for the three years between 2007 and 2010.

The formula for depreciation is:
\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^{\text{Number of Years}} \]

Here, the initial price is $20,000, the depreciation rate is 21% (or 0.21), and the number of years is 3 (from 2007 to 2010).

Let's calculate the final price:
\[ \text{Final Price} = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 20000 \times 0.493039 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 9860.78 \]

So, the price of the car in the year 2010 is approximately $9860.78."
"First, let's determine the number of English books. Since half of the 50 books are written in English, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of English books} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

Next, we calculate the number of German books. Since 10% of the books are written in German, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of German books} = 10\% \times 50 = 0.10 \times 50 = 5 \]

Now, to find the number of Spanish books, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:

\[ \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - (\text{Number of English books} + \text{Number of German books}) \]
\[ \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - (25 + 5) \]
\[ \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - 30 \]
\[ \text{Number of Spanish books} = 20 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 20."
"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we first need to determine how far she has already traveled. Bernice drove 325 kilometers over 4 days. 

The total distance from San Diego to New York City is approximately 1955 kilometers. To find out how much farther Bernice needs to drive, we subtract the distance she has already traveled from the total distance:

\[ 1955 \text{ km} - 325 \text{ km} = 1630 \text{ km} \]

So, Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers."
"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cups of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days.
2. Convert the total number of cups into gallons.

First, let's calculate the total number of cups of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days:
\[ \text{Total cups in 30 days} = 8 \, \text{cups/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 240 \, \text{cups} \]

Next, we convert the total number of cups into gallons. Since there are 16 cups in a gallon:
\[ \text{Total gallons} = \frac{240 \, \text{cups}}{16 \, \text{cups/gallon}} = 15 \, \text{gallons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 15 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of people on the train**: 120 people.
2. **First stop**: 20 more people board the train.
   - New number of people: \( 120 + 20 = 140 \) people.
3. **Second stop**: 50 people disembark and twice that number (which is \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \)) board the train.
   - People after disembarking: \( 140 - 50 = 90 \) people.
   - People after boarding: \( 90 + 100 = 190 \) people.
4. **Third stop**: 80 more people disembark.
   - Final number of people: \( 190 - 80 = 110 \) people.

Thus, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110."
"First, let's determine the cost of each item Alison bought:

1. Tank top: $10
2. Running shorts: $5 more than the tank top, so $10 + $5 = $15
3. Tennis shoes: Originally $48, but on sale for half price, so $48 / 2 = $24
4. Athletic socks: $8 original price, with a $2 coupon, so $8 - $2 = $6

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:

Total cost = Cost of tank top + Cost of running shorts + Cost of tennis shoes + Cost of athletic socks
Total cost = $10 + $15 + $24 + $6

Now, let's calculate the total cost:

Total cost = $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55

So, Alison spent $55 on athletic gear."
"To determine the cost of renovating the kitchen floor, we first need to calculate how many tiles are required to cover the 200 square feet area.

Each tile is a square with a side length of 1 foot, so the area of each tile is:
\[ 1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt} \]

Since the total area of the kitchen floor is 200 square feet, the number of tiles needed is:
\[ 200 \text{ SqFt} \div 1 \text{ SqFt/tile} = 200 \text{ tiles} \]

Each tile costs $12, so the total cost for 200 tiles is:
\[ 200 \text{ tiles} \times \$12/\text{tile} = \$2400 \]

Therefore, the cost to renovate the kitchen floor is:
\[ \$2400 \]"
"To determine how much James pays for insurance a year after his accident, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the increased monthly cost due to the accident.
2. Determine the annual cost based on the increased monthly cost.

First, let's calculate the increased monthly cost:
- The normal monthly cost is $120.
- The increase is 60% of the normal cost.

\[ \text{Increase} = 0.60 \times 120 = 72 \]

So, the increased monthly cost is:
\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Next, we calculate the annual cost:
- The increased monthly cost is $192.
- There are 12 months in a year.

\[ \text{Annual cost} = 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 2304 \]"
"To determine how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the number of loads required for the twin beds and the king size bed separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of loads for the twin beds:
- Greg has 4 twin beds.
- Each load can wash 2 twin sets of sheets.
- Therefore, the number of loads for the twin beds is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) loads per week.

Next, let's calculate the number of loads for the king size bed:
- Greg has 1 king size bed.
- Each load can wash 1 king set of sheets.
- Therefore, the number of loads for the king size bed is \( \frac{1}{1} = 1 \) load per week.

Now, let's find the total number of loads per week:
- Total loads per week = Loads for twin beds + Loads for king size bed
- Total loads per week = 2 + 1 = 3 loads per week.

Finally, let's calculate the total number of loads per year:
- There are 52 weeks in a year.
- Total loads per year = Total loads per week * Weeks per year
- Total loads per year = 3 * 52 = 156 loads.

The final numerical answer is 156."
"To determine the total number of movies Jill and her friends can watch in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the number of movies they watch each weekend and then multiply by 4.

First, let's find out how many movies they watch on Sunday. They watch half the number of movies on Sunday as they do on Saturday. Since they watch 4 movies on Saturday, they watch:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ movies on Sunday.} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of movies they watch in one weekend. They watch 4 movies on Saturday and 2 movies on Sunday, so in one weekend they watch:
\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ movies.} \]

Now, we need to find out how many movies they watch in 4 weeks. Since they watch 6 movies each weekend, in 4 weeks they will watch:
\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ movies.} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers. Last year, he collected 50 more stickers, so his collection increased to 100 + 50 = 150 stickers. This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which means he collected 2 * 50 = 100 stickers. Therefore, his collection increased to 150 + 100 = 250 stickers.

The final numerical answer is 250."
"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we first need to calculate the total amount of cat food Imma's cats consume per day.

Imma has 3 cats, and each cat is fed 60 grams of cat food twice a day. Therefore, the total amount of cat food consumed per day is:

\[ 3 \text{ cats} \times 60 \text{ grams/cat} \times 2 \text{ feedings/day} = 360 \text{ grams/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:

\[ \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams/day}} = 2 \text{ days} \]

So, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days."
"First, let's determine how many slices Jake ate. Since Becky ate 10 slices and she ate 3 more slices than Jake, Jake ate:

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we know that Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake. Therefore, Silvia ate:

\[ 2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by adding the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:

\[ 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 \text{ slices} \]

So, the total number of slices they ate is:

\[ 31 \]"
"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time for the meal is the sum of the times for both parts, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Next, we isolate \( D \) by subtracting 18 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Then, we solve for \( D \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's part as follows:

\[ Betsy's \ part = D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 58 \]"
"First, let's break down the costs:

1. **Cost of the cast**: $200
2. **Cost of the visit**: $300/hour for a 30-minute visit. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the cost is $300 * 0.5 = $150
3. **Cost of painkillers**: $4/pill for 30 painkillers. The cost is $4 * 30 = $120
4. **Cost of parking**: $6/hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours. The cost is $6 * 2 = $12

Now, let's sum these costs to find the total cost of the doctor's visit:

\[
200 + 150 + 120 + 12 = 482
\]

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"First, we need to determine how many emails James does not respond to in a day. Since 20% of the 80 emails do not require any response, we calculate 20% of 80:

\[ 0.20 \times 80 = 16 \]

So, James does not respond to 16 emails a day. This means he responds to the remaining emails:

\[ 80 - 16 = 64 \]

James responds to 64 emails each day. To find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of emails he responds to in a day by 5:

\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 320."
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to calculate the number of classes for each day and then sum them up.

- Wednesday: Three times as many as Monday, so \(3 \times 32 = 96\) classes
- Thursday: 30 classes
- Friday: 25 classes

Now, let's sum these numbers:

\[ 32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 \]

First, add 32 and 64:
\[ 32 + 64 = 96 \]

Next, add 96 and 96:
\[ 96 + 96 = 192 \]

Then, add 192 and 30:
\[ 192 + 30 = 222 \]

"First, let's calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club. They ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them.

\[ \text{Pizzas eaten by glee club} = 20 \times \frac{70}{100} = 20 \times 0.7 = 14 \]

So, the glee club has:

\[ \text{Pizzas left with glee club} = 20 - 14 = 6 \]

Next, let's calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the football team. They ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

The football team ate 80% of these pizzas.

\[ \text{Pizzas eaten by football team} = 40 \times \frac{80}{100} = 40 \times 0.8 = 32 \]

So, the football team has:

\[ \text{Pizzas left with football team} = 40 - 32 = 8 \]

Now, let's find the total number of pizzas left:

\[ \text{Total pizzas left} = \text{Pizzas left with glee club} + \text{Pizzas left with football team} = 6 + 8 = 14 \]

"First, let's determine the number of big coupons Anthony wants to send out. Since he wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, and he wants to send out 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is:

\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, and he is sending out 700 small coupons:

\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, and he is sending out 1400 big coupons:

\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of mailing all the coupons, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the cost of mailing the big coupons:

\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:

\[ 24500 \text{ cents} = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:

\[ \boxed{245} \]"
"First, let's determine how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney ordered. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which means she ordered \(10 - 3 = 7\) meatball sub sandwiches.

Next, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. So, the number of meatball sub sandwiches remaining after Mark ate some is \(7 - 4 = 3\).

Then, Sidney ordered another three meatball sub sandwiches. So, the total number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney had after the new order is \(3 + 3 = 6\).

Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. Therefore, the total number of meatballs in the remaining 6 meatball sub sandwiches is \(6 \times 4 = 24\).

"Initially, Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks, each carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. Therefore, the total amount of fertiliser dispatched was:

\[ 20 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 400 \text{ tons} \]

A quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures, which means:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks} \]

These 5 trucks could not deliver the fertiliser. Therefore, the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks} \]

The total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:

\[ 15 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 300 \text{ tons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the cost Dennis will incur for purchasing 6 pounds of butter under the given promotion, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total amount of butter needed:**
   Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
   \[
   \text{Total butter needed} = 6 \text{ dozen} \times 1 \text{ pound/dozen} = 6 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Understand the promotion:**
   The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter get one half off."" This means for every 2 pounds of butter purchased, Dennis only pays for 1 pound.

3. **Calculate the number of sets of 2 pounds needed:**
   Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter.
   \[
   \text{Number of sets of 2 pounds} = \frac{6 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds/set}} = 3 \text{ sets}
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost for each set:**
   The cost of butter is $4.00 per pound.
   \[
   \text{Cost for 1 pound in a set} = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Since the second pound in each set is half off, the cost for the second pound is:
   \[
   \text{Cost for 0.5 pounds} = \frac{4 \text{ dollars}}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Therefore, the total cost for one set of 2 pounds is:
   \[
   \text{Total cost for 1 set} = 4 \text{ dollars} + 2 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost for 3 sets:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost for 3 sets} = 3 \text{ sets} \times 6 \text{ dollars/set} = 18 \text{ dollars}

"First, let's calculate the total number of guests Kayla invited:

- Kayla's classmates: 25
- Girls in her dance class: 7
- Family members: 13
- Total guests invited: 25 + 7 + 13 = 45

Next, we need to account for the 4 people who could not come:

- Total guests who will attend: 45 - 4 = 41

Now, we need to calculate the cost based on the given pricing structure:

- The base fee for renting the theater for 20 guests is $125.
- The additional fee is $6 for each guest beyond the initial 20.

The number of additional guests beyond the initial 20 is:

- Additional guests: 41 - 20 = 21

The cost for the additional guests is:

- Additional cost: 21 * $6 = $126

Finally, we add the base fee to the additional cost to get the total cost:

- Total cost: $125 + $126 = $251

The final numerical answer is $251."
"Let's denote the amount of money Maggie had as \( M \) and the amount of money Riza had as \( R \). According to the problem, both Maggie and Riza had $60 initially.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, so she spent \( \frac{1}{4}M \). The amount of money she has left is:
\[ M - \frac{1}{4}M = \frac{3}{4}M \]

Riza spent one-third of her money, so she spent \( \frac{1}{3}R \). The amount of money she has left is:
\[ R - \frac{1}{3}R = \frac{2}{3}R \]

Since both Maggie and Riza initially had $60, we can substitute \( M = 60 \) and \( R = 60 \) into the expressions for the money they have left:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 60 = 45 \]
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \]

The total amount of money they have left together is:
\[ 45 + 40 = 85 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats:
\[ 10 + 4 = 14 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Together, the first and second monkeys eat:
\[ 10 + 14 = 24 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. Therefore, the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day is:
\[ \frac{315}{7} = 45 \text{ bananas each day} \]

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we subtract the number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day:
\[ 45 - 24 = 21 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Thus, the third monkey eats:
\[ \boxed{21} \text{ bananas each day} \]"
"Teddy finished half of the first 500-piece puzzle, which means Teddy placed 500 / 2 = 250 pieces of the first puzzle.

Therefore, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is 250 + 500 = 750 pieces."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the roses Jenny bought. She bought 15 roses, and since roses cost $2 each, the cost for the roses is:
\[ 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of the dozen roses. Since a dozen roses cost $15, and she bought 15 roses, she bought 1.25 dozen roses (since 15 roses is 1.25 dozen). However, since the florist only sells roses by the dozen, she would need to buy 2 dozen roses to get 15 roses. The cost for 2 dozen roses is:
\[ 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which totals:
\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the total cost of the roses is $30, she needs an additional $5 to pay for the roses. She has $25, so she needs to pay $5 more. Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to determine how many quarters make up $5. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the number of quarters she will receive in change is:
\[ \frac{5}{0.25} = 20 \text{ quarters} \]

Therefore, the number of quarters Jenny leaves with is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"

"To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the arrival and departure times of each train and then find out when Paul's train arrives.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays in the station for 20 minutes.
   - Departure time: 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives half an hour after the first train leaves (30 minutes).
   - Stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed (20 / 4 = 5 minutes).
   - Departure time: 30 + 5 = 35 minutes.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives an hour after the second train leaves (35 minutes).
   - Leaves the station immediately after it arrives.
   - Departure time: 35 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves (35 minutes).
   - Departure time: 35 + 20 = 55 minutes.

Paul's train is the fourth train, which arrives at 55 minutes. Since Paul arrives at the station at 10 minutes, he will wait for his train for:

\[ 55 - 10 = 45 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time Paul will wait for his train is 45 minutes."
"To determine how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we first need to calculate how many toothpicks she has already saved.

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks:
\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie needs a total of 200 toothpicks. She has already saved 120 toothpicks, so the number of toothpicks she still needs is:
\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks, we divide the number of toothpicks she still needs by the number of toothpicks she saves per week:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks."
"First, let's determine the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch. The original price of the watch is $2000, and he bought it at 75% of its original price.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers paid} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage discount Mr. Rogers's friend obtained from the original price. The original price was $2000, and the friend paid $1800 for the watch.

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

To find the percentage discount:

\[ \text{Percentage discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers's friend from the original price is 10%."

   - Since every second, a new jellyfish is created, the rate of jellyfish creation per spring is 1 jellyfish per second.

2. **Convert the time period into seconds:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are \(60 \times 60 = 3600\) seconds in an hour.
   - Therefore, in 4 hours, there are \(4 \times 3600 = 14400\) seconds.

3. **Calculate the total number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - Since one spring creates 1 jellyfish per second, in 14400 seconds, one spring will create \(14400\) jellyfish.

4. **Calculate the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates 14400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create \(5 \times 14400 = 72000\) jellyfish in 4 hours.

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs working at the same rate in 4 hours is 72000."

"First, let's determine the total distance James walked. He walked halfway to the store, which is 2 miles, and then walked back home, which is another 2 miles. Therefore, the total distance he walked is:

\[ 2 \text{ miles} + 2 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour. To find out how long it took him to walk 4 miles, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, the total time it took James to reach the store is 1 hour."
"First, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually.

Jenny buys 10 bunches, and each bunch has 4 bananas. Therefore, the total number of bananas is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

The cost of buying 40 bananas individually at $0.80 each is:
\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches.

Jenny buys 10 bunches at $3.00 each, so the total cost is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

Now, we find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually:
\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

The amount of money Jenny saved is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) and the amount Harry gets as \( H \). According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so we can write:

\[ H = S + 60 \]

Since the total amount of fence is 100 feet, we also have:

\[ S + H = 100 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Subtract 60 from both sides:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"To determine how many inches a crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to find the growth rate per year. The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, so the growth rate per year is:

\[
\text{Growth rate per year} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year}
\]

Now, to find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we multiply the growth rate per year by 13:

\[
\text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
26

"To determine how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply by their respective prices.

First, let's find out how many of each type of bike were sold:
- Total bikes sold = 300
- Trekking bikes sold = 50% of 300 = 0.5 * 300 = 150
- BMX bikes sold = 15% of 300 = 0.15 * 300 = 45
- MTB bikes sold = Total bikes sold - Trekking bikes sold - BMX bikes sold = 300 - 150 - 45 = 65

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike:
- Price of an MTB = $500
- Price of a BMX bike = Half the price of an MTB = $500 / 2 = $250
- Price of a Trekking bike = $450

Now, we calculate the total earnings:
- Earnings from MTB bikes = 65 * $500 = $32,500
- Earnings from BMX bikes = 45 * $250 = $11,250
- Earnings from Trekking bikes = 150 * $450 = $67,500

Finally, we sum up the earnings from all types of bikes:
- Total earnings = $32,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $111,250

The final numerical answer is $111,250."
"To determine how many bales of hay are left in the field after a 6-hour workday, we need to calculate the number of bales made and the number of bales picked up by the truck.

First, let's calculate the number of bales made by the farmer in 6 hours:
\[ \text{Bales made by farmer} = 5 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ bales} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of bales picked up by the truck in 6 hours:
\[ \text{Bales picked up by truck} = 3 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 18 \text{ bales} \]

Now, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer to find out how many bales are left in the field:
\[ \text{Bales left in the field} = 30 \text{ bales} - 18 \text{ bales} = 12 \text{ bales} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of hours John spends learning each week, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of periods John has each day:**
   - A normal student has 6 periods.
   - John has 2 extra classes, so he has \(6 + 2 = 8\) periods each day.

2. **Calculate the total number of minutes John spends in class each day:**
   - Each class is 40 minutes long.
   - John has 8 periods each day, so he spends \(8 \times 40 = 320\) minutes in class each day.

3. **Calculate the total number of minutes John spends in class each week:**
   - John goes to class 5 days a week, so he spends \(320 \times 5 = 1600\) minutes in class each week.

4. **Calculate the extra learning time John spends on Saturday and Sunday:**
   - John spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday.
   - The total weekly minutes are 1600, so the extra learning time is \(\frac{1600}{16} = 100\) minutes.

5. **Calculate the total number of minutes John spends learning each week:**
   - The total minutes spent learning each week is the sum of the minutes spent in class and the extra learning time.
   - This is \(1600 + 100 = 1700\) minutes.

6. **Convert the total minutes spent learning into hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so the total hours spent learning each week is \(\frac{1700}{60} = \frac{1700 \div 20}{60 \div 20} = \frac{85}{3} \approx 28.33\) hours.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine the initial height from which the ball is dropped. Since the ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony and each story is 24 feet high, the height from the third-floor balcony is:

\[ 3 \text{ stories} \times 24 \text{ feet/story} = 72 \text{ feet} \]

The ball bounces to 2/3 of its starting height with each bounce. Therefore, on the first bounce, the ball will reach:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 72 \text{ feet} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

On the second bounce, the ball will again bounce to 2/3 of its height from the first bounce:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 48 \text{ feet} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height the ball reaches on its second bounce is:

\[ 32 \text{ feet} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 32 \]"
"First, let's convert all heights to inches for easier calculation. The first child is 6 feet tall, which is 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall. The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

The final numerical answer is:
72 inches"
"To determine the earnings from selling 2000 apples at a rate of $5 per bag, we first need to find out how many bags were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can calculate the number of bags sold as follows:

\[ \text{Number of bags sold} = \frac{\text{Total number of apples sold}}{\text{Number of apples per bag}} = \frac{2000}{10} = 200 \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags sold by the price per bag:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of bags sold} \times \text{Price per bag} = 200 \times 5 = 1000 \]

Therefore, the orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the meat, so it left \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
3. The Allosaurus then ate the remaining meat, which is \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms. According to the problem, this amount is 270 kilograms.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]

To find \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

Therefore, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 kilograms.

"First, let's calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted.

The north and south walls are each 10 feet by 8 feet, so the area of each is:
\[ 10 \times 8 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is:
\[ 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The east and west walls are each 5 feet by 8 feet, so the area of each is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is:
\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Adding the areas of all four walls together gives the total area to be painted:
\[ 160 + 80 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, since each gallon of paint costs $12, the total cost to paint the room is:
\[ 12 \times 12 = 144 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the probabilities accordingly.

Initially, Ellen has:
- 3 shaken sodas
- 9 unshaken sodas

Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving:
- 3 shaken sodas
- 8 unshaken sodas

Ellen's brother then takes 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas, leaving:
- 2 shaken sodas
- 6 unshaken sodas

Now, Ellen's friend comes along. The friend can choose from the remaining 8 sodas (2 shaken and 6 unshaken). The probability that the friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left.

The probability is:
\[ \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \]

To express this as a percentage:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 25%."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours and then sum these distances since the trains are traveling in opposite directions.

The first train travels at 60 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will travel:
\[ 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \]

The second train travels at half the speed of the first train, which is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]
In 3 hours, it will travel:
\[ 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles} \]

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each train has traveled:

"First, let's calculate the initial charge and the return:

Initial charge: $85.00
Returned item: $15.00

After the return, the charge on the card is:
$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of the items she bought after the discounts:

Frying pan on sale for 20% off $20.00:
Original price of frying pan = $20.00
Discount = 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
Discounted price of frying pan = $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Set of towels on sale for 10% off $30.00:
Original price of towels = $30.00
Discount = 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
Discounted price of towels = $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, let's add the discounted prices of the frying pan and the set of towels to the remaining balance on the card:

Remaining balance on card = $70.00
Frying pan = $16.00
Set of towels = $27.00

"To find the total number of students in the school, we start by noting that 40% of the school population consists of 240 boys. Let's denote the total number of students in the school as \( T \).

Given that 40% of \( T \) is equal to 240 boys, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.40 \times T = 240 \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} \]

Now, let's perform the division:
\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} = 600 \]

So, the total number of students in the school is 600.

Next, we need to find the number of girls in the school. Since 40% of the students are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. We can calculate the number of girls by finding 60% of the total number of students:

\[ 12 \text{ kg} - 7 \text{ kg} = 5 \text{ kg} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"The temperature dropped by 8 degrees Celsius, so it became:
\[ 2 - 8 = -6 \text{ degrees Celsius} \]

Then, it increased by 3 degrees Celsius in the morning, so the temperature became:
\[ -6 + 3 = -3 \text{ degrees Celsius} \]

The temperature in the morning was \(-3\) degrees Celsius."
"Raymond initially had $21. He saved an additional $11, so his total became $21 + $11 = $32. Then he spent $5 on a comic book and $19 on a puzzle, which totals $5 + $19 = $24. Subtracting the total spent from his total after saving, we get $32 - $24 = $8. Therefore, Raymond has $8 left."
"First, let's determine how much money Anna has spent in total. She started with a budget of $16 and has $2 left after her purchases. Therefore, the total amount spent is:

\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \]

Anna has already spent $4 on other items, so the amount spent on the books is:

\[ 14 - 4 = 10 \]

Anna bought 2 books, and each book cost the same amount. Therefore, the cost of each book is:

\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

So, the cost of each book is $5. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 5 \]"
"To find the number of students enrolled this year after a 20% increase, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate 20% of the number of students enrolled last year.
2. Add this increase to the number of students enrolled last year.

First, calculate 20% of 50 students:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 0.2 \times 50 = 10 \]

Next, add this increase to the number of students enrolled last year:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \]

So, the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class is 60."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the rate at which the lighthouse's light blinks. We know that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. Therefore, the rate of blinking is:

\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times. We can use the rate we just calculated to find the time required:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} \]

Now, let's perform the division:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459}{51} = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times."
"First, let's calculate the total number of male and female guppies and goldfishes Tate has after the purchase.

**Initial numbers:**
- Male guppies: 4
- Female guppies: 7
- Male goldfishes: 3
- Female goldfishes: 5

**Numbers bought:**
- Additional male guppies: 2
- Additional female guppy: 1
- Additional male goldfishes: 2
- Additional female goldfishes: 3

**Total after purchase:**
- Male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
- Female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
- Male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5
- Female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, let's calculate the total number of male and female fishes:
- Total male fishes: 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfishes) = 11
- Total female fishes: 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfishes) = 16

Finally, to find out how many more female fishes than male fishes Tate has:

"First, let's determine the time each person took to complete their chores:

1. Amalia mowed the lawn, which took her 4 hours.
2. Megan walked the dog, which took her 2 hours longer than Amalia. Therefore, Megan's chore took her \(4 + 2 = 6\) hours.
3. Dior did the laundry, which took her well over 4 hours longer than Amalia. Since Amalia's chore took 4 hours, Dior's chore took her more than \(4 + 4 = 8\) hours. For the sake of calculation, let's assume Dior took 12 hours (a reasonable assumption that is more than 8 hours).

Now, we can calculate the total time they all took to do their chores altogether:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Amalia's time} + \text{Megan's time} + \text{Dior's time} = 4 + 6 + 12 = 22 \text{ hours}
\]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many miles John drives each month when visiting his parents, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the one-way driving time:**
   John drives for 2 hours one way.

2. **Calculate the one-way driving speed:**
   John drives at a speed of 70 mph.

3. **Calculate the one-way distance:**
   Distance = Speed × Time
   \[
   \text{One-way distance} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}
   \]

4. **Calculate the round trip distance:**
   Since the round trip involves driving to his parents and back, the total distance is:
   \[
   \text{Round trip distance} = 140 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 280 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Therefore, John drives 280 miles a month when visiting his parents."
"If Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day for 7 days, she will walk a total of \(10 \times 7 = 70\) miles in 7 days.

According to the question, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Therefore, Brian will walk half the distance that Sofie walks in 7 days. So, Brian will walk \(70 \div 2 = 35\) miles in 7 days.

The final numerical answer is 35."
"To determine how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers and then find out how many toys the fifth worker needs to produce to meet the order requirements.

First, let's calculate the production rate of the first two workers:
- Each of the first two workers produces 6 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(6 + 6 = 12\) toys per hour.

Next, let's calculate the production rate of the next two workers:
- Each of the next two workers produces 4 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(4 + 4 = 8\) toys per hour.

Now, let's find the total production rate of the first four workers:
- The first two workers together produce 12 toys per hour.
- The next two workers together produce 8 toys per hour.
- Therefore, the total production rate of the first four workers is \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

Since they work for a 10-hour shift, the total number of toys produced by the first four workers in 10 hours is:
\[ 20 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 200 \text{ toys} \]

The toy manufacturer received an order for 400 toys, and by the end of their shift, they still need 20 toys to ship the order. Therefore, the number of toys produced by the first four workers is:
\[ 400 - 20 = 380 \text{ toys} \]

However, the first four workers only produced 200 toys in 10 hours. This indicates that the fifth worker must have produced the remaining toys to meet the order requirements. The number of toys the fifth worker needs to produce is:
\[ 380 - 200 = 180 \text{ toys} \]

Since the fifth worker works for a 10-hour shift, the number of toys the fifth worker produces per hour is:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys/hour} \]

Thus, the fifth worker produces \(\boxed{18}\) toys per hour."
"First, let's determine the weight of Elijah's dogs based on the information given.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah's dog that is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog would weigh:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's dog that is half the weight of Kory's dog would weigh:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add the weights of Elijah's dogs to find the total weight of Elijah's dogs:
\[ 15 + 30 = 45 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs to find the combined weight of both sets of dogs:
\[ 45 + 60 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Elijah and Kory’s dogs altogether is:

1. Kris gave 7 stickers to Rob, and he kept 9 stickers. Therefore, before giving any to Rob, Kris had 7 + 9 = 16 stickers.
2. Luis gave half of his stickers to Kris. Since Kris had 16 stickers, Luis had 16 * 2 = 32 stickers before giving any to Kris.
3. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. Since Luis had 32 stickers, Seth had 32 * 2 = 64 stickers in the beginning.

The final numerical answer is 64."
"First, we need to determine the total weight of the M&Ms John has. He buys 3 large bags, each weighing 10 ounces. Therefore, the total weight is:

\[ 3 \text{ bags} \times 10 \text{ ounces per bag} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many M&Ms are in the 30 ounces. Since 1 ounce contains 30 M&Ms, the total number of M&Ms is:

\[ 30 \text{ ounces} \times 30 \text{ M&Ms per ounce} = 900 \text{ M&Ms} \]

John wants to put 10 M&Ms in each small bag. To find out how many small bags he can make, we divide the total number of M&Ms by the number of M&Ms per small bag:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ M&Ms}}{10 \text{ M&Ms per small bag}} = 90 \text{ small bags} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

2. Use the speed of the 2nd fastest car to find the speed of the faster car.

First, we know the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. Therefore, the speed of the 2nd fastest car is:
\[ 120 \times 5 = 600 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. Therefore, the speed of the faster car is:
\[ 600 \times 1.25 = 750 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 750 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's first determine Liam's age two years ago. Since Liam is currently 16 years old, two years ago he was:

\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \text{ years old} \]

According to the problem, two years ago Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. Let's denote Vince's age two years ago as \( V \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 14 = 2V \]

To find \( V \), we solve for \( V \):

\[ V = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]

So, two years ago Vince was 7 years old. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:

\[ 7 + 2 = 9 \]

Therefore, Vince is currently 9 years old. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 9 \]"
"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline as \( A \). Since they painted the same number of eggs, we have \( A = A \).

Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Sarah as \( S \). Then, the number of eggs painted by Camden is \( S + 12 \) because Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah.

We know that the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ A + A + S + (S + 12) = 56 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2A + 2S + 12 = 56 \]
Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get:
\[ 2A + 2S = 44 \]
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
\[ A + S = 22 \]

We also know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, so:
\[ S + (S + 12) = 30 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get:
\[ 2S = 18 \]
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, substituting \( S = 9 \) back into the equation \( A + S = 22 \), we get:
\[ A + 9 = 22 \]
Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get:
\[ A = 13 \]

So, Arnold painted 13 eggs, Madeline painted 13 eggs, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

To find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold, we calculate:
\[ 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups} \]

Each group of 8 crayons will be placed in a box, and each box weighs 8 ounces. Therefore, the total weight of the boxes is:

\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so the total weight of the crayons is:

\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together gives:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

To convert the total weight from ounces to pounds, we use the conversion factor that 16 ounces equals 1 pound:

\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 25 \text{ pounds} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many 4-foot logs John can make from the 80-foot tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, the length of the logs he can make is:

\[ 80 \text{ feet} \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 4-foot logs he can cut from 64 feet of wood:

\[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

Now, we need to determine how many planks John can get from these 16 logs. Since he cuts 5 planks from each log:

\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

Finally, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling these planks. Since each plank is sold for $1.2:

\[ 80 \text{ planks} \times 1.2 \text{ dollars/plank} = 96 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 96 \]"
"First, let's determine how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns half of what her brother earns, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Valerie's salary} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

Given that Valerie earns $5000 per month, we can solve for her brother's salary:

\[ 5000 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

\[ \text{Brother's salary} = 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Now, we know Valerie's brother earns $10000 per month. Next, we need to find out how much their mother earns. Their mother earns twice their combined salary. First, we calculate their combined salary:

\[ \text{Combined salary} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} \]

\[ \text{Combined salary} = 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Their mother earns twice this amount:

\[ \text{Mother's salary} = 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \]

Now, we can find the total amount of money they all have together by adding their salaries:

\[ \text{Total amount} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} + \text{Mother's salary} \]

\[ \text{Total amount} = 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

So, the total amount of money they all have together is $45000."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time spent by Grandma on the beach and on the sidewalk, and then calculate the total time for the entire 3-mile walk.

First, let's denote the speed of Grandma on the beach as \( v \) miles per minute. Therefore, the speed on the sidewalk is \( 2v \) miles per minute.

Given that Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes, we can calculate her speed on the beach:
\[ v = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Next, we calculate the time spent on the sidewalk. Since the distance on the sidewalk is 1 mile and her speed on the sidewalk is \( 2v \):
\[ 2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute} \]
\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we know the time spent on the beach is 40 minutes and the time spent on the sidewalk is 10 minutes. The total time for the entire 3-mile walk is:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Jane has already saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount she has saved so far is:
\[ 4 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 8 \, \text{weeks} = 32 \, \text{dollars} \]

To reach a total of $60, she needs to save an additional:
\[ 60 \, \text{dollars} - 32 \, \text{dollars} = 28 \, \text{dollars} \]

Since she saves $4 each week, the number of additional weeks required to save the remaining $28 is:
\[ \frac{28 \, \text{dollars}}{4 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 7 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take her 7 more weeks to have saved a total of $60."
"To find the total number of blue birds, we can break down the problem into parts and then sum them up.

First, we have 3 trees with 7 blue birds each:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Next, we have 2 trees with 4 blue birds each:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

Finally, we have 1 tree with 3 blue birds:
\[ 1 \times 3 = 3 \]

Now, we sum these amounts to find the total number of blue birds:
\[ 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 \]

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"First, let's determine how many marbles Bob currently has. If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen is equal to 24 marbles, we can set up the following equation to find out how many marbles Bob currently has:

\[ \text{Current marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

Subtracting 24 from both sides of the equation gives:

\[ \text{Current marbles} = 60 - 24 \]
\[ \text{Current marbles} = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles. If he loses 10 of the marbles he has, the number of marbles he will have is:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the second mug of water such that after Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle, the resulting mixture can be drunk.

Let's denote the temperature of the second mug of water as \( T \) degrees.

When Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle, the resulting mixture can be drunk if the temperature of the mixture is at least 40 degrees.

The temperature of the mixture can be calculated using the weighted average of the temperatures of the water poured into the bottle. The formula for the weighted average temperature is:

\[
\text{Average Temperature} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{4 + 1}
\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[
\text{Average Temperature} = \frac{132 + T}{5}
\]

We need this average temperature to be at least 40 degrees:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

To find the minimum temperature \( T \), we solve the inequality:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Subtract 132 from both sides:

\[
T \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the second mug of water must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the mixture.

The final numerical answer is:

\[
68

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of animals added to the farm over the course of three weeks and then add this to the initial number of animals.

First, let's determine the number of days in three weeks:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cows added by Milkie Cows Limited over these 21 days:
\[ 20 \text{ cows/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 420 \text{ cows} \]

Then, we calculate the number of chickens added by Broilers Limited over these 21 days:
\[ 10 \text{ chickens/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ chickens} \]

Now, we add the initial number of animals to the number of animals added:
\[ \text{Initial number of cows} + \text{Cows added} = 50 \text{ cows} + 420 \text{ cows} = 470 \text{ cows} \]
\[ \text{Initial number of chickens} + \text{Chickens added} = 20 \text{ chickens} + 210 \text{ chickens} = 230 \text{ chickens} \]

Finally, we add the total number of cows and chickens to get the total number of animals on the farm:
\[ 470 \text{ cows} + 230 \text{ chickens} = 700 \text{ animals} \]

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is:
\[ \boxed{700} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount:

Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs cost:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Since he orders 4 packs, he gets a 10% discount on the total cost. The discount amount is:
\[ 40 \times 0.10 = 4 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels he gets in total. Since each pack contains 9 bagels and he orders 4 packs, the total number of bagels is:
\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \]

To find the cost per bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels:
\[ \frac{36}{36} = 1 \]

So, the cost per bagel is $1.00. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1 \]"
"First, let's determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. According to the question, Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, we calculate:

\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 1 less than 3 is 2 scoops, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. The question states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, 1 less than 3 scoops is 2 scoops, and 3 less than 6 potatoes is 3 potatoes. Therefore, 2 scoops of mashed potatoes require 3 potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes are required for 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 2 scoops require 3 potatoes, 18 scoops would require:

\[ \frac{18}{2} \times 3 = 9 \times 3 = 27 \]

So, Gomer ate 27 potatoes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 27 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days:
- Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days.
- Total eggs in the first 30 days = 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs.

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the next 30 days:
- Chester eats 5 eggs a day for 30 days.
- Total eggs in the next 30 days = 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.

Now, let's find the total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days:
- Total eggs in 60 days = 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.

To find out how many dozens of eggs Chester needs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs):
- Total dozens of eggs = 240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens.

The final numerical answer is 20 dozens."
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we first need to determine the number of red jellybeans and then subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans.

Given:
- Total number of jellybeans = 60
- Number of green jellybeans = 17
- Number of red jellybeans = 2 * number of green jellybeans

Let's calculate the number of red jellybeans:
\[ \text{Number of red jellybeans} = 2 \times 17 = 34 \]

Now, we can find the number of blue jellybeans by subtracting the number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans:
\[ \text{Number of blue jellybeans} = \text{Total number of jellybeans} - (\text{Number of green jellybeans} + \text{Number of red jellybeans}) \]
\[ \text{Number of blue jellybeans} = 60 - (17 + 34) \]
\[ \text{Number of blue jellybeans} = 60 - 51 \]
\[ \text{Number of blue jellybeans} = 9 \]

So, the number of blue jellybeans is 9."

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus initially.

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can represent the number of men as \(5x\) and the number of women as \(9x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of passengers is given as 84. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[5x + 9x = 84\]
\[14x = 84\]
\[x = 6\]

Now, we can find the number of men and women:
- Number of men = \(5x = 5 \times 6 = 30\)
- Number of women = \(9x = 9 \times 6 = 54\)

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:
\[54 - 20 = 34\]

So, the number of women remaining on the bus is 34."
"To determine how many sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to first calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day and then multiply by 3.

From the information given:
- Each bouquet of sunflowers costs $8 and contains 12 sunflowers.
- Faraday earned $56 from selling bouquets per day.

First, we calculate the number of bouquets sold per day:
\[ \text{Number of bouquets sold per day} = \frac{\text{Earnings from bouquets per day}}{\text{Cost of one bouquet}} = \frac{56}{8} = 7 \text{ bouquets per day} \]

Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold per day is:
\[ \text{Number of sunflowers sold per day} = \text{Number of bouquets sold per day} \times 12 = 7 \times 12 = 84 \text{ sunflowers per day} \]

Now, to find the total number of sunflowers sold over 3 days:
\[ \text{Total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days} = \text{Number of sunflowers sold per day} \times 3 = 84 \times 3 = 252 \]

So, the total number of sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 3 days is:
\[ 252 \]"
"First, let's determine how many rocks Adam can buy with his $100. Each rock costs $5.

\[ \text{Number of rocks} = \frac{\$100}{\$5/\text{rock}} = 20 \text{ rocks} \]

Adam then sells 60% of his inventory. So, the number of rocks he sells is:

\[ \text{Number of rocks sold} = 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ rocks} \]

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling these rocks. Each rock is sold for $7.

\[ \text{Revenue} = 12 \text{ rocks} \times \$7/\text{rock} = \$84 \]

Adam initially invested $100. The loss is the difference between the initial investment and the revenue from selling the rocks.

\[ \text{Loss} = \$100 - \$84 = \$16 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$16 \]"

1. **Large-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 5 large-sized scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 45 large-sized scenes.
   - The number of days required for large-sized scenes is \( \frac{45}{5} = 9 \) days.

2. **Medium-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 36 medium-sized scenes.
   - The number of days required for medium-sized scenes is \( \frac{36}{6} = 6 \) days.

3. **Small-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 7 small-sized scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 49 small-sized scenes.
   - The number of days required for small-sized scenes is \( \frac{49}{7} = 7 \) days.

Now, we sum the days required for each type of scene:
\[ 9 \text{ days} + 6 \text{ days} + 7 \text{ days} = 22 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, the total number of days it will take for Lauren to create all of the picture scenes is:
\[ 22 \text{ days} \]"

"To find the average speed, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

First, we calculate the total distance traveled:

\[ \text{Total Distance} = 110 \text{ miles} + 140 \text{ miles} = 250 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the total time taken:

\[ \text{Total Time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can find the average speed:

\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{250 \text{ miles}}{5 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the average speed Sid was traveling is:

\[ 50 \text{ miles per hour} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that both tickets are winners.

First, let's denote the probability of winning with the first ticket as \( P_1 \). According to the problem, \( P_1 = 20\% = 0.20 \).

The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning with the second ticket, \( P_2 \), is:
\[ P_2 = 3 \times P_1 = 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60 \]

Since the events are independent, the probability that both tickets are winners is the product of their individual probabilities:
\[ P(\text{both tickets are winners}) = P_1 \times P_2 = 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

Thus, the probability that both tickets are winners is:
\[ \boxed{12\%} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine how many seashells Carlos collected:**
   - Jim collected 27 seashells.
   - Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos.
   - Therefore, Carlos collected \( 27 - 5 = 22 \) seashells.

2. **Determine how many seashells Carrey collected:**
   - Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey.
   - Therefore, Carrey collected \( \frac{22}{2} = 11 \) seashells.

3. **Calculate the total number of seashells collected:**
   - Carlos collected 22 seashells.
   - Jim collected 27 seashells.
   - Carrey collected 11 seashells.
   - Total seashells = \( 22 + 27 + 11 = 60 \) seashells.

4. **Divide the total seashells equally among the three people:**
   - Total seashells = 60.
   - Number of people = 3.
   - Each person gets \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) seashells.

Therefore, each person gets 20 seashells.

"To calculate the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to consider the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the number he eats on weekends.

Mason eats 4 carrots each weekday. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is:
\[ 4 \text{ carrots/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ carrots} \]

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is:
\[ 5 \text{ carrots/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ carrots} \]

Adding the carrots eaten on weekdays and the weekend gives us the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week:
\[ 20 \text{ carrots} + 10 \text{ carrots} = 30 \text{ carrots} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To find the total time of the cassette, we first need to calculate the duration of the second song. The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. 

To find the additional time for the second song, we calculate 60% of 5 minutes:
\[ 0.60 \times 5 = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the second song is:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the durations of both songs to find the total time of the cassette:
\[ 5 + 8 = 13 \text{ minutes} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the selling price of one mobile device. Linus buys each mobile device for $20 and sells it for twice the amount of the original price. Therefore, the selling price is:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the profit from selling one mobile device. The profit is the selling price minus the buying price:

\[ \text{Profit per device} = 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many mobile devices Linus bought in total. He bought 2 devices last Monday and 4 devices last Tuesday, so the total number of devices is:

\[ \text{Total devices} = 2 + 4 = 6 \text{ devices} \]

Finally, we calculate the total profit by multiplying the profit per device by the total number of devices:

\[ \text{Total Profit} = 6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 120 \]"
"First, let's determine the height of Isabel's brother, Ned. Since Isabel is 7 feet tall and Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, we can calculate Ned's height as follows:

\[ \text{Ned's height} = \text{Isabel's height} - 2 = 7 - 2 = 5 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know that Carl is one foot taller than Ned. Therefore, we can calculate Carl's height as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's height} = \text{Ned's height} + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ feet} \]

Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. Therefore, we can calculate the length of Carl's cane as follows:

\[ \text{Length of Carl's cane} = \frac{\text{Carl's height}}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ feet} \]

"To determine how many more bottles of juices Hortex would have to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bottles needed to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.
2. Subtract the current daily production from the total number of bottles needed.

First, let's calculate the total number of bottles needed:
- Each person's daily energy demand is covered by 20% of a bottle.
- Therefore, to cover 100% of a person's daily energy demand, we need 5 bottles (since 100% / 20% = 5).

For 2300 people:
\[ 2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we subtract the current daily production from the total number of bottles needed:
- Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day.

\[ 11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles/day} = 7300 \text{ bottles} \]

So, Hortex would have to produce 7300 more bottles of juices to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of babies dressed in purple and blue, and then calculate the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple.

First, let's find out how many babies are dressed in purple and how many are dressed in blue:
- Total babies = 8
- Babies dressed in purple = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- Babies dressed in blue = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we calculate how many babies wear bows:
- Babies wearing bows among the blue-wearers = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 2 = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.6667 \) (rounding to the nearest whole number, 1 baby)
- Babies wearing bows among the purple-wearers = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is \( 1 + 2 = 3 \).

Now, we need to find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. This can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of purple-wearers wearing bows}}{\text{Total number of babies wearing bows}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) \times 100 \approx 66.67\% \]

Therefore, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is approximately \( 66.67\% \)."
"To find out how many reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and the number of reports received on Thursday and Friday, from the total number of reports received last week.

Total reports received last week = 5168
Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

Reports received on Wednesday = Total reports - (Reports on Monday and Tuesday + Reports on Thursday and Friday)

Let's calculate it:

Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - (1907 + 2136)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043
Reports received on Wednesday = 1125

So, the number of reports received on Wednesday is 1125."
"First, let's determine the total area of land Abraham sold and the corresponding prices.

1. Abraham initially owned 80 square meters of land.
2. He sold half of his land, which is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) square meters, for $50.
3. After a month, he sold another \( \frac{1}{4} \) of his land, which is \( \frac{80}{4} = 20 \) square meters, for $30.
4. The remaining land is \( 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 \) square meters, which he sold for $3 per square meter.

Now, let's calculate the total money earned from each sale:

1. From the first sale: \( 40 \text{ square meters} \times \$50/\text{square meter} = \$2000 \).
2. From the second sale: \( 20 \text{ square meters} \times \$30/\text{square meter} = \$600 \).
3. From the third sale: \( 20 \text{ square meters} \times \$3/\text{square meter} = \$60 \).

Finally, we sum up the total money earned from all sales:

\[ \$2000 + \$600 + \$60 = \$2660 \]

So, the total money Abraham will be able to earn after selling all his unused land is $2660."

"First, let's determine the total number of eggs Cole hid in the yard. Since a dozen is equal to 12, 3 dozen eggs would be:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we'll calculate how many eggs each person found:

- Lamar found 5 eggs.
- Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy found:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ eggs} \]

- Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie found:

\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ eggs} \]

- Mei found half as many as Charlie, so Mei found:

\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we'll sum the number of eggs found by Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei:

\[ 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 \text{ eggs} \]

Finally, to find out how many eggs are still hidden in the yard, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden:

\[ 9 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of apartments in the third apartment complex. The first two complexes each have 200 apartments, so together they have:

\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments} \]

The third complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined. To find the number of apartments in the third complex, we calculate 60% of 400 and add it to 400:

\[ 400 \times 0.60 = 240 \]
\[ 400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from in a week. He collects garbage from each of the three complexes 3 times a week:

\[ 3 \times (200 + 200 + 640) = 3 \times 1040 = 3120 \text{ collections} \]

John gets paid $0.40 per collection. Therefore, his weekly earnings are:

"Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters, the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters, and the red rope as \( R \) centimeters.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we substitute \( B \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ R = 4(Y - 7) \]

Next, we substitute \( B \) and \( R \) into the third equation:
\[ 4(Y - 7) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]

Add 35 to both sides:
\[ 6Y = 72 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now, we find \( B \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \]

And we find \( R \):
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is \( 20 \) centimeters.

"Let's denote the amount of money given to Rissa as \( R_r \) and the amount given to Ronnie as \( R_n \). According to the problem, Ronnie was given $5, so \( R_n = 5 \). Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so \( R_r = 3 \times R_n = 3 \times 5 = 15 \).

Let's denote the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister as \( x \). After giving \( x \) dollars to their sister, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her money. Therefore, we can write the equation for Rissa's remaining money as:
\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]
\[ 15 - x = 12 \]
\[ x = 15 - 12 \]
\[ x = 3 \]

Now, we know that Ronnie gave \( x = 3 \) dollars to their little sister. Therefore, the amount of money left in Ronnie's money is:
\[ R_n - x = 5 - 3 = 2 \]

The final numerical answer is:

- \( Y = \frac{1}{2} \) of the mural
- The total amount of paint used is 12 pints.

Since \( R = W = P \), we can say \( R = W = P = x \).

The yellow paint, which is half the mural, is \( Y = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \) pints.

The total amount of paint used is the sum of all the individual amounts:
\[ R + W + P + Y = 12 \]
\[ x + x + x + 6 = 12 \]
\[ 3x + 6 = 12 \]
\[ 3x = 6 \]

"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. The area of one bedroom is given by the product of its length and width:

\[ \text{Area of one bedroom} = 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

\[ \text{Total area of bedrooms} = 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so:

\[ \text{Area of the living room} = 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

\[ \text{Total area of the house} = 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

"To determine how many dishwashing cycles can be run for $1 with the new box, we first need to find out how many pods are in the new box.

The original box has 100 pods and costs $12. The new box has 20% more pods than the original box. Therefore, the number of pods in the new box is:
\[ 100 + (0.20 \times 100) = 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The new box also costs $12, so the cost per pod in the new box is:
\[ \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

If you use 1 pod per cycle, the number of cycles you can run for $1 is:
\[ \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \text{ cycles} \]

"First, let's determine the number of 20 dollar bills Thomas initially withdraws from the bank. Since he withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \]

So, Thomas initially has 50 twenty-dollar bills.

Next, he loses 10 bills while getting home. The number of bills remaining is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Thomas then uses half of the remaining 40 bills to pay for a bill. The number of bills used is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, the number of bills left after paying the bill is:

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \]

Thomas then triples his money. Since each bill is worth $20, the total amount of money he has after tripling is:

\[ 20 \times 20 \times 3 = 1200 \]

Finally, Thomas converts all his money to 5 dollar bills. The number of 5 dollar bills he has is:

\[ \frac{1200}{5} = 240 \]

"First, let's break down the information given:

1. In the first half, team A scores 4 goals.
2. In the first half, team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, which means team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.
3. In the second half, team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half.
4. Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which means team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals in the second half.
5. Therefore, team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals in the second half.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by each team in the match:

- Team A scores \(4 + 2 = 6\) goals in the match.
- Team B scores \(2 + 8 = 10\) goals in the match.

The total number of goals scored in the match is the sum of the goals scored by team A and team B:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chalk the teacher has left and then calculate how many days he can continue using only 20% of the chalk each day before he has to recycle it.

1. **Initial Chalk Length**: The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
2. **Chalk Used on Monday**: The teacher used 45% of the chalk by the end of Monday. Therefore, the chalk used on Monday is:
   \[
   5 \times 0.45 = 2.25 \text{ inches}
   \]
   So, the chalk remaining after Monday is:
   \[
   5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \text{ inches}

"First, let's determine how many face masks Mike bought. According to the problem, Mike bought 5 face masks.

Next, we need to calculate how many face masks Johnny bought. The problem states that Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike. We can express this mathematically as:

\[ \text{Number of masks Johnny bought} = 3 \times (\text{Number of masks Mike bought}) + 2 \]

Substituting the number of masks Mike bought (5):

\[ \text{Number of masks Johnny bought} = 3 \times 5 + 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of masks Johnny bought} = 15 + 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of masks Johnny bought} = 17 \]

So, Johnny bought 17 face masks. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of teeth that the dentist fixes. According to the problem, the dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills. Since he drills 4 teeth, he caps \(4 + 7 = 11\) teeth.

Next, we calculate the total number of teeth that the dentist fixes. This is the sum of the teeth drilled and the teeth capped, which is \(4 + 11 = 15\) teeth.

To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we use the formula for percentage:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\%

"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the milk that Mr. Marcellus initially purchased. The company sold 4000 gallons of milk at $3.5 per gallon. Therefore, the total cost is:

\[ 4000 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = \$14000 \]

Next, we need to determine how much of this milk had passed the expiry date. Mr. Marcellus returned 2/5 of the milk. So, the amount of milk that was returned is:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \text{ gallons} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

Since the company sold the milk at $3.5 per gallon, the refund amount for the returned milk is:

\[ 1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = \$5600 \]

Therefore, the refund amount Mr. Marcellus received is:

\[ \$5600 \]

"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, we substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5(C + 7)) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5(C + 7)}{3} \]
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old. To verify, we can substitute \( C = 20 \) back into the equations to find \( W \):
\[ W = 5(C + 7) = 5(20 + 7) = 5 \times 27 = 135 \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]
\[ 20 + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \times 135 \]
\[ 45 = 45 \]

The values satisfy both equations, confirming that Colin is currently 20 years old. The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine how much money Bob spends on books in total. He spends $27,000 in total.

Next, we need to find out how many books he can buy with $27,000. We know that he can buy 100 books for $500. To find out how many books he can buy with $27,000, we can set up the following proportion:

\[ \text{Number of books} = \frac{\text{Total money}}{\text{Money per 100 books}} \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Number of books} = \frac{27000}{500} \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Number of books} = 54 \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Number of books} = 5400 \]

Bob can buy 5400 books in total. Since he has three schools, we need to divide the total number of books by 3 to find out how many books he can buy per school:

\[ \text{Books per school} = \frac{5400}{3} \]

\[ \text{Books per school} = 1800 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 1800."

"To solve this problem, we need to account for the rate at which Jay builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which means he builds 20/60 = 1/3 of a snowball per minute.

Every 15 minutes, 2 snowballs melt. So, in 15 minutes, 1/3 * 15 = 5/3 snowballs are built and 2 are melted, resulting in a net gain of 5/3 - 2 = 1/3 of a snowball.

To find out how many snowballs Jay will have after 15 minutes, we calculate:
- Snowballs built in 15 minutes: 1/3 * 15 = 5
- Snowballs melted in 15 minutes: 2
- Net gain in 15 minutes: 5 - 2 = 3

So, after 15 minutes, Jay will have 3 snowballs. We need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are required to reach 60 snowballs.

Let's calculate the number of 15-minute intervals needed to reach 60 snowballs:
- After 15 minutes, he has 3 snowballs.
- After 30 minutes, he has 3 + 3 = 6 snowballs.
- After 45 minutes, he has 6 + 3 = 9 snowballs.
- After 60 minutes, he has 9 + 3 = 12 snowballs.
- After 75 minutes, he has 12 + 3 = 15 snowballs.
- After 90 minutes, he has 15 + 3 = 18 snowballs.
- After 105 minutes, he has 18 + 3 = 21 snowballs.
- After 120 minutes, he has 21 + 3 = 24 snowballs.
- After 135 minutes, he has 24 + 3 = 27 snowballs.
- After 150 minutes, he has 27 + 3 = 30 snowballs.
- After 165 minutes, he has 30 + 3 = 33 snowballs.
- After 180 minutes, he has 33 + 3 = 36 snowballs.
- After 195 minutes, he has 36 + 3 = 39 snowballs.
- After 210 minutes, he has 39 + 3 = 42 snowballs.
- After 225 minutes, he has 42 + 3 = 45 snowballs.
- After 240 minutes, he has 45 + 3 = 48 snowballs.
- After 255 minutes, he has 48 + 3 = 51 snowballs.
- After 270 minutes, he has 51 + 3 = 54 snowballs.
- After 285 minutes, he has 54 + 3 = 57 snowballs.
- After 300 minutes, he has 57 + 3 = 60 snowballs.

Therefore, it will take Jay 300 minutes to have 60 snowballs.

"Let's break down the problem day by day to find out how many bandages were used and how many were left at the end of each day.

**First Day:**
- They used 38 bandages.
- They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
- Bandages left at the end of the first day: \( 38 - 38 + 50 = 50 \).

**Second Day:**
- They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \( 38 - 10 = 28 \) bandages.
- Bandages left at the end of the second day: \( 50 - 28 = 22 \).

**Third Day:**
- They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \) bandages.
- They used half a pack, which is \( 25 \) bandages.
- Bandages left at the end of the third day: \( 22 - 25 + 100 = 97 \).

According to the problem, they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. However, we calculated 97 bandages left. This discrepancy suggests that the problem might have a different interpretation or a different set of conditions. Given the conditions provided, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is 50.

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to consider her regular pay and the additional attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her regular pay:
- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- She works 6 days a week.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

So, her daily pay is:
\[ 7.5 \text{ hours/day} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = \$11.25/\text{day} \]

Her weekly pay is:
\[ \$11.25/\text{day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = \$67.50/\text{week} \]

Since there are exactly 4 weeks in April, her total pay for April is:
\[ \$67.50/\text{week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = \$270.00 \]

Additionally, since she did not incur any absences for the month of April, she receives the $10 attendance bonus.

Therefore, her total earnings for April are:

"To calculate the total amount of money Jason earned, we need to multiply the number of times he performed each task by the corresponding amount he earns for that task, and then sum these amounts.

- For emptying the dishwasher: Jason emptied the dishwasher 6 times, and he earns $0.50 for each time. So, the earnings from emptying the dishwasher are \(6 \times 0.50 = 3.00\) dollars.
- For doing laundry: Jason did laundry once, and he earns $3.00 for each time. So, the earnings from doing laundry are \(1 \times 3.00 = 3.00\) dollars.
- For taking the trash out: Jason took the trash out twice, and he earns $0.75 for each time. So, the earnings from taking the trash out are \(2 \times 0.75 = 1.50\) dollars.
- For cleaning his room: Jason cleaned his room once, and he earns $1.50 for each time. So, the earnings from cleaning his room are \(1 \times 1.50 = 1.50\) dollars.

Now, we sum these amounts to find the total earnings:
\[3.00 + 3.00 + 1.50 + 1.50 = 9.00\]

"First, let's determine the height of Mattison's house and the height of the first floor.

Mattison's height is 60 inches. The two-story house is 7 times as high as Mattison is:
\[ \text{Height of the house} = 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

The first floor is thrice as high as Mattison is:
\[ \text{Height of the first floor} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Since the house is two stories, the height of the second floor from the ground is:
\[ \text{Height of the second floor} = \text{Height of the house} - \text{Height of the first floor} = 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is the same as the height of the first floor:

Team The finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells:

\[ \text{Shells found by The finders} = 420 \times \frac{60}{100} = 420 \times 0.6 = 252 \]

Now, we can find out how many shells team Gogetters found by subtracting the shells found by Alphas and The finders from the total:

\[ \text{Shells found by Gogetters} = 700 - 280 - 252 = 168 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of miles the last dog needs to walk as \( x \).

The total number of miles the four dogs need to walk per day is the sum of the miles each dog needs:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 + x \]

According to the problem, the average number of miles the dogs need to walk per day is 3 miles. Since there are 4 dogs, the total number of miles they need to walk per day is:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \]

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 + x = 12 \]

Simplifying the left side:
\[ 8 + x = 12 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 12 - 8 \]
\[ x = 4 \]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the loan amount John gets. The loan is worth 40% of the value of his house, which is $250,000.

\[ \text{Loan Amount} = 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

Next, John uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts.

\[ \text{Amount Used to Pay Off Debt} = 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

To find out how much money he has leftover after paying off his debts, we subtract the amount used to pay off the debts from the loan amount.

\[ \text{Money Leftover} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 40,000 \]"

"To determine Trinity's profit, we first need to calculate the selling price of the magazines and then subtract the cost price from it.

Trinity bought the magazines at $72 each. She sells them at 11/8 of the price she bought them. Therefore, the selling price is:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8} \]

Let's calculate the selling price:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8} = 9 \times 11 = 99 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the cost price from the selling price:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price} = 99 - 72 = 27 \]

So, Trinity's profit is:

\[ \text{Profit} = 27 \]

Final numerical answer:

"To find the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed per day for each setting and then multiply by the number of days it was used at that setting.

1. **Low setting:**
   - Removes 1 liter of water per day.
   - Brian used it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed at low setting: \(1 \, \text{liter/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3 \, \text{liters}\).

2. **Medium setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the low setting.
   - Therefore, it removes \(2 \times 1 = 2\) liters of water per day.
   - Brian used it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed at medium setting: \(2 \, \text{liters/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 6 \, \text{liters}\).

3. **High setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting.
   - Therefore, it removes \(2 \times 2 = 4\) liters of water per day.
   - Brian used it for 5 days.
   - Total water removed at high setting: \(4 \, \text{liters/day} \times 5 \, \text{days} = 20 \, \text{liters}\).

Now, we sum up the total water removed from all settings:
- Total water removed: \(3 \, \text{liters} + 6 \, \text{liters} + 20 \, \text{liters} = 29 \, \text{liters}\).

The final numerical answer is:

The interest is 2% of $300:
\[ \text{Interest} = 300 \times \frac{2}{100} = 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen will owe is:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, we calculate how much Stephen will pay over the 11 months. He will pay $25 per month for 11 months:
\[ \text{Total Payment for 11 Months} = 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

Now, we find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month by subtracting the total payment for 11 months from the total amount he owes:
\[ \text{Payment in the Twelfth Month} = 306 - 275 = 31 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find the final price of the toy after the price changes, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price of the toy in December after an 80% increase.
2. Calculate the price of the toy in January after a 50% decrease from the December price.

**Step 1: Calculate the price in December.**

The original price of the toy in November was $40. In December, the price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we calculate 80% of $40 and add it to the original price.

\[ \text{Increase in December} = 40 \times \frac{80}{100} = 40 \times 0.8 = 32 \]

So, the price in December is:

\[ 40 + 32 = 72 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the price in January.**

In January, the price decreased by 50% from the December price. To find the new price, we calculate 50% of $72 and subtract it from the December price.

\[ \text{Decrease in January} = 72 \times \frac{50}{100} = 72 \times 0.5 = 36 \]

So, the price in January is:

\[ 72 - 36 = 36 \]

The final price of the toy after it was discounted in January is \(\boxed{36}\)."

Number of teachers at school = Total number of teachers - Number of sick teachers + Number of substitute teachers

Number of teachers at school = 82 - 13 + 9

Now, let's perform the calculation:

Number of teachers at school = 69 + 9 = 78

So, the final numerical answer is 78."
"To determine how much Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to calculate his weekly expenditure and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

First, let's calculate the weekly cost:
- Pasta costs $1.00 per box.
- Cheddar cheese costs $3.00.
- Gruyere cheese costs twice the amount of cheddar cheese, which is $3.00 * 2 = $6.00.

Now, let's add up the weekly costs:
- Weekly cost = Cost of pasta + Cost of cheddar cheese + Cost of Gruyere cheese
- Weekly cost = $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00

Next, we calculate the annual cost by multiplying the weekly cost by the number of weeks in a year (52 weeks):
- Annual cost = Weekly cost * Number of weeks in a year
- Annual cost = $10.00 * 52 = $520.00

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
520"
"First, let's calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms. Since it takes 15 minutes per classroom, the total time required is:

\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert the total time into hours because the workday is given in hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 1200 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

The custodian works 8 hours per day. To find out what percentage of their day is spent cleaning, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent cleaning}}{\text{Total workday}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours/day}} \right) \times 100 = 2.5 \times 100 = 250\% \]

However, this percentage seems unreasonably high, so let's recheck the calculation. The custodian works 8 hours a day, and they need 20 hours to clean all the classrooms. This means they would need to work more than one day to complete the task. Given the constraint of 5 days, we can calculate the average time spent cleaning per day:

\[ \text{Average time spent cleaning per day} = \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{5 \text{ days}} = 4 \text{ hours/day} \]

Now, we calculate the percentage of the day spent cleaning:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{4 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours/day}} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 50\% \]"
"First, let's determine the capacity of each shelf:

- Each of the middle shelves can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase:

- The total capacity of one bookcase is the sum of the capacities of all the shelves: \(10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books.

Given that Elly has 110 books, we need to determine how many bookcases are required to hold all 110 books. We do this by dividing the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:

\[
\frac{110}{55} = 2
\]

Therefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books. The final numerical answer is:

2"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs Rose bought. She bought five dozens of eggs at $2.40 per dozen.

\[
\text{Total cost} = 5 \times 2.40 = 12.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, let's determine the total number of eggs Rose bought. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:

\[
5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs}
\]

Rose plans to sell the eggs at $1 for every 3 eggs. To find out how many sets of 3 eggs she can sell, we divide the total number of eggs by 3:

\[
60 \div 3 = 20 \text{ sets}
\]

Since each set of 3 eggs is sold for $1, the total revenue from selling all the eggs is:

\[
20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, to find Rose's profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

\[
\text{Profit} = 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, Rose's profit is:

\[
\boxed{8}
\]"
"To determine the number of white hats Skyler has, we can follow these steps:

1. **Total Hats**: Skyler has 100 hats in total.

2. **Red Hats**: Half of the hats are red.
   \[
   \text{Number of red hats} = \frac{100}{2} = 50
   \]

3. **Remaining Hats After Red Hats**: Subtract the number of red hats from the total number of hats.
   \[
   \text{Remaining hats} = 100 - 50 = 50
   \]

4. **Blue Hats**: 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue.
   \[
   \text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]

5. **White Hats**: The rest of the hats are white. Subtract the number of red and blue hats from the remaining hats.
   \[
   \text{Number of white hats} = 50 - 30 = 20
   \]

Thus, the number of white hats Skyler has is 20."
"First, let's determine the cost of the beef jerky when it's $3.00 off. The original price of the bag is $18.00, so the discounted price is:

\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many sticks of beef jerky are in the bag. Since there are 30 sticks per bag, we can calculate the cost per stick by dividing the discounted price by the number of sticks:

\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

The cost per stick is $0.50, which is equivalent to 50 cents. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 50 \]"
"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to calculate how many questions she answered correctly on the first test.

The first test has 70 questions, and she gets 60% of them correct:
\[ 70 \times 0.60 = 42 \text{ questions correct} \]

To pass 6th grade, Audrey needs to correctly answer 70% of the total questions. The total number of questions across both tests is:
\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \text{ questions} \]

To find out how many questions she needs to get right in total to pass, we calculate 70% of 110:
\[ 110 \times 0.70 = 77 \text{ questions correct} \]

We already know she got 42 questions correct on the first test. Therefore, the number of questions she needs to get right on the second test is:
\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \text{ questions correct} \]

So, Audrey needs to get 35 questions correct on the second test to move onto 7th grade. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, which can be written as:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

The total number of ice cubes is the sum of the strawberry and blueberry cubes, which is given as 116:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:
\[ S = 20 \]

Now, substituting \( S = 20 \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is 96."
"To calculate the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of games Ara has played in four years.
2. Calculate the total points scored by multiplying the number of games by her average score per game.

First, Ara has been playing 40 games every year. Over four years, the total number of games she has played is:
\[ 40 \text{ games/year} \times 4 \text{ years} = 160 \text{ games} \]

Next, her score for every game is 21 points. Therefore, the total number of points she has scored in the four years is:
\[ 160 \text{ games} \times 21 \text{ points/game} = 3360 \text{ points} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 3360 \]"
"Brendan initially had 10 marbles. When he dropped half of them, he dropped 10 / 2 = 5 marbles. This means he had 10 - 5 = 5 marbles left. When he came up with 3 marbles, he got rid of 1 bead, so he effectively gained 3 - 1 = 2 marbles. Therefore, the total number of marbles Brendan ended up with is 5 + 2 = 7 marbles."
"To determine how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we can break down the problem into the steps provided by the historical averages.

1. **Determine the number of customers needed to sell 15 cars:**
   - For every 2 cars sold, 1 customer comes in.
   - Therefore, for 15 cars, the number of customers needed is:
     \[
     \frac{15 \text{ cars}}{2 \text{ cars/customer}} = 7.5 \text{ customers}
     \]
   - Since Jason can't have half a customer, we round up to the next whole number, which is 8 customers.

2. **Determine the number of telephone calls needed to get 8 customers:**
   - For every 25 telephone calls, 1 customer comes in.
   - Therefore, the number of telephone calls needed to get 8 customers is:
     \[
     8 \text{ customers} \times 25 \text{ calls/customer} = 200 \text{ calls}
     \]

So, Jason needs to make 200 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

"First, let's determine the number of flashlights. There are 4 people in the house, so there are 4 flashlights for them. Additionally, there are 2 flashlights per room, and there are 8 rooms. Therefore, the number of additional flashlights is:

\[ 2 \text{ flashlights/room} \times 8 \text{ rooms} = 16 \text{ flashlights} \]

Adding the flashlights for the people and the flashlights for the rooms, we get:

\[ 4 \text{ flashlights} + 16 \text{ flashlights} = 20 \text{ flashlights} \]

Next, let's determine the number of candles. There are 8 rooms in the house, and half of these rooms (4 rooms) have 4 small candles each, while the other half (4 rooms) have 5 medium candles each. The total number of candles is calculated as follows:

\[ 4 \text{ rooms} \times 4 \text{ small candles/room} + 4 \text{ rooms} \times 5 \text{ medium candles/room} \]

\[ = 16 \text{ small candles} + 20 \text{ medium candles} \]

\[ = 36 \text{ candles} \]

Now, we add the number of flashlights and candles to find the total number of items being used:

\[ 20 \text{ flashlights} + 36 \text{ candles} = 56 \]

So, the total number of candles and flashlights Brianna's family is using is:

"To solve this problem, let's break down the time it takes John to solve each side of the Rubik's cube.

1. The first side takes 5 minutes.
2. The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so each takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes.
3. The fourth and fifth sides each take half as long as the first side, so each takes \(\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\) minutes.

Now, let's sum up the time for all sides:

- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes

Adding these times together:

\[ 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 \]

So, the total time it takes John to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes."
"If there were 20 helmets, and Dominick saw half as many robots as helmets, then there were \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) robots.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount pop, which is \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels.
3. In the next 30 seconds, four times the initial amount pop, which is \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels.
4. In the final 30 seconds, half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, which is \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) kernels.

Now, let's sum up the total number of kernels that popped during the cooking process:

"To determine the total amount of dog food needed in a week, we first calculate the daily consumption for both German Shepherds and Bulldogs, and then multiply by the number of days in a week.

For the German Shepherds:
- Each German Shepherd consumes 5 kilograms of dog food per day.
- There are 3 German Shepherds.
- Therefore, the total daily consumption for German Shepherds is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) kilograms.

For the Bulldogs:
- Each Bulldog consumes 3 kilograms of dog food per day.
- There are 2 Bulldogs.
- Therefore, the total daily consumption for Bulldogs is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) kilograms.

Adding the daily consumption of both breeds:
- Total daily consumption = \(15 + 6 = 21\) kilograms.

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week):
- Weekly consumption = \(21 \times 7 = 147\) kilograms.

Thus, the Kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week."

\[ R = 32 - 12 \]
\[ R = 20 \]

So, the number of red blocks is 20."
"To determine how far Elvis is from his house, we need to calculate the distance he traveled west and the distance he traveled east, and then find the net distance from his starting point.

First, calculate the distance traveled west:
- Average speed = 18 mph
- Time traveled west = 5 hours
- Distance west = Speed × Time = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles

Next, calculate the distance traveled east:
- Average speed = 18 mph
- Time traveled east = 8 hours
- Distance east = Speed × Time = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles

Now, find the net distance from the starting point:
- Distance west = 90 miles
- Distance east = 144 miles
- Net distance = Distance east - Distance west = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

Therefore, Elvis is 54 miles from his house now."
"To find the final value of the boat after three years of depreciation, we need to calculate the value after each year's depreciation step by step.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   - Initial value: $9000
   - Depreciation rate: 30%
   - Depreciation amount: \( 9000 \times 0.30 = 2700 \)
   - Value after first year: \( 9000 - 2700 = 6300 \)

2. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   - Value at the start of the second year: $6300
   - Depreciation rate: 30%
   - Depreciation amount: \( 6300 \times 0.30 = 1890 \)
   - Value after second year: \( 6300 - 1890 = 4410 \)

3. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   - Value at the start of the third year: $4410
   - Depreciation rate: 20%
   - Depreciation amount: \( 4410 \times 0.20 = 882 \)
   - Value after third year: \( 4410 - 882 = 3528 \)

Thus, the boat is worth **$3528** after the three years."
"First, let's determine the number of orange and yellow candies.

Given:
- Red candies = 54
- Orange candies = 2 * Red candies = 2 * 54 = 108
- Yellow candies = Red candies / 2 = 54 / 2 = 27

Now, let's calculate the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies:
- Total of red, orange, and yellow candies = 54 (red) + 108 (orange) + 27 (yellow) = 189

The total number of candies in the bag is 232. To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:
- Pink candies = Total candies - (Red + Orange + Yellow) = 232 - 189 = 43

"First, let's calculate the cost of one night at the hotel. It is given as $80.

Next, we need to find the cost of one bus trip. The problem states that each bus trip is 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. Therefore, the cost of one bus trip is:
\[ 10\% \times 80 = 0.10 \times 80 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost for the hotel. Helen stayed for 3 nights, so the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 3 \times 80 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for the bus trips. Helen rode the bus 7 times, so the total cost for the bus trips is:
\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the total cost for the hotel and the total cost for the bus trips to find the overall cost:
\[ 240 + 56 = 296 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 296 \]"
"First, let's determine how many marbles Dallas has after dropping 4 of them in the playground. Dallas originally had 21 marbles and dropped 4, so:

\[ 21 - 4 = 17 \]

This means Dallas has 17 marbles after the drop. Since Dallas and Darla together received all 52 marbles from Mazie, we can find out how many marbles Darla received by subtracting the number of marbles Dallas has from the total number of marbles:

\[ 52 - 17 = 35 \]

Therefore, the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla is:

\[ 35 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the tickets:
- The cost of an adult ticket is $12, and there are 2 adults, so the total cost for adult tickets is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dollars.

"To determine how many pounds of feed are left after a week, we need to calculate the total feed consumption for all the pigs over the week and then subtract that from the initial amount of feed ordered.

First, let's calculate the daily feed consumption for one pig:
- Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day.
- Therefore, the daily feed consumption for one pig is \(4 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}\).

Next, we calculate the daily feed consumption for all five pigs:
- The total daily feed consumption for five pigs is \(8 \text{ pounds/pig} \times 5 \text{ pigs} = 40 \text{ pounds}\).

Now, we calculate the weekly feed consumption for all five pigs:
- There are 7 days in a week, so the weekly feed consumption for five pigs is \(40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 280 \text{ pounds}\).

Finally, we determine the amount of feed left after a week:
- Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed.
- After a week, the feed left is \(300 \text{ pounds} - 280 \text{ pounds} = 20 \text{ pounds}\).

"First, we need to calculate the total number of hot dogs required for the party. John invited 20 people and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs, so:

\[ 20 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ hot dogs/guest} = 40 \text{ hot dogs} \]

John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party, so we need to subtract these from the total required:

\[ 40 \text{ hot dogs} - 4 \text{ hot dogs} = 36 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Next, we need to determine how many packs of hot dogs John needs to buy. Each pack contains 6 hot dogs, so we divide the number of hot dogs needed by the number of hot dogs per pack:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ hot dogs}}{6 \text{ hot dogs/pack}} = 6 \text{ packs} \]

Each pack costs $2, so the total cost for 6 packs is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Street**: There are 5 children.
2. **Second Street**: Each of the 5 children is joined by another child. Therefore, the number of children becomes \(5 + 5 = 10\).
3. **Third Street**: Each of the 10 children is joined by another 2 children. Therefore, the number of children becomes \(10 + (10 \times 2) = 10 + 20 = 30\).

On the third street, the original 5 children give up and leave the group. So, we subtract these 5 children from the total of 30 children.

The final number of children following the truck is \(30 - 5 = 25\).

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to subtract the total number of meals she has already given out from the total number of meals she has to distribute.

First, let's calculate the total number of meals given out:
- Meals given out on Friday: 64
- Meals given out on Saturday: 30
- Meals given out on Sunday: 48

Total meals given out = 64 + 30 + 48

Now, let's add these numbers:
64 + 30 = 94
94 + 48 = 142

So, Mamou has given out 142 meals in total.

Now, we subtract the total meals given out from the total meals to be distributed:
1,360 - 142 = 1,218

Therefore, the number of meals Mamou has left to distribute is 1,218."

"First, let's calculate the time Charisma spends meditating each day. She meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes in the evening, which totals to 30 minutes per day.

Next, let's calculate the time she spends on yoga each week. She practices yoga for 1 hour (60 minutes) 5 days a week, so she spends 5 * 60 = 300 minutes on yoga each week.

Now, let's calculate the total time spent on meditation and yoga in one week. Since she meditates for 30 minutes each day and there are 7 days in a week, she spends 30 * 7 = 210 minutes on meditation each week. Adding the time spent on yoga, she spends 210 + 300 = 510 minutes on meditation and yoga each week.

Finally, to find out how much time she has spent on meditation/yoga practice in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly total by 4:

510 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 2040 minutes.

Converting 2040 minutes into hours, we get:

"First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate returns, the dog continues to dig 6 holes a day, but Nate starts filling in 9 holes a day. The net effect is that the dog is still digging 6 - 9 = -3 holes per day, which means the dog is digging 3 holes faster than Nate is filling them. 

Now, we need to determine how many days it will take to fill in all 84 holes. Since the dog is digging 3 holes faster than Nate is filling them, we can calculate the number of days it will take to fill in all the holes by dividing the total number of holes by the net effect per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

To find out how many weeks it takes, we divide the number of days by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes. The final numerical answer is:

First, calculate the enrollment at Butler High School:
\[ \text{Butler High School enrollment} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 \]

Let's perform the calculation:
\[ \text{Butler High School enrollment} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 = 3000 \]

Next, we need to find how much greater the enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Norman High School enrollment} - \text{Butler High School enrollment} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 4000 - 3000 = 1000 \]

Therefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1000 \]"
"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies the Adams family has made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.

Total cookies made = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies - (Rainbow cookies + Oatmeal cookies)

Let's calculate:

Chocolate chip cookies = 7995 - (2595 + 3075)
Chocolate chip cookies = 7995 - 5670
Chocolate chip cookies = 2325

So, the number of chocolate chip cookies made is 2325."
"First, let's determine the number of each item Igor gathered by accident:

- Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many, which is \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes.
- Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes, but Igor gathered two more than requested, which is \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes.
- Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, and Igor picked up the correct number, which is 7 beakers.

Now, let's calculate the total number of items Igor gathered:

- Test tubes: 8
- Beakers: 7
- Petri dishes: 16

Adding these together gives:
\[ 8 + 7 + 16 = 31 \]

Dr. Grumpus wanted a total of 29 items on the lab bench. Since Igor gathered 31 items, he must have lost some. The number of items lost is:
\[ 31 - 29 = 2 \]

Therefore, the number of beakers Igor lost is 2."
"First, we need to determine the total number of screws required for all the tables.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. Therefore, the number of screws needed for one table is:
\[ 4 \text{ legs/table} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 8 \text{ screws/table} \]

James is assembling 4 tables, so the total number of screws needed for all the tables is:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws/table} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the number of screws he has:
\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

Thus, the number of screws James will have left over is:
\[ 8 \]"
"If there are 10 eggs in the first basket and twice as many in the second basket, then the second basket has \(10 \times 2 = 20\) eggs.

Therefore, the total number of eggs in both baskets is \(10 + 20 = 30\).

The final numerical answer is 30."
"First, let's determine how much money each person raised individually.

Alexandra raised $430.

Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so:
\[ \text{Kim's amount} = 430 + 320 = 750 \]

Next, we need to find out how much Sarah raised. We know that Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, and Sarah raised $300, so:
\[ \text{Maryam's amount} = 300 + 400 = 700 \]

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money raised by adding the amounts raised by each person:
\[ \text{Total amount} = \text{Alexandra's amount} + \text{Kim's amount} + \text{Sarah's amount} + \text{Maryam's amount} \]
\[ \text{Total amount} = 430 + 750 + 300 + 700 \]

Adding these amounts together:
\[ 430 + 750 = 1180 \]
\[ 1180 + 300 = 1480 \]
\[ 1480 + 700 = 2180 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money raised by all of them is:
\[ 2180 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2180 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Aaron's speed:**
   - Let \( v \) be Vanessa's speed in miles per minute.
   - Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, Aaron's speed is \( 2v \).
   - Aaron completed 4 miles in 16 minutes.
   - Using the formula \( \text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \), we can write:
     \[
     16 = \frac{4}{2v}
     \]
   - Simplifying the equation:
     \[
     16 = \frac{4}{2v} \implies 16 = \frac{2}{v} \implies v = \frac{2}{16} = \frac{1}{8}
     \]
   - So, Vanessa's speed is \( \frac{1}{8} \) miles per minute.

2. **Determine the distance Vanessa ran:**
   - We know Vanessa ran 4 miles.

3. **Calculate the time Vanessa took to complete her part:**
   - Using the formula \( \text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \) again:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{\frac{1}{8} \text{ miles per minute}} = 4 \times 8 = 32 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, Vanessa took 32 minutes to complete her part of the race.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{32}

"First, we need to calculate the total amount of line required for the new dock. The caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. Since there are 200 feet of dock, the total line required is:

\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Next, we need to determine how much more line the caretaker needs to buy. He currently has 6 feet of new line, so the additional line required is:

\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."

5. **Total cost per reservation**: 2 meals * $5 + $5 = $10 + $5 = $15
6. **Total cost per night**: 6 reservations * $15 = $90
7. **Days the restaurant is open per week**: 2 days
8. **Total cost per week**: $90 * 2 = $180

Therefore, the final numerical answer is $180."
"First, let's calculate the total selling price of the 50 watermelons with a 25% profit.

The cost price for 50 watermelons is $80.

To find the selling price with a 25% profit, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Selling Price} = \text{Cost Price} \times (1 + \text{Profit Percentage}) \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ \text{Selling Price} = 80 \times (1 + 0.25) \]
\[ \text{Selling Price} = 80 \times 1.25 \]
\[ \text{Selling Price} = 100 \]

So, the total selling price for 50 watermelons is $100.

To find the selling price per watermelon, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:
\[ \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{\text{Total Selling Price}}{\text{Number of Watermelons}} \]
\[ \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{100}{50} \]
\[ \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = 2 \]

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2."
"First, let's determine James's current age. Since Dora will be 12 in 3 years, she is currently 9 years old. James is now twice as old as Dora, so James is currently \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

John had James when he was 19, so John is currently \(19 + 18 = 37\) years old.

Now, let's find out how old John's youngest son is. The youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest son is currently \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old.

In 3 years, the youngest son will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

The final numerical answer is:
8"
"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in that time.

First, let's find out how many oranges each can peel in one minute:
- Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in one minute, she peels \( \frac{1}{3} \) of an orange.
- Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in one minute, she peels \( \frac{1}{4} \) of an orange.

Next, we calculate how many oranges each can peel in one hour (60 minutes):
- In one hour, Ana peels \( 60 \times \frac{1}{3} = 20 \) oranges.
- In one hour, Jane peels \( 60 \times \frac{1}{4} = 15 \) oranges.

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane in one hour:
- The difference is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \).

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

The final numerical answer is:
5"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400, and Mark gets it at 80% off.

The discount amount is:
\[ 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \]

So, the cost of the radiator after the discount is:
\[ 400 - 320 = 80 \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost of hiring the mechanic to install the radiator. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.

The installation cost is:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator after the discount to the installation cost to find the total amount Mark paid:
\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

Therefore, the total amount Mark paid is:
\[ 230 \]"
"Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( K \).

We know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

From the first piece of information, we can write the equation:
\[ C + K = 20 \]

From the second piece of information, we know that chickens have 2 legs each and cows have 4 legs each, so we can write the equation:
\[ 2C + 4K = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

To solve this system, we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ C + 2K - C - K = 15 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 20 - 15 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is 5. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of slices available from the 7 pizzas. Since each pizza is cut into 8 slices, we can calculate the total number of slices as follows:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to divide the total number of slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends, which makes a total of 4 people. We can find out how many slices each person gets by dividing the total number of slices by the number of people:

\[ \frac{56 \text{ slices}}{4 \text{ people}} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

So, each of them can have 14 slices. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 14 \]"
