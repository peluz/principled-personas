"First, let's determine how many eggs Janet has left after eating and using some for baking.

Janet starts with 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 eggs for baking muffins. So, the number of eggs left for sale is:

\[ 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 \]

Janet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg. Therefore, the total amount she makes every day is:

\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 18 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.
2. The robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Therefore, the amount of white fiber needed is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \) bolts.

Now, let's calculate the amount of white fiber:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 2 = 1 \text{ bolt} \]

Next, we add the bolts of blue fiber and white fiber to find the total number of bolts:
\[ 2 \text{ bolts (blue)} + 1 \text{ bolt (white)} = 3 \text{ bolts} \]

So, the total number of bolts needed is 3.

\[
\boxed{3}

"First, let's calculate the increase in the value of the house due to the repairs. The original value of the house is $80,000. The repairs increased the value by 150%. To find the increase in value, we calculate 150% of $80,000:

\[ \text{Increase in value} = 80,000 \times \frac{150}{100} = 80,000 \times 1.5 = 120,000 \]

So, the total value of the house after the repairs is:

\[ \text{Total value after repairs} = 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Josh spent $50,000 on repairs, and the house was originally worth $80,000. Therefore, the total cost for Josh to buy and repair the house is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value of the house after repairs:

\[ \text{Profit} = 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 70,000 \]"
"James runs 3 sprints each day, and each sprint is 60 meters. Therefore, in one day, he runs:

\[ 3 \text{ sprints/day} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 180 \text{ meters/day} \]

Since he runs 3 times a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:

\[ 180 \text{ meters/day} \times 3 \text{ days/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 540."
"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she gives her flock in the morning and afternoon.

Wendi gives each chicken 3 cups of feed per day. With a flock of 20 chickens, the total feed given in the morning and afternoon is:

\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

In the morning, she gives 15 cups of feed, and in the afternoon, she gives 25 cups of feed. So, the total feed given in the morning and afternoon is:

\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

The total feed given in the morning and afternoon is 40 cups. Since the total feed required for the day is 60 cups, the amount of feed needed for the final meal is:

\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:

\[ 20 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 20 \]"
"To solve this, we need to calculate the cost of the glasses Kylar is buying. Kylar is buying 16 glasses, and the first glass costs $5. Every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.

Let's break it down:

- The first glass costs $5.
- The second glass costs $3.
- The third glass costs $5.
- The fourth glass costs $3.
- And so on...

This pattern continues for 16 glasses. We can see that for every two glasses, the cost is $5 + $3 = $8.

Since 16 glasses can be divided into 8 pairs of glasses, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 \times 8 = 64 \]

So, Kylar needs to pay $64 for the 16 glasses."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Seattle's Sheep**: We are given that Seattle has 20 sheep.
   \[
   \text{Sheep in Seattle} = 20
   \]

2. **Charleston's Sheep**: Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   \[
   \text{Sheep in Charleston} = 4 \times \text{Sheep in Seattle} = 4 \times 20 = 80
   \]

3. **Toulouse's Sheep**: Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   \[
   \text{Sheep in Toulouse} = 2 \times \text{Sheep in Charleston} = 2 \times 80 = 160
   \]

4. **Total Sheep**: To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we add the number of sheep in each city.
   \[
   \text{Total Sheep} = \text{Sheep in Seattle} + \text{Sheep in Charleston} + \text{Sheep in Toulouse} = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260
   \]

Therefore, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is 260."
"To determine the total time Carla spends downloading the 200 GB file, we need to break down the process into parts and calculate the time for each part.

1. **First 40% of the download:**
   - 40% of 200 GB is \(0.40 \times 200 = 80\) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \(80 \div 2 = 40\) minutes.

2. **Windows update installation:**
   - This takes 20 minutes.

3. **Restarting the download:**
   - After the update, Carla has to start the download from the beginning, which means she has to download the first 80 GB again.
   - The time to download 80 GB at 2 GB/minute is \(80 \div 2 = 40\) minutes.

4. **Remaining 60% of the download:**
   - 60% of 200 GB is \(0.60 \times 200 = 120\) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 120 GB is \(120 \div 2 = 60\) minutes.

Now, we sum up all the times:
- Time for the first 40% download: 40 minutes
- Time for the Windows update installation: 20 minutes
- Time to download the first 40% again: 40 minutes
- Time for the remaining 60% download: 60 minutes

Total time = \(40 + 20 + 40 + 60 = 160\) minutes.

The final numerical answer is 160 minutes."
"First, let's calculate the distance John traveled during the initial 3 hours at 60 mph:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during this time.

Then, he drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph:
\[ \text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]

After that, he drives for the remaining time at 80 mph. The total time spent driving is 4 hours, and he already spent 3.5 hours (3 hours + 0.5 hours), so the remaining time is:
\[ 4 \, \text{hours} - 3.5 \, \text{hours} = 0.5 \, \text{hours} \]

The distance covered during the last 0.5 hours at 80 mph is:
\[ \text{Distance} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 40 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, let's add up all the distances:
\[ 180 \, \text{miles} + 15 \, \text{miles} + 40 \, \text{miles} = 235 \, \text{miles} \]

Since John started 180 miles away from home, the distance he is from home at the end of those 4 hours is:
\[ 235 \, \text{miles} - 180 \, \text{miles} = 55 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 55 \]"
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break it down into regular hours and overtime hours.

Eliza's regular rate is $10 per hour. For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
\[ 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \]

For the overtime hours, she works 5 hours over the regular 40 hours. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate:
\[ 1.2 \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$12/\text{hour} \]

Her earnings for the overtime hours are:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

Adding the earnings from regular hours and overtime hours gives her total earnings for the week:
\[ \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \]

So, Eliza's earnings for this week are:
\[ \$460 \]"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, let's calculate the number of downloads for each month:

1. **First Month:** The program had 60 downloads.
2. **Second Month:** The number of downloads was three times the first month, so:
   \[
   60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ downloads}
   \]
3. **Third Month:** The number of downloads was reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we calculate:
   \[
   180 \times 0.30 = 54 \text{ downloads}
   \]
   Therefore, the number of downloads in the third month is:
   \[
   180 - 54 = 126 \text{ downloads}
   \]

Now, to find the total number of downloads over the three months, we sum the downloads from each month:
\[
60 + 180 + 126 = 366
\]

The total number of downloads over the three months is **366**."

  \[
  2 \times 80 = 160
  \]
- Mini cheesecakes: 6 dozen at $55 per dozen
  \[
  6 \times 55 = 330
  \]

Now, let's sum up the total cost:
\[
204 + 160 + 330 = 694
\]

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money from the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point at which the profit becomes positive.

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:
- Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons.
- Each lemon is sold for $1.5.
- Therefore, the annual revenue from lemons is \(7 \times 1.5 = 10.5\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the annual cost of maintaining the tree:
- The cost to water and feed the tree is $3 per year.

Now, we can find the net profit each year by subtracting the annual cost from the annual revenue:
- Net profit per year = Annual revenue - Annual cost
- Net profit per year = \(10.5 - 3 = 7.5\) dollars.

Carlos starts earning money when the net profit becomes positive. Since the initial cost to plant the tree is $90, we need to determine how many years it will take for the net profit to cover this initial cost.

Let \(n\) be the number of years it takes to earn back the initial cost. The total net profit after \(n\) years is \(7.5n\). We set this equal to the initial cost to find \(n\):
\[7.5n = 90\]

Solving for \(n\):
\[n = \frac{90}{7.5} = 12\]

Therefore, it will take 12 years before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree."
"Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had as \( x \).

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \).

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \).

3. She then sold half of what was left at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \). The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \).

We know that after these sales, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

Let's solve this equation step by step.

First, simplify the expression inside the parentheses:

\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \left( \frac{x}{3} - 1 \right) = \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{x}{3} + 1 = \frac{x}{3} - 1 \]

So the equation becomes:

\[ \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5 \]

Add 1 to both sides:

\[ \frac{x}{3} = 6 \]

Multiply both sides by 3:

\[ x = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners. Let's verify this by going through the steps:

1. She sold \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) vacuum cleaners at the green house, leaving her with \( 18 - 6 = 12 \) vacuum cleaners.
2. She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, leaving her with \( 12 - 2 = 10 \) vacuum cleaners.
3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) vacuum cleaners, leaving her with \( 10 - 5 = 5 \) vacuum cleaners.

The calculations confirm that Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners. Therefore, the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we have:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after those who enrolled in contemporary dance have been accounted for:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Now, 25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

The rest of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance. To find out how many students that is, we subtract the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance from the remaining students:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of students in hip-hop dance}}{\text{Total number of students}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.60 \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the entire students that enrolled in hip-hop dance is 60%."
"To determine which purchase plan will maximize the profit, we need to calculate the future value of each item based on the expected market growth and then compare the profit from each.

For the jewelry:
- Current value: $5,000
- Expected growth: 2.5%

The future value of the jewelry can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Future Value of Jewelry} = \text{Current Value} \times (1 + \text{Growth Rate}) \]
\[ \text{Future Value of Jewelry} = 5000 \times (1 + 0.025) \]
\[ \text{Future Value of Jewelry} = 5000 \times 1.025 \]
\[ \text{Future Value of Jewelry} = 5125 \]

For the electronic gadgets:
- Current value: $8,000
- Expected growth: 1.2%

The future value of the electronic gadgets can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Future Value of Gadgets} = \text{Current Value} \times (1 + \text{Growth Rate}) \]
\[ \text{Future Value of Gadgets} = 8000 \times (1 + 0.012) \]
\[ \text{Future Value of Gadgets} = 8000 \times 1.012 \]
\[ \text{Future Value of Gadgets} = 8096 \]

Now, we calculate the profit for each option:
- Profit from jewelry: \( \text{Future Value of Jewelry} - \text{Current Value} \)
\[ \text{Profit from Jewelry} = 5125 - 5000 = 125 \]

- Profit from electronic gadgets: \( \text{Future Value of Gadgets} - \text{Current Value} \)
\[ \text{Profit from Gadgets} = 8096 - 8000 = 96 \]

Comparing the profits:
- Profit from jewelry: $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets: $96

The merchant would maximize profit by choosing to purchase the jewelry, which would yield a profit of $125."
"To determine the total distance covered by each train over the two days, we need to add the distances traveled in both directions.

1. The first day, the train travels 80 miles west.
2. The second day, the train travels 150 miles north.

The total distance covered by each train is the sum of these two distances:
\[ 80 \text{ miles} + 150 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles} \]

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles."
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from both teaching and coaching separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her annual earnings from teaching:
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual teaching hours = 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year
Annual teaching earnings = 1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her annual earnings from coaching:
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual coaching hours = 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year
Annual coaching earnings = 750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year

Now, we sum up her annual earnings from both teaching and coaching:
Annual salary = Annual teaching earnings + Annual coaching earnings
Annual salary = $35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

The final numerical answer is $57,500."
"To determine how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs Claire uses per day.
2. Calculate the number of eggs Claire uses per week.
3. Calculate the number of eggs Claire uses in 4 weeks.
4. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.

Step 1: Claire uses 3 eggs per day.

Step 2: There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Step 3: Over 4 weeks, Claire will use:
\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Step 4: Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, we convert 84 eggs into dozens:
\[ \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozen} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 7 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour over the entire 12-mile trail.

First, let's calculate the total time Marissa wants to spend hiking to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

The formula for average speed is:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Given that Marissa wants an average speed of 4 miles per hour and the total distance is 12 miles, we can set up the equation:
\[ 4 = \frac{12}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Solving for Total Time:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already spent 1 hour on the first 4 miles and another 1 hour on the next 2 miles. So, the time spent so far is:
\[ 1 + 1 = 2 \text{ hours} \]

To achieve a total time of 3 hours, the remaining time is:
\[ 3 - 2 = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The remaining distance is:
\[ 12 - 4 - 2 = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we need to find the speed required to cover the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Thus, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \]"
"First, let's determine the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the amount of water in the orange drink is:

\[ \text{Water in orange drink} = 10 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ liters} \]

Next, let's determine the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is:

\[ \text{Water in pineapple drink} = 15 \times \frac{3}{5} = 9 \text{ liters} \]

After spilling one liter of the orange drink, the amount of orange drink remaining is:

\[ \text{Remaining orange drink} = 10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

The total volume of the mixture after adding the remaining orange drink to the pineapple drink is:

\[ \text{Total volume} = 9 + 15 = 24 \text{ liters} \]

The total amount of water in the mixture is the sum of the water from the remaining orange drink and the water from the pineapple drink:

\[ \text{Total water} = \frac{20}{3} + 9 = \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3} \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture is:

\[ \frac{47}{3} \text{ liters} \]

Let's convert this to a numerical value:

\[ \frac{47}{3} \approx 15.67 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 15.67 \]"

- The last 3 customers did not buy any DVDs, so that's 0 DVDs.

Adding these together: 3 + 4 + 0 = 7 DVDs.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 7."
"To determine how many centimeters shorter the candle will be after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, we need to calculate the total burning time and then use the rate of melting to find the total decrease in the candle's height.

The burning time from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is 4 hours.

Given that the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, the total decrease in the candle's height over 4 hours is:
\[ 2 \text{ cm/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ cm} \]

Therefore, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"To find the original price of the book, we can set up an equation based on the information given. If the book was bought for $19.50 with a 25% discount, it means Kyle paid 75% of the original price (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \). According to the problem, 75% of \( P \) is $19.50. We can write this as:

\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we need to solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's calculate the value of \( P \).
```python
# Calculation
original_price = 19.50 / 0.75
original_price
```
```output
RuntimeError
```
It seems there was an error in the execution environment. Let me perform the calculation manually:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was \( \$26 \).

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{26}

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered except for the boxes of pizza.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
The cost of 4 apples is \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Adding these together gives:
\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\] dollars.

Marie paid a total of $50. If we subtract the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples from the total amount paid, we can find out how much she spent on the boxes of pizza:
\[50 - 33 = 17\] dollars.

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, we can determine the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered by dividing the amount spent on pizza by the cost per box:
\[17 \div 8.50 = 2\] boxes.

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza. The final numerical answer is:
\[2\]"
"To find out how much Mishka spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of each type of clothing item and then sum them up.

For the shorts:
3 pairs * $16.50 per pair = $59.50

For the pants:
3 pairs * $22.50 per pair = $67.50

For the shoes:
3 pairs * $42 per pair = $126.00

Now, we add the costs together:
$59.50 + $67.50 + $126.00 = $253.00

So, Mishka spent $253.00 on all the clothing items."
"To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of servings she will consume and then the total cost based on the price per carton.

First, calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days:
- Cynthia eats 1 serving of ice cream every night.
- There are 60 days in the period.

\[
\text{Total servings} = 1 \text{ serving/day} \times 60 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ servings}
\]

Next, determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need:
- Each carton contains 15 servings.

\[

"To determine how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to calculate the distance from his first stop to his second stop.

Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, so the distance from the start to his first stop is 20 miles.

His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip is 60 miles, the distance to his second stop is:
\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \text{ miles} \]

Now, to find the distance between his first and second stops, we subtract the distance of his first stop from the distance of his second stop:
\[ 45 - 20 = 25 \text{ miles} \]

So, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops."
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

The cost of the first pair of high heels is $33. The cost of the second pair of high heels is twice the cost of the first pair, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ B = 99 + 5 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = 104 \]

So, the cost of the boots is \( 104 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 104 \]"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen based on the given ratio and total age.

Given:
- The ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11.
- The sum of their ages is 162.

Let's denote Darrell's age as \(7x\) and Allen's age as \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The sum of their ages is:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]
\[18x = 162\]
\[x = \frac{162}{18}\]
\[x = 9\]

Now, we can find their current ages:
- Darrell's age: \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\)
- Allen's age: \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\)

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is:
\[109\]"
"To find the average guess, we first need to determine each friend's guess and then calculate the average.

1. The first friend's guess is 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half of the first friend's guess:

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these as equations:
\[ G + S = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins \( S \) is 40, we can find the number of gold coins \( G \) using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins."
"First, let's determine how many jewels Aaron has. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Since Raymond has 40 jewels, we can calculate half of Raymond's jewels as follows:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Now, we add 5 to this number to find out how many jewels Aaron has:

\[
20 + 5 = 25
\]

So, Aaron has 25 jewels. Next, we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. The problem states that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Therefore, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:

\[
25 - 2 = 23
\]

Thus, Siobhan has 23 jewels. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John makes from selling his lego sets. He has 13 lego sets and sells each for $15.

\[ \text{Total money from lego sets} = 13 \times 15 = 195 \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money John spends on the video games. He buys 8 video games for $20 each.

\[ \text{Total money spent on video games} = 8 \times 20 = 160 \]

Now, we can determine how much money John has left after buying the video games. We know he has $5 left after these purchases.

\[ \text{Money left} = 195 - 160 = 35 \]

Since the problem states that John has $5 left, we can verify the calculation:

\[ 35 + 5 = 40 \]

This confirms that the total money spent and left matches the given information. Since John sold all his lego sets and spent the rest on video games, he does not have any lego sets left.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To find John's speed, we need to determine the total distance he runs and the total time he spends running.

John runs 60 miles a week over 3 days. He runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. So, on the second and third days, he runs 3/2 = 1.5 hours each day.

The total time he spends running in a week is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours (first day)} + 1.5 \text{ hours (second day)} + 1.5 \text{ hours (third day)} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

The total distance he runs in a week is 60 miles. To find his speed, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour.
   - Since skipping is half as fast as running, we can find the running speed by doubling the skipping speed.
   - Running speed = 2 * skipping speed = 2 * 3 miles per hour = 6 miles per hour.

2. **Determine the time spent running and walking:**
   - Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking.
   - Total time = 6 hours.
   - Time spent running = \(\frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2\) hours.
   - Time spent walking = \(\frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4\) hours.

3. **Calculate the distance traveled while running and walking:**
   - Distance traveled while running = running speed * time spent running = 6 miles per hour * 2 hours = 12 miles.
   - Distance traveled while walking = walking speed * time spent walking.
   - Walking speed is four times the walking speed, and since running speed is six miles per hour, walking speed is \(\frac{6}{4} = 1.5\) miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled while walking = 1.5 miles per hour * 4 hours = 6 miles.

4. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = distance traveled while running + distance traveled while walking = 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles.

The final numerical answer is 18 miles."

"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to calculate how many calories are left in your daily calorie target.

Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories. Therefore, the remaining calories you can consume are:
\[ 2000 - 1800 = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories are in one serving of chips. According to the nutritional info, one serving of chips has 250 calories.

To find out how many servings of chips you can consume with the remaining 200 calories, we divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories/serving}} = 0.8 \text{ servings} \]

Since one serving is 300 grams, we can find out how many grams of chips you can eat by multiplying the number of servings by the grams per serving:
\[ 0.8 \text{ servings} \times 300 \text{ grams/serving} = 240 \text{ grams} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ x = 163 \]

Therefore, the number of Post-it notes in the package that she purchased is 163."
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Given that each blue tie costs $40 and he spent a total of $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of each red tie. Since red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, the cost of each red tie is:

\[ \text{Cost per red tie} = \text{Cost per blue tie} + 0.5 \times \text{Cost per blue tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60 \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

Finally, we can find the total amount John spent on ties by adding the total cost of the blue ties and the total cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total spent on ties} = \text{Total cost of blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800 \]

"First, let's calculate the total number of units in the building. The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units. Therefore, the total number of units is:

\[ 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units/floor} = 120 \text{ units} \]

Next, we need to find out how many units are occupied. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is:

\[ 120 \text{ units} \times \frac{3}{4} = 90 \text{ units} \]

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

\[ 120 \text{ units} - 90 \text{ units} = 30 \text{ units} \]

So, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"First, we need to determine how many eggs Lloyd sells per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen and he sells them for $2 per dozen, we can calculate the daily revenue from eggs as follows:

\[ \text{Daily revenue} = \frac{\text{Number of eggs per day}}{\text{Eggs per dozen}} \times \text{Price per dozen} \]
\[ \text{Daily revenue} = \frac{252}{12} \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Daily revenue} = 21 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Daily revenue} = 42 \]

Next, we need to find out how much Lloyd makes in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:

\[ \text{Weekly revenue} = \text{Daily revenue} \times 7 \]

"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, and he removes 30 comic books.

\[ \text{Total weight of comic books} = 30 \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pounds} \]

\[ \text{Total weight of comic books} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we know that Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds in comic books, we can calculate the remaining weight that needs to be removed from the toys.

\[ \text{Remaining weight to be removed} = 15 - 7.5 \]

\[ \text{Remaining weight to be removed} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy.

\[ \text{Number of toys to be removed} = \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} \]

\[ \text{Number of toys to be removed} = 7.5 \times 2 \]

\[ \text{Number of toys to be removed} = 15 \]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 15 \]"

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has.

First, we know that the two house cats, Patchy and Trixie, have had kittens. According to the information provided:
- Patchy has had thrice the number of adopted kittens.
- Trixie has had 12 kittens.

Let's denote the number of adopted kittens as \( x \). Therefore, Patchy has had \( 3x \) kittens.

Given that Trixie has had 12 kittens, we can set up the equation:
\[ 3x = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

So, Patchy has had \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) kittens.

Now, we add the number of adopted kittens to the number of kittens from the house cats:
- Adopted kittens: 7
- Kittens from Patchy: 12
- Kittens from Trixie: 12

Total number of kittens:

   - For 20 years, the total pension amount is:
     \[
     20 \times 50,000 = 1,000,000
     \]

2. **Next 10 years:**
   - Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.
   - The value of the pension at the start of the 21st year is $1,000,000.
   - The annual pension for the next 10 years is 5% of $1,000,000:
     \[
     0.05 \times 1,000,000 = 50,000
     \]

Since Marcy quits after 30 years, she will receive the pension for the next 10 years at the 5% rate. Therefore, her annual pension after 30 years will be $50,000.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
50,000

"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payment into two halves of the year and then sum them up.

1. **First Half of the Year:**
   - The streaming service charges $140 per month.
   - There are 6 months in the first half of the year.
   - Total cost for the first half: \( 140 \times 6 = 840 \) dollars.

2. **Second Half of the Year:**
   - The service charges 10% less than the initial amount.
   - The reduced monthly charge: \( 140 - (140 \times 0.10) = 140 - 14 = 126 \) dollars.
   - There are also 6 months in the second half of the year.
   - Total cost for the second half: \( 126 \times 6 = 756 \) dollars.

3. **Total Cost for the Year:**
   - Sum of the costs for both halves: \( 840 + 756 = 1596 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is **1596** dollars."
"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to calculate how much gas she has left in her tank after her 100-mile trip. Since she needed 4 gallons to refill her 12-gallon tank, she currently has:

\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how many miles she can drive with the 8 gallons of gas she currently has. We know that she drove 100 miles with 4 gallons, so the miles per gallon (mpg) for her car is:

\[ \text{mpg} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

With 8 gallons of gas, she can drive:

\[ 8 \text{ gallons} \times 25 \text{ miles per gallon} = 200 \text{ miles} \]

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the five cell phones before interest:

\[ \text{Total cost of cell phones} = 5 \times \$150 = \$750 \]

Next, we need to calculate the interest on the total cost. The interest rate is 2% per unit:

\[ \text{Interest per unit} = 2\% \times \$150 = 0.02 \times \$150 = \$3 \]

Since Shiela bought five cell phones, the total interest is:

\[ \text{Total interest} = 5 \times \$3 = \$15 \]

Now, we add the total interest to the total cost of the cell phones to get the total installment amount:

\[ \text{Total installment amount} = \$750 + \$15 = \$765 \]

Shiela will pay this amount over 3 months, so we divide the total installment amount by 3 to find the monthly payment:

"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the volume of tomatoes before cooking:**
   - Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces.
   - The tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked.
   - Therefore, the original volume of tomatoes before cooking is twice the volume of the sauce.
   - Original volume of tomatoes = 32 ounces * 2 = 64 ounces.

2. **Determine the number of tomatoes:**
   - Each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes.
   - To find out how many 16-ounce cans are needed to make 64 ounces of tomatoes, we divide the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of one can.
   - Number of 16-ounce cans = 64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans.
   - Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes is:

"Mary initially has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, which totals to:
\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ potted plants} \]

She receives 18 more potted plants from her nursery, so the total number of potted plants she has now is:
\[ 80 + 18 = 98 \text{ potted plants} \]

Tomorrow, she will give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family, which means she will give away:
\[ 40 \text{ potted plants} \]

Therefore, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:
\[ 98 - 40 = 58 \text{ potted plants} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 58 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. So, the second friend pressed the doorbell \(20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25\) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. So, the third friend pressed the doorbell \(60 + 10 = 70\) times.

Now, we can calculate the total number of doorbell rings by summing up the rings from all friends:

\[ \text{Total doorbell rings} = 20 + 25 + 60 + 70 \]

Let's calculate the sum:

\[ 20 + 25 = 45 \]
\[ 45 + 60 = 105 \]
\[ 105 + 70 = 175 \]

So, the total number of doorbell rings is 175.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 175 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of pages Solo needs to read:

- Science: 4 pages
- Social Studies: 20 pages
- History: 7 pages
- Geography: 8 pages

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday. Therefore, the remaining pages he needs to read are:

Remaining pages = Total pages - Pages read on Monday
Remaining pages = 39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read, on average, in one day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days left:

Pages per day = Remaining pages / Number of days left
Pages per day = 24 / 4 = 6 pages

So, Solo needs to read, on average, 6 pages per day."
"To determine how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to break down his water consumption by weekdays and weekends.

John drinks water with each meal on weekdays (Monday through Friday):
- Breakfast
- Lunch
- Dinner
- Before bed

That's 4 glasses of water per day on weekdays.

So, for 5 weekdays:
\[ 4 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ glasses} \]

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), John drinks a soda with dinner instead of water:
- Dinner

That's 1 glass of water per day on weekends.

So, for 2 weekend days:
\[ 1 \text{ glass/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 2 \text{ glasses} \]

Adding the glasses of water from weekdays and weekends:
\[ 20 \text{ glasses} + 2 \text{ glasses} = 22 \text{ glasses} \]

Therefore, the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is 22."
"To determine how many minutes it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance the fog bank needs to cover.
2. Determine the rate at which the fog bank covers the city.
3. Calculate the total time required to cover the entire city.

First, the total distance the fog bank needs to cover is the length of the city, which is 42 miles.

Next, we know that the fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. Therefore, the rate of coverage is:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{3 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

To find out how long it will take to cover 42 miles, we use the rate:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{\frac{3 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} = 42 \times \frac{10}{3} = 140 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the fog bank will take 140 minutes to cover the whole city.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner volume of one box and then multiply it by 3.

The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. The walls are 1 inch thick, so the inner dimensions of each box are:
- Length: 5 inches - 2 * 1 inch = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - 2 * 1 inch = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - 1 inch = 3 inches

The inner volume of one box is:
\[ \text{Inner Volume} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} = 3 \times 4 \times 3 = 36 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume is:
\[ \text{Total Inner Volume} = 3 \times 36 = 108 \text{ cubic inches} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, let's break down the hours he spent watching TV each day:

- Monday and Tuesday: 1 hour each day, so 2 hours in total.
- Thursday: 1 hour for a 1-hour episode and 0.5 hours (30 minutes) for a 30-minute show, so 1.5 hours in total.
- Friday: 2 hours for two 1-hour episodes.

Now, let's calculate the total hours watched from Monday to Friday:
- Monday and Tuesday: 2 hours
- Thursday: 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours

Adding these up: 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. So, the hours he watched on Wednesday is:
7 hours (total) - 5.5 hours (Monday to Friday) = 1.5 hours

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is:
1.5 hours / 0.5 hours per episode = 3 episodes

Therefore, the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday is 3."
"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry meant to bake as \( x \). According to the problem, he actually baked twice as many as he meant to, plus 15 more cookies. This can be expressed as:
\[ x + 15 \]

After baking, he drops 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is:
\[ (x + 15) - 5 = x + 10 \]

We are given that after dropping 5 cookies, he has a total of 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x + 10 = 110 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation by subtracting 10 from both sides:
\[ x = 110 - 10 \]
\[ x = 100 \]

Thus, Henry meant to bake 100 cookies. Since he actually baked twice as many as he meant to, the number of cookies he baked last year is:
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 200 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas without any cashback:

\[ \text{Cost per gallon} = \$3.00 \]

To find the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by both, we divide the total by the number of people (which is 2):
- Average: \(\frac{90}{2} = 45\) roll-ups

The final numerical answer is 45."
"First, let's determine the speed at which Julia rows the boat. It takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Therefore, her speed is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet per second} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes her to row the entire 64 seconds distance to the shore:

\[ \text{Time to row 64 seconds} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds per 20 feet}} = 4 \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. To find out how much water the boat took on during the entire 80 feet row, we can set up a proportion:

\[ \text{Water taken on} = \left( \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 80 \text{ feet} = \frac{2 \times 80}{10} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the leftover lumber Sasha has:

- Ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards at $10 each: \(10 \times 10 = $100\)
- Five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at $16 each: \(5 \times 16 = $80\)

The total cost of the leftover lumber is \(100 + 80 = $180\).

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the leftover lumber:

- Ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards at $15 each (assuming the price has increased by 50% from $10 to $15): \(10 \times 15 = $150\)
- Five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at $24 each (assuming the price has increased by 50% from $16 to $24): \(5 \times 24 = $120\)

The total revenue from selling the leftover lumber is \(150 + 120 = $270\).

Finally, the profit Sasha makes is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = 270 - 180 = $90 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the ratio and the total amount used. The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total number of parts in the ratio is 7 + 13 = 20 parts.

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water. To find out how many teaspoons of sugar she used, we can set up a proportion based on the ratio. The number of teaspoons of sugar used is the ratio part for sugar (7) divided by the total ratio parts (20) times the total amount used (120 teaspoons).

Let's calculate the number of teaspoons of sugar used:

\[
\text{Number of teaspoons of sugar} = \left(\frac{7}{20}\right) \times 120
\]

"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of vehicles initially counted by the customs officer.
2. Calculate the difference between the total number of vehicles after the second day and the initial number of vehicles.
3. Use the difference to find the number of containers imported on the second day.

Initially, the customs officer counted 2 containers, each with 5 vehicles:
\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles/container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

After the second day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. Therefore, the number of vehicles added on the second day is:
\[ 30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles} \]

Since each container has 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of hours the hospital sees patients in a day. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can divide the total minutes per day by 60 to get the number of hours.

\[ \text{Total hours per day} = \frac{500 \text{ patients/day} \times 24 \text{ minutes/patient}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 200 \text{ hours/day} \]

Next, we calculate the revenue generated by the hospital from these visits. The hospital charges $200 per hour for each patient visit.

\[ \text{Revenue per day} = 200 \text{ hours/day} \times 200 \text{ dollars/hour} = 40,000 \text{ dollars/day} \]

Now, we calculate the cost incurred by the hospital. The doctors charge $150 per hour for each patient visit.

\[ \text{Cost per day} = 200 \text{ hours/day} \times 150 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30,000 \text{ dollars/day} \]

Finally, we calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

\[ \text{Profit per day} = 40,000 \text{ dollars/day} - 30,000 \text{ dollars/day} = 10,000 \text{ dollars/day} \]

So, the hospital makes a profit of $10,000 per day from these visits."

- Fred also rode the luge 2 times, so he used \(2 \times 6 = 12\) tickets for the luge.
- Therefore, Fred used a total of \(24 + 12 = 36\) tickets.

Now, let's find the total number of tickets used by both Pam and Fred:

- The total number of tickets used is \(24 + 36 = 60\).

So, the final numerical answer is 60."
"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, let's break down the information given:

- On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.
- On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he did on Monday, which is \(6 \times 4 = 24\) miles.
- The total mileage for Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles.

To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we can subtract the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage:

\[ \text{Miles walked on Wednesday} = \text{Total mileage} - (\text{Miles on Monday} + \text{Miles on Tuesday}) \]

\[ \text{Miles walked on Wednesday} = 41 - (4 + 24) \]

\[ \text{Miles walked on Wednesday} = 41 - 28 \]

\[ \text{Miles walked on Wednesday} = 13 \]

So, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday."
"To calculate the total amount Tom pays in a year for car washes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of car washes Tom gets in a year. Since he gets 4 car washes a month, in a year (which has 12 months), he gets:
   \[
   4 \text{ car washes/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 48 \text{ car washes/year}
   \]

2. Calculate the total cost for the year by multiplying the number of car washes by the cost per car wash. Each car wash costs $15, so:
   \[
   48 \text{ car washes/year} \times 15 \text{ dollars/car wash} = 720 \text{ dollars/year}
   \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 720."
"First, let's determine how many video games Brian has after losing 5 of them. Brian originally has 20 video games, but he lost 5, so:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Now, we know that Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian has. Since Brian now has 15 video games, we calculate 3 times that number:

\[ 3 \times 15 = 45 \]

Then, we subtract 5 from this number to find out how many video games Bobby has:

\[ 45 - 5 = 40 \]

So, Bobby has 40 video games. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 40 \]"
"To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.
2. Calculate the number of female unicorns among the Scottish unicorns.

First, we know there are 27 unicorns in total, and one third of them are in the Scottish Highlands. So, the number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 27 = 9 \]

Next, we know that two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female. Therefore, the number of female Scottish unicorns is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

So, the number of female Scottish unicorns is 6."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the subs:
\[ 2 \text{ subs} \times \$7.50 \text{ per sub} = \$15.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the chips:
\[ 2 \text{ bags of chips} \times \$1.50 \text{ per bag} = \$3.00 \]

Then, let's calculate the cost of the cookies:
\[ 2 \text{ cookies} \times \$1.00 \text{ per cookie} = \$2.00 \]

Now, let's add up the cost of the subs, chips, and cookies:
\[ \$15.00 + \$3.00 + \$2.00 = \$20.00 \]

Next, we need to add the 20% delivery fee. To find the delivery fee, we calculate 20% of the subtotal:
\[ 20\% \times \$20.00 = 0.20 \times \$20.00 = \$4.00 \]

Adding the delivery fee to the subtotal:
\[ \$20.00 + \$4.00 = \$24.00 \]

Finally, we add the $5.00 tip to the total:
\[ \$24.00 + \$5.00 = \$29.00 \]

So, the total cost of Rory's delivery order is:
\[ \$29.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate how many questions Mark completed on each test based on the time he had to complete them.

For the first test:
- Mark had 8 hours to complete the test.
- He completed 5 questions per hour.
- Therefore, the number of questions he completed on the first test is \(8 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ questions/hour} = 40 \text{ questions}\).
- Since the first test had 75 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete is \(75 - 40 = 35 \text{ questions}\).

For the second test:
- Mark had 6 hours to complete the test.
- He completed 5 questions per hour.
- Therefore, the number of questions he completed on the second test is \(6 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ questions/hour} = 30 \text{ questions}\).
- Since the second test had 100 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete is \(100 - 30 = 70 \text{ questions}\).

Now, let's sum up the incomplete questions from both tests:
- Incomplete questions from the first test: 35
- Incomplete questions from the second test: 70
- Total incomplete questions: \(35 + 70 = 105\)

The final numerical answer is:

According to the problem, we have:
\[ P = 4B + 22 \]

Given that there are 12 blue gumballs:
\[ B = 12 \]

Now, substitute \( B \) with 12 in the equation:
\[ P = 4(12) + 22 \]
\[ P = 48 + 22 \]
\[ P = 70 \]

So, the number of pink gumballs is 70."
"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine how many semi-automatic cars there are. We know there are 20 cars in total, 12 of which are automatic and 4 are manual. The rest are semi-automatic.

The number of semi-automatic cars is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = \text{Total cars} - \text{Automatic cars} - \text{Manual cars} \]
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 \]

Next, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total cars}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of the cars that are semi-automatic is 20%."
"Let's denote the number of queens as \( Q \), the number of baby bees as \( B \), and the number of worker bees as \( W \).

According to the problem:
1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so \( W = 2B \).
2. There are twice as many baby bees as queens, so \( B = 2Q \).

The total number of bees is 700, so:
\[ W + B + Q = 700 \]

Substituting \( W = 2B \) and \( B = 2Q \) into the total bees equation:
\[ 2B + B + Q = 700 \]
\[ 3B + Q = 700 \]

Since \( B = 2Q \), we can substitute \( B \) with \( 2Q \) in the equation:
\[ 3(2Q) + Q = 700 \]
\[ 6Q + Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now, we can find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]
\[ W = 2B = 2 \times 200 = 400 \]

Therefore, the number of worker bees is 400."
"Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day. In one week, he would play video games for 2 hours/day * 7 days/week = 14 hours. Since he earns $10 an hour at his part-time job, he would earn 14 hours * $10/hour = $140 in one week if he spent his video game time working instead.

The final numerical answer is $140."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of nonfood items before tax:

- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

Total cost of nonfood items = $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $15

Next, we calculate the tax on the nonfood items. The tax rate is 10%, so the tax amount is:

Tax amount = 10% of $15 = 0.10 * $15 = $1.50

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of nonfood items to get the final cost:

Final cost of nonfood items = $15 + $1.50 = $16.50

The cost of food items (milk, eggs, light bulbs, cups, and roach traps) is already given without tax, so we don't need to add tax to these. The total cost of food items is:

Total cost of food items = $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $15

Finally, we add the total cost of food items to the final cost of nonfood items to get the overall total cost:

Overall total cost = $15 (food items) + $16.50 (nonfood items) = $31.50

So, the final numerical answer is $31.50."

"To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of harvests John can have in a year.
2. Determine the total number of pineapples harvested based on the number of harvests.

First, since John harvests his pineapples every 3 months, we need to find out how many 3-month periods there are in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so:

\[ \text{Number of harvests in a year} = \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests} \]

Next, we know that John has 100 pineapples per hectare and he has 10 hectares of pineapple field. Therefore, the total number of pineapples per harvest is:

\[ \text{Total pineapples per harvest} = 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} \times 10 \text{ hectares} = 1000 \text{ pineapples} \]

Since John can harvest 1000 pineapples per harvest and he can do this 4 times in a year, the total number of pineapples he can harvest in a year is:

\[ \text{Total pineapples in a year} = 1000 \text{ pineapples/harvest} \times 4 \text{ harvests} = 4000 \text{ pineapples} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 4000 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of pieces in each lego set:

3. The third lego set has \(\frac{1}{4}\) the number of pieces as the first one, which means it has \(\frac{1}{4} \times 500 = 125\) pieces.

Now, let's add up all the pieces Johnny has to pick up:

\[500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125\]

So, the total number of lego pieces Johnny picks up is 2125."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Bees leaving the hive in the first 6 hours:**
   Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.

2. **Bees returning in the next 6 hours:**
   Debra sees \(\frac{1}{2}\) of the 30 bees return, which is \(15\) bees.

3. **Bees leaving the hive in the next 6 hours:**
   Debra sees twice as many bees leave as those that left in the first 6 hours. Since 30 bees left in the first 6 hours, twice that number is \(60\) bees.

4. **Bee returns in the last 6 hours:**
   In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left in the first two 6-hour periods return to the hive. The total number of bees that left in the first two 6-hour periods is \(30 + 60 = 90\) bees. Since all of these bees return in the last 6 hours, Debra sees \(90\) bees return in the last 6 hours.

Therefore, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours is \(90\).

So, the total amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier is:
\[ 30 \text{ dollars} \]"
"To find out how many Facebook friends James has, we first need to determine how many friends Dorothy has. We know that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find the number of Dorothy's friends:

\[ \text{Number of Charlie's friends} = 3 \times \text{Number of Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ 12 = 3 \times \text{Number of Dorothy's friends} \]

To find the number of Dorothy's friends, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ \text{Number of Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can determine how many friends James has. We know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Number of James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Number of Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ \text{Number of James's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

So, James has 16 Facebook friends. The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to convert the distance from miles to feet because the speeds are given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance in feet:
\[ 3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet} \]

Tim's distance in feet:
\[ 2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each to travel their respective distances.

Time for Steve to bike home:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

Time for Tim to skateboard home:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

The winner is Steve, who takes 36 minutes to get home. The loser is Tim, who takes 40 minutes to get home. The difference in their travel times is:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the winner (Steve) will be waiting at their house for 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's work backwards from the final number of fries to find out how many were in the pack initially.

1. After the raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries, five fries were left. This means that the five fries represent one third of the fries that were left before the raccoon stole them. Therefore, before the raccoon, there were \(5 \times 3 = 15\) fries.
2. The three pigeons each ate three fries, so they ate a total of \(3 \times 3 = 9\) fries. This means that before the pigeons ate, there were \(15 + 9 = 24\) fries.
3. Dave ate 14 fries, and the seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \(14 / 2 = 7\) fries. This means that before the seagull ate, there were \(24 + 14 + 7 = 45\) fries.
4. The large pack of fries initially had 45 fries.

The final numerical answer is 45."
"To calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly class schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has three 1-hour classes each day. So, the total number of hours he spends on these days is:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ classes/day} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes each day. So, the total number of hours he spends on these days is:
\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ classes/day} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Adding the hours from both sets of days gives the total number of hours he spends on classes each week:

"First, let's convert all the lengths to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll use inches for this problem.

- Each roll is 4 inches long, and Bill bakes 300 rolls. So, the total length of the rolls is:
  \[
  300 \text{ rolls} \times 4 \text{ inches/roll} = 1200 \text{ inches}
  \]

- Each croissant is 6 inches long, and Bill bakes 120 croissants. So, the total length of the croissants is:
  \[
  120 \text{ croissants} \times 6 \text{ inches/croissant} = 720 \text{ inches}
  \]

- Each baguette is 2 feet long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is:
  \[
  2 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 24 \text{ inches}

  Bill bakes 60 baguettes, so the total length of the baguettes is:
  \[
  60 \text{ baguettes} \times 24 \text{ inches/baguette} = 1440 \text{ inches}
  \]

Now, we add up the total lengths of all the baked goods in inches:
\[
1200 \text{ inches} + 720 \text{ inches} + 1440 \text{ inches} = 3360 \text{ inches}
\]

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[
3360 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 280 \text{ feet}
\]

So, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is 280 feet."

   \text{Increase} = 20\% \times 49.7664 = 0.20 \times 49.7664 = 9.95328
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 49.7664 + 9.95328 = 59.71968
   \]

We can see that the price increases by 20% every two months. To generalize, after \( n \) two-month periods, the price will be:
\[
\text{Price after } n \text{ two-month periods} = 20 \times (1.2)^n
\]

Since 36 months is equivalent to 18 two-month periods, we can calculate the price after 18 two-month periods:
\[
\text{Price after 18 two-month periods} = 20 \times (1.2)^{18}
\]

Now, let's calculate \( (1.2)^{18} \):
\[
(1.2)^{18} \approx 10.488
\]

Therefore, the price after 36 months is:
\[
\text{Price after 36 months} = 20 \times 10.488 = 209.76
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{209.76}

"First, let's determine the cost of one red car. According to the information given, one red car costs $4.

Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and an action figure costs $5, the cost of 3 action figures is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]
Therefore, the doll costs $15.

Now, we know the cost of one red car is $4, and the doll costs $15. We need to find the total cost of all the toys:
- Red cars: 5 cars at $4 each = \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \)
- Action figures: 3 figures at $5 each = \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \)
- Doll: $15

Adding these together gives the total cost of all the toys:
\[ 20 + 15 + 15 = 50 \]

So, the total value of all the toys is $50."
"First, we need to determine the missed income if Jackie does her taxes herself. She would lose 3 hours of freelance work, and she earns $35 per hour from freelance work. Therefore, the missed income is calculated as follows:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of hiring an accountant. The accountant charges $90. To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the missed income:

\[ \$105 - \$90 = \$15 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$15 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the computer accessories Elvira bought:

- Screen: €157
- Keyboard and mouse: €74
- Scanner: €102
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Total cost of accessories = €157 + €74 + €102 + €74 + €102 = €509

Elvira's total budget is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost of the accessories from her budget:

Money left for clothing = €1500 - €509 = €991

So, the final numerical answer is €991."
"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit to make 15 Spanish flans, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs needed to make 15 flans.
2. Determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit to gather that many eggs.

First, Sandra needs 3 eggs to make one flan. Therefore, for 15 flans, she needs:
\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, since Sandra receives 9 eggs each time she babysits, we need to find out how many times she needs to babysit to get 45 eggs. This can be calculated by dividing the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she receives per babysitting session:
\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysittings} \]

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit 5 times to gather the necessary eggs to make 15 Spanish flans."
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write:
\[ S = 2B \]

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write:
\[ (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \]

Substituting \( S = 2B \) into the equation, we get:
\[ (B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28 \]
\[ B + 2 + 2B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ 3B + 4 = 28 \]

Subtract 4 from both sides:
\[ 3B = 24 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's current age is 8, we can find Seth's current age using \( S = 2B \):
\[ S = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 16 \]"
"If Ethel has $8, then twice the money Ethel has is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars. Jimmy has $2 more than this amount, so Jimmy has \(16 + 2 = 18\) dollars.

"To calculate the total miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to consider his daily walking distance and the number of days he walks that distance.

From Monday to Friday, he walks 20 miles each day. So, for 5 days, he walks:
\[ 20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles} \]

On Saturday and Sunday, he walks 10 miles each day. So, for 2 days, he walks:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Adding the miles from the weekdays and the weekend days together:
\[ 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total number of miles Pancho walks in a week is 120 miles."
"First, let's determine the cost of each item:

- The cost of the hat is $25.
- The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat, so it is \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.
- The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket. The average is calculated as \(\frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50\) dollars.

Now, to find the total cost of each uniform, we add the cost of the hat, the jacket, and the pants:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \]

So, the total cost of each uniform is $150."
"To find the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to calculate the legs from each group of creatures separately and then sum them up.

For the spiders:
\[ 80 \text{ spiders} \times 8 \text{ legs per spider} = 640 \text{ legs} \]

For the insects:
\[ 90 \text{ insects} \times 6 \text{ legs per insect} = 540 \text{ legs} \]

For the rare mutant invertebrates:
\[ 3 \text{ invertebrates} \times 10 \text{ legs per invertebrate} = 30 \text{ legs} \]

Now, we sum the legs from all the groups:
\[ 640 \text{ legs} + 540 \text{ legs} + 30 \text{ legs} = 1210 \text{ legs} \]

So, the total number of legs Jake sees is:
\[ 1210 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

1. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, we can calculate the total age of the four birds:

- Sally Two: 19 years
- Granny Red: 16 years
- Sally Four: 8 years
- Sally Thirtytwo: 8 years

Total age = \(19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 51\) years.

The final numerical answer is 51."
"First, let's calculate the amount Jessica needs to pay each month if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum.

For the student loans:
Minimum payment = $300
50% more than minimum = $300 * 0.50 = $150
Total payment = $300 + $150 = $450

For the credit card:
Minimum payment = $200
50% more than minimum = $200 * 0.50 = $100
Total payment = $200 + $100 = $300

For the mortgage:
Minimum payment = $500
50% more than minimum = $500 * 0.50 = $250
Total payment = $500 + $250 = $750

Now, let's add up the monthly payments:
Total monthly payment = $450 (student loans) + $300 (credit card) + $750 (mortgage) = $1500

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the total monthly payment by 12:
Total annual payment = $1500 * 12 = $18000

The final numerical answer is:
18000"
"To determine how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel and cut each potato and then multiply by the total number of potatoes.

First, let's calculate the time to peel and cut one potato:
- Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
- Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

Convert the time to peel one potato to seconds for easier calculation:
- 1.5 minutes = 1.5 * 60 seconds = 90 seconds

Now, add the time to peel and cut one potato:
- Total time for one potato = 90 seconds (peeling) + 5 seconds (cutting) = 95 seconds

Next, calculate the total time for 60 potatoes:
- Total time = 95 seconds/potato * 60 potatoes = 5700 seconds

Finally, convert the total time from seconds to minutes:
- 5700 seconds = 5700 / 60 minutes = 95 minutes

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes."
"First, let's determine the total revenue from selling lemonade. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, so the revenue per gallon is:
\[ 20 \text{ glasses/gallon} \times \$0.50/\text{glass} = \$10/\text{gallon} \]

Given that their profit is $25, we can use the profit formula to find the total cost. The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. Let's denote the total cost as \( C \). The total revenue is \( 10 \) dollars per gallon, and they made a profit of \( 25 \) dollars. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} \]
\[ 25 = 10 - C \]
\[ C = 10 - 25 \]
\[ C = -15 \]

This negative value indicates an error in the interpretation. Let's re-evaluate the problem. The total cost \( C \) includes the cost of lemons and sugar. The cost of lemons and sugar per gallon is:
\[ \text{Cost of lemons and sugar per gallon} = \$3 + \$2 = \$5 \]

The profit equation should be:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} \]
\[ 25 = 10 - (5 + \text{Cost of lemons}) \]
\[ 25 = 10 - 5 - \text{Cost of lemons} \]
\[ 25 = 5 - \text{Cost of lemons} \]
\[ \text{Cost of lemons} = 5 - 25 \]
\[ \text{Cost of lemons} = -20 \]

This negative value indicates an error in the interpretation. Let's re-evaluate the problem again. The correct interpretation should be:
\[ 25 = 10 - (5 + \text{Cost of lemons}) \]
\[ 25 = 10 - 5 - \text{Cost of lemons} \]
\[ 25 = 5 - \text{Cost of lemons} \]
\[ \text{Cost of lemons} = 5 - 25 \]
\[ \text{Cost of lemons} = 15 \]

Therefore, the amount they spent on lemons is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we first need to determine the number of Chinese participants. Given that there are 240 Asians in total and 80 of them are Japanese, the number of Chinese participants is:

\[ 240 - 80 = 160 \]

We know that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. Therefore, the number of girls on the Chinese team can be found by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants:

\[ 160 - 60 = 100 \]

So, the number of girls on the Chinese team is 100."
"First, let's calculate how much Zaid spends on rent, car fuel, and the remaining amount after these expenses.

Zaid's monthly salary is 6000$. 

1. Rent: \( \frac{1}{4} \) of his salary.
\[ \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \]

2. Car fuel: \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his salary.
\[ \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \]

3. Total spent on rent and car fuel:
\[ \text{Total spent} = 1500 + 2000 = 3500 \]

4. Remaining amount after rent and car fuel:
\[ \text{Remaining} = 6000 - 3500 = 2500 \]

5. Donation to charity: Half of the remaining amount.
\[ \text{Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \]

6. Remaining amount after donation:
\[ \text{Remaining} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \]

7. Expenses for his daughter and wife:
\[ \text{Expenses for daughter} = 200 \]
\[ \text{Expenses for wife} = 700 \]
\[ \text{Total expenses} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

8. Remaining amount after expenses for daughter and wife:
\[ \text{Remaining} = 1250 - 900 = 350 \]

Therefore, the final amount of money Zaid will still have after all these expenses and donations is 350$."
"First, let's determine the number of crabs each person has:

1. Bo has 40 crabs.
2. Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has \(40 - 4 = 36\) crabs.
3. Rani has ten more crabs than Monic, so Rani has \(36 + 10 = 46\) crabs.

Now, let's calculate the total number of crabs the three have together:

\[
\text{Total crabs} = \text{Bo's crabs} + \text{Monic's crabs} + \text{Rani's crabs} = 40 + 36 + 46

"To calculate Lloyd's earnings for the first two weeks, we need to multiply the number of hours he tutored each week by his hourly rate and then sum the results.

For the first week:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$10 \text{ per hour} = \$50 \]

For the second week:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times \$10 \text{ per hour} = \$80 \]

Adding the earnings from both weeks:
\[ \$50 + \$80 = \$130 \]

So, Lloyd earned a total of \$130 for the first two weeks."
"To determine the number of votes the loser received, we first need to calculate the number of votes the winner received.

The winner received \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total votes. Given that the total number of votes cast was 80, we can calculate the number of votes the winner received as follows:

\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80
\]

\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = 60
\]

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser received is the total number of votes minus the number of votes the winner received:

\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60
\]

\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 20
\]

Thus, the number of votes the loser got is 20."
"Let's denote the number of white carnations Sandra ordered as \( w \).

From the information given:
1. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, so the number of red roses is \( 4w \).
2. Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which are five times the number of white carnations, so \( 5w = 200 \).

First, we solve for \( w \):
\[ 5w = 200 \]
\[ w = \frac{200}{5} \]
\[ w = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of white carnations is 40, we can find the number of red roses:
\[ \text{Number of red roses} = 4w = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find Jean's age, let's break down the information given:

1. Jan's current age is 30.
2. Two years ago, Mark's age was 5 years less than half of Jan's age at that time.

First, let's determine Jan's age two years ago:
\[ \text{Jan's age two years ago} = 30 - 2 = 28 \]

Next, we calculate half of Jan's age two years ago:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 28 = 14 \]

According to the problem, two years ago Mark's age was 5 years less than this value:
\[ \text{Mark's age two years ago} = 14 - 5 = 9 \]

Now, we need to find Mark's current age:
\[ \text{Mark's current age} = 9 + 2 = 11 \]

Jean is two years older than Mark:
\[ \text{Jean's current age} = 11 + 2 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jean is 13 years old.

\[

"First, let's calculate the total time for the faster team to complete the race. Since each member of the faster team runs their leg in 55 seconds, the total time for the race is:

\[ 55 \text{ seconds/runner} \times 4 \text{ runners} = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time for the slower team to complete the race. The first runner takes 60 seconds, the second runner takes 57 seconds (3 seconds faster than the first), the third runner takes 54 seconds (3 seconds faster than the second), and the fourth runner takes 51 seconds (3 seconds faster than the third). The total time for the race is:

\[ 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, to find out how many seconds the faster team will win by, we subtract the total time of the faster team from the total time of the slower team:

\[ 222 \text{ seconds} - 220 \text{ seconds} = 2 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then compare them.

First, let's determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

\[ P(\text{number greater than 3}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Next, let's determine the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:

\[ P(\text{even on first roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll, given that the first roll was even, is also:

\[ P(\text{even on second roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of both events happening (rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll) is the product of the individual probabilities:

\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25 \]

Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. This is the difference in the probabilities divided by the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, expressed as a percentage.

\[ \text{Difference in probabilities} = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 \]

\[ \text{Percentage more likely} = \left( \frac{0.25}{0.25} \right) \times 100\% = 100\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 100 \]"
"If Jenna's mother picked 20 apples, and Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother, then Jenna picked 20 / 2 = 10 apples.

"Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as \( r \).

From the information given:
- There are 3 cages of rats, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is \( 3r \times 6 = 18r \).
- There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \).
- There are 20 pieces of straw distributed among the rabbits.

The total number of pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents is the sum of the pieces of straw given to the rats, the hamsters, and the rabbits. According to the problem, this total is 160 pieces of straw. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 18r + 50 + 20 = 160 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 18r + 70 = 160 \]
\[ 18r = 160 - 70 \]
\[ 18r = 90 \]
\[ r = \frac{90}{18} \]
\[ r = 5 \]

So, the number of rats in each cage is \( 5 \).

"To calculate the amount Mandy should give Benedict after 3 months, we need to consider the initial amount and the monthly interest.

The initial amount Mandy owes is $100. The monthly interest rate is 2%, which can be expressed as a decimal: 0.02.

The interest for the first month is:
\[ 100 \times 0.02 = 2 \]

So, after the first month, the total amount Mandy owes is:
\[ 100 + 2 = 102 \]

For the second month, the interest is:
\[ 102 \times 0.02 = 2.04 \]

So, after the second month, the total amount Mandy owes is:
\[ 102 + 2.04 = 104.04 \]

For the third month, the interest is:
\[ 104.04 \times 0.02 = 2.0808 \]

So, after the third month, the total amount Mandy owes is:
\[ 104.04 + 2.0808 = 106.1208 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent (since currency is typically expressed to the nearest cent), the amount Mandy should give Benedict is:
\[ 106.12 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of bags of wheat as \( n \).

The cost per bag includes the purchase price and the transportation cost:
\[ \text{Cost per bag} = \$20 + \$2 = \$22 \]

The selling price per bag is:
\[ \text{Selling price per bag} = \$30 \]

The total cost for \( n \) bags is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = n \times \$22 \]

The total revenue from selling \( n \) bags is:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = n \times \$30 \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} \]
\[ \$400 = n \times \$30 - n \times \$22 \]
\[ \$400 = n \times (\$30 - \$22) \]
\[ \$400 = n \times \$8 \]
\[ n = \frac{\$400}{\$8} \]
\[ n = 50 \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food:

- The cost of the tickets is $20.25.
- The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, so it is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

Next, we add the cost of the food to the cost of the tickets to get the total cost of the tickets and food:

- Total cost of tickets and food = $20.25 + $15.75 = $36.00.

Now, we add the cost of the rides to the total cost of the tickets and food:

- The cost of the rides is $33 for each ride, and they went on 2 rides, so the total cost for the rides is $33 * 2 = $66.00.
- Total cost including rides = $36.00 + $66.00 = $102.00.

Since they agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:

- Each person's share = $102.00 / 3 = $34.00.

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{34}

"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ten ducks needs per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of insects needed per day for one duck.
2. Multiply the daily amount needed for one duck by the number of ducks in the flock.

First, we know that the total amount of insects needed per week for one duck is 3.5 pounds. There are 7 days in a week, so the amount of insects needed per day for one duck is:
\[ \frac{3.5 \text{ pounds}}{7 \text{ days}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per day} \]

Now, for a flock of ten ducks, the total amount of insects needed per day is:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the net increase in trees each year.
2. Determine the number of trees after 10 years, considering the net increase.
3. Account for the 30% of trees that die after 10 years.

**Step 1: Net increase in trees each year**
Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year.
Net increase = 10 - 2 = 8 trees per year.

**Step 2: Number of trees after 10 years**
Starting with 50 trees, the number of trees after 10 years, considering the net increase, is:
\[ 50 + 8 \times 10 = 50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees} \]

**Step 3: Trees that die after 10 years**
30% of the trees die after 10 years.
Number of trees that die = 30% of 130 = 0.30 * 130 = 39 trees.

**Step 4: Number of trees left after the 30% die**
\[ 130 - 39 = 91 \text{ trees} \]

So, the final number of trees Tom has left after 10 years is 91."

   - These 6 flamingos were painted white and put back out.
   - Therefore, the number of pink flamingos left is \( 18 - 6 = 12 \).
   - The number of white flamingos added is 6.

3. **Placement on Sunday:**
   - Another 18 pink flamingos were added to the yard.
   - The total number of pink flamingos now is \( 12 + 18 = 30 \).
   - The number of white flamingos remains 6.

4. **Comparison on Sunday at Noon:**
   - Number of pink flamingos: 30
   - Number of white flamingos: 6
   - The difference is \( 30 - 6 = 24 \).

Therefore, at noon on Sunday, there were 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the cost of a pencil and an eraser combined. A pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30, so the combined cost is:

\[ 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50 \]

Since a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined, a pen costs $1.50.

Now, to find out how much 8 pens will cost, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8:

\[ 1.50 \times 8 = 12.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 12.00 \]"
"To determine how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we first need to calculate the total amount of carrots that will be distributed to the 40 restaurants.

Each restaurant receives 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. Therefore, the total amount of carrots distributed is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds/restaurant} \times 40 \text{ restaurants} = 80 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of carrots available is 200 pounds. To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we subtract the total amount distributed from the total amount available:
\[ 200 \text{ pounds} - 80 \text{ pounds} = 120 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used is:
\[ 120 \]"

"To find the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now, we need to calculate the number of cards she collected each month and then sum them up.

1. **Initial number of cards**: Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.
2. **First month collection**: She collected three times the number of cards she initially had.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ cards}
   \]
3. **Second month collection**: She collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40 \text{ cards}
   \]
4. **Third month collection**: She collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months.
   \[
   2 \times (60 + 40) = 2 \times 100 = 200 \text{ cards}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the cards collected over the three months to find the total number of cards Elaine has now:
\[
20 \text{ (initial)} + 60 \text{ (first month)} + 40 \text{ (second month)} + 200 \text{ (third month)} = 320 \text{ cards}

"First, let's determine how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher each week. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers and a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B.

Next, we know that Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, the amount Mark earns from Publisher A each week is:
\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays Mark:
\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10 \text{ cents/sentence} \]
Therefore, the amount Mark earns from Publisher B each week is:
\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

To find out how much Mark makes in a week in total, we add the amounts from both publishers:
\[ 2500 \text{ cents} + 5000 \text{ cents} = 7500 \text{ cents} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 7500 \]"

"To calculate John's total earnings for the year after winning the award, we need to consider both the monetary reward and the salary increase.

First, let's calculate the salary increase:
- John's current weekly salary is $2000.
- The raise is 5% of his current salary.
- The raise amount is \( 2000 \times 0.05 = 100 \) dollars per week.

Next, we calculate his new weekly salary after the raise:
- New weekly salary = $2000 + $100 = $2100.

Now, we calculate his total earnings for the year:
- There are 52 weeks in a year.
- His total earnings from the raise over the year = $2100 \times 52.

Additionally, we add the one-time monetary reward of $5000.

Let's calculate the total earnings:
- Total earnings from the raise = $2100 \times 52 = $109,200.
- Total earnings including the one-time reward = $109,200 + $5000 = $114,200.

So, the total amount of money John made that year is $114,200."

"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to break down the problem into parts and sum them up.

1. **Sandwiches for lunch:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 5 days.
   - He used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich.
   - Total slices of cheese for sandwiches = 5 days * 2 slices/day = 10 slices.

2. **Omelets for breakfast:**
   - Carl ate omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week.
   - He used 1 more slice of cheese per omelet than he did per sandwich.
   - Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet.
   - Total slices of cheese for omelets = 3 days * 3 slices/day = 9 slices.

3. **Macaroni and cheese dish:**
   - Carl used 8 slices of cheese for the big dish.

Now, we sum up all the slices of cheese used:
- Total slices of cheese = slices for sandwiches + slices for omelets + slices for macaroni and cheese
- Total slices of cheese = 10 slices + 9 slices + 8 slices = 27 slices.

The final numerical answer is 27."

"To find the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the sum of the first five test scores.
2. Determine the total sum of the six test scores needed to achieve an average of 93.
3. Find the score required on the sixth test by subtracting the sum of the first five test scores from the total sum needed.

First, let's calculate the sum of the first five test scores:
\[ 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 440 \]

Next, we need to find the total sum of the six test scores that would give an average of 93:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total Sum of Six Tests}}{6} = 93 \]
\[ \text{Total Sum of Six Tests} = 93 \times 6 = 558 \]

Now, we can find the score required on the sixth test by subtracting the sum of the first five test scores from the total sum needed:
\[ \text{Score Needed on Sixth Test} = 558 - 440 = 118 \]

Therefore, Brinley needs a score of 118 on her sixth test to get an average of 93.

"To calculate the total kilometers Micheal rode, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first four weeks and the next three weeks.

**First four weeks:**
- Micheal rode at least 5 times a week.
- Each time he rode, he covered 25 kilometers.
- Therefore, in one week, he rode \(5 \times 25 = 125\) kilometers.
- Over four weeks, he rode \(4 \times 125 = 500\) kilometers.

**Next three weeks:**
- Micheal decided to ride 2 times a week.
- Each time he rode, he covered 60 kilometers.
- Therefore, in one week, he rode \(2 \times 60 = 120\) kilometers.
- Over three weeks, he rode \(3 \times 120 = 360\) kilometers.

**Total kilometers:**
- Adding the kilometers from both periods, we get \(500 + 360 = 860\) kilometers.

The total number of kilometers Micheal rode is 860 kilometers."
"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we first need to determine the weight of each candied apple. Given that each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams and each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, we can calculate the weight of each candied apple as follows:

\[ \text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{\text{Weight of each chocolate bar}}{2} = \frac{40 \text{ grams}}{2} = 20 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then sum them up.

\[ \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 \text{ grams} = 1000 \text{ grams} \]
\[ \text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20 \text{ grams} = 1600 \text{ grams} \]

Finally, we add the total weights of the chocolate bars and the candied apples to get the total weight of the bag of candy:

\[ \text{Total weight of the bag of candy} = 1000 \text{ grams} + 1600 \text{ grams} = 2600 \text{ grams} \]

3. **Wednesday**: She bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. So, she bought \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

Now, we sum up the cakes bought over the three days:
- Monday: 4 cakes
- Tuesday: 12 cakes
- Wednesday: 60 cakes

Total cakes = \(4 + 12 + 60 = 76\)

The final numerical answer is 76."
"First, let's determine the cost of half a dozen plates. Since each plate costs $6000, half a dozen plates would cost:

\[ \text{Cost of half a dozen plates} = \frac{6000}{2} = 3000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much twenty dozen cups cost. According to the problem, twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates, which is $3000. Therefore, the cost of twenty dozen cups is:

\[ \text{Cost of twenty dozen cups} = 3000 - 1200 = 1800 \]

Now, we need to find the cost of one cup. Since twenty dozen cups is equal to 240 cups, the cost of one cup is:

\[ \text{Cost of one cup} = \frac{1800}{240} = 7.5 \]

So, the total cost of buying each cup is:

\[ 7.5 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, let's determine how much money Sara earns from babysitting and mowing the lawn:
- Sara earns $5 each time she babysits, and she babysits 4 times, so she earns \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars from babysitting.
- Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, and we need to find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to afford the $70.

Let's denote the number of times Sara needs to mow the lawn as \(x\). The total amount of money Sara will have after mowing the lawn is her initial savings plus the money she earns from babysitting plus the money she earns from mowing the lawn. This can be expressed as:
\[10 + 20 + 4x\]

We need this total to be at least $70, so we set up the inequality:
\[10 + 20 + 4x \geq 70\]
\[30 + 4x \geq 70\]
\[4x \geq 40\]
\[x \geq 10\]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn at least 10 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \). According to the problem, the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day. Additionally, it is given that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which can be expressed as:

\[ w = r + 2 \]

The total number of eggs collected each day can be expressed as:

\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Now, substitute \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation:

\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 8r = 32 \]

Divide both sides by 8:

\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens. To verify, we can calculate the number of white chickens and the total eggs collected:

\[ w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \]

The total number of eggs collected per day:

\[ 3r + 5w = 3(4) + 5(6) = 12 + 30 = 42 \]

The calculations confirm that the solution is correct. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park, as that's the distance he walks. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park are 1.5 miles by 6 miles, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (1.5 + 6) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the distance (15 miles) and speed (3 miles/hour) into the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{15}{3} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park."
"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of customers on the second day.
2. Calculate the total number of customers over the three days.
3. Find the number of customers on the third day by subtracting the total number of customers on the first and second days from the total number of customers over the three days.

First, we know that on the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than on the first day. Therefore, the number of customers on the second day is:
\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \]

Next, we know the total number of customers over the three days is 500. To find the number of customers on the third day, we subtract the number of customers on the first and second days from the total number of customers over the three days:
\[ 500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250 \]

So, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is:
\[ 250 \]"
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons.

From the problem, we know that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Since the pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
Simplifying this equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ B = 2S + 16 \]

Now, we know that the current amount of water in the big pool is four times the current amount of water in the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have two equations:
1. \( B = 2S + 16 \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

We can set these two equations equal to each other:
\[ 2S + 16 = 4S \]
Solving for \( S \):
\[ 16 = 2S \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool currently has 8 gallons of water. Let's verify this by finding the current amount of water in the big pool:
\[ B = 4S = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( 32 - 16 = 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( 8 - 16 = -8 \) gallons, which is not possible, so we need to recheck the consistency. The correct interpretation is that the big pool had \( 32 \) gallons and the small pool had \( 8 \) gallons, and the current amounts are consistent with the problem's conditions.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to make her purchase, we first need to calculate the total cost of the pair of shoes and the matching belt.

Total cost = Cost of shoes + Cost of belt
Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00
Total cost = $352.00

Lori earns $8.00 per hour. To find out how many hours she needs to work, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage.

Hours needed = Total cost / Hourly wage
Hours needed = $352.00 / $8.00
Hours needed = 44

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She promised to return the original $2000 plus an additional 10% of that amount.

The additional amount is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she promised to return is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Janeth is paying $165 per month for 12 months. The total amount she will pay over 12 months is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she promised to return to find her remaining balance:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance by the end of 12 months will be:

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. So, Yuri's score is:
   \[
   \text{Yuri's score} = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44
   \]
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna's score is:
   \[
   \text{Brianna's score} = 68 + 17 = 85

"First, let's calculate the total number of cards James has after the changes:

- Initial fire type cards: 30
- Initial grass type cards: 20
- Initial water type cards: 40

After losing 8 water type cards:
- Water type cards left: 40 - 8 = 32

After buying 14 new grass type cards:
- Grass type cards now: 20 + 14 = 34

Now, the total number of cards James has is:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 34
- Water type: 32

Total number of cards = 30 + 34 + 32 = 96

To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 = 0.3333 \times 100 = 33.33\% \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33%.

The final numerical answer is 33."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the burrito with all the additions and upgrades:

- Base burrito: $6.50
- Extra meat: $2.00
- Extra cheese: $1.00
- Avocado: $1.00
- 2 sauces at $0.25 each: $0.25 * 2 = $0.50

Adding these together:
\[ 6.50 + 2.00 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 0.50 = 11.00 \]

Now, Chad adds an extra $3.00 for chips and a drink:
\[ 11.00 + 3.00 = 14.00 \]

Chad has a gift card worth $5.00, which he uses to reduce the total cost:
\[ 14.00 - 5.00 = 9.00 \]

Therefore, the amount Chad still owes is:
\[ 9.00 \]"
"First, let's determine how many pieces Kalinda and her mom can place together in one minute.

Kalinda places 4 pieces per minute.
Her mom places half as many pieces as Kalinda, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

Together, they can place \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces per minute.

The puzzle has 360 pieces. To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can place together per minute:

\[ \text{Time in minutes} = \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \text{Time in hours} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many watermelons were ready for harvest after the first two months. Since 30% of the 120 watermelons were ready, we calculate:

\[ 0.30 \times 120 = 36 \]

So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest and Ashlyn took them home. This means the number of watermelons remaining after she took the ready ones is:

\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest two weeks later. Since 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready, we calculate:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63 \]

This means 63 watermelons were ready for harvest and Ashlyn took them home. Therefore, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:

\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 21 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the cars before taxes and registration fees. Each car costs $20,000, and Mark buys 12 cars.

\[ \text{Total cost of cars} = 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000 \]

Next, we calculate the tax on the cars. The tax rate is 10%.

\[ \text{Tax on cars} = 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000 \]

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of the cars to get the total cost before registration fees.

\[ \text{Total cost before registration} = 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000 \]

Then, we calculate the total registration fee. Each car has a registration fee of $1,000, and Mark has 12 cars.

\[ \text{Total registration fee} = 12 \times 1,000 = 12,000 \]

Finally, we add the total registration fee to the total cost before registration to get the final amount Mark pays.

\[ \text{Total amount paid} = 264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 276,000 \]"
"On Monday, Robert collects 20 shells. Since Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, Kylie collects 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.

The final numerical answer is 50."
"If there were 50 ants and Dax found half as many bugs as ants, then the number of bugs is:

\[ \text{Number of bugs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of ants} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \]

To find the total number of insects in the garden, we add the number of ants and the number of bugs:

\[ \text{Total number of insects} = \text{Number of ants} + \text{Number of bugs} = 50 + 25 = 75 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 75 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

3. **Penguins that go into the cave**: Another one-third of 36 is also \( \frac{36}{3} = 12 \)

Now, let's find out how many penguins are left:

- **Penguins that jump in the ocean**: 12
- **Penguins that go into the cave**: 12
- **Total penguins that leave**: 12 + 12 = 24
- **Penguins still sunbathing**: 36 - 24 = 12

So, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is **12**."
"To determine how many vines Steve needs, we first need to calculate how many cherry tomatoes he eats per week.

Steve eats 6 cherry tomatoes per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the number of tomatoes he eats in a week is:
\[ 6 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ tomatoes/week} \]

Steve's girlfriend eats half as much as he does, so she eats:
\[ \frac{6 \text{ tomatoes/day}}{2} = 3 \text{ tomatoes/day} \]
Thus, in a week, she eats:
\[ 3 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ tomatoes/week} \]

Together, Steve and his girlfriend eat:
\[ 42 \text{ tomatoes/week} + 21 \text{ tomatoes/week} = 63 \text{ tomatoes/week} \]

Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, the number of vines needed is:
\[ \frac{63 \text{ tomatoes/week}}{3 \text{ tomatoes/vine/week}} = 21 \text{ vines} \]

Therefore, Steve needs 21 vines."
"To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pizza slices needed.
2. Determine how many whole pizzas are required based on the number of slices per pizza.

First, calculate the total number of slices needed:
- John has 20 friends, and each friend will have 4 slices.
- Therefore, the total number of slices needed is \(20 \times 4 = 80\) slices.

Next, determine how many whole pizzas are required:
- Each pizza is sliced into 8 portions.
- To find out how many pizzas are needed, divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza: \(80 \div 8 = 10\).

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the process Ram uses to make new pens from the empty ones. Ram can make one full pen by mixing the ink from five empty pens. This means that for every five empty pens, he gets one new full pen.

Ram initially buys 25 pens. Since he can make one new pen from five empty pens, we can determine how many new pens he can make from the 25 empty pens he has initially:

\[ \text{Number of new pens} = \frac{25}{5} = 5 \]

After making these 5 new pens, Ram will have used up 25 empty pens, and he will have 5 new full pens. Now, he has 5 new full pens, and he can continue the process of making new pens from the empty ones. However, since the question asks for the total number of pens he gets to have, we need to consider the initial 25 pens plus the 5 new pens he made:

\[ \text{Total pens} = 25 + 5 = 30 \]

So, the total number of pens Ram gets to have is:

\[ 30 \]"

"To find the sum of the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa, we first need to determine each of their ages based on the information provided.

1. Jessa's age is given as 20 years.
2. Joan is five years older than Jessa. Therefore, Joan's age is:
   \[
   20 + 5 = 25 \text{ years}
   \]
3. Mary is two years younger than Joan. Therefore, Mary's age is:
   \[
   25 - 2 = 23 \text{ years}

The sum of the ages of the three girls is \(\boxed{68}\)."
"First, let's calculate the number of students who went out through exit A. Since 30% of the students went out through exit A, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Students through exit A} = 1000 \times \frac{30}{100} = 300 \]

After students went through exit A, the remaining number of students is:

\[ \text{Remaining students} = 1000 - 300 = 700 \]

Next, we calculate the number of students who went out through exit B. According to the problem, 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B:

\[ \text{Students through exit B} = 700 \times \frac{3}{5} = 420 \]

The number of students who went out through exit C is the rest of the students after those who went through exits A and B. Therefore, we subtract the number of students who went through exits A and B from the total number of students:

\[ \text{Students through exit C} = 1000 - 300 - 420 = 280 \]

So, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
"To solve this problem, let's start by determining how many candies Robert has. We know that John has twice as many candies as Robert and John has 54 candies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find out how many candies Robert has:

\[ \text{John's candies} = 2 \times \text{Robert's candies} \]
\[ 54 = 2 \times \text{Robert's candies} \]
\[ \text{Robert's candies} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Now that we know Robert has 27 candies, we can determine how many candies James has. We know that James has 6 more candies than Robert:

\[ \text{James's candies} = \text{Robert's candies} + 6 \]
\[ \text{James's candies} = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Next, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's candies} - \text{James's candies} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

So, John has 21 more candies than James. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of pen pals Mike has left after stopping being pen pals with 2 of them. Initially, he had 5 pen pals, so after stopping being pen pals with 2, he has:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals} \]

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each pen pal sends:

\[ 2 \text{ letters/week} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 10 \text{ pages/week} \]

Since there are 3 pen pals, the total number of pages sent by all pen pals in a week is:

\[ 3 \text{ pen pals} \times 10 \text{ pages/pen pal/week} = 30 \text{ pages/week} \]

Mike responds in kind, so he also writes 30 pages a week. He can write a page every 6 minutes, so the total time he spends writing in minutes is:

\[ 30 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 180 \text{ minutes/week} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 3 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"To determine how many minutes Jason has left on his phone plan, we need to calculate the total minutes he has used and subtract that from his plan's total minutes.

First, calculate the total minutes Jason has used:
- Jason uses 15 minutes per day for his boss.
- There are 30 days in the month.

So, the total minutes used for his boss calls is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Additionally, Jason has used 300 extra minutes for other people.

Therefore, the total minutes used in the month is:

3. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Now Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, so Colby took \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. Now Griffin has \(9 - 2 = 7\) fries left.
5. After receiving fries from Ginger, Griffin had 27 fries. So, the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin is \(27 - 7 = 20\).

Therefore, the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin is 20."
"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( F \).

Given:
- There are 4 snails in the first aquarium.
- There are 32 snails in the second aquarium.
- The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in both aquariums.
- Both aquariums have the same number of fish.

First, calculate the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums:
\[ \text{Difference in snails} = 32 - 4 = 28 \]

According to the problem, this difference is twice the number of fish in both aquariums:
\[ 28 = 2 \times (2F) \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]

Now, solve for \( F \):
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} = 7 \]

Therefore, the number of fish in each aquarium is \( 7 \).

"First, let's calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist works for the movie:

- She works 6 hours each day.
- She needs the makeup done 4 times a week.
- The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.

Total hours worked = 6 hours/day * 4 days/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours.

Next, let's calculate the total cost before the discount:

- The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.
- She worked 120 hours.

Total cost before discount = 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000.

Now, let's calculate the discount:

- She gives a 10% discount.

Discount amount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.10 * $30,000 = $3,000.

Finally, let's calculate the total cost after the discount:

Total cost after discount = Total cost before discount - Discount amount = $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000.

So, Jean paid $27,000."

"First, let's determine how many cookies Sue's sister ate each day.

On Monday, her sister ate 5 cookies.

On Tuesday, her sister ate 13 cookies.

Next, we calculate how many cookies Sue ate each day.

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Therefore, Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies on Monday.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Therefore, Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies on Tuesday.

Now, we calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate over the two days.

Sue's total cookies:
- Monday: 20 cookies
- Tuesday: 26 cookies
- Total: \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies

Her sister's total cookies:
- Monday: 5 cookies
- Tuesday: 13 cookies

"First, we need to determine the total length of the redwood tree in feet, which is given as 200 feet.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the entire redwood tree before any damage. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can find the total weight by dividing the total length of the tree by the length of each section and then multiplying by the weight of each section.

\[
\text{Total weight of the tree} = \left(\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}}\right) \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 20 \times 400 = 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to account for the damage caused by the termites. The termites ate 30% of the tree's wood, which means 70% of the tree remains. We calculate the remaining weight as follows:

\[
\text{Remaining weight} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70 = 5600 \text{ pounds}

"Let's denote the number of apples Jamal has as \( J_a \) and the number of bananas Jamal has as \( J_b \).

From the information given:
1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, so if Andrea has 52 apples, then Jamal has \( 52 - 8 = 44 \) apples.
2. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so \( J_b = J_a + 4 \).
3. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so if Jamal has \( J_b \) bananas, then Andrea has \( \frac{J_b}{2} \) bananas. Since Andrea has 52 apples, we can use this to find the number of bananas Jamal has.

First, let's find the number of bananas Jamal has:
\[ J_b = J_a + 4 = 44 + 4 = 48 \]

Now, let's find the number of bananas Andrea has:

"To determine the total amount of flour Carla will need, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she is making and then determine the total amount of flour required based on the given ratio.

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, so the total number of cookies is:
\[ 36 + 30 = 66 \]

We know that 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies. To find out how many cups of flour are needed for 66 cookies, we can set up a proportion based on the given ratio:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{66 \text{ cookies}} \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 66 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} \]
\[ x = \frac{132}{12} \]
\[ x = 11 \]

Therefore, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow."
"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we first need to calculate how many pennies are in the stack.

Given that there are 9,300 pennies in the cup, we calculate two thirds of this amount:

\[
\text{Pennies in the stack} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9300
\]

Let's perform the multiplication:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9300 = 2 \times \frac{9300}{3} = 2 \times 3100 = 6200
\]

So, there are 6,200 pennies in the stack.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, the total dollar amount in the stack is:

\[
\text{Total dollar amount} = 6200 \times 0.01 = 62
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
62

\[ 250 + 20 = 270 \text{ marbles} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 270 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of trees each person has.

Chris has 6 trees.

Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, so:
\[ \text{Number of trees Ferdinand has} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has, so:
\[ \text{Number of trees Harry has} = 2 \times 3 + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11 \]

Now, to find out how many more trees are in Harry's yard than Ferdinand's yard, we subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has:
\[ \text{Difference} = 11 - 3 = 8 \]

So, Harry's yard has 8 more trees than Ferdinand's yard. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"First, let's determine how much money each girl has:

- Carmen has $100.
- Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125.
- Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has $125 + $50 = $175.

Now, let's add up the amounts of money that Carmen, Samantha, and Daisy have combined:

$100 (Carmen) + $125 (Samantha) + $175 (Daisy) = $400.

So, the final numerical answer is 400."
"First, let's calculate the total price of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

The selling price of the house is $350,000.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price:
\[ \text{Brokerage Fee} = 350,000 \times \frac{5}{100} = 350,000 \times 0.05 = 17,500 \]

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price:
\[ \text{Transfer Fee} = 350,000 \times \frac{12}{100} = 350,000 \times 0.12 = 42,000 \]

Now, let's add the brokerage fee and the transfer fee to the selling price to get the total price of the house:
\[ \text{Total Price} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500 \]

Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. To find out how much more the total price of the house is than her budget, we subtract her budget from the total price:
\[ \text{Difference} = 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500 \]

So, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget."
"First, let's calculate the transfer fees. The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Transfer Fees} = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000 \]

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee. The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000 \]

Now, let's calculate the total fees Mr. Tan paid. This includes the transfer fees and the brokerage fee.

\[ \text{Total Fees} = 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000 \]

Mr. Tan also paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount of the house. To find his net proceeds, we subtract the total fees from the selling price and then subtract the loan amount.

\[ \text{Net Proceeds} = 400,000 - 32,000 - 250,000 = 118,000 \]

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is $118,000."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes for the oil to heat up to 400 degrees. We know it takes 20 minutes to heat the oil to 300 degrees, and it then takes 40% longer to heat it to 400 degrees.

40% of 20 minutes is:
\[ 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the additional time needed to heat the oil to 400 degrees is 8 minutes. Therefore, the total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that it takes 5 minutes less time to cook the chicken than it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees. So, the cooking time is:
\[ 28 - 5 = 23 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees and the time it took to cook the chicken:
\[ 28 + 23 = 51 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken is:
\[ 51 \text{ minutes} \]"
"To calculate the total amount spent by the real estate agent on buying all the ads, we need to calculate the cost for the newspaper ads and the television ads separately, and then sum them up.

For the newspaper ads:
Cost per newspaper ad = $5
Number of newspaper ads = 50
Total cost for newspaper ads = $5 * 50 = $250

For the television ads:
Cost per television ad = $75
Number of television ads = 15
Total cost for television ads = $75 * 15 = $1125

Now, we add the total costs for both types of ads:
Total cost = Total cost for newspaper ads + Total cost for television ads
Total cost = $250 + $1125 = $1375

The real estate agent spent $1375 on buying all the ads."

"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and then sum them up.

1. The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
2. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has \(300 + 12 = 312\) M&Ms.
3. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, so it has \(300 / 2 = 150\) M&Ms.

Now, we sum the M&Ms from all three bags:
\[ 300 + 312 + 150 = 762 \]

So, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"To determine the total number of windows in John's houses, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum the results.

1. **Windows in bedrooms:**
   - Each house has 3 bedrooms.
   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.
   - Therefore, the number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is \(3 \text{ bedrooms} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows}\).
   - Since John has 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms of both houses is \(6 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 12 \text{ windows}\).

2. **Additional windows:**
   - Each house has an additional 4 windows not connected to bedrooms.
   - Therefore, the total number of additional windows in one house is 4.
   - For both houses, the total number of additional windows is \(4 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 8 \text{ windows}\).

3. **Total windows:**
   - Adding the windows from the bedrooms and the additional windows gives us the total number of windows.
   - Total windows = windows in bedrooms + additional windows = \(12 + 8 = 20\).

Thus, the total number of windows between the houses is 20."
"To find out the change the cashier gives back, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items the mother bought. The items and their respective costs are:

- Cocoa: $4.20
- Laundry: $9.45
- Pasta: $1.35

First, we add these costs together:

\[ 4.20 + 9.45 + 1.35 \]

Let's add these step by step:

\[ 4.20 + 9.45 = 13.65 \]
\[ 13.65 + 1.35 = 15.00 \]

So, the total cost of the items is $15.00.

The mother pays with $20.00. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:

\[ 20.00 - 15.00 = 5.00 \]

Therefore, the change the cashier gives back is $5.00."
"First, let's determine the number of stitches for each part of the sweater:

- The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
- The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body, which is \( \frac{900}{10} = 90 \) stitches.
- The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is \( 2 \times 90 = 180 \) stitches.

Now, let's add up the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette:

\[ 900 \text{ (body)} + 90 \text{ (collar)} + 180 \text{ (rosette)} = 1170 \text{ stitches} \]

The total number of stitches for the whole sweater is 1800. Therefore, the number of stitches for the two sleeves combined is:

\[ 1800 - 1170 = 630 \text{ stitches} \]

Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches for each sleeve is:

\[ \frac{630}{2} = 315 \text{ stitches} \]

So, each sleeve takes 315 stitches. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 315 \]"

"First, let's calculate the number of lines Sean has to memorize for each part of his role.

1. **Solo Song:**
   The solo song has 54 lines, and Sean has to memorize all of them.
   \[
   \text{Lines for the solo song} = 54
   \]

2. **First Scene:**
   The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song.
   \[
   \text{Lines for the first scene} = 2 \times 54 = 108
   \]
   Only a third of the lines in the first scene are Sean's lines.
   \[
   \text{Sean's lines for the first scene} = \frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36
   \]

3. **Second Scene:**
   The second scene has six more lines than the solo song.
   \[
   \text{Lines for the second scene} = 54 + 6 = 60
   \]
   Four-fifths of the lines in the second scene are Sean's lines.
   \[
   \text{Sean's lines for the second scene} = \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48

"First, let's determine how many cards had the letter A on them. Since 2/5 of the cards had the letter A, we calculate:

\[ \text{Cards with letter A} = \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \]

Next, we find out how many cards are left after removing the cards with the letter A:

\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 80 - 32 = 48 \]

Now, we calculate how many of these remaining cards had the letter B on them. Since 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B, we calculate:

\[ \text{Cards with letter B} = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]

We then find out how many cards are left after removing the cards with the letter B:

\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 48 - 24 = 24 \]

Next, we calculate how many of these remaining cards had the letter C on them. Since 5/8 of the remaining cards had the letter C, we calculate:

\[ \text{Cards with letter C} = \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \]

Finally, we find out how many cards had the letter D on them by subtracting the cards with letters A, B, and C from the total number of cards:

\[ \text{Cards with letter D} = 80 - 32 - 24 - 15 = 11 \]

So, the number of cards that had the letter D on them is:

"To calculate the total time Matthew will take to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we first calculate the time for each type of hole and then sum them up.

For the small holes:
- Time to dig one small hole = 3 minutes
- Number of small holes = 30
- Total time for small holes = 3 minutes/hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes

For the large holes:
- Time to dig one large hole = 10 minutes
- Number of large holes = 15
- Total time for large holes = 10 minutes/hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes

Now, we add the total time for both types of holes:
- Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert the total time from minutes to hours:
- Total time in hours = 240 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours

So, the final numerical answer is 4 hours."
"If the sum of Mico and Marco's current ages is 20, then in 10 years, their ages will each increase by 10 years. Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

\[ 20 + 10 + 10 = 40 \]

The final numerical answer is 40."
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, which translates to \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. This can be written as \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

First, we substitute the expression for \( R \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Next, we expand and simplify the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old. To verify, we can find Ruby's current age:
\[ R = 6S = 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

In 9 years, Sam will be \( 6 + 9 = 15 \) years old, and Ruby will be \( 36 + 9 = 45 \) years old. Checking the condition that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
\[ 45 = 3 \times 15 \]
This is true, so our solution is correct.

"First, let's determine the number of spots a mamba has. Since a cobra has 70 spots and a mamba has half as many spots as a cobra, a mamba has:

\[ \text{Spots per mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and all the mambas. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, so the total number of spots for the cobras is:

\[ \text{Total spots for cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots, so the total number of spots for the mambas is:

\[ \text{Total spots for mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Now, we find the combined total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas:

\[ \text{Total spots combined} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of the total number of spots:

\[ \text{Half the total spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 2450 \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of people who will be eating the pizza.

- There are 12 team members.
- There are 3 coaches.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so \(12 \text{ team members} \times 2 \text{ guests/team member} = 24 \text{ guests}\).

Adding these together, the total number of people is:
\[ 12 \text{ team members} + 3 \text{ coaches} + 24 \text{ guests} = 39 \text{ people} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Each pizza serves 3 people, so we divide the total number of people by the number of people each pizza can serve:
\[ \frac{39 \text{ people}}{3 \text{ people/pizza}} = 13 \text{ pizzas} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Each pizza costs $15, so:
\[ 13 \text{ pizzas} \times 15 \text{ dollars/pizza} = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Maddy will spend \(\boxed{195}\) dollars."
"To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to calculate the total length used by the topaz gemstones and then find out how much space is left for the sterling silver beads.

First, calculate the total length used by the topaz gemstones:
- Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long.
- Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace.
- Therefore, the total length used by the topaz gemstones is \(8 \times 1 = 8\) inches.

Next, determine the remaining length available for the sterling silver beads:
- The total length of the necklace is 25 inches.
- The length used by the topaz gemstones is 8 inches.
- Therefore, the remaining length for the sterling silver beads is \(25 - 8 = 17\) inches.

"To find the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot altogether, we need to calculate the number of stories each wrote in both weeks and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of stories each wrote in the second week:
- Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week and doubled that in the second week, so she wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories in the second week.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week and doubled that in the second week, so he wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories in the second week.
- Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week and doubled that in the second week, so she wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories in the second week.

Next, we sum up the total number of stories written by each of them over the two weeks:
- Alani wrote \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories in total.
- Braylen wrote \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories in total.
- Margot wrote \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories in total.

"To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we first need to calculate the total number of stars accounted for by the rows of 8 and 6 stars, and then subtract that from the total number of stars on the flag.

The total number of stars on the flag is 76. There are three rows of 8 stars and two rows of 6 stars. Let's calculate the number of stars in these rows:

- Three rows of 8 stars: \(3 \times 8 = 24\)
- Two rows of 6 stars: \(2 \times 6 = 12\)

Adding these together gives the total number of stars in the rows of 8 and 6 stars:

\[24 + 12 = 36\]

Now, we subtract the number of stars in these rows from the total number of stars on the flag to find out how many stars are in the rows of 5 stars:

\[76 - 36 = 40\]

Since each row of 5 stars contains 5 stars, we divide the remaining number of stars by 5 to find the number of rows of 5 stars:

Therefore, the number of trucks needed is 3."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, the speed of the car in the slow lane is:

\[ \text{Speed of slow lane car} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it took the car in the fast lane to travel 480 miles. The time taken can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the fast lane:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{fast lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at a constant speed of 30 miles/hour and it is covering the same distance of 480 miles, the time taken by the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance can be calculated as:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{slow lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

"To find out how many medals have been given out for counting, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of medals Izzy has.
2. Calculate the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together.
3. Use the information that this total is 10 times less than the number of medals given out to find the total number of medals given out.

First, let's find out how many medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, we can calculate:

\[ \text{Medals Izzy has} = 22 - 5 = 17 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:

\[ \text{Total medals Ali and Izzy have} = 22 + 17 = 39 \]

According to the problem, this total (39 medals) is 10 times less than the number of medals given out. This means the number of medals given out is 10 times the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have:

\[ \text{Total medals given out} = 39 \times 10 = 390 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Susan works for a total of 3 hours (from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m.), which is equivalent to 180 minutes. She pauses for half an hour, which is 30 minutes, so she actually works for 150 minutes.

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we can calculate her earnings as follows:

\[ \text{Earnings per minute} = \frac{5}{10} = 0.5 \, \text{dollars per minute} \]

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 150 \times 0.5 = 75 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 75."
"First, let's determine the initial points for each player:

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Next, we check if any of the players get an extra point in the fourth round. According to the rules, a player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points.

- Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so Mike gets an extra point.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so Jim does not get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so Tony gets an extra point.

Now, we add the extra points to their initial points:

- Mike's new total is \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
- Jim's new total remains \(18\) points.
- Tony's new total is \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

Finally, we calculate the total points for all three players:

\[22 + 18 + 43 = 83\]

So, the total number of points all three players have after the extra points had been distributed is 83."
"First, let's determine the ages of Will's sons. The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest son is half as old as the oldest, which means the youngest son is 4 years old.

Next, we calculate the number of oranges each son washes. The oldest son washes 8 oranges, and the youngest son washes 4 oranges. Therefore, the total number of oranges washed by both sons is:

\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \]

Will initially bought 15 oranges. After the sons wash 12 oranges, the number of oranges left unwashed is:

\[ 15 - 12 = 3 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"To find the total count of activities Darren did in the two days, we need to calculate the number of each activity he did on both days and then sum them up.

**First Day:**
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

**Second Day:**
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, let's calculate the total for each activity over the two days:

- Total pushups: 100 (first day) + 120 (second day) = 220
- Total squats: 50 (first day) + 40 (second day) = 90
- Total dumbbell presses: 20 (first day) + 40 (second day) = 60

Finally, we sum up all the totals:

- Total activities: 220 (pushups) + 90 (squats) + 60 (dumbbell presses) = 370

The final numerical answer is 370."
"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day by the household.
2. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week by the household.
3. Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

First, let's calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day by the household. There are 5 members, and each consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since they eat rice at lunch and dinner, each person consumes 0.4 kg of rice per day.

Total daily consumption = 5 members * 0.4 kg/member/day = 2 kg/day

Next, we calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week. There are 7 days in a week.

Total weekly consumption = 2 kg/day * 7 days/week = 14 kg/week

Now, we determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

Number of weeks the bag will last = 42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks

The final numerical answer is 3 weeks."
"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target.

First, let's calculate the total crates sold:
- Over the weekend, he sold 20 crates.
- On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.
- On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.
- On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.

Adding these together:
\[ 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 \]

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he did not sell any crates on those days. Therefore, the total crates sold in the week is 65.

Sam's target was to sell 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off by, we subtract the crates he sold from his target:
\[ 120 - 65 = 55 \]

Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week."
"To determine the total cost of the antique desk to Carmen, we need to calculate the bids she placed and the bids of the other bidders.

Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so she bids 3 times. Each of her bids increases by $50. Therefore, her bids are:
1. First bid: $200
2. Second bid: $200 + $50 = $250
3. Third bid: $250 + $50 = $300

The other 3 bidders each bid once, and since they bid in sequence, their bids are:
1. First bidder: $200
2. Second bidder: $200 + $50 = $250
3. Third bidder: $250 + $50 = $300

Carmen wins with her third bid of $300. To find out how much she spent, we sum up all her bids:
$200 + $250 + $300 = $750

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
750"

"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the folding process and the arrangement of the pages.

1. **Folding Process**: When a piece of paper is folded vertically, it creates two layers. Each layer can be used to print two pages, one on the front and one on the back. This means that each piece of paper can be used to print 4 pages (2 pages on the front and 2 pages on the back).

2. **Pages in a 32-page tabloid**: A 32-page tabloid has 32 pages in total.

3. **Calculating the Number of Pieces of Paper**: Since each piece of paper can be used to print 4 pages, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages that can be printed on one piece of paper.

\[
\text{Number of pieces of paper} = \frac{\text{Total number of pages}}{\text{Pages per piece of paper}} = \frac{32}{4} = 8
\]

Therefore, the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid is 8."

"To determine the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of books sold in the first year:**
   - Elise sold 45 books this year.
   - She sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year.
   - Therefore, the number of books sold in the first year is \( 45 \times 2 = 90 \).

2. **Calculate the total number of books sold in the first two years:**
   - Total books sold in the first year: 90
   - Total books sold in the current year: 45
   - Total books sold in the first two years: \( 90 + 45 = 135 \).

3. **Determine the total number of books sold in the three years:**
   - Total books in the collection: 250

"To determine how much money Watson made in April, we need to calculate his earnings from his hourly wage and his weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate Watson's daily earnings:
- Watson works 10 hours a day.
- He earns $10 per hour.

\[ \text{Daily earnings} = 10 \, \text{hours/day} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$100/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate his weekly earnings:
- Watson works 5 days a week.
- He earns $100 per day.

\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 5 \, \text{days/week} \times \$100/\text{day} = \$500/\text{week} \]

Since Watson gets a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well, his total weekly earnings when the company performs well are:

\[ \text{Total weekly earnings} = \$500 + \$300 = \$800/\text{week} \]

Now, let's determine the number of weeks in April:
- April has 30 days.
- Watson works 5 days a week.

\[ \text{Number of weeks in April} = \frac{30 \, \text{days}}{5 \, \text{days/week}} = 6 \, \text{weeks} \]

Finally, we calculate his total earnings for the month of April:

\[ \text{Total earnings for April} = 6 \, \text{weeks} \times \$800/\text{week} = \$4800 \]

"To determine how many people John lost to, we first need to calculate how many people he beat and then subtract that number from the total number of people he arm wrestled.

John beats 80% of the 20 people he arm wrestled. To find out how many people he beat, we calculate 80% of 20:

\[ 0.80 \times 20 = 16 \]

So, John beat 16 people. To find out how many people he lost to, we subtract the number of people he beat from the total number of people he arm wrestled:

\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, the number of people John lost to is 4."
"First, let's determine how many loaves of bread are sold in the morning. Since two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning, we calculate:

\[
\text{Morning sales} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
\]

Next, we find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales:

\[
\text{Loaves left after morning} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
\]

In the afternoon and evening, half of the remaining loaves are sold equally. Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening combined is:

\[
\text{Afternoon and evening sales combined} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
\]

Since the loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[
\text{Afternoon sales} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ loaves}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the savings on the ice cream. The original price of one tub of ice cream is $13, and it is now sold at $11. The discount per tub of ice cream is:

\[ 13 - 11 = 2 \]

So, the savings on one tub of ice cream is $2. Therefore, the savings on two tubs of ice cream is:

\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \]

Next, let's calculate the savings on the milk. The discount on one packet of milk is $0.5. Therefore, the savings on one packet of milk is $0.5. Therefore, the savings on four packets of milk is:

\[ 0.5 \times 4 = 2 \]

Now, we add the savings from the ice cream and the milk to find the total savings:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
6 business suits * $100 each = $600

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
3 suitcases * $50 each = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit:
5 * $100 (cost of one business suit) = $500
$700 more than $500 = $5700
So, the flight ticket costs $5700.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
Cost of business suits: $600
Cost of suitcases: $150
Cost of flight ticket: $5700
Total cost: $600 + $150 + $5700 = $6450

Theo wishes to save $2000 for the trip, so the amount he has spent so far is:
Total cost - Savings = $6450 - $2000 = $4450

Since Theo has $6000 to spend on the trip, the amount he can spend on gifts for his business partners is:
Total amount - Amount spent on other items = $6000 - $4450 = $1550

"To determine the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum up the results.

First, let's identify the number of people in the family and their daily egg consumption:
- There are 5 people in the family.
- 3 people eat 3 eggs each day.
- The remaining 2 people eat 2 eggs each day.

Calculate the daily egg consumption for the 3 people who eat 3 eggs each:
\[ 3 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ eggs/person/day} = 9 \text{ eggs/day} \]

Calculate the daily egg consumption for the 2 people who eat 2 eggs each:
\[ 2 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ eggs/person/day} = 4 \text{ eggs/day} \]

Now, add the daily egg consumption of both groups to find the total daily egg consumption:
\[ 9 \text{ eggs/day} + 4 \text{ eggs/day} = 13 \text{ eggs/day} \]

Next, calculate the total weekly egg consumption by multiplying the daily consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week):
\[ 13 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 91 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Therefore, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old six years ago.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since six years have passed, Noah is now \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age.
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

4. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now.
   - Let \(P\) be the current population of Chile.
   - Therefore, \(60000 = \frac{P}{2}\).
   - Solving for \(P\), we get \(P = 60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

The population of Chile now is 120000."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so it is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players in the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve for \( D \), we first combine the terms on the left side of the equation:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 3D + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{6D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{7D}{2} \]

So the equation becomes:
\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

To isolate \( D \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Then we divide both sides by 7:
\[ D = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

The final numerical answer is:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we account for the people who couldn't come due to illness. This number is 8.

Then, we account for the people who couldn't come due to previous commitments. This number is \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the number of people who couldn't come due to illness, which is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \).

The total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Therefore, the number of people who show up for the party is \(24 - 10 = 14\).

Let \( P \) be the number of electric poles and \( W \) be the number of electric wires. According to the ratio, we have:
\[ \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Given \( W = 45 \), we can substitute this value into the equation:
\[ \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \]

To find \( P \), we can solve the equation by cross-multiplying:
\[ P = \frac{45}{3} \]
\[ P = 15 \]

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

\[

"At the beginning, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 25 + 15 = 40 people at the party.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left, which means 1/4 * 40 = 10 people left.

If 22 men stayed at the party, this means that 22 men + the number of women who stayed = 40 people in total.

Let's denote the number of women who stayed as \( W \). So, we have:
\[ 22 + W = 40 \]

Solving for \( W \):
\[ W = 40 - 22 = 18 \]

Therefore, 18 women are left at the party.

"First, let's determine the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as a book and the book costs $4, the magazine costs:

\[ \text{Cost of magazine} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cost of book} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of the pen. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so:

\[ \text{Cost of pen} = \text{Cost of magazine} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 \]

Therefore, the pen costs $1."
"First, let's determine the total number of pencils Jam has. We know that Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. So, the number of pencils in the boxes is:

\[ 26 - 2 = 24 \]

This means Jam has 24 pencils in boxes and 2 loose pencils, making a total of 26 pencils. Now, we need to find out how many boxes are needed to store all the pencils if we assume each box can hold the same number of pencils as the average number of pencils per box in the given information. Since we don't have the exact number of pencils per box, we can assume that the 24 pencils in the boxes are distributed evenly among the boxes, and we need to find out how many boxes are needed to store 46 pencils for Meg.

If we assume each box can hold the same number of pencils as the average number of pencils per box in the given information, we can calculate the number of boxes needed for Meg's pencils. Since we don't have the exact number of pencils per box, we can use the total number of pencils and the assumption that each box can hold the same number of pencils as the average number of pencils per box in the given information.

Let's assume each box holds 8 pencils (since 24 pencils in 3 boxes means each box holds 8 pencils). Then, the number of boxes needed for Meg's 46 pencils would be:

\[ \lceil \frac{46}{8} \rceil = \lceil 5.75 \rceil = 6 \]

So, Jam needs 3 boxes and Meg needs 6 boxes. Therefore, the total number of boxes needed is:

\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 9 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the weakening of the coffee due to the cooling and the addition of cream.

First, let's determine how many ice cubes Shannon needs to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we can calculate the number of ice cubes required as follows:

\[ \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \]

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:

\[ \text{Total weakening due to ice cubes} = 5 \times 12 \text{ milliliters} = 60 \text{ milliliters} \]

Next, we need to account for the weakening due to the addition of cream. The problem states that any added liquid weakens the coffee. Since Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, this will weaken the coffee by 15 milliliters.

Therefore, the total weakening of the coffee is the sum of the weakening due to the ice cubes and the weakening due to the cream:

\[ \text{Total weakening} = 60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters} \]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream. The final numerical answer is:

"If 5 people leave with 7 new records between them, and each person can trade 2 old records for 1 new record, then the total number of new records traded out is 7. Since each new record traded out requires 2 old records to be traded in, the total number of old records traded in is \(7 \times 2 = 14\).

Therefore, the 5 people brought in 14 old records."
"First, let's determine the number of junior and senior programmers.

Given that the total number of employees is 100 and the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:
\[ \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers is:
\[ \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Next, we know that each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total amount paid to junior programmers per month is:
\[ \text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

The senior programmers are paid $400 more than the junior programmers, so each senior programmer is paid:
\[ \text{Payment to each senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400 \]

Therefore, the total amount paid to senior programmers per month is:
\[ \text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

Finally, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers:
\[ \text{Total payment to all programmers} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 224000 \]"
"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the number of people on the bus becomes \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on, so the number of people on the bus becomes \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).

We are given that there were a total of 20 people on the bus at the third stop. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( 14 \).

The final numerical answer is:
14"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school: \(24 - 2 = 22\) lollipops.
3. He passes 14 lollipops to his friends: \(22 - 14 = 8\) lollipops.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which means he buys \(2 \times 14 = 28\) lollipops: \(8 + 28 = 36\) lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night: \(36 - 3 = 33\) lollipops.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning: \(33 - 2 = 31\) lollipops.

"The phone is currently at 60% charged and needs to reach 100% charged. The recharging rate is 1 percentage point per 3 minutes. To find out how many percentage points are needed to fully charge the phone, we subtract the current charge from 100%:

100% - 60% = 40%

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, it will take:

40% * 3 minutes/percentage point = 120 minutes

To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60:

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

So, the final numerical answer is 2 hours."

"To determine the final amount the customer paid, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip:**
   - The customer spent $80.
   - For every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase.
   - Therefore, the rewards earned from the $80 spent is:
     \[
     \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ rewards}
     \]

2. **Apply the rewards to the current shopping trip:**
   - The customer used their $4 rewards on the current shopping trip.
   - The current shopping trip cost $43.
   - After applying the rewards, the cost becomes:
     \[
     43 - 4 = 39 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Apply the coupon:**
   - The coupon takes off twice the amount of rewards.
   - Since the customer used $4 in rewards, the coupon takes off:
     \[
     2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The final cost after applying the coupon is:
     \[
     39 - 8 = 31 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Therefore, the customer paid \(\boxed{31}\) dollars on this shopping trip."
"First, let's calculate the net pay for Job A.

Job A:
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours per year: 2000
- Total annual income before tax: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- State tax rate: 20%
- State tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net pay for Job A: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Next, let's calculate the net pay for Job B.

Job B:
- Annual income before tax: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax rate on net income: 10%
- Tax on net income: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay for Job B: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, let's find the difference in net pay between the two jobs.

"First, let's calculate the total cost for each offer.

For Furniture United:
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 installments of $350 each

Total cost for Furniture United = Advance payment + (Number of installments * Monthly installment amount)
Total cost for Furniture United = $1,350 + (6 * $350)
Total cost for Furniture United = $1,350 + $2,100
Total cost for Furniture United = $3,450

For Cozy Homes:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 installments of $250 each

Total cost for Cozy Homes = Advance payment + (Number of installments * Monthly installment amount)
Total cost for Cozy Homes = $1,100 + (9 * $250)
Total cost for Cozy Homes = $1,100 + $2,250
Total cost for Cozy Homes = $3,350

Now, let's find the cost difference between the two offers.

Cost difference = Total cost for Furniture United - Total cost for Cozy Homes
Cost difference = $3,450 - $3,350
Cost difference = $100

The cost difference between the two offers is $100."

"To determine the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we can break down the problem into two parts: the sugar needed for the suckers and the sugar needed for the fudge.

First, calculate the sugar needed for the suckers:
- Each batch of suckers requires 30 ounces of sugar.
- Mason needs to make 8 batches of suckers.
- Therefore, the total sugar needed for the suckers is \( 30 \text{ ounces/batch} \times 8 \text{ batches} = 240 \text{ ounces} \).

Next, calculate the sugar needed for the fudge:
- Each batch of fudge requires 70 ounces of sugar.
- Mason needs to make 1 batch of fudge.
- Therefore, the total sugar needed for the fudge is \( 70 \text{ ounces/batch} \times 1 \text{ batch} = 70 \text{ ounces} \).

Now, add the sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge to find the total amount of sugar Mason needs:
- Total sugar needed = sugar for suckers + sugar for fudge
- Total sugar needed = 240 ounces + 70 ounces = 310 ounces.

The final numerical answer is 310 ounces."

"First, let's determine how many hot dogs Thomas ate. Since Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, we can calculate the number of hot dogs Thomas ate as follows:

\[ \text{Thomas's hot dogs} = 3 \times \text{Luke's hot dogs} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Next, we need to find out how many hot dogs John ate. John ate half the amount that Thomas ate, so:

\[ \text{John's hot dogs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Thomas's hot dogs} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \]

Now, to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's hot dogs} - \text{Luke's hot dogs} = 3 - 2 = 1 \]

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The number of students in the smallest group would then be \( x - 10 \).

Given that the total number of students is 200, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two equal groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60."
"Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \) and the number of chickens as \( H \). According to the problem, the total number of animals is 60, and there are twice as many chickens as cows. This gives us the following equations:

\[ H + C = 60 \]
\[ H = 2C \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( C \):

\[ 2C + C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:

\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of legs. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:

\[ \text{Total legs} = (2 \times H) + (4 \times C) = (2 \times 40) + (4 \times 20) = 80 + 80 = 160 \]

So, the total number of legs the animals have is 160."

"To solve this problem, let's first establish the weights of each animal based on the information given:

1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. A pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, so a blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
3. A pink frog weighs the same as a green toad, so a green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
4. A pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, so a yellow snake weighs \(50 + 10 = 60\) pounds.
5. A pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than a red bird, so a red bird weighs \(50 - 20 = 30\) pounds.

Now, let's calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, including the container itself:

- Weight of one pink frog: 50 pounds
- Weight of one blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Weight of one green toad: 50 pounds
- Weight of one yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Weight of one red bird: 30 pounds
- Weight of the container: 20 pounds

"First, let's calculate the daily revenue from tractors:
- They sold 10 tractors a day.
- Each tractor was sold for $100.

So, the daily revenue from tractors is:
\[ 10 \text{ tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate the daily revenue from silos:
- They sell 5 silos a day.
- Each silo is sold for $220.

So, the daily revenue from silos is:
\[ 5 \text{ silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day} \]

Now, we need to find the percentage increase in daily revenue from making silos compared to making tractors:
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New revenue} - \text{Old revenue}}{\text{Old revenue}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\$1100 - \$1000}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{\$100}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

"First, let's calculate the total cost for the mini-golf and go-karts:

- Cost for one round of mini-golf: $5
- Cost for two rides on go-karts: $10 * 2 = $20

So, the total cost for mini-golf and go-karts is $5 + $20 = $25.

Now, we subtract this total cost from the budget to find out how much money is left for arcade tokens and snacks:

- Budgeted amount: $90
- Total cost for mini-golf and go-karts: $25

Money left for arcade tokens and snacks: $90 - $25 = $65.

Morgan wants to have $5 in arcade tokens, so the remaining money after buying arcade tokens is:

- Money left after arcade tokens: $65 - $5 = $60.

This $60 can be used for snacks and other expenses, but the question specifically asks how many friends she can invite. Since the question does not specify how much each friend gets to spend, and assuming the remaining $60 is for snacks and other expenses, we can assume that the number of friends is not directly related to the remaining budget but rather to the $5 in arcade tokens.

Therefore, Morgan can invite as many friends as she wants, as long as she has $5 in arcade tokens for each friend. However, if we are to strictly adhere to the question's format and numerical answer, we can conclude that she can invite as many friends as she wants with the given $5 per friend.

Since the question asks for the number of friends she can invite, and assuming the remaining $60 is for snacks and other expenses, the number of friends she can invite is not limited by the remaining budget but rather by the $5 in arcade tokens per friend. Thus, she can invite an unlimited number of friends, but for the sake of the question's format, we can say she can invite as many friends as she wants with the given $5 per friend.

The final numerical answer, as per the question's format, is:

"First, let's calculate how much Marisa spends on lollipops each day. Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and she buys 4 lollipops each day. So, the cost per day is:

\[ 4 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 100 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, 100 cents is equivalent to 1 dollar. So, Marisa spends $1 each day on lollipops.

Next, we need to determine how much money Marisa saves each day. Since she gets $5 as pocket money every day and spends $1 on lollipops, the amount she saves each day is:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars} - 1 \text{ dollar} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much she saves over 5 days. Since she saves $4 each day, over 5 days she saves:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Billy spent on gumballs. He bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, so the total cost for the gumballs is:

\[ 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Since he spent half of his change on gumballs, the total amount of money he had initially was twice the amount he spent on gumballs:

\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Billy started with $10, so the amount of money he spent on candy is:

\[ 10 - 4 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of the candy is $1.5 per pound. To find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we divide the total amount spent on candy by the cost per pound:

\[ \frac{6}{1.5} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's denote Carver's son's age as \( x \).

According to the problem, Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. This can be expressed as:
\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old."
"First, let's calculate the distance of the entire trip from the first city to the third city and back to the first city.

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city back to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the second and third city trip, which is \(100 - 50 = 50\) miles.

So, the total distance for one complete round trip (first to second, then second to third, and finally third to first) is:
\[75 + 100 + 50 = 225 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[225 \times 3 = 675 \text{ miles}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance traveled in one day by the service interval:
\[18000 \div 675 = 26.6667\]

Since the train cannot go a fraction of a day between services, we round up to the next whole number. Therefore, the train goes between services every 27 days.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed. The collie bed requires the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. A Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds of stuffing and a chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing. The average amount of stuffing for a collie bed is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Average stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we can calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the 4 chihuahua beds and the 3 collie beds:

\[
\text{Total stuffing for chihuahua beds} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]
\[
\text{Total stuffing for collie beds} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Adding these together gives the total amount of stuffing needed:

\[
\text{Total stuffing} = 8 + 15 = 23 \text{ pounds}

"First, let's calculate the time John spent driving to his friend's house. The distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, and he drives at a speed of 70 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time taken to drive to his friend's house is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} = \frac{200 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{200}{70} \text{ hours} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 2.857 \text{ hours} \]

Next, John took a detour that added 10 miles to his trip, making the total distance to his friend's house 210 miles. The time taken for this detour is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{210}{70} \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the time John spent driving back home. The distance home is 240 miles, and he drives at a speed of 80 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{back home}} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = \frac{240}{80} \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, the total time for the trip is the sum of the time taken to drive to his friend's house, the time taken for the detour, and the time taken to drive back home:

\[ \text{Total Time} = \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} + \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} + \text{Time}_{\text{back home}} \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{20}{7} + 3 + 3 \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{20}{7} + 6 \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{20}{7} + \frac{42}{7} \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{62}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 8.857 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time for the trip is:

\[ \frac{62}{7} \text{ hours} \]

Let's convert this to a decimal for a more precise answer:

\[ \frac{62}{7} \approx 8.857 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test, we first need to calculate the total points she has already scored on her first two tests.

Points scored on the first test: 15 points
Points scored on the second test: 18 points

Total points scored on the first two tests: \( 15 + 18 = 33 \) points

Jane needs a total of at least 42 points across all three tests. To find the minimum score she needs on the third test, we subtract the total points she has already scored from the required total:

Minimum points needed on the third test: \( 42 - 33 = 9 \) points

So, the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass is 9 points."
"Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as \( C \). According to the problem, \( C = 3 \).

The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is \( 4C - 5 \). Substituting \( C = 3 \) into this equation, we get:
\[ 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]

The number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is \( 3 \) times the number of shoplifters, which is \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \).

Now, we know the total number of customers and shoplifters and physical violence offenders:
- Customers: \( 3 \)
- Shoplifters: \( 7 \)
- Physical violence offenders: \( 21 \)

The total number of customers, shoplifters, and physical violence offenders is:
\[ 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 \]

- Erin now has three times more points than Sara.

First, calculate the points Erin has now:
\[ \text{Erin's current points} = 3 \times \text{Sara's points} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Erin scored 14 points to reach her current total of 24 points. Therefore, the points Erin had before scoring the 14 points are:
\[ \text{Erin's points before} = \text{Erin's current points} - \text{points scored} = 24 - 14 = 10 \]

"First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. Each picture frame costs $20 and an additional 20% for etching. The total cost per picture frame is:

\[ 20 + (20 \times 0.20) = 20 + 4 = 24 \]

Since there are 44 seniors, the total cost for the picture frames is:

\[ 44 \times 24 = 1056 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the pins. Two seniors will receive pins, and each pin costs $5:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the cords for the officers. One-fourth of the seniors are officers, so:

\[ \frac{44}{4} = 11 \]

Each cord costs $12, so the total cost for the cords is:

\[ 11 \times 12 = 132 \]

Finally, we sum up all the costs:

\[ 1056 + 10 + 132 = 1200 \]

The total amount spent on the senior gifts is:

"To determine the total cost for Ethan if he makes his own hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the savings from the DIY option and then subtract that from the original cost.

The original cost of the wallpaper is $400. The DIY option saves 20% of this cost. First, we calculate 20% of $400:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.20 \times 400 = 80 \]

This means Ethan saves $80 by making his own wallpaper. Therefore, the total cost for Ethan if he makes his own wallpaper is:

\[ 400 - 80 = 320 \]

So, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Friday Sales**: The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.
2. **Saturday Sales**: The store sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday. Therefore, the number of pairs sold on Saturday is:
   \[
   14 \times 2 = 28 \text{ pairs}
   \]
3. **Sunday Sales**: The store sold one-half the number of pairs sold on Saturday. Therefore, the number of pairs sold on Sunday is:

So, the total number of hours Hallie had dance practice in a week is 5 hours."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of pieces of equipment and then calculate the cost of the functioning pieces.

1. Let's denote the total number of pieces of equipment as \( N \).
2. According to the problem, 40% of the total number of pieces were faulty. Therefore, the number of faulty pieces is \( 0.4N \).
3. Consequently, the number of functioning pieces is \( N - 0.4N = 0.6N \).

The total cost of the equipment is $400,000. Since the faulty pieces are returned, the company only pays for the functioning pieces. The cost of the functioning pieces is therefore \( 0.6N \) times the cost per piece. However, since we are not given the cost per piece, we can directly use the proportion of functioning pieces to the total cost.

The cost of the functioning pieces is:
\[ 0.6 \times 400000 = 240000 \]

So, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $240,000.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \text{Remaining pupils} = 40 - 20 = 20 \]

One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green, so we calculate:

\[ \text{Pupils who like green} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

The rest of the pupils like yellow. To find out how many pupils like yellow, we subtract the number of pupils who like green from the remaining pupils:

"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she will have to pay back, including the interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

The formula to calculate the total amount to be paid back is:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} \times (1 + \text{Interest Rate})^{\text{Time}} \]

Given:
- Principal (P) = $3,650
- Interest Rate (r) = 10% = 0.10
- Time (t) = 5 months

Since the interest rate is given as an annual rate, we need to adjust it for the time period. However, for simplicity and since the interest is compounded monthly, we can use the formula for simple interest for this calculation, as the time period is relatively short compared to a full year.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} \times (1 + \text{Interest Rate} \times \text{Time}) \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 \times (1 + 0.10 \times 5) \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 \times (1 + 0.50) \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 \times 1.50 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 5475 \]

Now, to find out how much she has to pay per month, we divide the total amount by the number of months:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{\text{Number of Months}} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{5475}{5} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 1095 \]

So, Karan has to pay $1095 per month."

"First, let's determine the number of silver and gold pesos Anna has.

Axel has 50 silver pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Axel has 80 gold pesos. Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so:
\[ 80 + 40 = 120 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of silver pesos they have together:
\[ 50 \text{ (Axel's silver pesos)} + 100 \text{ (Anna's silver pesos)} = 150 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of gold pesos they have together:

- Each pitcher holds 12 cups.
- She can make 3 pitchers of lemonade.

So, the total number of cups is:
\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups/pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling all the lemonade:

- She sells each cup for $1.
- She has 36 cups.

So, the total revenue is:
\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1/\text{cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to determine the cost of making the lemonade:

- She spent $18 to buy the supplies.

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue:
\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Millie sells all the lemonade, and she sells an average of 4 cups per hour. To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours the lemonade stand is open:

- She sells 4 cups per hour.

So, the profit per hour is:

"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 50\% \times 52 = 0.50 \times 52 = 26 \]

Since the choir is evenly split between boys and girls, the number of boys is also 26.

Next, we need to find out how many female members will perform. Since all female members will perform, the number of female members is:

\[ \text{Number of female members} = 26 \]

On the day of the performance, half of the female members can't make it to the show because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of female members who can't make it is:

\[ \frac{26}{2} = 13 \]

This means the number of female members who can make it to the show is:

\[ 26 - 13 = 13 \]

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many popsicles Betty and Sam each have based on the given ratio and total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. Together, they have a total of 165 popsicles.

First, we find the sum of the parts of the ratio:
\[ 5 + 6 = 11 \]

This means that the total number of popsicles (165) is divided into 11 equal parts. To find the number of popsicles in one part, we divide the total number of popsicles by 11:
\[ \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can find out how many popsicles Betty and Sam have individually:
- Betty has \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \) popsicles.
- Sam has \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 15 \]"
"First, let's calculate the monthly cost of the streaming services after the 20% savings for bundling.

Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 each, so together they cost $20. With a 20% savings, the savings amount is:
\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \]

So, the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus after the savings is:
\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \]

Now, let's add the cost of Netflix, which is $10 a month:
\[ 16 + 10 = 26 \]

Tim's cable package costs $60 a month. Therefore, the amount of money he saves by cancelling his cable package and subscribing to the streaming services is:
\[ 60 - 26 = 34 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 34 \]"
"First, let's convert all the time spent into the same unit. We'll use minutes for this calculation.

- Time spent writing a song: 4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes
- Time spent recording: half of the time spent writing = 240 / 2 = 120 minutes
- Time spent editing: 90 minutes

Now, let's calculate the total work time in minutes:
- Total work time = Time spent writing + Time spent recording + Time spent editing
- Total work time = 240 + 120 + 90 = 450 minutes

Next, we calculate the percentage of the total work time spent editing:
- Percentage spent editing = (Time spent editing / Total work time) * 100
- Percentage spent editing = (90 / 450) * 100 = 0.2 * 100 = 20%

The final numerical answer is 20%."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of books Wendy wants to place in the shelving system.

First, we calculate the total number of slots in the shelving system:
- The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns.

"First, let's determine the number of millipedes. Nancy saw 1/3 as many millipedes as spiders. Since she saw 90 spiders, the number of millipedes is:

\[ \text{Number of millipedes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30 \]

Next, we need to find the number of stink bugs. The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12. Since there are 30 millipedes, the number of stink bugs is:

\[ \text{Number of stink bugs} = 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48 \]

Now, we can find the total number of bugs by adding the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs together:

\[ \text{Total number of bugs} = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168 \]

So, the total number of bugs Nancy counted is:

\[ 168 \]"

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of meat and cheese required and then calculate the cost based on the given prices.

First, let's determine the number of sandwiches needed:
- There are 20 people and each sandwich serves 4 people.
- Therefore, the number of sandwiches required is \( \frac{20}{4} = 5 \) sandwiches.

Next, we calculate the total amount of meat and cheese needed:
- Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.
- For 5 sandwiches, the total meat required is \( 5 \times 1 = 5 \) pounds.
- For 5 sandwiches, the total cheese required is \( 5 \times 1 = 5 \) pounds.

Now, we calculate the cost of the meat and cheese:
- The cost of meat is $7.00 per pound.
- The cost of cheese is $3.00 per pound.
- The total cost for the meat is \( 5 \times 7 = 35 \) dollars.
- The total cost for the cheese is \( 5 \times 3 = 15 \) dollars.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of cannolis**: Allan initially has 40 cannolis.
2. **Corn to cannolis ratio**: There is twice as much corn as cannolis. Therefore, initially, Allan has \(2 \times 40 = 80\) corns.
3. **Cannolis after buying more**: Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new total of cannolis is \(40 + 60 = 100\).
4. **Corn after buying fewer**: Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought, so he bought \(60 - 40 = 20\) fewer corns. Therefore, the new total of corns is \(80 - 20 = 60\).

Now, we need to find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house:

\[
\text{Total} = \text{Number of corns} + \text{Number of cannolis} = 60 + 100 = 160

"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means for every 2 pounds of taffy, Sally pays $3 for the first pound and $1.50 for the second pound (since it's half off).

Sally bought 2 pounds of taffy:
- First pound costs $3.
- Second pound costs $1.50.

So, the total cost for the taffy is:
\[ 3 + 1.50 = 4.50 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells. The seashells cost $1.50 each, and Sally bought 4 seashells:
\[ 4 \times 1.50 = 6.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the magnets. Each magnet costs $0.25, and Sally bought 4 magnets:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1.00 \]

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[ 4.50 \text{ (taffy)} + 6.00 \text{ (seashells)} + 1.00 \text{ (magnets)} = 11.50 \]

Sally's parents gave her $10 to spend. To find out how much money Sally has left, we subtract the total cost from the $10:
\[ 10.00 - 11.50 = -1.50 \]

"Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees as \( A \).

From the problem, we know:
- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples.
- Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
- Joanne's sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
- Joanne's sister doesn't take any apples from the average trees, so she contributes 0 apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is:

"Let's denote the number of camels as \( C \) and the number of dromedaries as \( D \).

From the problem, we have two equations:
1. The total number of heads: \( C + D = 180 \)
2. The total number of humps: \( 2C + D = 304 \)

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, we can express \( C \) in terms of \( D \) from the first equation:
\[ C = 180 - D \]

Next, we substitute \( C \) in the second equation:
\[ 2(180 - D) + D = 304 \]
\[ 360 - 2D + D = 304 \]
\[ 360 - D = 304 \]
\[ -D = 304 - 360 \]
\[ -D = -56 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

To find the number of camels, we substitute \( D = 56 \) back into the first equation:
\[ C + 56 = 180 \]
\[ C = 180 - 56 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

To verify, we check the humps:
\[ 2C + D = 2(124) + 56 = 248 + 56 = 304 \]

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days. He traveled 200 kilometers each day, so:

\[ 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \]

Next, we need to find out how far he traveled in the next two days, which is 30% of the distance he traveled in the first four days. So, we calculate 30% of 800 km:

\[ 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \]

So, the total distance traveled in the first six days is:

\[ 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} = 1040 \text{ km} \]

On the seventh day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance for that day is 0 km. On the eighth day, he traveled 300 km. Now, we can calculate the total distance traveled during the two-week trip by adding the distances from each part of the trip:

\[ 1040 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 300 \text{ km} = 1340 \text{ km} \]

So, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:

"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, which means a total of \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cats were taken away. Therefore, the number of cats remaining on the rock is \(50 - 20 = 30\).

Later, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse they'd seen. The number of cats that ran away is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \). Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is \(30 - 18 = 12\).

The final numerical answer is 12."
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break down the cost into different periods based on the pricing changes.

1. **First 6 months**: The cost is $8 per month.
   \[
   6 \text{ months} \times \$8/\text{month} = \$48
   \]

2. **Next 2 months (months 7 and 8)**: The cost is the normal price of $12 per month.
   \[
   2 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$24
   \]

3. **Next 18 months (months 9 to 26)**: The cost is the increased price of $14 per month.
   \[
   18 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$252
   \]

Now, we sum up the costs for all periods:
\[
\$48 + \$24 + \$252 = \$324
\]

Therefore, the total cost for 2 years of the service is:
\[
\boxed{324}

"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:

\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of both pairs of jeans:

\[ 28 + 22 = 50 \]

Cole saved a total of $6. According to the problem, he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. Let's denote the total savings as \( S \). Since he saved $6 in total, we have:

\[ S = 6 \]

The savings from the jogger jeans is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]

The savings from the tattered jeans is:

\[ 6 - 2 = 4 \]

Now, we need to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. We already know the original cost of the tattered jeans is $28 and the original cost of the jogger jeans is $22. The difference in cost is:

\[ 28 - 22 = 6 \]

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 more than the tattered jeans. The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to sum the capacities of all the vehicles rented.

First, we calculate the capacity of the buses:
\[ 4 \text{ buses} \times 60 \text{ employees per bus} = 240 \text{ employees} \]

Next, we calculate the capacity of the minibusses:
\[ 6 \text{ minibusses} \times 30 \text{ employees per minibus} = 180 \text{ employees} \]

Then, we calculate the capacity of the minivans:
\[ 10 \text{ minivans} \times 15 \text{ employees per minivan} = 150 \text{ employees} \]

Now, we sum the capacities of all the vehicles:
\[ 240 \text{ employees} + 180 \text{ employees} + 150 \text{ employees} = 570 \text{ employees} \]

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is:

"Lillian builds 3 bird feeders herself and buys 3 more, making a total of 6 bird feeders. Each of her bird feeders attracts 20 birds per day. The store-bought bird feeders attract 20 birds each, while her bird feeders attract 10 more birds each, which means they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds per day.

To find the total number of birds she can expect to see each day, we multiply the number of feeders by the number of birds each feeder attracts:

\[ 6 \text{ feeders} \times 30 \text{ birds per feeder} = 180 \text{ birds per day} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 180."
"First, let's determine the cost of the soup. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. The bagel costs $4.

To find 25% of $4:
\[ 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]

So, the soup costs:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Next, we know the cake costs half of the price of the bagel. The bagel costs $4, so:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the dinner by adding the cost of the soup, the bagel, and the cake:
\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \]

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for the dinner she ordered."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of cards Kenny started with. Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( x \).

Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards, so he sells 2/3 of them. The number of cards he sells is \( \frac{2}{3}x \). He sells each card for $1.5, so the total amount of money he earns from selling the cards is \( 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}x = x \).

According to the problem, after selling the cards, Kenny has $50 in spending cash and the remaining $50 to buy the ticket to the amusement park, which costs $100. This means the total amount of money he has after selling the cards is $100. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

"First, let's determine how many hotdogs were prepared initially. The caterer was told to prepare enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs each. There were 36 guests initially, so half of the guests is:

\[ \frac{36}{2} = 18 \]

Each of these 18 guests was supposed to have 2 hotdogs, so the total number of hotdogs prepared was:

\[ 18 \times 2 = 36 \]

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. Since only 36 hotdogs were prepared, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:

\[ 40 - 36 = 4 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Mixing bowls: $20.00
- Utensils: 5 utensils at $5.00 each, so 5 * $5.00 = $25.00

Total cost before discount = $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Now, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost:

Discount amount = 20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount:

Final amount = $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

"First, we need to determine how much gas is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we can calculate the amount of gas per container as follows:

\[ \text{Gas per container} = \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5 \text{ containers}} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Josey needed \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a container, so we calculate the amount of gas she needed:

\[ \text{Gas needed by Josey} = \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so:

\[ \text{Gas needed by Josey in pints} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints per gallon} = \frac{3 \times 8}{4} = \frac{24}{4} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, let's determine how much money George spent on chips. We know he got 3 bags of chips, and each bag costs 40 cents. Therefore, the total cost for the chips is:
\[ 3 \times 40 \text{ cents} = 120 \text{ cents} \]

Since George spent $5, which is 500 cents, and he had 1% of his money left after buying the chips, we can calculate how much money he had left:
\[ 500 \text{ cents} \times 0.01 = 5 \text{ cents} \]

This means the amount of money George spent on chips and candy bars combined is:
\[ 500 \text{ cents} - 5 \text{ cents} = 495 \text{ cents} \]

Since he spent 120 cents on chips, the amount of money he spent on candy bars is:
\[ 495 \text{ cents} - 120 \text{ cents} = 375 \text{ cents} \]

Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so the number of candy bars George bought is:
\[ \frac{375 \text{ cents}}{75 \text{ cents per candy bar}} = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of candy bars George bought is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"

"First, let's determine the amount of onions Antoine uses. The recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, and he doubles that amount:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00 \text{ per pound} = \$8.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box is $2.00:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00 \text{ per box} = \$4.00 \]

Adding the cost of the onions and the beef stock gives us the total cost:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

"First, let's determine the time it takes for Wayne to drive to the theater. According to the information provided, Wayne's drive takes 4 minutes.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes for Bernadette to drive to the theater. The problem states that the drive from Bernadette’s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne’s hotel. Therefore, we calculate Bernadette's drive time as follows:

\[ \text{Bernadette's drive time} = 4 \times \text{Wayne's drive time} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne's drive takes 4 minutes, we need to determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave to ensure she arrives 5 minutes before Wayne.

\[ \text{Time Bernadette should leave earlier} = \text{Wayne's drive time} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 9 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first.

"First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of Billie's room in feet is:
\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area formula for a rectangle, which is:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

Given that the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, we can solve for the width:
\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{width} \]
\[ \text{width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can calculate the perimeter of the rectangle using the perimeter formula:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

"First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven. Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour.

\[ \text{Temperature increase from oven} = 3 \, \text{hours} \times 5 \, \text{degrees/hour} = 15 \, \text{degrees} \]

Next, let's calculate the temperature decrease due to the window. Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.

\[ \text{Temperature decrease from window} = \left(\frac{30 \, \text{minutes}}{10 \, \text{minutes}}\right) \times 2 \, \text{degrees} = 3 \times 2 \, \text{degrees} = 6 \, \text{degrees} \]

Now, let's find the net temperature change by combining the temperature increase and decrease.

\[ \text{Net temperature change} = 15 \, \text{degrees} - 6 \, \text{degrees} = 9 \, \text{degrees} \]

Finally, we add the net temperature change to the initial temperature to find the final temperature.

\[ \text{Final temperature} = 40 \, \text{degrees} + 9 \, \text{degrees} = 49 \, \text{degrees} \]

So, the house's final temperature is 49 degrees."
"First, let's convert all the times to minutes for easier calculation:
- Jon's swim time: 40 minutes
- Jon's bike ride time: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 60 + 20 = 80 minutes
- Jon's run time: 50 minutes

Now, let's calculate James's times:
- James's swim time: Jon's swim time minus 10% of Jon's swim time
  \[
  \text{James's swim time} = 40 - (0.10 \times 40) = 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ minutes}
  \]
- James's bike ride time: Jon's bike ride time plus 5 minutes
  \[
  \text{James's bike ride time} = 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes}
  \]
- James's run time: We need to find this.

The total time for Jon is:
\[
\text{Jon's total time} = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes}
\]

Let James's run time be \( x \) minutes. Then James's total time is:
\[
\text{James's total time} = 36 + 85 + x = 121 + x \text{ minutes}
\]

We know that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[
121 + x = 170 + 10
\]
\[
121 + x = 180

"First, we need to determine how many miles the horse runs. The horse runs at a speed of 32 miles per hour for 30 minutes, which is half an hour. Therefore, the distance the horse runs is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 32 \text{ miles/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of hay the horse eats. For every mile the horse runs, it eats 1/2 a bail of hay. Therefore, for 16 miles, the horse eats:

\[ \text{Hay consumed} = 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail/mile} = 8 \text{ bails} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the hay. Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost for 8 bails is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars/bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which means he has:

\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

"Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as \( P \).

The cost of the super ticket is $20, and it includes one popcorn and one soda for an extra $1. So, the total cost for the super ticket is $20 + $1 = $21.

The cost of buying a movie ticket for $12 and a popcorn and a soda at regular price is $12 + \( P \) + $3 = $15 + \( P \).

According to the problem, you saved $2 by buying the super ticket instead of buying the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda separately. Therefore, the cost of buying the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda separately is $2 more than the cost of the super ticket.

We can set up the equation as follows:
\[ 15 + P = 21 + 2 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[ 15 + P = 23 \]

To find \( P \), we subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:
\[ P = 23 - 15 \]
\[ P = 8 \]

So, the regular price of popcorn is $8.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the initial cost per balloon and then calculate the new cost per balloon after the price increase. Finally, we will use this new cost to find out how much Bentley paid for 170 balloons.

First, let's find the initial cost per balloon. The total cost for 20 balloons was $900. Therefore, the cost per balloon initially is:
\[ \text{Initial cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. So, the new cost per balloon is:

"To find the average speed of the car during the entire trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance for each segment of the trip:
- For the first segment, the car travels at 60 mph for 2 hours. The distance is \(60 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles}\).
- For the second segment, the car travels at 30 mph for 1 hour. The distance is \(30 \text{ mph} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 30 \text{ miles}\).

The total distance traveled is \(120 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 150 \text{ miles}\).

The total time taken for the trip is \(2 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} = 3 \text{ hours}\).

The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time:

So, the car's average speed during the trip is 50 mph."
"First, let's determine the value of the sapphires Jenna has left after the trade. Jenna started with 8 sapphires and traded 3 of them. So, she has 5 sapphires left.

The value of the sapphires Jenna has left is:
\[ 5 \text{ sapphires} \times \$800 \text{ per sapphire} = \$4000 \]

Next, let's calculate the value of the rubies Jenna received from the trade. She traded 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. Since the rubies are worth $1200 each, the total value of the 2 rubies is:

"First, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the raised bed) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

For one raised bed, the volume is:

\[ V = 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:

\[ \text{Total Volume} = 10 \times 32 \, \text{cubic feet} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of Bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet per bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{dollars per bag} = 1920 \, \text{dollars} \]

Thus, the total cost for the potting soil is:

\[ \boxed{1920} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of green cards. We know there are 15 red cards and 60% more green cards than red cards.

The number of green cards is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Number of green cards} = \text{Number of red cards} + 0.60 \times \text{Number of red cards} \]
\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + 0.60 \times 15 \]
\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + 9 \]
\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 24 \]

Next, we calculate the number of yellow cards. The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards:
\[ \text{Number of yellow cards} = \text{Number of red cards} + \text{Number of green cards} \]
\[ \text{Number of yellow cards} = 15 + 24 \]
\[ \text{Number of yellow cards} = 39 \]

Now, we can find the total number of cards by adding the number of red, green, and yellow cards:
\[ \text{Total number of cards} = \text{Number of red cards} + \text{Number of green cards} + \text{Number of yellow cards} \]
\[ \text{Total number of cards} = 15 + 24 + 39 \]
\[ \text{Total number of cards} = 78 \]

The final numerical answer is:

The number of kids allergic to dairy is 9.
The number of kids allergic to peanuts is 6.
The number of kids allergic to both is 3.

Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion, the number of kids allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Allergic to dairy or peanuts} = \text{Allergic to dairy} + \text{Allergic to peanuts} - \text{Allergic to both} \]
\[ \text{Allergic to dairy or peanuts} = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both. Since there are 32 kids in total, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:
\[ \text{Not allergic to anything} = \text{Total kids} - \text{Allergic to dairy or peanuts} \]
\[ \text{Not allergic to anything} = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

2. Calculate one third of the Pomeranian puppies to find the number of girl Pomeranian puppies.

First, we calculate the number of Pomeranian puppies. Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can find the number of Pomeranian puppies by multiplying the total number of puppies by two thirds:

\[
\text{Number of Pomeranian puppies} = \frac{2}{3} \times 27 = 18
\]

Next, we need to find out how many of these Pomeranian puppies are girls. Since one third of the Pomeranian puppies are girls, we calculate one third of 18:

\[
\text{Number of girl Pomeranian puppies} = \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6
\]

Therefore, the number of girl Pomeranian puppies Jana has is 6."

"First, let's calculate the cost of 2 packs of razors without any discounts:

- Each pack costs $4.00.
- Heather buys 2 packs, so the cost before any discounts is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) dollars.

Now, let's apply the buy one get one free offer:

- With the buy one get one free offer, Heather only pays for one razor from each pack.
- Since she buys 2 packs, she only pays for 2 razors.
- The cost for 2 razors at $4.00 per pack is $8.00.

Next, let's apply the $2.00 coupon:

- The total cost after applying the coupon is \(8.00 - 2.00 = 6.00\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the cost per razor:

- Heather buys 2 packs, which contain 4 razors.
- The total cost for 4 razors is $6.00.
- The cost per razor is \(\frac{6.00}{4} = 1.50\) dollars.

Finally, converting the cost per razor to cents:

- 1 dollar = 100 cents.
- Therefore, 1.50 dollars = \(1.50 \times 100 = 150\) cents.

The final numerical answer in cents is:

"First, let's determine the average height of the cheerleaders. There are 9 cheerleaders who are 64 inches tall and 1 cheerleader who is 60 inches tall. The average height can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Average height} = \frac{(9 \times 64) + 60}{10} = \frac{576 + 60}{10} = \frac{636}{10} = 63.6 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total height of the human pyramid. The pyramid has 4 girls on the bottom, 3 on the next level, 2 on the next, and 1 at the top. The heights of the cheerleaders are 64 inches, 64 inches, 64 inches, 64 inches, 60 inches, 64 inches, 64 inches, 64 inches, 64 inches, and 64 inches.

The total height of the pyramid is:

\[ \text{Total height} = 4 \times 64 + 3 \times 64 + 2 \times 64 + 1 \times 60 \]
\[ \text{Total height} = 256 + 192 + 128 + 60 \]
\[ \text{Total height} = 636 \text{ inches} \]

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):

\[ \text{Total height in feet} = \frac{636}{12} = 53 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks, we need to consider the cost of his morning and afternoon rides.

First, let's determine the number of rides he made in one day:
- Morning ride: 1
- Afternoon ride: 1

So, in one day, he made a total of 2 rides.

Next, we calculate the total number of rides he made in 14 days:
- Total rides in 14 days = 14 days * 2 rides/day = 28 rides

Now, we calculate the cost of the morning rides:
- Cost per morning ride: $6
- Total cost for morning rides = 28 rides * $6/ride = $168

Next, we calculate the cost of the afternoon rides:
- Cost per afternoon ride: $2
- Total cost for afternoon rides = 28 rides * $2/ride = $56

Finally, we add the total costs of the morning and afternoon rides to find the total amount spent:

\[ C_2 = 25n + 5n = 30n \]

We need to find the number of guests \( n \) for which the costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5n = 30n \]

Let's solve this equation for \( n \):
\[ 200 = 30n - 5n \]
\[ 200 = 25n \]
\[ n = \frac{200}{25} \]
\[ n = 8 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 8."
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \( D \). According to the problem, Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects. Additionally, David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects. The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides to isolate the term with \( D \):

\[ 4D = 36 \]

Now, divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( D \):

\[ D = 9 \]

Since Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects, we substitute \( D = 9 \) into the expression:

\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Therefore, Lily found 16 insects. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the width of the rug. Since the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair and the chair is 3 feet wide, the rug's width is:

\[ \text{Rug's width} = \text{Chair's width} + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the length of the couch. The problem states that the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Since the rug's width is 8 feet, twice the width of the rug is:

\[ 2 \times \text{Rug's width} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ feet} \]

Adding 2 feet to this value gives us the length of the couch:

\[ \text{Couch's length} = 16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet} \]

So, the length of the couch is 18 feet."
"Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( S \). Suzie bought four packs of gum in total, with two packs being strawberry gum. Therefore, the cost of the strawberry gum is \( 2S \).

She also bought one pack of grape gum, which cost $2. She bought one pack of green apple gum, which cost half as much as the grape gum, so it cost $1.

The total cost of the gum is given as $7. We can set up the following equation to represent the total cost:

\[ 2S + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2S + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:

\[ 2S = 4 \]

"To determine how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we start by understanding the relationship between the quantities bought by Sophia and Rose. According to the problem, Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.

Given:
- Rose bought 12 onions.
- Rose bought 4 potatoes.

Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as \( S_o \) and the number of potatoes Sophia bought as \( S_p \).

From the problem, we know:
\[ 4 \times (S_o + S_p) = 12 + 4 \]

First, we calculate the total number of onions and potatoes Rose bought:
\[ 12 + 4 = 16 \]

Now, we set up the equation:
\[ 4 \times (S_o + S_p) = 16 \]

To find \( S_o + S_p \), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, the house cost three times as much as the lot, so we can write:

\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]

Combining like terms, we have:

\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

To find \( L \), we divide both sides by 4:

\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000 \]

Now that we know the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):

"First, we need to determine how many rows of red tulips Jackson can plant. He has 36 red tulips and can fit 6 red tulips in a row. So, the number of rows of red tulips is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Number of rows of red tulips} = \frac{36 \text{ red tulips}}{6 \text{ red tulips/row}} = 6 \text{ rows} \]

Next, we need to determine how many rows of blue tulips Jackson can plant. He has 24 blue tulips and can fit 8 blue tulips in a row. So, the number of rows of blue tulips is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Number of rows of blue tulips} = \frac{24 \text{ blue tulips}}{8 \text{ blue tulips/row}} = 3 \text{ rows} \]

To find the total number of rows of flowers Jackson will plant, we add the number of rows of red tulips and the number of rows of blue tulips:

\[ \text{Total number of rows} = 6 \text{ rows of red tulips} + 3 \text{ rows of blue tulips} = 9 \text{ rows} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 9 \]"
"To determine how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we first need to find out how many cups of raisins she has available for making the cookies. Since she divides the bag of raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix, each item will get:

\[ \frac{27 \text{ cups}}{3} = 9 \text{ cups} \]

Each batch of oatmeal cookies requires \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a cup of raisins. To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies she can make with 9 cups of raisins, we divide the total amount of raisins available for the cookies by the amount needed per batch:

\[ 9 \div \frac{3}{4} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 12 \]

Therefore, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"First, let's calculate Ada's daily electric consumption before and after adding the new device.

**Before adding the new device:**
- Daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour
- Daily cost: 12 * $1.50 = $18.00

**After adding the new device:**
- Daily consumption: 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour
- Daily cost: 14 * $1.50 = $21.00

Next, we calculate the weekly cost for both scenarios.

**Weekly cost before adding the new device:**
- Weekly consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 84 kilowatt-hours
- Weekly cost: 84 * $1.50 = $126.00

**Weekly cost after adding the new device:**
- Weekly consumption: 14 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 98 kilowatt-hours
- Weekly cost: 98 * $1.50 = $147.00

Finally, we find the difference between the weekly electric bills before and after adding the new device.

**Difference in weekly electric bill:**
- Difference: $147.00 - $126.00 = $21.00

The difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is $21.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which the people can paint the house and then scale it up for 5 people.

First, let's find out how much one person can paint in one day. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then in one day, one person can paint:

\[
\frac{1/2 \text{ house}}{5 \text{ days}} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ house per day}
\]

This means that one person can paint \(\frac{1}{10}\) of a house in one day. Therefore, in one day, 5 people can paint:

\[
5 \times \frac{1}{10} \text{ house per day} = \frac{5}{10} \text{ house per day} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ house per day}
\]

So, 5 people can paint half a house in one day. To paint a whole house, it would take:

\[
\frac{1 \text{ house}}{\frac{1}{2} \text{ house per day}} = 2 \text{ days}
\]

Since we need the answer in hours, and there are 24 hours in a day, it would take:

\[
2 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 48 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
48

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ophelia has 20 sofas.
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. Therefore, Ophelia has \(20 + 2 = 22\) chairs.
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. Therefore, Jenna has \(3 \times 22 = 66\) chairs.
4. Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, Ophelia also has 22 sofas (as calculated earlier).
5. Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so Jenna has \(66 - 2 = 64\) sofas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have together:

- Ophelia's total: \(20\) sofas + \(22\) chairs = \(42\)
- Jenna's total: \(64\) sofas + \(66\) chairs = \(130\)

Adding their totals together:

\[42 + 130 = 172\]

The final numerical answer is 172."
"To determine how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had not purchased the headphone set, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of the headphone set.
2. Determine the amount of money Tom would have had if he did not buy the headphone set.
3. Calculate how many CDs he could have bought with that amount of money.

First, we know that Tom paid $48 in total and that the CD cost $4. Therefore, the cost of the headphone set is:
\[ 48 - 4 = 44 \]

If Tom had not bought the headphone set, he would have had:
\[ 48 - 44 = 4 \]

With $4, Tom could buy:
\[ \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

So, Tom would have been able to buy 1 more CD if he had not bought the headphone set. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1 \]"
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we need to account for the hours he worked out each week, including the exceptions.

First, let's calculate the total hours for the weeks where he worked out 4 hours each week:
\[ 4 \text{ hours/week} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 24 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we add the hours for the two weeks where he worked out 5 hours each week:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

Then, we add the hours for the week where he worked out 6 hours:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/week} \times 1 \text{ week} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we sum all these hours together:
\[ 24 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:
\[ 40 \]"
"Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 people get off. Then, 5 times as many people as those who got off get on. So, \(5 \times 8 = 40\) people get on the bus. The number of people on the bus after the first stop is:
\[48 - 8 + 40 = 80\]

At the second stop, 21 people get off. Then, 3 times fewer people get on compared to those who got off. So, \(21 / 3 = 7\) people get on the bus. The number of people on the bus after the second stop is:
\[80 - 21 + 7 = 66\]

The final numerical answer is 66."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, Jame's current age is \( 27 - 5 = 22 \) years.

2. **Determine the cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 22 + 8 = 30 \) years old.
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \).
   - Therefore, Jame's cousin will be \( 60 - 5 = 55 \) years old in 8 years.

3. **Determine the cousin's current age:**
   - If Jame's cousin will be 55 in 8 years, then the cousin's current age is \( 55 - 8 = 47 \) years.

4. **Determine the age difference between Jame and his cousin:**
   - Jame is currently 22 years old.
   - Jame's cousin is currently 47 years old.

"Let's break down the information given:

- The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400.
- The computer costs $1,100.
- The printer costs $400 less than the computer, so the printer costs $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the computer and the printer:
- Cost of the computer: $1,100
- Cost of the printer: $700
- Total cost of the computer and the printer: $1,100 + $700 = $1,800

Since the total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400, we can find the total cost of the 2 monitors by subtracting the total cost of the computer and the printer from the total cost:
- Total cost of the computer and the printer: $1,800
- Total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer: $2,400
- Total cost of the 2 monitors: $2,400 - $1,800 = $600

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the total cost of the 2 monitors by 2:
- Total cost of the 2 monitors: $600
- Cost of one monitor: $600 / 2 = $300

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is $300."
"To find out how many seashells each girl brought, we first need to determine the number of boys and girls. Since there are twenty kids in total and they are divided into two equal groups, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

Each boy brought back 60 seashells. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is:
\[ 10 \text{ boys} \times 60 \text{ seashells/boy} = 600 \text{ seashells} \]

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. So, the total number of seashells brought by the girls is:
\[ 600 \text{ seashells} + 4 \times 600 \text{ seashells} = 600 \text{ seashells} + 2400 \text{ seashells} = 3000 \text{ seashells} \]

Since there are 10 girls, the number of seashells each girl brought is:
\[ \frac{3000 \text{ seashells}}{10 \text{ girls}} = 300 \text{ seashells/girl} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 300 \]"
"If George has 3 candies left after eating 5, it means George originally had 3 + 5 = 8 candies.

"First, let's determine Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, we can calculate Alyana's age as follows:

Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4
Alyana's age = 10 - 4
Alyana's age = 6

Next, we need to find Anne's age. Since Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, we can calculate Anne's age as follows:

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2
Anne's age = 6 + 2
Anne's age = 8

Therefore, Anne is 8 years old."
"To find the total thickness of the four books, let's calculate the thickness of each book step by step:

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so it is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm thick.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm thick.

Now, let's add the thicknesses of all four books together:

\[31 + 50 + 45 + 62\]

First, add 31 and 50:

\[31 + 50 = 81\]

Next, add 45 to the result:

\[81 + 45 = 126\]

Finally, add 62 to the result:

\[126 + 62 = 188\]

So, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and use the information given.

First, let's determine the total number of days in April. April has 30 days.

Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half of the month as he does in the first half. This means the second half of the month will have 15 days (half of 30 days).

Let's denote the amount Elvis saves daily in the first half of the month as \( x \). Therefore, the amount he saves daily in the second half of the month will be \( 2x \).

The total savings for the first half of the month will be:
\[ 15x \]

The total savings for the second half of the month will be:
\[ 15 \times 2x = 30x \]

The total savings for the entire month will be the sum of the savings from the first and second halves:
\[ 15x + 30x = 45x \]

We know that Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 45:
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \]

So, Elvis saves $25 daily in the first half of the month. For the second half of the month, he saves:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save $50 for each day in the second half of the month.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 50 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the apples:
- Verna bought 3 apples at $1.50 each.
- Total cost for apples = 3 * $1.50 = $4.50

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the oranges:
- Verna bought 5 oranges at $0.80 each.
- Total cost for oranges = 5 * $0.80 = $4.00

Then, let's calculate the total cost of the peaches:
- Verna bought 6 peaches at $0.75 each.
- Total cost for peaches = 6 * $0.75 = $4.50

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the fruits:
- Total cost = Cost of apples + Cost of oranges + Cost of peaches
- Total cost = $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

Verna gave $20 to the seller. To find out the change she received, we subtract the total cost of the fruits from the amount she gave:
- Change = Amount given - Total cost
- Change = $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

The final numerical answer is $7.00."

\[ 0.5 \times 20 = 10 \]

Now, to find out how much more Jairus earns than Jenny, we subtract Jenny's earnings from Jairus's earnings:

\[ 16 - 10 = 6 \]

So, Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars. The total amount of money is $100, so we can write the equation:

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets $20. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's amount as follows:

\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets $80. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 80 \]"

"To determine the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Rewriting**: Elise writes the entire alphabet twice.
   - The alphabet has 26 letters.
   - Therefore, writing it twice means \(26 \times 2 = 52\) letters.

2. **Second Rewriting**: Elise writes half of the alphabet once.
   - Half of the alphabet is \(26 / 2 = 13\) letters.
   - Therefore, writing half of the alphabet once means \(13\) letters.

3. **Third Rewriting**: Elise rewrites everything she has already written.
   - This includes the two full alphabets and the half alphabet.
   - The total number of letters already written is \(52 + 13 = 65\).
   - Rewriting everything means writing \(65\) letters again.

Now, we sum up all the letters written:
- First rewriting: \(52\) letters.
- Second rewriting: \(13\) letters.
- Third rewriting: \(65\) letters.

Adding these together:
\[ 52 + 13 + 65 = 130 \]

Therefore, the total number of letters Elise has written is:

"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break down the commission structure:

1. For the first $1000 of sales, she earns a 30% commission.
2. For sales over $1000, she earns an additional 10% commission on the amount over $1000.

First, let's calculate the commission for the first $1000:
\[ \text{Commission for first } \$1000 = 1000 \times 0.30 = \$300 \]

Next, we calculate the additional commission for the sales over $1000. Antonella sold $2500 worth of goods, so the amount over $1000 is:
\[ 2500 - 1000 = \$1500 \]

The additional commission for the $1500 is:
\[ \text{Additional commission} = 1500 \times 0.10 = \$150 \]

Now, we add the two commissions together to find the total commission:
\[ \text{Total commission} = 300 + 150 = \$450 \]

"First, let's determine how long it takes Ray to swim a mile when the water is warm.

Given:
- When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.
- When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold.

Let's calculate the time it takes to swim a mile in warm water:
- Twice the time it takes in cold water is \(2 \times 16 = 32\) minutes.
- Adding 2 minutes to this gives \(32 + 2 = 34\) minutes.

So, it takes Ray 34 minutes to swim a mile in warm water.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water:
- In cold water, it takes \(16 \times 3 = 48\) minutes to swim 3 miles.
- In warm water, it takes \(34 \times 3 = 102\) minutes to swim 3 miles.

Finally, to find out how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day compared to a cold day, we subtract the time taken in cold water from the time taken in warm water:
- The difference is \(102 - 48 = 54\) minutes.

Therefore, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day."
"First, let's calculate how much John earns in a day. He earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day, so his daily earnings are:

The rest of the buttons have 4 holes each. Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 of them have 2 holes, the number of buttons with 4 holes is:
\[ 21 - 7 = 14 \text{ buttons} \]

The number of holes in these 14 buttons is:
\[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \text{ holes} \]

Now, we add the holes from both types of buttons to get the total number of holes:
\[ 14 + 56 = 70 \text{ holes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 70 \]"
"First, let's determine the volume of Zack's locker. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can calculate the volume of Zack's locker as follows:

\[ \text{Volume of Zack's locker} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Volume of Timothy's locker} \]

Given that Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches, we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[ \text{Volume of Zack's locker} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 = 12 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we need to find the volume of Peter's locker. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, so we can calculate the volume of Peter's locker as follows:

\[ \text{Volume of Peter's locker} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Volume of Zack's locker} \]

Substituting the volume of Zack's locker into the equation:

\[ \text{Volume of Peter's locker} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, the volume of Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches."
"First, let's determine the daily recommended cups of coffee for Octavia. Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, if the daily recommended cups of coffee is \( R \), then Octavia drinks \( \frac{R}{2} \) cups of coffee.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks. Therefore, Juan drinks \( 10 \times \frac{R}{2} = 5R \) cups of coffee.

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. This means Juan needs to reduce his coffee intake from \( 5R \) cups to 4 cups.

To find out by how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we calculate the difference between his current intake and the recommended intake:

\[ 5R - 4 \]

Since the daily recommended cups of coffee for Octavia is \( R \), and Juan's current intake is \( 5R \), we need to express the reduction in terms of the daily recommended cups. The reduction in cups is:

\[ 5R - 4 \]

However, without the specific value of \( R \), we can't simplify this further numerically. But the problem asks for the reduction in terms of the daily recommended cups, which is \( 5R - 4 \).

Given the problem's context and the need for a numerical answer, we assume \( R = 4 \) (since 4 cups is the recommended intake for Octavia, and Juan drinks 10 times that amount):

\[ 5 \times 4 - 4 = 20 - 4 = 16 \]

Therefore, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups.

The final numerical answer is:
16"
"To find the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then add them together.

For the hamsters:
3 cages * 10 hamsters per cage = 30 hamsters

For the guinea pigs:
3 cages * 5 guinea pigs per cage = 15 guinea pigs

Now, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs together:
30 hamsters + 15 guinea pigs = 45 rodents

The final numerical answer is 45."
"First, let's determine the weights of Susan and Bob.

Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark. Since Mark weighs 150 pounds, Susan's weight is:
\[ 150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds} \]

Bob weighs twice as much as Susan. Since Susan weighs 130 pounds, Bob's weight is:
\[ 2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we can find the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob. The average weight is calculated by summing their weights and dividing by the number of friends (which is 3).

The total weight of the three friends is:
\[ 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

The average weight is:
\[ \frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the angle the sun makes with the ground after moving for 10 hours.

Initially, the sun is at the tip of the pyramid, which is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground. The sun moves upward at a rate of 5 degrees per hour. Over 10 hours, the sun will move upward by:

\[ 5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the total angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours will be the initial angle plus the angle the sun has moved upward:

\[ 32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 82 \]"
"To determine how much James spends on candles, we first need to find out how many candles he needs to buy. The ages of his sons are 12 and 4. Since they are 4 years apart, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old. Therefore, James needs candles for sons who are 8 and 12 years old, which means he needs 2 candles.

A pack of 5 candles costs $3. To find out how many packs James needs to buy, we divide the number of candles he needs by the number of candles in a pack: 2 candles / 5 candles per pack = 0.4 packs. Since he can't buy a fraction of a pack, he needs to buy 1 full pack to have enough candles.

The cost for 1 pack is $3. Therefore, James spends $3 on candles.

The final numerical answer is:
3"
"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the pages read in the first week and add it to the pages read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week. She read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week. So, the total reading time in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pages she can read in 105 minutes. We know that she can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. Therefore, the number of pages she reads per minute is:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of pages read in the first week:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages. So, the total number of pages read in two weeks is:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

Thus, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"

The final numerical answer is 5."
"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equation based on the information given.

Let \( S \) be Shiloh's current age, and let \( N \) be his nephew's current age.

From the problem, we know:
1. Shiloh is currently 44 years old, so \( S = 44 \).
2. In 7 years, Shiloh will be \( S + 7 \) years old.
3. In 7 years, his nephew will be \( N + 7 \) years old.
4. In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew, so \( S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \).

Now, substitute \( S = 44 \) into the equation:
\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3N + 21 \]
Subtract 21 from both sides:
\[ 30 = 3N \]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[ N = 10 \]

So, his nephew is currently 10 years old. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Tooth:**
   - The tooth fairy left $5.00.

2. **Next Three Teeth:**
   - For each of these teeth, the tooth fairy gave $1.00.
   - Total for these three teeth: \(3 \times 1.00 = 3.00\).

3. **Last Two Teeth:**
   - For the first of these last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of the previous three teeth, which is \( \frac{1.00}{2} = 0.50 \).
   - For the second of these last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of the previous two teeth, which is \( \frac{1.00}{2} = 0.50 \).
   - Total for these two teeth: \(0.50 + 0.50 = 1.00\).

Now, let's sum up all the amounts:

- First tooth: $5.00
- Next three teeth: $3.00
- Last two teeth: $1.00

Total amount: \(5.00 + 3.00 + 1.00 = 9.00\).

"To find out how many goals all three teenagers scored, we need to determine the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna based on the information given about Richie.

Given:
- Richie scored 80 goals.
- Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark.
- Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna.

First, we calculate the number of goals Mark scored:
\[ \text{Goals scored by Mark} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 20 = 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate the number of goals Anna scored:
\[ \text{Goals scored by Anna} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 45 = 80 - 45 = 35 \]

Now, we sum the goals scored by all three teenagers:
\[ \text{Total goals} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} + \text{Goals scored by Mark} + \text{Goals scored by Anna} = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 \]

Therefore, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is:

\[ 21 \text{ lemonades} \times 4 \text{ dollars/lemonade} = 84 \text{ dollars} \]

Liam claimed to have made $63. To find out how many more dollars Mitchell made than Liam, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings:
\[ 84 \text{ dollars} - 63 \text{ dollars} = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 21 \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Peter spends on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. He buys one wooden action figure each day, and each wooden action figure costs $5. Therefore, the total cost for the wooden action figures is:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the wooden action figures, the remaining amount of money Peter has is:

\[ 70 \text{ dollars} - 20 \text{ dollars} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, Peter will spend the remaining $50 on plastic action figures, which cost $2 each. The number of plastic action figures he can buy is:

\[ \frac{50 \text{ dollars}}{2 \text{ dollars/plastic action figure}} = 25 \text{ plastic action figures} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week. He bought 4 wooden action figures and 25 plastic action figures, so the total number of action figures is:

\[ 4 + 25 = 29 \]

Thus, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is:

"To calculate the total cost, we need to add up all the expenses:

1. Cost of spaying the kitten: $200
2. Cost of 3 vaccines: $20 each, so 3 vaccines cost $20 * 3 = $60
3. Cost of repairing 4 broken vases: $12 each, so 4 vases cost $12 * 4 = $48

Now, we add these amounts together:

$200 (spaying) + $60 (vaccines) + $48 (repairing vases) = $308

So, the total cost so far is $308."
"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we first need to calculate the total number of roses he grows in a week and then compare it to the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops.

Ford grows 40 roses every week. The flower shops order a total of:
- The first flower shop orders 20 roses.
- The second flower shop orders 15 roses.
- The third flower shop orders 30 roses.

So, the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week is:
\[ 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \]

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops in a month is:
\[ 65 \times 4 = 260 \]

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so in a month, he grows:
\[ 40 \times 4 = 160 \]

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the number of roses he grows from the number of roses ordered:
\[ 260 - 160 = 100 \]

Therefore, the number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by which the oven is off and then apply that same percentage to the 520 degrees required by the recipe.

First, let's find the percentage by which the oven is off when set to 450 degrees. The actual temperature is 468 degrees.

The difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature is:
\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage by which the oven is off is:
\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

Now, we need to apply this 4% off percentage to the 520 degrees required by the recipe.

The amount by which the temperature should be adjusted is:
\[ 520 \times \frac{4}{100} = 520 \times 0.04 = 20 \]

Therefore, the temperature Maggie should set the oven to is:

Therefore, the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is 215 minutes."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we first need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and then subtract that from Herb's price.

Herb's house price = $76,000

30% of Herb's house price = 0.30 * $76,000 = $22,800

Juan's house price = Herb's house price - 30% of Herb's house price
Juan's house price = $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

Now, we add the prices of both houses to find the combined value:

Combined value = Herb's house price + Juan's house price
Combined value = $76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200

The final numerical answer is $129,200."
"First, let's determine the number of cups and dishes Judy initially bought.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups.

She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.

At the event, her friend brought 40 cups. Since Judy initially bought 12 cups, her friend brought \(40 - 12 = 28\) more cups than Judy bought.

Her friend also brought 20 more dishes than Judy bought. Since Judy bought 24 dishes, her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend.

Total cups brought:
\[ 12 \text{ (Judy's cups)} + 40 \text{ (friend's cups)} = 52 \text{ cups} \]

Total dishes brought:
\[ 24 \text{ (Judy's dishes)} + 44 \text{ (friend's dishes)} = 68 \text{ dishes} \]

The total number of utensils (cups and dishes) brought by the two is:
\[ 52 \text{ cups} + 68 \text{ dishes} = 120 \text{ utensils} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the cost of one box of contacts after the 10% discount. The original price of one box is $100.00. A 10% discount on $100.00 is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Discount} = 100.00 \times \frac{10}{100} = 10.00 \]

So, the discounted price of one box is:

\[ \text{Discounted Price} = 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

Since Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost for 2 boxes is:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost per pair of contacts. Since each box contains 90 single use contacts, 2 boxes will contain:

\[ \text{Total Contacts} = 90 \times 2 = 180 \]

Therefore, the cost per pair of contacts is:

\[ \text{Cost per Pair} = \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total hours Jill worked.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so:
\[ \text{Total hours Jill worked} = 2 + 1 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Tabitha agreed to pay $10 per hour, so Jill's earnings are:
\[ \text{Jill's earnings} = 3 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$30 \]

Next, let's calculate the total hours John worked.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so:
\[ \text{John's hours on Saturday} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so:
\[ \text{John's hours on Sunday} = 3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, John's total hours worked are:

"First, let's calculate the total calories burned from doing aerobics and running.

For aerobics:
- Hannah spends 2 hours doing aerobics.
- Aerobics burn 500 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from aerobics = 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.

For running:
- Hannah spends 1 hour running.
- Running burns 600 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from running = 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.

Now, let's add the calories burned from both activities:
- Total calories burned = calories burned from aerobics + calories burned from running
- Total calories burned = 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories.

Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. To find out how many ml of water she needs to drink for 1600 calories, we can set up a proportion:

\[ \frac{100 \text{ ml}}{200 \text{ calories}} = \frac{x \text{ ml}}{1600 \text{ calories}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{100 \text{ ml} \times 1600 \text{ calories}}{200 \text{ calories}} \]
\[ x = \frac{160000 \text{ ml-calories}}{200 \text{ calories}} \]
\[ x = 800 \text{ ml} \]

So, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the note, the number of red jelly beans is 1% less than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \). Similarly, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of the red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

So, the number of blue jelly beans is 1500. Now we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

- Number of red jelly beans: \( 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \)
- Number of green jelly beans: \( 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \)

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 30."

- Weight loss per week: 1.25 pounds
- Weight loss over 5 weeks: \(1.25 \times 5 = 6.25\) pounds

For donuts:
- Weight gain per week: 1.75 pounds
- Weight gain over 5 weeks: \(1.75 \times 5 = 8.75\) pounds

Now, we find the difference in weight:
- Difference in weight: \(8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5\) pounds

The difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and eating donuts is 2.5 pounds."
"To determine the total number of seats Alex needs, we need to calculate the number of attendees based on the invitations and responses.

1. **Initial Invitations:**
   - Alex invites 100 people.
   - Each of these 100 people invites 2 friends.
   - Total additional invitations = 100 people * 2 friends/person = 200 friends.

2. **Additional Invitations from Friends:**
   - 10 of Alex's friends are called.
   - 8 of these 10 friends bring their spouses.
   - Total additional invitations from friends = 10 friends * 1 spouse/friend = 10 spouses.

3. **Total Attendees:**
   - Initial attendees: 100 people.
   - Additional attendees from initial invitations: 200 people.
   - Additional attendees from friends: 10 people (spouses).
   - Total attendees = 100 + 200 + 10 = 310 people.

Therefore, Alex will need 310 seats."
"First, let's determine the weight of each dog based on the information provided:

1. The Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds.
2. The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs \(10 \times 2 = 20\) pounds.
3. The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs \(20 \div 4 = 5\) pounds.
4. The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs \(5 \times 44 = 220\) pounds.

Therefore, the weight of the Mastiff is 220 pounds."
"First, let's calculate the total cost for the boots on Amazon.com:
- The cost of the boots on Amazon.com is $16.
- The shipping cost on Amazon.com is $4.
- Therefore, the total cost on Amazon.com is $16 + $4 = $20.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the boots on eBay:
- The cost of the boots on eBay is $13.
- The shipping cost on eBay is twice the shipping cost on Amazon.com. Since the shipping cost on Amazon.com is $4, the shipping cost on eBay is 2 * $4 = $8.
- Therefore, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

Now, let's find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon.com:
- The total cost on eBay is $21.
- The total cost on Amazon.com is $20.
- The difference in cost is $21 - $20 = $1.

"To determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, we need to calculate the height of the beanstalk each day until it exceeds 20 feet.

The beanstalk starts at 4 feet tall and doubles its height every day. Let's calculate the height of the beanstalk day by day:

- Day 0: 4 feet
- Day 1: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
- Day 2: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
- Day 3: 16 * 2 = 32 feet

On Day 3, the beanstalk reaches 32 feet, which is taller than the 20 feet Mark's window is off the ground.

Therefore, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final numerical answer is 3."
"To determine how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms every day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Calculate the total protein intake per week.

First, we know that 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein. Therefore, the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Protein per 200 grams} = \left(\frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams of mushrooms}}\right) \times 200 \text{ grams of mushrooms} = 6 \text{ grams of protein} \]

Next, we calculate the total protein intake per week. Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, the protein intake per day is 6 grams. Therefore, the protein intake per week is:
\[ \text{Protein per week} = 6 \text{ grams/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 42 \]"
"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Expanding and simplifying the equation:
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
\[ J - 2J = -10 \]
\[ -J = -10 \]
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

George needs 2 implants, each with a base price of $2000. So, the cost for the implants is:
\[ 2 \times 2000 = 4000 \]

For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. So, the additional cost for the porcelain crown is:
\[ 500 \]

The total cost for the dental work is:
\[ 4000 + 500 = 4500 \]

George has already put down a deposit of $600. Therefore, the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
\[ 4500 - 600 = 3900 \]

George makes $15 per hour at work. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
\[ \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \]

So, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 260 \]"
"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees, and the other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees. The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees and \( 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees. The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The measure of the largest angle in the triangle is \(\boxed{90}\) degrees."
"First, let's determine the total amount of money Colby has in cents.

\[ \text{Ruiz's hourly rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. According to the problem, Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we can calculate the amount Marissa makes in one hour as follows:

\[ \text{Marissa's hourly rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 60 \text{ pounds per hour} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of chocolates Ruiz and Marissa make together in 12 hours. First, we calculate the total amount Ruiz makes in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Ruiz's total in 12 hours} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

"First, let's determine the total number of rotations the tires go through in a month. Given that the car drives 400 miles a month and the tires rotate 725 times for every 2 miles, we can calculate the total rotations per month as follows:

\[ \text{Rotations per mile} = \frac{725}{2} \]
\[ \text{Rotations per month} = 400 \times \frac{725}{2} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of rotations per month:

\[ \text{Rotations per month} = 400 \times 362.5 = 145000 \]

Now, we know that each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations. To find out how many months the tires can last, we divide the total number of rotations each tire can handle by the number of rotations per month:

\[ \text{Months per tire} = \frac{10,440,000}{145000} \]

Let's calculate this value:

\[ \text{Months per tire} = 72 \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can find out how many years the tires can last by dividing the number of months per tire by 12:

\[ \text{Years per tire} = \frac{72}{12} = 6 \]

Therefore, the tires can last for 6 years before they need to be replaced. The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how much each pump costs, we first need to determine the total number of washes Jackie can get from one bottle of shampoo. Since the directions say 2 pumps give 120 washes, we can calculate the number of washes per pump:

\[ \text{Washes per pump} = \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washes per pump} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pumps are in the bottle. Since the bottle gives 120 washes and each pump gives 60 washes, the number of pumps in the bottle is:

\[ \text{Number of pumps} = \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{60 \text{ washes per pump}} = 2 \text{ pumps} \]

The total cost of the bottle is $24.00. To find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the number of pumps:

\[ \text{Cost per pump} = \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 12.00 \text{ dollars per pump} \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert dollars to cents (1 dollar = 100 cents):

\[ 12.00 \text{ dollars} = 12.00 \times 100 \text{ cents} = 1200 \text{ cents} \]

So, the cost per pump is 1200 cents."
"First, let's calculate the sale price of the shirt and the shorts.

The shirt's original price is $25, and there is a 30% discount. The discount amount for the shirt is:
\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]
So, the sale price of the shirt is:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

The shorts' original price is $35, and there is a 30% discount. The discount amount for the shorts is:
\[ 35 \times 0.30 = 10.50 \]

"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the funding into two parts: the initial 5 months and the extended 5 months.

1. **Initial 5 months funding:**
   - The initial funding is $100,000 for the first 5 months.

2. **Extended 5 months funding:**
   - The research took 10 times the initial 5 months, which means it took \(10 \times 5 = 50\) months in total.
   - The first 5 months cost $100,000.
   - The remaining 45 months (50 months - 5 months) cost 50% more per month than the initial $100,000 / 5 = $20,000 per month.
   - The new monthly cost for the extended period is \(20,000 \times 1.5 = 30,000\) dollars per month.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the extended 45 months is \(45 \times 30,000 = 1,350,000\) dollars.

3. **Total cost:**
   - Adding the initial 5 months and the extended 45 months, the total cost is \(100,000 + 1,350,000 = 1,450,000\) dollars.

Thus, the total cost of John's research is **$1,450,000**."

"To calculate the total cost of John's physical therapy, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of therapy sessions John attended.
2. Calculate the total number of hours John spent in therapy.
3. Compute the total cost based on the hourly rate.

**Step 1: Total number of therapy sessions**
John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks, and each week he attended twice for 2 hours at a time.
\[ \text{Total sessions} = 6 \text{ weeks} \times 2 \text{ sessions/week} = 12 \text{ sessions} \]

**Step 2: Total number of hours spent in therapy**
Each session is 2 hours long.
\[ \text{Total hours} = 12 \text{ sessions} \times 2 \text{ hours/session} = 24 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 3: Total cost of therapy**
The cost per hour is $125.
\[ \text{Total cost} = 24 \text{ hours} \times 125 \text{ dollars/hour} = 3000 \text{ dollars} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Pack of Gum**: Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum.

2. **Gum Chewed During School**: Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since a school day lasts 8 hours, he chews:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours/piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces}
   \]

3. **Gum Chewed on the Way Home**: Jim chews 1 piece on the way home from school.

4. **Gum Chewed After Dinner**: Jim chews 1 piece after dinner.

5. **Gum Given to His Sister**: After dinner, Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Let's calculate the remaining gum before giving any to his sister:
   \[
   20 - 4 - 1 - 1 = 14 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   Half of 14 pieces is:
   \[
   \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   So, Jim gives 7 pieces to his sister, leaving him with:
   \[
   14 - 7 = 7 \text{ pieces}
   \]

Therefore, the number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day is:
\[
\boxed{7}
\]"
"To find out how old Charmaine will be 4 years from now, we first need to determine her current age. If she will be 16 years old in 12 years, we can subtract 12 years from 16 to find her current age:

\[ 16 - 12 = 4 \]

So, Charmaine is currently 4 years old. To find out how old she will be 4 years from now, we add 4 years to her current age:

\[ 4 + 4 = 8 \]

So, Ashley’s internet connection speed in Mb per hour is 72 Mb/h."
"To calculate the total number of cars towed by the tow truck over the week, we can break down the problem into two parts: the first three days and the last four days.

For the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day. Therefore, the total number of cars pulled in the first three days is:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

For the remaining four days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day than it did on the first three days. Since it pulled 10 cars each day on the first three days, it pulled:
\[ 10 \text{ cars} - 4 \text{ cars} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]
Therefore, the total number of cars pulled in the last four days is:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Adding the number of cars pulled over the first three days and the last four days gives us the total number of cars towed that week:
\[ 30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to convert Adam's current height from inches to feet to compare it with the required height. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, Adam's height in feet is:

\[ 40 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{40}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The minimum height required to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. Therefore, Adam needs to grow:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Adam grows 2 inches per year, which is equivalent to \(\frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6}\) feet per year. To find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet, we divide \(\frac{2}{3}\) by \(\frac{1}{6}\):

\[ \frac{2}{3} \div \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = \frac{2 \times 6}{3 \times 1} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Therefore, Adam will be tall enough to ride the roller coaster in 4 years. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 cars James sold:
\[ \text{Total cost of cars} = 10 \times \$25,000 = \$250,000 \]

Next, we calculate the amount the company paid to acquire these cars:
\[ \text{Cost to acquire the cars} = 30\% \times \$250,000 = 0.30 \times \$250,000 = \$75,000 \]

Now, we find the total profit from selling the cars:
\[ \text{Total profit} = \text{Total cost of cars} - \text{Cost to acquire the cars} = \$250,000 - \$75,000 = \$175,000 \]

James gets a 10% commission on the profits:
\[ \text{James's commission} = 10\% \times \$175,000 = 0.10 \times \$175,000 = \$17,500 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$17,500 \]"
"First, let's determine how many riders can stay upright on the wave. Since only 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright, we calculate:

\[ 100 \times 0.25 = 25 \]

So, 25 riders can stay upright on the wave.

Next, we need to find out how many of these 25 riders are women. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we calculate:

\[ 25 \times 0.60 = 15 \]

So, 15 riders are women who can stay upright on the wave.

To find out how many of these 25 riders are men, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is 10.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 10 \]"
"First, let's find the price of the gold jewel. Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000 and the price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

\[
\text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600
\]

Next, we need to find the price of the silver jewel. The problem states that the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of the gold jewel. Therefore, we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

\[
\text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
\]

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond jewel, the gold jewel, and the silver jewel:

\[
\text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800
\]

The final numerical answer is:

\[

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between him and Bob.

First, let's calculate the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap. Since Bob is driving at 55 mph and Tom is driving at 70 mph, Tom is gaining on Bob at a rate of:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is closing the 75-mile gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. To find out how long it will take Tom to close this gap, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"If Naomi caught 17 fish, and Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, then Darren caught:

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 14."
"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the maximum cost per class and then find out how many classes he can attend without exceeding this cost.

First, let's denote the total cost of the 10 classes as \( C \). The total cost is given as $60. If the cost per class exceeds $10, they won't sign him up again. Therefore, we need to find the maximum number of classes \( n \) such that the cost per class is not more than $10.

The cost per class if he attends \( n \) classes is:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{n} \]

We need this cost to be less than or equal to $10:
\[ \frac{60}{n} \leq 10 \]

Solving for \( n \):
\[ 60 \leq 10n \]
\[ n \geq 6 \]

This means Manny can miss up to \( 10 - 6 = 4 \) classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \]"
"To determine the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we first need to find out how many customers each of them processes in a day.

Given that Jewel processes 50 customers per day, and Julie processes twice as many customers as Jewel, we can calculate the number of customers Julie processes per day as follows:
\[ \text{Customers processed by Julie per day} = 2 \times \text{Customers processed by Jewel per day} = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of customers processed by each of them in a week (7 days):
\[ \text{Total customers processed by Jewel in a week} = 50 \times 7 = 350 \]
\[ \text{Total customers processed by Julie in a week} = 100 \times 7 = 700 \]

Finally, we add the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel in a week to find the total weekly production:
\[ \text{Total weekly production} = \text{Total customers processed by Jewel in a week} + \text{Total customers processed by Julie in a week} = 350 + 700 = 1050 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many miles Reggie ran. Since Paisley ran 4 miles and Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, we can calculate Reggie's distance as follows:

\[ \text{Reggie's distance} = 5 \times \text{Paisley's distance} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. So, we can set up the following equation to find out how many miles Lynn ran:

\[ \text{Reggie's distance} = \text{Lynn's distance} + 3 \]

Substituting the distance Reggie ran:

\[ 20 = \text{Lynn's distance} + 3 \]

To find Lynn's distance, we subtract 3 from 20:

\[ \text{Lynn's distance} = 20 - 3 = 17 \text{ miles} \]

So, Lynn ran 17 miles. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 17 \]"
"First, let's find the cost of one apple and one orange.

The cost of four apples is $5.20, so the cost of one apple is:
\[ \text{Cost of one apple} = \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \]

The cost of three oranges is $3.30, so the cost of one orange is:
\[ \text{Cost of one orange} = \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \]

Now, we need to find the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges:
\[ \text{Cost of 5 apples} = 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \]
\[ \text{Cost of 5 oranges} = 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \]

So, Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the hole:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel one cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) it will take him to dig the hole is:

\[ T = \text{volume} \times \text{time per cubic foot} \]
\[ T = 72 \times 3 = 216 \text{ seconds} \]

"First, let's calculate the cost of each additional feature:

1. King cab upgrade: $7,500
2. Leather seats: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so $7,500 / 3 = $2,500
3. Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats, so $2,500 - $500 = $2,000
4. Upgraded exterior light package: $1,500

Now, let's add up all the extra costs:
- King cab upgrade: $7,500
- Leather seats: $2,500
- Running boards: $2,000
- Upgraded exterior light package: $1,500

Total extra cost = $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1,500 = $13,500

Now, let's add the base price of the truck to the total extra cost:
- Base price of the truck: $30,000
- Total extra cost: $13,500

1. **Determine the sales from green hats in the first month:**
   - The sales from red hats in the first month were $400.
   - The sales from green hats in the first month were twice the sales from red hats.
   - Therefore, the sales from green hats in the first month were \( 2 \times 400 = 800 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total sales for the first month:**
   - The total sales for the first month were the sum of the sales from red and green hats.
   - Total sales for the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
   - Total sales for the first month = \( 400 + 800 = 1200 \) dollars.

3. **Determine the sales for the second month:**
   - The sales for the second month were \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total sales of the first month.
   - Sales for the second month = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total sales for the two months:**
   - Total sales for the two months = Sales for the first month + Sales for the second month

   - James gets 1 hour free.
   - Effective paid hours = Total time hired - Free hour = 4 hours - 1 hour = 3 hours.

3. **Calculate the cost for each paid hour:**
   - The first paid hour costs $15.
   - Each subsequent hour costs twice the previous hour's cost.
   - Cost for the first hour = $15.
   - Cost for the second hour = 2 * $15 = $30.
   - Cost for the third hour = 2 * $30 = $60.

4. **Sum the costs for all paid hours:**
   - Total cost = Cost of first hour + Cost of second hour + Cost of third hour
   - Total cost = $15 + $30 + $60 = $105.

Therefore, James paid $105 for the horse-drawn carriage."
"To determine how many dollars were withheld from Sally’s wage, we need to calculate the difference between the amount in her bank account at the end of the week and the amount she should have in her bank account if she had received her full weekly wage.

The amount in her bank account at the end of the week is $420.
The amount she should have in her bank account if she had received her full weekly wage of $300 is $300.

The difference, which represents the amount withheld, is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Amount withheld} = \text{Amount in bank account at the end of the week} - \text{Amount she should have} \]
\[ \text{Amount withheld} = 420 - 300 \]
\[ \text{Amount withheld} = 120 \]

So, the number of dollars withheld from Sally’s wage is 120."
"First, let's determine the total number of deviled egg halves Lori needs. Since each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves and she is inviting 16 guests, the total number of deviled egg halves is:

\[ 16 \text{ guests} \times 3 \text{ deviled egg halves/guest} = 48 \text{ deviled egg halves} \]

Next, we need to find out how many whole eggs are required. Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, the number of whole eggs needed is:

\[ \frac{48 \text{ deviled egg halves}}{2 \text{ deviled egg halves/whole egg}} = 24 \text{ whole eggs} \]

Now, we need to convert the number of whole eggs into dozens. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, the number of dozens of eggs Lori needs is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ whole eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozen} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \]"

"To determine how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading, we need to calculate the total number of days it will take him to read the entire 200-page book at a rate of 10 pages per day.

The total number of days required to read the book is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Total days required} = \frac{\text{Total pages}}{\text{Pages per day}} = \frac{200 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ pages/day}} = 20 \text{ days} \]

Since the assignment is to be completed within 30 days, we can find out how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading by subtracting the total days required from the deadline:
\[ \text{Days before deadline} = 30 \text{ days} - 20 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ days} \]

So, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline."
"To calculate the total cost for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane, the monthly rental cost for the hanger, and the monthly cost for fuel.

1. **Initial Cost of the Plane**: $150,000
2. **Monthly Rental Cost for the Hanger**: $5,000
3. **Monthly Cost for Fuel**: Twice the rental cost for the hanger, which is $5,000 * 2 = $10,000
4. **Total Monthly Cost**: Rental cost for the hanger + Cost for fuel = $5,000 + $10,000 = $15,000
5. **Total Cost for the First Year**: Total monthly cost * 12 months = $15,000 * 12 = $180,000

Now, we add the initial cost of the plane to the total cost for the first year:

- Initial cost of the plane: $150,000
- Total cost for the first year: $180,000

Total cost for the first year = $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000

"First, let's determine the cooking times for each item:

1. **Rice**: It took Finley 30 minutes to cook the rice.
2. **Pork**: It took her 20 more minutes to cook the pork than the rice. Therefore, the cooking time for pork is:
   \[
   30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
   \]
3. **Beans**: It took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is:
   \[
   30 \text{ minutes} + 50 \text{ minutes} = 80 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   Therefore, the cooking time for beans is:
   \[

"Let's denote the number of sheep as \( S \) and the number of geese as \( G \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs.
2. Sheep have 1 head and geese have 1 head.

We can set up the following equations based on the given information:
1. The total number of legs: \( 4S + 2G = 70 \)
2. The total number of heads: \( S + G = 20 \)

We can solve these equations step by step. First, let's solve the second equation for \( G \):
\[ G = 20 - S \]

Next, substitute \( G \) in the first equation:
\[ 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]
\[ 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ 2S + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2S = 30 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep is \( S = 15 \).

"Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs. When 8 more dogs arrive, he needs to buy toys for these 8 dogs. So, he needs 8 toys.

After buying the toys for the 8 new dogs, there are now twice as many more dogs than when he left. This means there are 8 * 2 = 16 more dogs in the shelter. So, he needs to buy toys for these 16 dogs.

When James came back again, 3 dogs were gone, so he no longer needed the toys for those 3 dogs. However, this does not affect the total number of toys he needs to buy for the new dogs that arrived.

So, the total number of toys James needs to buy is the sum of the toys for the 8 new dogs and the 16 new dogs, which is 8 + 16 = 24 toys.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time Chris spent mowing half of his lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half in ""rabbit"" mode.

First, let's convert the times to a consistent unit. Since the question asks for the time in minutes, we'll use minutes for both modes.

- ""Turtle"" mode: 1 hour = 60 minutes
- ""Rabbit"" mode: 40 minutes

Chris mows half of his lawn in each mode. Therefore, the time spent mowing half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Similarly, the time spent mowing half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode is:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

To find the total time spent mowing the entire lawn, we add the time spent in both modes:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

"First, let's determine the cost of the lollipops and candies Manolo bought.

Given:
- Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for $3.20.
- Each lollipop costs $0.40.

Calculate the total cost of the lollipops:
\[ 5 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.40 \text{ per lollipop} = \$2.00 \]

Now, subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of the candies:
\[ \$3.20 - \$2.00 = \$1.20 \]

Since the cost of four candies is $1.20, we can find the cost of one candy:
\[ \frac{\$1.20}{4 \text{ candies}} = \$0.30 \text{ per candy} \]

Now, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies:
- The cost of 10 lollipops:
\[ 10 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.40 \text{ per lollipop} = \$4.00 \]

- The cost of 10 candies:
\[ 10 \text{ candies} \times \$0.30 \text{ per candy} = \$3.00 \]

Finally, add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies to get the total cost:
\[ \$4.00 + \$3.00 = \$7.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$7.00 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how many coins Rong saves per month:**
   Rong saves 20 coins per month.

2. **Calculate how many coins Neil saves per month:**
   Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong. This means Neil saves:
   \[
   20 + \left(\frac{2}{5} \times 20\right) = 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of months in ten years:**
   There are 12 months in a year, so in ten years, there are:
   \[
   10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of coins Rong has after ten years:**
   Rong saves 20 coins per month, so in 120 months, he will have:
   \[
   20 \times 120 = 2400 \text{ coins}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of coins Neil has after ten years:**
   Neil saves 28 coins per month, so in 120 months, he will have:
   \[
   28 \times 120 = 3360 \text{ coins}
   \]

6. **Calculate the total number of coins they have together after ten years:**
   Adding the coins saved by Rong and Neil:
   \[
   2400 + 3360 = 5760 \text{ coins}

"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20.

\[ \text{Cost of vaccines} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, let's denote the cost of the heartworm check as \( H \). According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as \( T \). Therefore, we have:

\[ H = 0.60 \times T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:

\[ T = 40 + H \]

Since \( H = 0.60 \times T \), we can substitute \( H \) in the total bill equation:

\[ T = 40 + 0.60 \times T \]

To solve for \( T \), we rearrange the equation:

\[ T - 0.60 \times T = 40 \]
\[ 0.40 \times T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:

\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, let's determine the price of each type of fruit:

- The price of one apple is $0.5.
- The price of one banana is twice the price of one apple, so it is \(2 \times 0.5 = $1.0\).
- The price of one orange is three times the price of one banana, so it is \(3 \times 1.0 = $3.0\).

Next, we calculate the total cost for one crate of fruit, which contains 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges:

- The cost for 5 bananas is \(5 \times 1.0 = $5.0\).
- The cost for 12 apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = $6.0\).
- The cost for 7 oranges is \(7 \times 3.0 = $21.0\).

"First, let's calculate how much Greta puts into her retirement account. She puts 50% of her $2400.00 paycheck into her retirement account:

\[ 2400 \times 0.50 = 1200 \]

So, she has $1200 left after putting money into her retirement account.

Next, we calculate how much she uses for her monthly car payment. She uses 20% of her $2400.00 paycheck for her car payment:

\[ 2400 \times 0.20 = 480 \]

So, she has $480 left after paying for her car.

Now, we subtract the amount spent on her car payment from the remaining amount after retirement contributions:

\[ 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Greta has left to spend is $720."

"First, let's determine the capacity of Gordy's truck. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, we can calculate Gordy's truck capacity as follows:

\[ \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = 4000 + 800 = 4800 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know the combined capacity of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks is 11,600 pounds. Let's denote Gary's truck capacity by \( G \). Therefore, we can write the equation for the total capacity as:

\[ 4000 + 4800 + G = 11600 \]

Now, we solve for \( G \):

\[ 8800 + G = 11600 \]
\[ G = 11600 - 8800 \]
\[ G = 2800 \]

So, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel. The final numerical answer is:

Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, each male ate:

\[ 3 \text{ dumplings/female} + 1 \text{ dumpling} = 4 \text{ dumplings/male} \]

With 8 males, the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is:

\[ 8 \text{ males} \times 4 \text{ dumplings/male} = 32 \text{ dumplings} \]

Adding the dumplings eaten by the males and the females gives the total number of dumplings cooked:

\[ 18 \text{ dumplings} + 32 \text{ dumplings} = 50 \text{ dumplings} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of hours required to reach the goal of $6300, given that $2100 has already been raised in the first 3 hours and that the amount raised per hour is constant.

First, we calculate the amount raised per hour:
\[ \text{Amount raised per hour} = \frac{\text{Total amount raised in 3 hours}}{\text{Number of hours}} = \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

Next, we determine the remaining amount needed to reach the goal:
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = \text{Total goal} - \text{Amount already raised} = 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Now, we calculate the number of additional hours required to raise the remaining amount:
\[ \text{Number of additional hours} = \frac{\text{Remaining amount}}{\text{Amount raised per hour}} = \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

Finally, we add the initial 3 hours to the additional hours to find the total number of hours required:
\[ \text{Total hours} = \text{Initial hours} + \text{Additional hours} = 3 + 6 = 9 \]

So, the total number of hours they have to fundraise in total to reach their goal is 9 hours."
"To find the percent of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the percentage of water used by the city for industrial purposes.
2. Subtract the industrial usage percentage from 100% to find the non-industrial usage percentage.

First, we know that Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. Out of this 40%, 80% is used for industrial purposes. Therefore, the percentage of water used by the city for industrial purposes is:
\[ 40\% \times 80\% = 40\% \times 0.80 = 32\% \]

Next, to find the percentage of water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the industrial usage percentage from 100%:

"First, let's calculate the total cost if Ron fixes the pothole himself.

1. Fine for unauthorized road maintenance: $120
2. Cost of 3 buckets of asphalt: 3 buckets * $25 per bucket = $75

Total cost if Ron fixes the pothole himself:
$120 (fine) + $75 (asphalt) = $195

Now, let's compare this to the damage the pothole would cause to his car if it's not fixed:
$450

To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we subtract the total cost of fixing the pothole from the potential damage to his car:
$450 (damage) - $195 (cost of fixing) = $255

So, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole himself."
"First, let's calculate the number of normal chairs left after some were sent for repair:
170 normal chairs - 20 repaired chairs = 150 normal chairs left.

Next, let's calculate the number of baby chairs left after some were sent for repair:
23 baby chairs - 13 repaired chairs = 10 baby chairs left.

Now, let's add the remaining normal chairs and baby chairs to find the total number of chairs left:
150 normal chairs + 10 baby chairs = 160 chairs.

"First, let's determine the total number of slices of pizza ordered. Since there are 5 people (Bryce and his four friends) and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate how many slices Bryce and two of his friends ate. They ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizzas:
\[ 2 \times 12 \times \frac{2}{3} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Then, we calculate how many slices the remaining two friends ate. They ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizzas:
\[ 2 \times 12 \times \frac{3}{4} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Now, we find the total number of slices eaten by all five people:
\[ 16 + 18 = 34 \]

Finally, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices to find out how many slices are left:
\[ 60 - 34 = 26 \]

So, the number of slices of pizza left is:
\[ 26 \]"
"First, let's determine the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages. The cat takes 30 minutes to eat nine sausages. The dog takes \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the time the cat takes, so the dog's time is:

\[ \text{Dog's time} = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. The average time is calculated by adding the times together and then dividing by 2:

\[ \text{Average time} = \frac{\text{Cat's time} + \text{Dog's time}}{2} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, Topher's shoe length of 8-feet and 4-inches is:

\[ 8 \times 12 + 4 = 96 + 4 = 100 \text{ inches} \]

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( x \) inches. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of windows in the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars.
- Each student's car has 4 windows.
- Therefore, the total number of windows in the students' cars is \(64 \times 4 = 256\) windows.

Next, let's calculate the number of windows in the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each teacher's car has 2 windows.
- Therefore, the total number of windows in the teachers' cars is \(32 \times 2 = 64\) windows.

Now, let's calculate the number of windows smashed by Hannah:
- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.
- A quarter of the students' cars' windows is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64\) windows.
- Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows.
- 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48\) windows.

Finally, the total number of windows smashed by Hannah is the sum of the windows smashed from the students' cars and the teachers' cars:
- Total windows smashed = \(64 + 48 = 112\).

The final numerical answer is 112."
"To find the percentage of blue spools, we first need to calculate the total number of spools and the number of blue spools.

Candy has:
- 15 light blue spools
- 45 dark blue spools
- 40 light green spools
- 50 dark green spools

The total number of spools is:
\[ 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150 \]

The total number of blue spools (light blue and dark blue) is:
\[ 15 + 45 = 60 \]

To find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 \]

   - Number of people who voted by 16:00 = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000 \).

5. **People who had not voted by 16:00**:
   - Number of people who had not voted by 16:00 = Remaining people after midday - People who voted by 16:00.
   - Number of people who had not voted by 16:00 = \( 3000 - 2000 = 1000 \).

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000."
"To determine how many packs of gum Parker will need for 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will chew in 30 days.
2. Determine how many packs of gum are needed based on the total number of pieces.

First, we calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will chew in 30 days:
\[ \text{Total pieces of gum} = \text{Pieces per day} \times \text{Number of days} \]
\[ \text{Total pieces of gum} = 4 \times 30 = 120 \]

Next, we determine how many packs of gum are needed. Since each pack contains 15 pieces of gum:
\[ \text{Number of packs} = \frac{\text{Total pieces of gum}}{\text{Pieces per pack}} \]
\[ \text{Number of packs} = \frac{120}{15} = 8 \]

Therefore, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of smores needed:

- There are 9 kids, and each wants 2 smores, so the kids will need \(9 \times 2 = 18\) smores.
- There are 6 adults, and each will eat 1 smore, so the adults will need \(6 \times 1 = 6\) smores.
- Therefore, the total number of smores needed is \(18 + 6 = 24\) smores.

Next, we need to determine how many sleeves of graham crackers are required to make 24 smores. Since each sleeve makes the base for 8 smores, we need to find out how many sleeves are needed for 24 smores:

\[ \text{Number of sleeves needed} = \frac{24 \text{ smores}}{8 \text{ smores per sleeve}} = 3 \text{ sleeves} \]

Since each box contains 3 sleeves, they will need:

\[ \text{Number of boxes needed} = \frac{3 \text{ sleeves}}{3 \text{ sleeves per box}} = 1 \text{ box} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Dora's father's age:**
   - Dora's age is given as 15 years.
   - Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age.
   - Twice Dora's age is \(2 \times 15 = 30\).
   - Eight more than twice Dora's age is \(30 + 8 = 38\).
   - Therefore, Dora's father is 38 years old.

2. **Determine Dora's mother's age:**
   - Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father.
   - Dora's father is 38 years old.
   - Four years younger than 38 is \(38 - 4 = 34\).
   - Therefore, Dora's mother is 34 years old.

3. **Calculate the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother:**
   - Dora's age is 15.
   - Dora's father's age is 38.

"First, let's calculate the total weight of Cindy's math and science books. Since each of these books weighs 2 pounds and there are two of them, the total weight for these books is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds/book} \times 2 \text{ books} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know the weight of her French book is 4 pounds and her English book is 3 pounds. So, the total weight of these two books is:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} + 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Her history book weighs twice as much as her English book. Since her English book weighs 3 pounds, the weight of her history book is:
\[ 2 \times 3 \text{ pounds} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add up the weights of all her books to find the total weight:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} + 7 \text{ pounds} + 6 \text{ pounds} = 17 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is:

"First, let's calculate the number of votes candidate B received. Candidate A received 20% of the votes, and candidate B received 50% more than candidate A's votes.

Candidate A's votes:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ votes} \]

Candidate B's votes:
\[ 50\% \text{ more than candidate A's votes} = 20 + (0.50 \times 20) = 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ votes} \]

Now, we can find out how many votes candidate C received by subtracting the votes of candidates A and B from the total number of votes.

Total votes:
\[ 100 \]

Votes for candidate C:
\[ 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \text{ votes} \]

So, candidate C received 50 votes."
"First, let's determine how many apples Beck has initially. Since Boris has 100 apples and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, we can calculate the number of apples Beck has as follows:

\[ \text{Beck's initial apples} = \text{Boris's apples} - 23 = 100 - 23 = 77 \]

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. So, we need to update the number of apples each person has after this transaction:

\[ \text{Boris's apples after giving 10 to Beck} = 100 - 10 = 90 \]
\[ \text{Beck's apples after receiving 10 from Boris} = 77 + 10 = 87 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after this transaction:

\[ \text{Difference in apples} = \text{Boris's apples} - \text{Beck's apples} = 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the information given:

- Total number of students = 50
- Number of students who like to bake = 10
- Number of students who like to play basketball = 5
- The rest like to either play video games or play music.

Let's denote the number of students who like to play video games as \( V \) and the number of students who like to play music as \( M \).

According to the problem, \( M = 2 \times 5 = 10 \).

The total number of students can be represented as the sum of those who like to bake, play basketball, play video games, and play music:

\[ 10 + 5 + V + M = 50 \]

Substituting \( M = 10 \) into the equation:

\[ 10 + 5 + V + 10 = 50 \]

Simplifying the equation:

"To find the number of boys in each class, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of students in each class.
2. Calculate the number of girls in each class.
3. Subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class to find the number of boys.

First, since the total number of students in the two classes is 80 and each class has the same number of students, we can find the number of students in each class by dividing the total number of students by 2:

\[ \text{Number of students in each class} = \frac{80}{2} = 40 \]

Next, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. Therefore, the number of girls in each class is:

\[ \text{Number of girls in each class} = 40 \times \frac{40}{100} = 40 \times 0.4 = 16 \]

Now, to find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class:

\[ \text{Number of boys in each class} = 40 - 16 = 24 \]

So, the number of boys in each class is 24."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many students would be in each group if the activity is divided into 12 groups.

First, we find out how many students would be in each group if there are 12 groups:
\[ \text{Number of students per group} = \frac{54 \text{ students}}{12 \text{ groups}} = 4.5 \text{ students per group} \]

Since the number of students per group must be a whole number, it is not possible to divide 54 students into 12 groups of equal size. Therefore, the question is asking for the number of additional groups needed to form, which implies we need to find out how many groups are needed to have whole groups of students.

Given that 54 students need to be divided into groups of equal size, the number of students per group must be a divisor of 54. The divisors of 54 are: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, and 54. The largest number of groups that can be formed with whole students is when each group has 1 student, which would mean 54 groups. However, the problem specifies 12 groups, which is not possible with 54 students.

To form groups of 1 student each, we need:
\[ 54 \text{ groups} - 12 \text{ groups} = 42 \text{ more groups} \]

Thus, the number of additional groups needed to form is:
\[ \boxed{42} \]"

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during a single weekday and a single weekend day:
- Weekdays: 60 chairs per day
- Weekends: 100 chairs per day

Next, we need to determine the number of weekdays and weekend days in a 4-week month:
- There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a single week.
- Therefore, in a 4-week month, there are \(5 \times 4 = 20\) weekdays and \(2 \times 4 = 8\) weekend days.

Now, we can calculate the total number of chairs rented during a 4-week month:
- Chairs rented during weekdays: \(60 \times 20 = 1200\)
- Chairs rented during weekends: \(100 \times 8 = 800\)
- Total chairs rented in one 4-week month: \(1200 + 800 = 2000\)

Finally, we need to find out the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months:
- Total chairs rented in two 4-week months: \(2000 \times 2 = 4000\)

So, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is 4000."

Next, let's determine how many large stickers Lorraine trades for large buttons. She starts with 40 large stickers and trades 50% of them:

\[ 40 \times 0.50 = 20 \text{ large stickers} \]

Since each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons, and a large button is worth three small buttons, each large sticker is worth 1 large button. Therefore, trading 20 large stickers for large buttons gives her 20 large buttons.

Now, let's determine how many large stickers Lorraine has left after trading 20 of them for large buttons. She started with 40 large stickers and traded 20 of them:

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ large stickers} \]

Next, she trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons. Since each large sticker is worth 1 large button, and a large button is worth three small buttons, each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons. Therefore, trading 20 large stickers for small buttons gives her:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ small buttons} \]

Now, let's sum up all the buttons Lorraine has by the end. She has 27 small buttons from trading small stickers, 20 large buttons from trading large stickers, and 60 small buttons from trading the remaining large stickers. Since a large button is worth three small buttons, the 20 large buttons are equivalent to:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ small buttons} \]

So, the total number of buttons Lorraine has is:

\[ 27 + 60 + 60 = 147 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{147} \]"
"To find out how many matches Joey played in one week, let's break down the information given:

- Joey played 2 matches on Monday.
- Joey played 1 match on Friday.
- Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday on Saturday, which means he played \(2 \times 2 = 4\) matches on Saturday.

Now, let's add up the matches played each day:
- Monday: 2 matches
- Friday: 1 match
- Saturday: 4 matches

Total matches played in one week = 2 (Monday) + 1 (Friday) + 4 (Saturday) = 7 matches.

The final numerical answer is 7."
"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, so it is \( 2x \).

The total number of votes cast is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is \( x + 2x = 3x \).

We know the total number of people on the council is 33, so:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x \):
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Thus, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Extra-small (XS) shirts**: 11 students need size extra-small.
2. **Small (S) shirts**: Twice as many students need size small as extra small. Therefore, the number of students needing size small is \(2 \times 11 = 22\).
3. **Medium (M) shirts**: Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size medium is \(22 - 4 = 18\).
4. **Large (L) shirts**: Half as many students need size large as size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size large is \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\).
5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts**: Six more students need size extra-large than large. Therefore, the number of students needing size extra-large is \(9 + 6 = 15\).

Now, we sum up the number of students needing each size to find the total number of shirts ordered:

\[
11 \text{ (XS)} + 22 \text{ (S)} + 18 \text{ (M)} + 9 \text{ (L)} + 15 \text{ (XL)} = 75
\]

So, the total number of shirts Krissa ordered is 75."
"To calculate the final price after a 5% discount on a $140 item, you first need to determine the amount of the discount and then subtract it from the original price.

The discount amount is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Original Price} \times \frac{\text{Discount Percentage}}{100} \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 140 \times \frac{5}{100} \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 140 \times 0.05 \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 7 \]

Now, subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the final price:
\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount Amount} \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 140 - 7 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 133 \]

So, the final price after the discount is $133."
"To find the total number of hours the 20 playlists will last, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of songs across all playlists.
2. Calculate the total number of hours by multiplying the total number of songs by the length of each song.

First, let's calculate the total number of songs:
- Each playlist has 300 songs.
- John has 20 playlists.

Total number of songs = 300 songs/playlist * 20 playlists = 6000 songs.

Next, we calculate the total number of hours:
- Each song is 10 hours long.

Total number of hours = 6000 songs * 10 hours/song = 60000 hours.

So, the 20 playlists will last a total of 60000 hours."
"First, let's find out how many people think horse #2 will win. 

20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win:
\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \text{ people} \]

Next, we need to find out how many people are left after those who think horse #2 will win:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ people} \]

Now, 60% of the remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win:
\[ 0.60 \times 40 = 24 \text{ people} \]

The rest of the people think horse #12 will win. To find out how many people that is, we subtract the number of people who think horse #7 will win from the remaining people:
\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \text{ people} \]

So, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is 16."
"To find the total number of puppies Jana has, we can work backwards from the information given.

We know that one third of the Pomeranian puppies are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. Therefore, the total number of Pomeranian puppies (let's call this number \( P \)) can be found by solving the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{3}P = 6 \]

Multiplying both sides by 3 gives:
\[ P = 6 \times 3 = 18 \]

So, Jana has 18 Pomeranian puppies. Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can find the total number of puppies (let's call this number \( T \)) by solving the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{3}T = 18 \]

Multiplying both sides by \(\frac{3}{2}\) gives:
\[ T = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 27 \]

Therefore, Jana has 27 puppies in total."
"First, let's determine how much money Jayden has after his sister gives him half of her allowance.

Ava's allowance is $90, so half of that is:
\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

Jayden initially had $70, and his sister gave him $45, so now Jayden has:
\[ 70 + 45 = 115 \]

The camera costs $200, so the amount of money Jayden still needs to buy the camera is:
\[ 200 - 115 = 85 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 85 \]"
"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The first house needs \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the second house, so the first house needs \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases.
- The third house needs double the first house, so the third house needs \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) cases.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{5}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{5} \):
\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{5} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. The third house needs double the first house, which is:
\[ 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = 2 \times \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 100 \]"

"To find out how many fruits George has, we first need to determine how many pears he has. Given that George has 45% more pears than bananas, and he has 200 bananas, we can calculate the number of pears as follows:

Number of pears = Number of bananas + 45% of the number of bananas
Number of pears = 200 + 0.45 * 200
Number of pears = 200 + 90
Number of pears = 290

Now, to find the total number of fruits, we add the number of bananas and the number of pears:

Total number of fruits = Number of bananas + Number of pears
Total number of fruits = 200 + 290
Total number of fruits = 490

So, the final numerical answer is 490."

"First, let's determine how many books Ahmed read. According to the problem, Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in one hour. Since Ezra read 300 books, we can set up the following equation to find out how many books Ahmed read:

\[ \text{Ahmed's books} = \frac{\text{Ezra's books}}{2} = \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

Ahmed read 150 books in one hour. Now, we need to find out how many books they have read altogether. We know that Ezra decided to read 150 more books, so the total number of books Ezra read is:

\[ 300 + 150 = 450 \]

Now, we add the number of books Ahmed read to the number of books Ezra read to find the total number of books read by both:

\[ \text{Total books} = \text{Ahmed's books} + \text{Ezra's books} = 150 + 450 = 600 \]

"To calculate Tanya's earnings for the two days, we need to break down her earnings for each day and then sum them up.

**Monday:**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She also earns an additional $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Monday:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} \times 5 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 20 \times 5 \times 15 = \$1500 \]

Next, calculate the additional earnings for Monday:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} > 3 \text{ classes} \]
\[ 4 \text{ classes} - 3 \text{ classes} = 1 \text{ extra class} \]
\[ 1 \text{ extra class} \times \$5 = \$5 \]

So, the total earnings for Monday are:
\[ \$1500 + \$5 = \$1505 \]

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She does not earn the additional $5 per day since she does not teach more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Wednesday:
\[ 2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 2 \times 2 \times 15 = \$60 \]

Since she does not teach more than 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5 per day.

So, the total earnings for Wednesday are:
\[ \$60 \]

Now, sum the earnings for both days:
\[ \$1505 + \$60 = \$1565 \]

Therefore, Tanya earned a total of \$1565 for these two days of teaching."

"To determine how long Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time he spends driving to the museum and the time he spends driving back home, and then add the time he spends at the museum.

First, let's calculate the time spent driving to the museum. The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and Jack drives at a speed of 75 mph. The time spent driving to the museum is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time spent driving to the museum is:

\[ \text{Time to museum} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Since the trip back home is the same distance and at the same speed, the time spent driving back home is also 2 hours.

Now, we add the time spent driving to the museum, the time spent driving back home, and the time spent at the museum:

\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time to museum} + \text{Time back home} + \text{Time at museum} \]
\[ \text{Total time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

So, Jack is gone from home for a total of 10 hours."

"First, let's break down the information given:

- Mike has 600 movies in total.
- A third of the movies are in various series, which means \( \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \) movies are in series.
- The remaining movies are \( 600 - 200 = 400 \) movies.
- 40% of the remaining 400 movies are older movies, which means \( 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \) movies are older.
- The rest of the remaining movies are not in series or older, which is \( 400 - 160 = 240 \) movies.

Now, let's calculate the cost of replacing the movies:

- The cost of the series movies: Since a third of the movies are in series and he can get them for $6, the cost for the series movies is \( 200 \times 6 = 1200 \) dollars.
- The cost of the older movies: Since 40% of the remaining movies are older and each costs $5, the cost for the older movies is \( 160 \times 5 = 800 \) dollars.
- The cost of the remaining movies: Since the remaining 240 movies are not in series or older and each costs $10, the cost for these movies is \( 240 \times 10 = 2400 \) dollars.

Adding these costs together gives the total cost of replacing the movies:
\[ 1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 4400."

"First, let's calculate the distance the Llesis family drove. They drove for 6 hours at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.

\[ \text{Distance driven} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 50 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, let's determine the hiking speed. The hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half the driving speed.

\[ \text{Hiking speed} = \frac{50}{2} - 5 = 25 - 5 = 20 \, \text{miles/hour} \]

Given that they hiked for 1.5 hours at this speed, we can calculate the distance they hiked.

\[ \text{Distance hiked} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 20 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, to find the total distance to their vacation spot, we add the distance driven and the distance hiked.

\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance driven} + \text{Distance hiked} = 300 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 330 \, \text{miles} \]

"Let's denote the number of enemies Ava jumps on as \( E_A \) and the number of berries she collects as \( B_A \). Similarly, let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumps on as \( E_E \) and the number of berries she collects as \( B_E \).

Given:
- Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma: \( E_A = E_E + 8 \)
- Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma: \( B_A = B_E + 3 \)
- Ava finishes 4 seconds slower than Emma, which means she loses 30 points for the time penalty: \( -30 \) points

Now, let's calculate the scores for both Ava and Emma.

Ava's score:
- Points from enemies: \( 10 \times (E_E + 8) \)
- Points from berries: \( 5 \times (B_E + 3) \)
- Time penalty: \( -30 \)

Emma's score:
- Points from enemies: \( 10 \times E_E \)
- Points from berries: \( 5 \times B_E \)

Let's denote the base scores (without the time penalty) as:
- Ava's base score: \( 10(E_E + 8) + 5(B_E + 3) \)
- Emma's base score: \( 10E_E + 5B_E \)

Now, let's calculate the difference in their scores:
\[ \text{Difference} = (10(E_E + 8) + 5(B_E + 3) - 30) - (10E_E + 5B_E) \]

Simplify the expression:
\[ \text{Difference} = 10E_E + 80 + 5B_E + 15 - 30 - 10E_E - 5B_E \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 80 + 15 - 30 \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 75 \]

So, the difference between their two scores is 75 points."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each. Then, we subtract this amount from the total cost to find the combined cost of the other two pizzas. Finally, we divide this amount by 2 to find the cost of each of the other two pizzas.

The total cost of the four pizzas is 64 dollars. The cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each is:
\[ 30 + 30 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting this from the total cost gives the combined cost of the other two pizzas:
\[ 64 - 60 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the combined cost of these two pizzas by 2:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, each of the other two pizzas cost 2 dollars. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as \( w \) and the number of orange fish he bought as \( o \). We know that the total number of fish Bob bought from the pet store is \( o + w = 17 \).

After adding these fish to his pond, the total number of orange fish became \( 3 + o \) and the total number of white fish became \( 4 + w \). According to the problem, after adding the new fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish. This gives us the equation:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( o + w = 17 \)
2. \( 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \)

Let's solve the second equation first:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]
\[ 3 + o = 8 + 2w \]
\[ o - 2w = 5 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( o + w = 17 \)
2. \( o - 2w = 5 \)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use elimination. First, we'll eliminate \( o \) by subtracting the second equation from the first:
\[ (o + w) - (o - 2w) = 17 - 5 \]
\[ o + w - o + 2w = 12 \]
\[ 3w = 12 \]
\[ w = 4 \]

Now that we have \( w = 4 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( o \):
\[ o + 4 = 17 \]
\[ o = 13 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish and 13 orange fish. The number of white fish Bob bought at the store is \( 4 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total distance Andy travels in a week. Since he goes to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days. The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, so the round trip distance is \(5 \times 2 = 10\) miles per day. Therefore, the total distance he travels in a week is \(10 \times 5 = 50\) miles.

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of gas Andy consumes in a week. Given that his car's fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon, the number of gallons consumed for 50 miles is \(50 \div 10 = 5\) gallons.

Finally, we calculate the cost of the gas consumed in a week. If the price of gas is $3 per gallon, then the cost for 5 gallons is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is 15."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie has in quarters. Since she has 140 quarters and each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount in quarters is:

\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie has in twenties. Since she has 10 twenties and each twenty is worth $20, the total amount in twenties is:

\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Carrie spent 3/5 of the twenties. So, the amount spent on twenties is:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the amount spent on quarters and the amount spent on twenties to find the total amount of money she paid for the lunch:

\[ 35 + 120 = 155 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is:

\[ 155 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 155 \]"
"To find out how many fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to calculate the total yield from the tomato plants and the eggplant plants separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the total yield from the tomato plants:
- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo planted 5 tomato plants.

\[
\text{Total tomatoes} = 22 \text{ tomatoes/plant} \times 5 \text{ plants} = 110 \text{ tomatoes}
\]

Next, let's calculate the total yield from the eggplant plants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo planted 8 eggplant plants.

\[
\text{Total eggplants} = 4 \text{ eggplants/plant} \times 8 \text{ plants} = 32 \text{ eggplants}
\]

Now, we sum the total yield from both types of plants to find the total number of fruits:

\[
\text{Total fruits} = \text{Total tomatoes} + \text{Total eggplants} = 110 + 32 = 142
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
142

"To find out how many OLED TVs were sold, we first need to determine the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold, and then subtract these from the total sales.

Given:
- One-fourth of the sales are smart TVs.
- One-eighth of the sales are analog TVs.
- The rest are OLED TVs.
- Total sales = 40 TVs.

First, calculate the number of smart TVs sold:
\[ \text{Number of smart TVs} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

Next, calculate the number of analog TVs sold:
\[ \text{Number of analog TVs} = \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5 \]

Now, calculate the number of OLED TVs sold by subtracting the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total sales:
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (\text{Number of smart TVs} + \text{Number of analog TVs}) \]
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (10 + 5) \]
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - 15 \]
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 25 \]

So, the number of OLED TVs sold is 25."

"First, we need to determine the temperature difference that needs to be prevented for the pipes to freeze. The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. The temperature during the night is 33 degrees colder than during the day, so the night temperature is:

\[ 45 \text{ degrees} - 33 \text{ degrees} = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

The temperature during the night is 12 degrees, which is below the freezing point of 32 degrees. To prevent the pipes from freezing, the temperature needs to be raised to at least 32 degrees. The temperature difference that needs to be raised is:

\[ 32 \text{ degrees} - 12 \text{ degrees} = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Since each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees, the number of logs needed to raise the temperature by 20 degrees is:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ degrees}}{5 \text{ degrees/log}} = 4 \text{ logs} \]

So, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"

"First, let's determine Jamie's regular hourly rate and her special hourly rate.

Jamie's regular hourly rate is $20 per hour.

Her special hourly rate is 150% of her regular hourly rate. To find this, we calculate:
\[ 150\% = 1.5 \]
\[ \text{Special hourly rate} = 1.5 \times 20 = 30 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Jamie earns for her regular 8 hours of work:
\[ \text{Regular earnings} = 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Jamie worked 11 hours in total, which includes her regular 8 hours and the additional 3 hours. We need to calculate the earnings for the additional 3 hours at the special hourly rate:
\[ \text{Special earnings} = 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the regular earnings and the special earnings to find her total earnings for the day:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = 160 + 90 = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Jamie was paid \(\boxed{250}\) dollars for her work on last Tuesday."
"The number of male lions is half the number of female lions, so there are 12 / 2 = 6 male lions. Adding the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs together, we get 12 + 6 + 14 = 32 lions in the enclosure.

"To find out how much money Mike will have left after buying the jeans, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discount amount on the jeans.
2. Subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the sale price.
3. Subtract the sale price from the $50.00 bill to find out how much money Mike will have left.

First, let's calculate the discount amount:
\[ \text{Discount amount} = \text{Original price} \times \text{Discount percentage} \]
\[ \text{Discount amount} = \$40.00 \times 0.25 \]
\[ \text{Discount amount} = \$10.00 \]

Next, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the sale price:
\[ \text{Sale price} = \text{Original price} - \text{Discount amount} \]
\[ \text{Sale price} = \$40.00 - \$10.00 \]
\[ \text{Sale price} = \$30.00 \]

Finally, we subtract the sale price from the $50.00 bill to find out how much money Mike will have left:
\[ \text{Money left} = \text{Amount paid} - \text{Sale price} \]
\[ \text{Money left} = \$50.00 - \$30.00 \]
\[ \text{Money left} = \$20.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of employees after three months.
2. Calculate the total salary paid to all employees in one month.
3. Multiply the total salary for one month by the number of months (three months).

**Step 1: Determine the number of employees after three months.**

The company hires 20 new employees every month. After three months, the number of new employees hired is:
\[ 20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees} \]

The initial number of employees is 200. Therefore, the total number of employees after three months is:

"To solve this problem, let's first determine Billy's starting salary and his salary after the raises.

1. **Billy's starting salary:**
   - Initially, Billy was paid $10 per hour.
   - After 2 months, he received a raise of $0.50 per hour, so his new hourly rate became $10.50.
   - On his first anniversary, he received another raise of $1.00 per hour, so his final hourly rate became $11.50.

2. **Billy's earnings for 20 hours:**
   - At $11.50 per hour, for 20 hours, Billy earns \( 11.50 \times 20 = 230 \) dollars.

Next, let's determine Sally's starting salary.

3. **Sally's starting salary:**
   - Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary.
   - Billy's starting salary was $10 per hour, so Sally's starting salary is \( 10 + 0.50 = 10.50 \) dollars per hour.

4. **Sally's earnings for 20 hours:**
   - At $10.50 per hour, for 20 hours, Sally earns \( 10.50 \times 20 = 210 \) dollars.

5. **Difference in earnings:**

"First, let's calculate the number of students and teachers in the school.

The school has 40 classes with an average of 25 students per class:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 25 \text{ students/class} = 1000 \text{ students} \]

The school also has 40 classes with an average of 3 teachers per class:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 3 \text{ teachers/class} = 120 \text{ teachers} \]

Each child plants 1 tree, so the number of trees planted by the students is:
\[ 1000 \text{ students} \times 1 \text{ tree/student} = 1000 \text{ trees} \]

Each teacher plants 2 trees, so the number of trees planted by the teachers is:
\[ 120 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ trees/teacher} = 240 \text{ trees} \]

Adding the trees planted by the students and the teachers gives the total number of trees planted:

"First, let's calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:

- Puppies: 3
- Koalas: 5
- Zebras: 2
- Frogs: 4

Total stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Let's denote the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy as \( x \).

After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30%. Therefore, the equation representing this situation is:

\[ \frac{x}{14 + x} = 0.30 \]

To solve for \( x \), we can rearrange the equation:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total hours Kris has already played.

For the first 2 weeks (14 days), Kris plays for half an hour every day:
\[ 14 \text{ days} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/day} = 7 \text{ hours} \]

For the next week (7 days), Kris plays for 2 hours every day:
\[ 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/day} = 14 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's add the hours from both periods to find the total hours played so far:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} + 14 \text{ hours} = 21 \text{ hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. To find out how many more hours she needs to play, we subtract the hours she has already played from the total required hours:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} - 21 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

So, Kris still needs to play 9 more hours to earn the achievement."
"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled by the first car:
- The first car travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance traveled by the first car is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled by the second car:
- The second car travels at an average speed of 70 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance traveled by the second car is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_2 = 70 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled by the two cars:
\[
\text{Separation} = \text{Distance}_2 - \text{Distance}_1 = 140 \, \text{miles} - 120 \, \text{miles} = 20 \, \text{miles}

Total cost including premium = $900 + $270 = $1170

So, the final numerical answer is $1170."
"First, let's calculate the pass rates for each grade:

- For third graders: \( \frac{340}{500} = 0.68 \) or 68%
- For fourth graders: \( \frac{40}{100} = 0.40 \) or 40%
- For fifth graders: The pass rate is twice that of fourth graders, so \( 2 \times 0.40 = 0.80 \) or 80%

Next, we calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students:

- Third graders: 340
- Fourth graders: 40
- Fifth graders: 400

Total number of students: \( 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 \)

Total number of students who passed: \( 340 + 40 + 400 = 780 \)

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students:

\[ \text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{780}{1000} = 0.78 \]

So, the school's overall pass rate is 78%."
"To determine how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has.
2. Determine the total area of the mosaic he can make with the chips he has.
3. Calculate the length of the mosaic based on the area and the height.

First, let's find out how many glass chips Milo has:
- Each bag contains 72 chips.
- Milo has two bags.
- Therefore, the total number of chips is \( 72 \times 2 = 144 \) chips.

Next, we need to find out how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips:
- It takes 12 chips to make every square inch.
- Therefore, the total area in square inches is \( \frac{144}{12} = 12 \) square inches.

Now, we know the height of the mosaic is 3 inches. To find the length, we use the area formula for a rectangle (Area = Length × Height):
- The area is 12 square inches.
- The height is 3 inches.
- Therefore, the length is \( \frac{12}{3} = 4 \) inches.

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long. The final numerical answer is:

To find out how many candies he still needs to sell, we subtract the number of candies he has from the total number of candies he ordered, which is 200 - 150 = 50.

So, the final numerical answer is 50."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students on campus at the end of each month and then determine the total number of additional students who joined by the end of May.

Starting with 10 students at the beginning of the year, the number of students doubles every month.

- At the end of January: \(10 \times 2 = 20\) students
- At the end of February: \(20 \times 2 = 40\) students
- At the end of March: \(40 \times 2 = 80\) students
- At the end of April: \(80 \times 2 = 160\) students
- At the end of May: \(160 \times 2 = 320\) students

Now, we calculate the total number of additional students who joined by the end of May:

- Additional students in January: \(20 - 10 = 10\)
- Additional students in February: \(40 - 20 = 20\)
- Additional students in March: \(80 - 40 = 40\)
- Additional students in April: \(160 - 80 = 80\)
- Additional students in May: \(320 - 160 = 160\)

"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we first need to determine the total number of branches he climbed during the week.

Given that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs and he made $105 during the week, we can calculate the total number of branches he climbed by dividing the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\text{Total money made}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} \]

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = 420 \]

Since he made this amount of money during the week, and there are 7 days in a week, we can find the average number of branches he climbed per day by dividing the total branches climbed by the number of days in the week:

\[ \text{Branches climbed per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches climbed}}{\text{Number of days in a week}} = \frac{420}{7} \]

\[ \text{Branches climbed per day} = 60 \]

So, the average number of branches Felix climbed per day is 60."
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose initially picks:

- For the first 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals.
- For the next 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals.
- For the next 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals.
- For the last 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals.

Adding these together gives the total number of petals before any are dropped:
\[15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\] petals.

Rose drops 1 flower of each type, so she drops:
- 1 flower with 5 petals,
- 1 flower with 6 petals,
- 1 flower with 4 petals,
- 1 flower with 7 petals.

The total number of petals dropped is:
\[5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\] petals.

"First, let's determine the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean to make S'mores. John makes 9 S'mores and DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so together they make:

\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \text{ S'mores} \]

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they use 18 marshmallows in total. They started with 35 marshmallows and dropped 3 on the ground, so the number of marshmallows left is:

\[ 35 - 18 - 3 = 14 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Now, we need to determine how many S'mores they can make with the remaining 14 marshmallows. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they can make:

\[ 14 \text{ S'mores} \]

Since John and DeSean are sharing the remaining marshmallows equally, each of them can have:

\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ S'mores} \]

2. \( O = 2S \) (twice as much oil as salt)
3. \( F = C \) (same amount of fragrance as citrus zest)
4. \( S = C \) (same amount of salt as citrus zest)

Since \( S = C \) and \( F = C \), we can say \( S = F = C \).

The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, so we can write the equation:
\[ S + O + F + C + G = 10 \]

Substituting the relationships into the equation:
\[ S + 2S + S + S + S = 10 \]
\[ 6S = 10 \]
\[ S = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \]

Since \( O = 2S \):
\[ O = 2 \times \frac{5}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \]

Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \( \frac{10}{3} \) ounces. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \frac{10}{3} \]"

"First, let's determine how many cars Joe initially has. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find out how many cars he sells, we calculate 20% of 40:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

After selling 8 cars, Joe has:

\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \text{ cars} \]

Then, Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

After giving away 16 cars, Joe has:

\[ 32 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, the final number of cars Joe remains with is:

\[ 16 \]"
"To find out how much each student raised, we first need to determine the total amount of money raised by the students. The total amount raised by the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of this came from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to divide this amount by the number of students to find out how much each student raised. There are 20 students, so we calculate:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

Thus, each student raised $6,250."
"To calculate the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days in minutes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the time Sandy walked on the first day.
2. Determine the time Sandy walked on the second day.
3. Convert the time from hours to minutes for both days.
4. Sum the total time in minutes.

First, Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day.

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she did on the first day. Therefore, the time she walked on the second day is:
\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour.

For the first day:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes} \]

For the second day:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we sum the total time in minutes for both days:
\[ 480 \text{ minutes} + 240 \text{ minutes} = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is:
\[ 720 \text{ minutes} \]"

2. **Additional Cars During First Break**: During the first break, he counted 20 more cars. So, the total number of cars after the first break is:
   \[
   50 + 20 = 70
   \]
3. **Cars Gone During Lunch Break**: When he got out of class for the lunch break, he realized that half of the cars had gone. Therefore, the number of cars that remained in the parking lot is:
   \[
   \frac{70}{2} = 35
   \]

Thus, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35."
"To calculate John's earnings for a full 7-day week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. **Calculate the daily earnings:**
   - John does 30 cycles of work a day.
   - Each cycle has 5 different tasks.
   - Each task pays $1.20.
   - Therefore, the earnings per cycle = 5 tasks * $1.20/task = $6.00.
   - Daily earnings = 30 cycles/day * $6.00/cycle = $180.00.

2. **Calculate the weekly earnings:**
   - John works 7 days a week.
   - Weekly earnings = Daily earnings * 7 days = $180.00/day * 7 days = $1260.00.

So, John makes $1260.00 if he works a full 7-day week."
"First, let's determine the points scored by Sasha and Julie in the first game.

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, so:
\[ \text{Julie's points in the first game} = 14 - 4 = 10 \]

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie did in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored:
\[ \text{Sasha's points in the second game} = 10 - 6 = 4 \]

Now, let's calculate the total points Sasha scored during both games:
\[ \text{Total points scored by Sasha} = 14 + 4 = 18 \]

"First, let's calculate the total number of tins of cat food Kimberly bought. She bought 8 packages of cat food, and each package contains 11 tins.

\[ \text{Total tins of cat food} = 8 \times 11 = 88 \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of tins of dog food Kimberly bought. She bought 6 packages of dog food, and each package contains 6 tins.

\[ \text{Total tins of dog food} = 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

Now, to find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we subtract the total number of tins of dog food from the total number of tins of cat food.

\[ \text{Difference} = 88 - 36 = 52 \]

So, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now we know PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards. Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

So, the number of cards Becca has is 153."
"First, let's determine the number of each color of eggs Cindy has:

- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: twice as many as green eggs, so \(2 \times 5 = 10\)
- Pink eggs: one fewer than blue eggs, so \(10 - 1 = 9\)
- Yellow eggs: one-third as many as pink eggs, so \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\)

Now, let's add up all the eggs:

- Total eggs = Green eggs + Blue eggs + Pink eggs + Yellow eggs
- Total eggs = 5 + 10 + 9 + 3

Let's calculate the total:
```python
# Number of each color of eggs
green_eggs = 5
blue_eggs = 2 * green_eggs
pink_eggs = blue_eggs - 1
yellow_eggs = pink_eggs // 3

# Total number of eggs
total_eggs = green_eggs + blue_eggs + pink_eggs + yellow_eggs
total_eggs

"First, let's calculate the shipping cost. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound plus $0.08 per mile.

The cost for the weight of the book is:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.35/\text{pound} = \$1.40 \]

The cost for the distance is:
\[ 20 \text{ miles} \times \$0.08/\text{mile} = \$1.60 \]

So, the total shipping cost is:
\[ \$1.40 + \$1.60 = \$3.00 \]

Next, we calculate the refundable amount from Amazon. Since Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, the refundable amount is:
\[ 32 \text{ dollars} \times 0.75 = \$24.00 \]

Now, we calculate the total cost Milly will incur:
\[ \text{Cost of the book} + \text{Shipping cost} = 32 \text{ dollars} + 3 \text{ dollars} = \$35.00 \]

Finally, the amount of money Milly will lose is the total cost minus the refundable amount:
\[ 35 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = \$11.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from Pompei's lifting capacity to Naruto's.

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain \(12 \times 1 = 12\) inches high.
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain \(4 \times 12 = 48\) inches high.
4. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain \(10 \times 48 = 480\) inches high.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert 480 inches to feet:

\[ 480 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total distance Mason has traveled, we can use the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

First, we calculate the distance he travels in the first 4 hours:

\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance he travels in the next 6 hours:

\[ \text{Distance}_2 = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we add the two distances together to find the total distance traveled:

\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the total distance Mason has traveled is 80 miles."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total distance traveled by the kangaroos:**
   - Let the distance across the highway be \( D \).
   - Let the speed of each kangaroo be \( v \).
   - Since it takes 3 kangaroos 18 hours to travel the distance \( D \), the total distance \( D \) can be calculated as:
     \[
     D = 3v \times 18 = 54v
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of each turtle:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of each turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).

3. **Calculate the time it takes for four turtles to travel the distance \( D \):**
   - Let \( t \) be the time it takes for four turtles to travel the distance \( D \).
   - The total distance \( D \) can also be expressed as:
     \[
     D = 4 \times \left(\frac{v}{2}\right) \times t = 2vt
     \]
   - Since we know \( D = 54v \), we can set the two expressions for \( D \) equal to each other:
     \[
     54v = 2vt
     \]
   - Solving for \( t \):
     \[
     t = \frac{54v}{2v} = 27
     \]

Therefore, it will take four turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway."

"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to have to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to calculate the current daily milk production and then find out how much additional milk is needed.

The current daily milk production from 3 cows is:
\[ 3 \text{ cows} \times 5 \text{ liters/cow} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The additional milk needed is:
\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed to produce the additional 10 liters of milk is:

"First, let's determine the number of goats sold from each farm.

From Farm X, Mr. Smith sold 10 goats.

From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats as from Farm X, which means he sold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) goats.

Now, let's calculate the number of goats remaining in each farm.

Initially, Farm X had 55 goats. After selling 10 goats, the number of goats left in Farm X is:
\[ 55 - 10 = 45 \]

Initially, Farm Y had 45 goats. After selling 20 goats, the number of goats left in Farm Y is:
\[ 45 - 20 = 25 \]

To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the remaining goats from Farm X and Farm Y:
\[ 45 + 25 = 70 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
2. Divide the total amount spent on shoes by the total number of pairs bought.

James buys 2 pairs of shoes each month. There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of pairs of shoes he buys in a year is:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair of shoes, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs bought:
\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

So, the average amount James pays for each pair of shoes is:
\[ 110 \text{ dollars} \]"

1. In the first year, they will build 12 homes.
2. In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year. So, they will build \(3 \times 12 = 36\) homes.
3. In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total number of homes built in the first two years is \(12 + 36 = 48\). Therefore, in the third year, they will build \(2 \times 48 = 96\) homes.

Now, let's sum the homes built over the three years:
\[12 + 36 + 96 = 144\]

The total number of homes built over the next three years is 144."
"Let's denote the ages as follows:
- Let \( S \) be my age.
- Let \( B \) be my brother's age.
- Let \( M \) be my mom's age.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. I am three years younger than my brother: \( S = B - 3 \)
2. I am two years older than my sister: \( S = T + 2 \), where \( T \) is my sister's age.
3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age: \( M = 3B - 1 \)
4. The sum of our ages is 87: \( S + B + T + M = 87 \)

Since \( S = T + 2 \), we can substitute \( T \) with \( S - 2 \). Now, we can substitute \( S \), \( B \), and \( M \) in the sum equation:

\[ S + B + (S - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ S + B + S - 2 + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 2S + 4B - 3 = 87 \]
\[ 2S + 4B = 90 \]
\[ S + 2B = 45 \]

We also know from the first relationship that \( S = B - 3 \). Substitute \( S \) in the equation \( S + 2B = 45 \):

\[ (B - 3) + 2B = 45 \]
\[ 3B - 3 = 45 \]
\[ 3B = 48 \]
\[ B = 16 \]

Now, we can find \( S \):

\[ S = B - 3 \]
\[ S = 16 - 3 \]
\[ S = 13 \]

So, I am 13 years old. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first calculate the total number of glue sticks required for the class. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks needed is:

\[ 27 \times 2 = 54 \]

Next, we need to figure out how many packs of glue sticks are required to get at least 54 glue sticks. Since glue sticks come in packs of 8, we divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:

\[ \frac{54}{8} = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks. To ensure he has enough glue sticks, we calculate the total number of glue sticks in 7 packs:

\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 \]

Since 56 is more than the 54 glue sticks needed, Mr. Jackson will have 2 extra glue sticks. Thus, the number of packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy is:

\[ 7 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 7 \]"

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of new infections each day and add them to the total number of infected people.

- **Day 0**: Initially, there are 10 infected people.
- **Day 1**: Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others, so the number of new infections is \(10 \times 6 = 60\). Therefore, the total number of infected people after Day 1 is \(10 + 60 = 70\).
- **Day 2**: Now there are 70 infected people, and each of them infects 6 others. So, the number of new infections is \(70 \times 6 = 420\). Therefore, the total number of infected people after Day 2 is \(70 + 420 = 490\).
- **Day 3**: Now there are 490 infected people, and each of them infects 6 others. So, the number of new infections is \(490 \times 6 = 2940\). Therefore, the total number of infected people after Day 3 is \(490 + 2940 = 3430\).

So, the total number of people infected after three days is 3430."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Rafaela received as tips. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate the total as follows:

\[ \text{Total tips for Rafaela} = 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Julieta received. Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To find out how much less, we calculate 10% of Rafaela's total tips:

\[ \text{10% of Rafaela's tips} = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]

So, Julieta received:

\[ \text{Total tips for Julieta} = 800 - 80 = 720 \]

Now, to find the total amount of money both Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether, we add their individual totals:

\[ \text{Total tips for both} = 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of books that Anne has as \( A \). According to the problem, Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has \( A + 25 \) books. Additionally, Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Fawn has \( A + 12 \) books.

The total number of books that Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have together is 85. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (A + 25) + A + (A + 12) = 85 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ A + 25 + A + A + 12 = 85 \]
\[ 3A + 37 = 85 \]

Next, we solve for \( A \):

\[ 3A = 85 - 37 \]
\[ 3A = 48 \]
\[ A = \frac{48}{3} \]
\[ A = 16 \]

So, Anne has 16 books. Since Fawn has 12 more books than Anne, we calculate the number of books Fawn has as follows:

\[ Fawn = A + 12 = 16 + 12 = 28 \]

Therefore, Fawn has 28 books. The final numerical answer is:

2. **Chicken:**
   - Kelly has 6 packets of chicken.
   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - The cost per packet of chicken is $2 * 2 = $4.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the chicken is 6 * $4 = $24.

3. **Strawberries:**
   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries.
   - Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the strawberries is 3 * $4 = $12.

4. **Apples:**
   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples.
   - Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   - The price of each pack of apples is $4 / 2 = $2.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the apples is 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's sum up the total cost of all the items:
- Total cost of bacon: $10
- Total cost of chicken: $24
- Total cost of strawberries: $12
- Total cost of apples: $14

The total cost of all items is $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60.

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget:
- Money left = $65 - $60 = $5.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the usual runtime of Elaina's concerts as \( x \) minutes. According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, so the final concert is \( 2x \) minutes long. Additionally, at the end of the final concert, she performs a 15-minute encore. Therefore, the total runtime of the final concert, including the encore, is \( 2x + 15 \) minutes. We are given that the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. So, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual runtime of Elaina's concerts is 25 minutes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 25 \]"

- On Wednesdays, they make 125 chimichangas.
- On Fridays, they make twice as many as on Tuesdays, which is \(2 \times 125 = 250\) chimichangas.

Now, let's add the number of chimichangas made on each of these days:

\[ 125 \text{ (Tuesdays)} + 125 \text{ (Wednesdays)} + 250 \text{ (Fridays)} = 500 \]

So, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many microphones are left after accounting for the 20% that won't fit in pairs.

First, calculate 20% of the 50 microphones:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

This means 10 microphones won't fit in pairs. Therefore, the number of microphones that can be paired is:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Now, to find out how many pairs of microphones can be arranged, we divide the number of microphones that can be paired by 2:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

"First, let's determine the number of birds flying overhead. Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes. According to the problem, 2/3 of that number of birds are flying overhead. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of birds flying overhead} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of birds feeding. Jerry counts 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of birds feeding} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, we sum up all the birds Jerry counts:

\[ \text{Total number of birds} = \text{Number of birds nesting} + \text{Number of birds flying overhead} + \text{Number of birds feeding} \]
\[ \text{Total number of birds} = 6 + 4 + 24 = 34 \]

"First, let's calculate the total number of petals on the orchids. Joelle has 5 orchids, and each orchid has 5 petals. So, the total number of petals on the orchids is:

\[ 5 \text{ orchids} \times 5 \text{ petals/orchid} = 25 \text{ petals} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals on the African daisies. Joelle has 4 African daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals. So, the total number of petals on the daisies is:

\[ 4 \text{ daisies} \times 10 \text{ petals/daisy} = 40 \text{ petals} \]

Now, to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies:

\[ 40 \text{ petals} - 25 \text{ petals} = 15 \text{ petals} \]

So, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants, so we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. We find the number of flowering plants by subtracting the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:

\[ \text{Number of flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25 \]

To find what percent of the total plants are flowering plants, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how fast a whirligig spins, we need to first determine the speed of the thingamabob. We know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, we can calculate the speed of the thingamabob as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{\text{Speed of whatchamacallit}}{11} = \frac{121 \text{ meters/second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters/second} \]

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can determine the speed of the whirligig. We know that a whirligig spins five times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of the whirligig is:

\[ \text{Speed of whirligig} = 5 \times \text{Speed of thingamabob} = 5 \times 11 \text{ meters/second} = 55 \text{ meters/second} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this, let's first determine how much Tasha earned from mowing lawns.

Given:
- Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's lawn.
- Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's lawn.
- Joe paid Tasha $6 for mowing his lawn.

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( x \).

Then:
- The number of times she mowed Kamala's lawn is \( 3x \).
- The number of times she mowed Alba's lawn is \( 5x \).

The total earnings from mowing lawns can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Total earnings from mowing lawns} = 6x + 6(3x) + 6(5x) \]
\[ = 6x + 18x + 30x \]
\[ = 54x \]

Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. Therefore, the earnings from mowing lawns alone is:
\[ 54x = 54 \]

To find \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{54}{54} = 1 \]

Now, we can calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns:
\[ 54x = 54 \times 1 = 54 \]

Subtracting the earnings from mowing lawns from the total earnings gives the earnings from lemonade sales:
\[ \text{Earnings from lemonade sales} = 80 - 54 = 26 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine Carl's weight. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, we can calculate Carl's weight as follows:

Carl's weight = Martin's weight + 16 kg
Carl's weight = 55 kg + 16 kg
Carl's weight = 71 kg

Next, we find Christian's weight. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight:

Christian's weight = Carl's weight + 8 kg
Christian's weight = 71 kg + 8 kg
Christian's weight = 79 kg

Finally, we determine Harry's weight. Harry is 5 kg less than Christian's weight:

Harry's weight = Christian's weight - 5 kg
Harry's weight = 79 kg - 5 kg
Harry's weight = 74 kg

The weight of Harry is 74 kg."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours John rents his car out in a month. He rents his car 10 times a month, and each time for 3 hours. So, the total number of hours rented in a month is:

\[ 10 \text{ times/month} \times 3 \text{ hours/time} = 30 \text{ hours/month} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money John earns from renting his car in a month. He gets paid $25 per hour, so:

\[ 30 \text{ hours/month} \times 25 \text{ dollars/hour} = 750 \text{ dollars/month} \]

"To find the total distance Dijana and Anis rowed on that Sunday, we first need to calculate the distance Anis rowed.

Dijana rowed 50 miles.

Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. This means Anis rowed 50 miles plus an additional 1/5 of 50 miles.

First, calculate 1/5 of 50 miles:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles} \]

So, Anis rowed:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Now, to find the total distance both rowed, we add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis:

"First, let's determine how many pages each person read over the two days.

Yesterday:
- Denise read 10 pages.
- Daniel read 13 pages.

Today:
- Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.
- Daniel was not able to read any pages today, so he read 0 pages today.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages each person read over the two days:
- Denise's total: \(10 + 18 = 28\) pages.
- Daniel's total: \(13 + 0 = 13\) pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total number of pages Daniel read from the total number of pages Denise read:

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup, we need to first understand the capacity of the pot in terms of adult and child bowls.

The pot can fill:
- 4 adult's bowls
- 8 child's bowls

Since Calvin is an adult, he will have one bowl of soup. His wife is also an adult, so she will have one bowl of soup as well. This accounts for 2 adult bowls. The remaining bowls will be for the two children.

The pot can fill 8 child's bowls, and we have already used 2 adult bowls (1 for Calvin and 1 for his wife). Therefore, the remaining bowls are:
\[ 8 - 2 = 6 \text{ child's bowls} \]

Since there are two children, we need to determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup. We divide the remaining bowls by the number of children:
\[ \frac{6 \text{ child's bowls}}{2 \text{ children}} = 3 \text{ times} \]

Thus, each child can have a bowl of soup 3 times. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the amount of material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we can break down the problem into two parts: the material needed for the small masks and the material needed for the large masks.

First, let's calculate the material needed for the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4} = 0.5 \text{ yards} \).
- For 20 small masks, the material needed is \( 20 \times 0.5 \text{ yards} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

Next, let's calculate the material needed for the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3} = 0.75 \text{ yards} \).
- For 8 large masks, the material needed is \( 8 \times 0.75 \text{ yards} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

Now, we add the material needed for the small masks and the large masks:
- Total material needed = material for small masks + material for large masks
- Total material needed = 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards.

The final numerical answer is 16 yards."

"To solve this problem, let's establish the ages of Duncan and Adam based on the information provided.

1. Duncan's current age is 60 years.
2. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \(60 - 8 = 52\) years.
3. Let Adam's current age be \(A\).
4. Four years ago, Adam's age was \(A - 4\).

According to the problem, eight years ago, Duncan's age was two times Adam's age four years ago. This gives us the equation:

Now, let's solve for \(A\):
\[52 = 2A - 8\]
\[52 + 8 = 2A\]
\[60 = 2A\]
\[A = 30\]

So, Adam's current age is 30 years. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

"Let's denote the number of red balloons as \( R \) and the number of yellow balloons as \( Y \). According to the problem, \( R = 20 \).

Benny threw two pieces of bologna at each red balloon, so the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is \( 2R \). Given that \( R = 20 \), the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \).

The total number of pieces of bologna thrown at all balloons is 58. Therefore, the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons is \( 58 - 40 = 18 \).

Since Benny threw three pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, the number of yellow balloons \( Y \) can be found by dividing the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons by 3. So, \( Y = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).

Thus, the number of yellow balloons is 6. The final numerical answer is:

2. **Dogs**: Larry has 3 times as many dogs as cats. Therefore, the number of dogs is \(3 \times 3 = 9\).
3. **Rabbits**: Larry has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. Therefore, the number of rabbits is \(9 - 2 = 7\).
4. **Fish**: Larry has three times the number of fish as rabbits. Therefore, the number of fish is \(3 \times 7 = 21\).
5. **Gerbils**: Larry has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has. Therefore, the number of gerbils is \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\).

Now, let's sum up all the pets:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Total number of pets = \(3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47\).

The final numerical answer is 47."
"Josh can eat 2 * 2 = 4 slices a day.

Together, Abby and Josh can eat 2 + 4 = 6 slices a day.

The loaf of bread has 24 slices, so it will last 24 / 6 = 4 days.

The final numerical answer is 4."
"Martha collects shells every month. She started collecting at age 5 and her 10th birthday marks the end of her collection period. To find out how many months she collected shells, we calculate the difference in age and then subtract one month (since she started collecting at age 5, not at age 4).

Age difference: 10 - 5 = 5 years
Number of months: 5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months

Therefore, by her 10th birthday, Martha will have collected 60 shells."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total cups of tea**: Lana has 27 cups of tea.
2. **Rows of tea cups**: She divides these cups into 3 rows, so each row has \( \frac{27}{3} = 9 \) cups.
3. **Tea types in each row**: In each row, she brews an equal amount of chamomile and mint tea. Therefore, each row has \( \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \) cups of chamomile tea and \( \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \) cups of mint tea.
4. **Cups of cinnamon tea**: She uses the remaining cups to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea. Since she has 27 cups in total and 15 of these are cinnamon tea, the remaining \( 27 - 15 = 12 \) cups are for chamomile and mint tea.

Since each row has 9 cups and half of these are mint tea, each row has 4.5 cups of mint tea.

The final numerical answer is:
4.5"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground, given that he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

First, let's break down the time spent on each trip:
- The sloth takes 4 hours to make the trip down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up into his tree.

Since the sloth needs to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we need to find out how many trips he can make in that time.

The total time available is 8 hours, and each trip takes 4 hours. Therefore, the number of trips he can make in 8 hours is:
\[ \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips} \]

Since he needs to collect 24 berries in 8 hours and he can make 2 trips in that time, the number of berries he needs to pick up per trip is:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip} \]

Thus, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip down to the ground is:
\[ 12 \]"
"First, we need to determine the amount of water in the tank. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons of water, the tank will have:

\[ \text{Tank capacity} = \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much water will be left in the tank after 6 days, given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. The total amount of water removed from the tank over 6 days is:

\[ \text{Total water removed} = 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[ \text{Remaining water} = 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2000 \]"
"To determine how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate his remaining budget after accounting for the items he has already purchased.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items he has already bought:
- 2 tubs of popcorn: \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars
- 4 boxes of candy: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars

Total cost of these items: \(16 + 8 = 24\) dollars

Colby's total monthly budget is $150. After spending $24, his remaining budget is:
\[ 150 - 24 = 126 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money he can spend on tickets. Since it is a Friday, the ticket price is $10. He has already seen 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, and 8 movies on other days, so the total number of movies he has already seen is:
\[ 5 + 8 = 13 \text{ movies} \]

The cost of these movies is:
\[ 13 \times 10 = 130 \text{ dollars} \]

Since he has already spent $130 on tickets, he cannot afford any more tickets with his remaining $126. Therefore, the number of additional movies he can see is:
\[ \frac{126}{10} = 12.6 \]

Since he can only see whole movies, he can see 12 more movies.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"First, we need to calculate the calories for the mini versions of the pastries.

For the mini cinnamon rolls:
- A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
- A mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll.
- Therefore, a mini cinnamon roll has \( \frac{600}{3} = 200 \) calories.
- Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls.
- So, the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls are \( 200 \times 200 = 40000 \) calories.

For the mini blueberry muffins:
- A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
- A mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin.
- Therefore, a mini blueberry muffin has \( \frac{450}{3} = 150 \) calories.
- Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins.
- So, the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins are \( 300 \times 150 = 45000 \) calories.

Now, we add the total calories from both the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins:
- Total calories = \( 40000 + 45000 = 85000 \) calories.

The final numerical answer is:
85000"
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the five days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, which is \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs per day. Therefore, for both Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed \(78 + 78 = 156\) Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, we sum the number of Junebugs removed over the five days:
\[39 + 156 + 48 + 57\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[39 + 156 = 195\]
\[195 + 48 = 243\]
\[243 + 57 = 300\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days is 300.

To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days (which is 5):
\[\frac{300}{5} = 60\]

Thus, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"To find out how much farther the bus traveled than the car, we first need to calculate the distance each traveled.

The distance traveled by the bus can be calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For the bus:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

For the car:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find out how much farther the bus traveled than the car:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to calculate the difference between the total number of toys Sophie has and the sum of the toys she already had.

The total number of toys Sophie has is 62.

The number of building blocks is 31.
The number of stuffed animals is 8.
The number of stacking rings is 9.

First, we add the number of building blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings:
\[ 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 \]

Next, we subtract this sum from the total number of toys to find out how many bouncy balls there are:
\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

Therefore, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is 14."
"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old:
   \[
   P + Pa + J = 100
   \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   Pa = J + 10
   \]

3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = Pa + J
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now, we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, we can find Paul's age:
\[
Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]

And Peter's age:
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

So, the age of Peter is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"Initially, Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons, so that's 4 friends * 2 balloons/friend = 8 balloons. Maria also received 2 balloons, so the total number of balloons at this point is 8 (for friends) + 2 (for Maria) = 10 balloons.

Then, her mom gave each person 3 more balloons. There are 4 friends + 1 Maria = 5 people in total. So, 5 people * 3 balloons/person = 15 additional balloons.

Adding the additional balloons to the initial total, we get 10 (initial total) + 15 (additional balloons) = 25 balloons.

The final numerical answer is 25."
"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes of stuff they have:

- 10 people donate 5 boxes each: \(10 \times 5 = 50\) boxes
- They already have 10 boxes
- Total boxes of stuff: \(50 + 10 = 60\) boxes

Next, we need to determine how many tables they need to fit all the boxes:

- They can fit 2 boxes per table
- Total number of tables needed: \(\frac{60}{2} = 30\) tables

They already own 15 tables, so we need to find out how many more tables they need:

- Tables needed: 30
- Tables they already have: 15
- Additional tables needed: \(30 - 15 = 15\) tables

The final numerical answer is 15."
"First, let's calculate the total distance Zoey spits her seeds. Zoey has 40 seeds and spits each one 10 feet. So, the total distance Zoey spits is:

\[ 40 \text{ seeds} \times 10 \text{ feet/seed} = 400 \text{ feet} \]

Next, let's calculate the total distance Sydney spits her seeds. Sydney has 35 seeds and spits each one 12 feet. So, the total distance Sydney spits is:

\[ 35 \text{ seeds} \times 12 \text{ feet/seed} = 420 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we need to find the average total distance spat by both Zoey and Sydney. To do this, we add the total distances and divide by the number of people (which is 2):

\[ \text{Average total distance} = \frac{400 \text{ feet} + 420 \text{ feet}}{2} = \frac{820 \text{ feet}}{2} = 410 \text{ feet} \]

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the daily, monthly, and hourly widget production and sales revenue for each machine.

First, let's calculate the daily widget production for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1440 widgets/day
- WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1080 widgets/day

Next, let's calculate the monthly widget production for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: 1440 widgets/day * 30 days/month = 43200 widgets/month
- WidgetMaster 9000: 1080 widgets/day * 30 days/month = 32400 widgets/month

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the widgets for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: 43200 widgets/month * $6/widget = $259200/month
- WidgetMaster 9000: 32400 widgets/month * $6/widget = $194400/month

Finally, let's find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000:

The final numerical answer is $64800."
"To determine how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the total cost of his stay under both options and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost if Cameron chooses the 24-hour option:
- The initial 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos.
- The additional 12 hours (24-hour stay) cost 1600 pesos.
- Therefore, the total cost for the 24-hour option is 1000 + 1600 = 2600 pesos.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Cameron chooses the option of adding 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark:
- Cameron stays from 5 pm to 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours.
- The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos.
- The additional 5 hours cost 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.
- Therefore, the total cost for the 17-hour option is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Now, we find the savings by subtracting the total cost of the 17-hour option from the total cost of the 24-hour option:
- Savings = 2600 - 1350 = 1250 pesos.

The final numerical answer is:
1250"
"First, let's determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. So, we calculate twice the amount each goat needs and then subtract 3 pounds:

\[ \text{Hay per sheep} = 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep. There are 15 goats, and each needs 5 pounds of hay:

\[ \text{Hay for goats} = 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

There are 12 sheep, and each needs 7 pounds of hay:

\[ \text{Hay for sheep} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the hay needed for the goats and the sheep gives us the total amount of hay needed:

\[ \text{Total hay} = 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 159 \]"
"First, let's calculate John's earnings for the week:
\[ \text{Earnings} = \text{Hourly Wage} \times \text{Hours Worked} = 50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the gas:
\[ \text{Cost of Gas} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the remaining money after spending on gas:
\[ \text{Remaining Money} = \text{Earnings} - \text{Cost of Gas} = 300 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so we subtract that from the remaining money:
\[ \text{Money After Deposit} = \text{Remaining Money} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the pencils:
\[ \text{Cost of Pencils} = \text{Number of Pencils} \times \text{Cost per Pencil} = 5 \times 10 \text{ dollars} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the cost of the pencils from the money after the deposit:
\[ \text{Money After Buying Pencils} = \text{Money After Deposit} - \text{Cost of Pencils} = 150 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, let's determine how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with the remaining money:

"First, let's calculate the distance James swims. He swims 60% of the 20-mile lake, which is:

\[ 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes for James to swim 12 miles at a pace of 2 miles per hour:

\[ \text{Time to swim 12 miles} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

James then rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is:

\[ \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

After resting, James swims the remaining 8 miles (20 miles - 12 miles) at half the speed, which is:

\[ \text{Speed for the remaining distance} = \frac{2 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile/hour} \]

The time it takes for James to swim the remaining 8 miles at 1 mile per hour is:

\[ \text{Time to swim remaining 8 miles} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, the total time it took James to get across the lake is the sum of the swimming time, the resting time, and the swimming time for the remaining distance:

\[ \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours} \]

"Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as \( A \), by Dinar as \( D \), and by Bahati as \( B \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Bahati scored the most points, so \( B > A \) and \( B > D \).
2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so \( B = A + 20 \).
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, so \( B = D + 10 \).

We also know the total points scored by the three individuals is 45:
\[ A + B + D = 45 \]

Since \( B = A + 20 \) and \( B = D + 10 \), we can set these two expressions for \( B \) equal to each other:
\[ A + 20 = D + 10 \]
Solving for \( D \) in terms of \( A \):
\[ D = A + 10 \]

Now we substitute \( B = A + 20 \) and \( D = A + 10 \) into the total points equation:
\[ A + (A + 20) + (A + 10) = 45 \]
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]
Subtract 30 from both sides:
\[ 3A = 15 \]
Divide by 3:
\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of reports Vince can staple from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM.

First, calculate the total time Vince was stapling reports:
- From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Next, convert the total time into minutes:
- 15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes.

Now, determine how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:
- 900 minutes / 15 minutes/interval = 60 intervals.

Since Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes, we can calculate the total number of reports he stapled:
- 60 intervals * 30 reports/interval = 1800 reports.

Therefore, the total number of reports Vince stapled is 1800."
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up early.

1. **Total sleep time**: Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Converting this to minutes:
   \[
   8 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Time spent sleepwalking**: Kim sleepwalked from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. The duration of sleepwalking is:
   \[
   2:38 \text{ a.m.} - 2:15 \text{ a.m.} = 23 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Time woke up early**: Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. This means she woke up at:
   \[
   6:00 \text{ a.m.} - 5 \text{ minutes} = 5:55 \text{ a.m.}
   \]
   The time she was awake before waking up early is:
   \[
   5:55 \text{ a.m.} - 6:00 \text{ a.m.} = 5 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Total time awake**: Adding the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up early:
   \[
   23 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 28 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Time slept on the bed**: Subtracting the total time awake from the total sleep time:
   \[
   480 \text{ minutes} - 28 \text{ minutes} = 452 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Therefore, the number of minutes Kim slept on her bed that day is 452 minutes."
"First, let's determine the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has initially. Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has two dozen (24) measuring cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons as follows:

\[ \text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

Next, Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons. So, the number of measuring spoons he has remaining is:

\[ \text{Remaining measuring spoons} = 16 - 6 = 10 \]

Now, we add the remaining measuring spoons to the number of measuring cups to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining:

\[ \text{Total utensils} = \text{Remaining measuring spoons} + \text{Measuring cups} = 10 + 24 = 34 \]

So, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is 34."
"First, let's determine the initial number of occupied beds in the hospital. The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of these beds are occupied.

\[ \text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

Next, we calculate the number of beds that are unoccupied initially.

\[ \text{Initial unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 200 = 800 \]

Now, we need to determine the number of patients admitted over 2 weeks. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, and 50 patients are admitted each day.

\[ \text{Total patients admitted in 2 weeks} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

We then calculate the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks by subtracting the total number of patients admitted from the initial number of unoccupied beds.

\[ \text{Unoccupied beds after 2 weeks} = 800 - 700 = 100 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 100 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of emails Robyn sends to her family. We know that out of the sixteen emails, seven are work emails. Therefore, the number of emails that are not work emails is:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these nine emails are sent to her family. According to the problem, two-thirds of the remaining emails are to her family. So, the number of emails sent to her family is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

Now, we need to find out how many emails are left after sending emails to her family. This is:

\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

These three remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. According to the problem, one-third of these remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. So, the number of emails sent to her boyfriend is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

Therefore, the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day is:

\[ 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

The final numerical answer is 45."
"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate the number that is 20% less than the number Courtney reported.

Courtney reported 48 people attended the concert. If this number is 20% more than the actual number, we can set up the following equation to find the actual number of attendees:

\[ \text{Actual number of attendees} = \frac{\text{Number reported by Courtney}}{1 + \text{Percentage overstatement}} \]

Here, the number reported by Courtney is 48, and the percentage overstatement is 20%, or 0.20 in decimal form. Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Actual number of attendees} = \frac{48}{1 + 0.20} = \frac{48}{1.20} \]

Now, we perform the division:

\[ \text{Actual number of attendees} = \frac{48}{1.20} = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \). According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls. We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so we can set up the equation:

\[ 2J = 2 \]

Solving for \( J \):

\[ J = 1 \]

Now we can determine how many balls each boy carried:
- Jeffrey carried \( J = 1 \) ball.
- Jason carried \( 2J = 2 \) balls.
- Jordan carried \( 4J = 4 \times 1 = 4 \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is:

\[ 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 7."
"To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the number of holes at the end of the first day.
3. Calculate the number of holes at the end of the third day.
4. Find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
- First day: 10 holes
- Second day: 13 holes
- Third day: 8 holes (but they filled in 2 holes, so they actually dug 8 - 2 = 6 holes)

Total holes by the end of the third day = 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 holes.

The island had four times as many holes by the end of the third day as it did at the end of the first day. So, the number of holes at the end of the first day is:
\[ \text{Holes at the end of the first day} = \frac{29}{4} = 7.25 \]

Since the number of holes must be a whole number, and considering the context of digging holes, it's reasonable to assume the number of holes at the end of the first day is 7 (as 7.25 would imply a fractional hole, which is not practical in this context).

Now, let's find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day. The number of holes at the end of the third day is 29, and the number of holes at the end of the fourth day is:
\[ \text{Holes at the end of the fourth day} = 4 \times 7 = 28 \]

So, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[ \text{Holes dug on the fourth day} = 29 - 28 = 1 \]

Therefore, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of corn chips given the conditions.

1. Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips.
2. Collins received 15 more corn chips than the number Amora and Lainey received.

First, calculate the number of corn chips Collins received:
\[ \text{Collins' chips} = 70 + 15 = 85 \]

Next, calculate the total number of corn chips by summing the chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:
\[ \text{Total chips} = 70 + 70 + 85 \]

Now, perform the addition:
\[ 70 + 70 = 140 \]
\[ 140 + 85 = 225 \]

Therefore, the total number of corn chips is:
\[ 225 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 225 \]"
"To find the cost of the travel tickets, we first need to calculate 50% more than the cost of the supplies. The supplies cost $400 in total.

50% of $400 is calculated as:
\[ 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the cost of the travel tickets is:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Therefore, the travel cost is $600."
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( X = S + 5 \)
2. \( S = 4A - 13 \)
3. \( X + S + A = 339 \)

First, we substitute the expressions for \( X \) and \( S \) from the first two equations into the third equation.

Substituting \( X = S + 5 \) and \( S = 4A - 13 \) into \( X + S + A = 339 \):

\[ (4A - 13) + 5 + (4A - 13) + A = 339 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 4A - 13 + 5 + 4A - 13 + A = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Add 21 to both sides:

\[ 9A = 360 \]

Divide by 9:

\[ A = 40 \]

Now, we can find \( S \) using \( S = 4A - 13 \):

\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

The final numerical answer is:
147"

1. Each episode is 20 minutes long.
2. Let \( E \) represent the total number of episodes.
3. According to the problem, there are half as many episodes in total as there are minutes per episode. This can be expressed as:
   \[
   E = \frac{20}{2} = 10
   \]
4. Now, to find out how many minutes John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode:

   \]

Therefore, the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show is 200."
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance the bird traveled in each leg of the journey and then sum these distances.

1. **First Leg:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Second Leg:**
   - Direction: Norttherly
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \)

3. **Third Leg:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \)

Now, we sum the distances of all three legs to find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes:

\[ 300 \text{ miles} + 36 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 446 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 446 miles."
"First, let's determine the total number of brownies Greta had initially:

- For herself, she made 1 dozen brownies.
- At her office party, she received 1/2 dozen brownies.
- At her friends' surprise party, she received 4 dozen brownies.

To find the total number of brownies, we add these quantities together:

1 dozen + 1/2 dozen + 4 dozen = 1 + 0.5 + 4 = 5.5 dozen

Since 1 dozen equals 12 individual brownies, we convert the total number of brownies from dozens to individual brownies:

5.5 dozen * 12 brownies/dozen = 66 brownies

Next, we account for the brownies eaten during the party:

- 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.
- 1 1/2 dozen equals 1.5 dozen.

Converting 1.5 dozen to individual brownies:

1.5 dozen * 12 brownies/dozen = 18 brownies

Finally, we subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies to find out how many are left:

66 brownies - 18 brownies = 48 brownies

So, the final numerical answer is 48."
"To find the total age of Nani, his brother, and his sister, we need to calculate the ages of each family member and then sum them up.

1. Nani's age is given as 8 years.
2. Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is \( 8 \times 2 = 16 \) years.
3. Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. So, her age is \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \) years.

Now, we sum up the ages of Nani, his brother, and his sister:
\[ 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 \]

The total age of all three family members is 30."
"To find the total time Andy will take to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of racquet and then sum them up.

For synthetic gut:
3 racquets * 15 minutes per racquet = 45 minutes

For polyester string:
5 racquets * 22 minutes per racquet = 110 minutes

For hybrid sets:
4 racquets * 18 minutes per racquet = 72 minutes

Now, we sum up the times:
45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes

The final numerical answer is 227 minutes."
"To solve this, let's break down the cost:

1. The first two phones cost $600 each.
2. The third phone is half the price of the first phone, so it costs $600 / 2 = $300.
3. The fourth phone is also half the price of the first phone, so it also costs $300.

Now, let's calculate the total cost:

- Cost of the first phone: $600
- Cost of the second phone: $600
- Cost of the third phone: $300
- Cost of the fourth phone: $300

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 100 \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington initially had and how many she gave away:

- Total boxes bought: 12
- Boxes given to mom: 2
- Boxes given to sister: 2

Total boxes given away = 2 + 2 = 4

Now, let's find out how many boxes Mrs. Harrington kept:

- Total boxes - Boxes given away = Boxes kept
- 12 - 4 = 8 boxes kept

Next, we calculate the total number of oranges in the boxes she kept:

- Each box contains 20 oranges
- 8 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 160 oranges kept

Since Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges, the total number of oranges she originally had is:

- 160 oranges (kept) * 4 = 640 oranges

Finally, we calculate the number of oranges she sold:

- Total oranges - Oranges kept = Oranges sold
- 640 - 160 = 480 oranges sold

So, the final numerical answer is 480 oranges."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the number of states in the USA. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the United States has 50 states.

Given that India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, we can calculate the number of states in India as follows:
- Half the number of states in the USA is \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \).
- India has 4 more than this, so the number of states in India is \( 25 + 4 = 29 \).

Now, to find the total number of states in both countries together, we add the number of states in India and the number of states in the USA:
- Total number of states = Number of states in India + Number of states in the USA
- Total number of states = 29 + 50 = 79

The final numerical answer is 79."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Tyler wants to buy:
- Dictionary: $18
- Dinosaur book: $13
- Children's cookbook: $8

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Tyler has already saved $14. Therefore, the additional amount he needs to earn is:
Additional amount needed = Total cost - Amount saved
Additional amount needed = $39 - $14 = $25

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn the additional $25, we divide the additional amount needed by his hourly wage:
Hours needed = Additional amount needed / Hourly wage
Hours needed = $25 / $5 = 5 hours

So, Tyler has to work 5 hours to afford his books."
"First, let's determine how many cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 30 cherries and has 10 more than Richard, we can calculate Richard's cherries as follows:

\[ \text{Richard's cherries} = \text{Robert's cherries} - 10 = 30 - 10 = 20 \]

Now, we know the total number of cherries is 60. We can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting the number of cherries Richard and Robert have from the total:

\[ \text{Jerry's cherries} = \text{Total cherries} - (\text{Richard's cherries} + \text{Robert's cherries}) = 60 - (20 + 30) = 60 - 50 = 10 \]

Finally, to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Robert's cherries} - \text{Jerry's cherries} = 30 - 10 = 20 \]

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's define the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother as \(D\) and \(B\) respectively.

Given:
- Emil is currently 19 years old.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.

First, let's determine how many years it will be until Emil turns 24:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \text{ years} \]

In 5 years, Emil will be 24 years old. At that time, his dad will be:
\[ D + 5 \]
And Emil will be half the age of his dad:
\[ 24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5) \]
Solving for \(D\):
\[ 24 = \frac{D + 5}{2} \]
\[ 48 = D + 5 \]
\[ D = 43 \]

So, Emil's dad is currently 43 years old.

Next, in 5 years, Emil will be 24 years old. At that time, his brother will be:
\[ B + 5 \]
And Emil will be twice as old as his brother:
\[ 24 = 2 (B + 5) \]
Solving for \(B\):
\[ 24 = 2B + 10 \]
\[ 14 = 2B \]
\[ B = 7 \]

So, Emil's brother is currently 7 years old.

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother:
\[ D + B = 43 + 7 = 50 \]

The sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is:

"First, let's determine the amount of crawfish Joe caught each day:

- On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
- On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.
- On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, which is \(\frac{12}{2} = 6\) pounds.

Next, we'll add up the total amount of crawfish caught over the three days:

\[3 \text{ pounds (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ pounds (Friday)} + 6 \text{ pounds (Saturday)} = 21 \text{ pounds}\]

Now, we need to determine how many servings of crawfish he has. Since each serving is 3 pounds, we divide the total amount of crawfish by the amount per serving:

\[\frac{21 \text{ pounds}}{3 \text{ pounds/serving}} = 7 \text{ servings}\]

"First, let's find out how many students are football players. Since 20% of the class are football players, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 30 = \frac{20}{100} \times 30 = 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are football players. This means the remaining number of students is:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining 24 students are either cheerleaders or part of the band. Since 25% of the remaining students are cheerleaders or part of the band, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 24 = \frac{25}{100} \times 24 = 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are either cheerleaders or part of the band. Adding the football players to these students, we get the total number of students leaving early:

\[ 111 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 1332 \text{ inches} \]

Each flower is 12 inches wide, and there needs to be 1.5 feet of space between each plant. Since 1.5 feet is equivalent to 18 inches, we need to determine how many plants can fit in the flower bed.

Let's denote the number of plants as \( n \). The total space occupied by the plants and the spaces between them can be expressed as:

\[ 12n + 18(n-1) = 1332 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 12n + 18n - 18 = 1332 \]
\[ 30n - 18 = 1332 \]
\[ 30n = 1350 \]
\[ n = 45 \]

So, Pat needs 45 plants. Since Pat already owns 17 plants, she needs to buy:

\[ 45 - 17 = 28 \text{ plants} \]

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for the plants is:

\[ 28 \times 6 = 168 \]

Therefore, Pat will spend $168 at the store to fill up her flower bed."
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we first need to determine how many pretzels his brother eats in a day. Since Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, we can calculate the daily amount for Edgar's brother as follows:

\[ \text{Edgar's brother's daily pretzels} = \frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9 \]

Next, to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we multiply the daily amount by the number of days in a week:

\[ \text{Edgar's brother's weekly pretzels} = 9 \times 7 = 63 \]

So, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week."
"To determine the total cost Katherine will spend, we need to calculate the cost for one basket and then multiply by the number of baskets.

First, let's calculate the cost for one basket:
- Cost of petunias: 3 petunias * $3.00/petunia = $9.00
- Cost of sweet potato vines: 2 sweet potato vines * $2.50/vine = $5.00

Total cost for one basket:
$9.00 (petunias) + $5.00 (sweet potato vines) = $14.00

Now, we need to find the total cost for 5 baskets:
5 baskets * $14.00/basket = $70.00

Therefore, the total amount Katherine will spend is $70.00."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

For the sunflowers:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

For the carnations:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of soil they have is 30 pounds. So, the remaining soil for roses is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. Therefore, the number of roses they can plant is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"First, let's determine how much Jessica sets aside each month for fancy shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly paycheck.

\[ \text{Monthly savings for shoes} = 25\% \times \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times \$2,000.00 = \$500.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy with her monthly savings. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes per month} = \frac{\$500.00}{\$1,000.00} = 0.5 \]

Since Jessica can only buy whole pairs of shoes, she can buy 0 pairs of shoes per month.

To find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year, we need to consider the number of months in a year, which is 12.

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes per year} = 0.5 \times 12 = 6 \]

However, since she can only buy whole pairs, the number of pairs she can buy in a year is 0.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 0 \]"
"First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, the time required to peel 90 shrimp is:

\[ \text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to saute 30 shrimp. Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, the time required to saute 90 shrimp (which is three times 30 shrimp) is:

\[ \text{Time to saute 90 shrimp} = 3 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Emily can either peel or saute shrimp simultaneously, the total time required to peel and saute 90 shrimp is the longer of the two times calculated. In this case, it is 30 minutes.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 30 \text{ minutes} \]"
"First, let's calculate the temperature change during each phase of the air conditioner's operation.

1. **Low setting for 3 hours:**
   - Cooling rate: 2 degrees per hour
   - Time: 3 hours
   - Total cooling: \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ degrees}\)

2. **High setting for 4 hours:**
   - Cooling rate: 3 degrees per hour
   - Time: 4 hours
   - Total cooling: \(3 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ degrees}\)

3. **Off for 2 hours:**
   - No cooling, so the temperature remains the same.

Now, let's sum up the total cooling:
- Total cooling = Cooling during low setting + Cooling during high setting
- Total cooling = 6 degrees + 12 degrees = 18 degrees

Since the room warms up at 2 degrees per hour when the air conditioner is off, we need to account for the warming during the 2 hours the air conditioner was off:
- Warming during off period: \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ degrees}\)

Now, let's calculate the net change in temperature:
- Net change = Total cooling - Warming during off period
- Net change = 18 degrees - 4 degrees = 14 degrees

The room was 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature after the air conditioner was turned off. Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final numerical answer is:
14"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's father when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Bill's father saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Since his father was 30 years old when he saw the comet, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet for the second time.

3. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Bill saw the comet for the second time when he was 90 years old.
   - The comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, meaning it will appear again in 75 years from the time Bill saw it for the first time.
   - Therefore, if Bill was 90 years old when he saw it for the second time, he was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw it for the first time.

So, the final numerical answer is:
15"
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, let's break down the information given:

1. He writes a check for the electric bill once per month.
2. He writes a check for the gas bill once per month.
3. He writes a check to the church twice per month.
4. He writes a check to the pest and lawn service quarterly (which is 4 times per year).

First, let's calculate the number of checks he writes for the electric and gas bills:
- Electric bill: 12 checks per year (once per month)
- Gas bill: 12 checks per year (once per month)

Next, let's calculate the number of checks he writes to the church:
- Church: 24 checks per year (twice per month)

Finally, let's calculate the number of checks he writes to the pest and lawn service:
- Pest and lawn service: 4 checks per year (quarterly)

Now, we sum up all the checks:
- Electric bill: 12 checks
- Gas bill: 12 checks
- Church: 24 checks
- Pest and lawn service: 4 checks

Total number of checks per year = 12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52 checks

The final numerical answer is 52."
"Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as \( F \). According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4}F \). The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany, so the number of flights to France is \( \frac{1}{4}F \) and the number of flights to Germany is also \( \frac{1}{4}F \).

The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and this is half the number of flights the first plane makes in a day. Therefore, the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day is \( 2 \times 44 = 88 \). So, \( F = 88 \).

Now, we can calculate the number of flights to France by the first plane:
\[ \text{Flights to France} = \frac{1}{4}F = \frac{1}{4} \times 88 = 22. \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 22 \]"
"First, let's determine the duration of each wolf's howl.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so:
\[ \text{Chikote's howl duration} = 2 \times 20 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Igneous howls for as long as Tobias and Chikote combined, so:
\[ \text{Igneous's howl duration} = 20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} = 60 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, let's find the combined duration of all three wolves' howls in seconds:
\[ \text{Combined duration} = 20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} + 60 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ seconds} \]

To convert the combined duration from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):
\[ \text{Combined duration in minutes} = \frac{120 \text{ seconds}}{60} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Adam's parents gave him.

Adam's mother gave him $6.
Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) dollars.

So, the total amount of money given by his parents is \(6 + 12 = 18\) dollars.

Adam spent $30 on trousers. To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount given by his parents from the cost of the trousers.

So, Adam had to contribute \(30 - 18 = 12\) dollars from his savings.

The final numerical answer is 12."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the ages of the children as follows:
- Akbar's age = 3 years
- Alessandro's age = 4 years
- Helene's age = \( H \) years
- Wilfred's age = \( W \) years

We know the total age of the children is 20 years:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

We are also given that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{3 + 4 + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene is twice the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now we substitute \( H = 10 \) into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Therefore, Wilfred's age is 3 years. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount Walter has collected from his neighbors and the online fund:

- From neighbors: $500
- From online fund: $1500

Total collected so far: $500 + $1500 = $2000

Next, Walter's lawyer is going to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. To find out how much the lawyer will donate, we need to know how much everyone else has donated. Walter's friend is going to donate $200, which is the amount that will trigger the lawyer's donation.

Since the lawyer will donate three times the amount of what everyone else donates, the lawyer's donation will be:

$200 * 3 = $600

So, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $600."
"First, we need to calculate the total number of cookies. Since there were 100 guests and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies/guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies} \]

The bride decided to give half of the cookies to the church next door. Therefore, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500 \text{ cookies}}{2} = 750 \text{ cookies} \]

Each person in the church next door got 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church next door, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people} \]

So, the number of people in the church next door is:

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the distribution of the watermelon slices among the family members. Let's denote the total volume of the watermelon as \( V \).

Given that there are 2 adults and 4 kids, and each adult's slice is twice as big as each kid's slice, we can represent the volume of each adult's slice as \( 2x \) and the volume of each kid's slice as \( x \).

The total volume of the watermelon is the sum of the volumes of all slices:
\[ 2(2x) + 4(x) = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

Since the total volume of the watermelon is \( V \), we have:
\[ 8x = V \]

Each adult's slice is \( 2x \), so the total volume of the slices for the adults is:
\[ 2(2x) = 4x \]

To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we calculate:
\[ \frac{4x}{V} \times 100\% \]

Since \( 8x = V \), we can substitute \( V \) with \( 8x \):
\[ \frac{4x}{8x} \times 100\% = \frac{1}{2} \times 100\% = 50\% \]

Therefore, each adult gets 50% of the watermelon."
"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones will spend on checking on the inpatients. He has 9 inpatients, and it takes him 20 minutes per inpatient.

\[ 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes per inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's convert the 180 minutes into hours since the clinic hours are given in hours.

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the total time he will spend on his appointments. He has 10 appointments, and each appointment takes 30 minutes.

\[ 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes per appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's convert the 300 minutes into hours.

\[ 300 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's add up all the time he will spend on the clinic, the inpatient rounds, and the appointments.

\[ 9 \text{ hours (clinic)} + 3 \text{ hours (inpatient rounds)} + 5 \text{ hours (appointments)} = 17 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we need to find out how much time he will have left to update his records. He is working for 9 hours at the clinic.

\[ 9 \text{ hours (total clinic time)} - 17 \text{ hours (total time spent)} = -8 \text{ hours} \]

Since the result is negative, it indicates that Doctor Jones will not have any time left to update his records; he will be short by 8 hours. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[

"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to complete all the steps and then subtract this total from the desired serving time of 5:00 pm.

1. Time to make the cake batter: 20 minutes
2. Time to bake the cake: 30 minutes
3. Time to cool the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
4. Time to frost the cake: 10 minutes

Now, let's add up all these times:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Convert 180 minutes into hours and minutes:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Jordan needs 3 hours to complete the cake from start to finish. If she wants the cake to be ready by 5:00 pm, we subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm:
\[ 5:00 \text{ pm} - 3 \text{ hours} = 2:00 \text{ pm} \]

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

- Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks, the total earnings per month would be: $120 * 4 = $480

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"To find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we first need to determine the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes.

Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars. Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes is:
\[ \text{Chocolate bars per box (Peter)} = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]

Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars. Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes is:
\[ \text{Chocolate bars per box (Martha)} = \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

Now, to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we subtract the number of chocolate bars per box for Martha from the number of chocolate bars per box for Peter:

"First, let's determine the number of female porcupines in the park. Given that the total population of porcupines is 50 and the number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population, we can calculate the number of female porcupines as follows:

\[ \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the number of babies born each month is:

\[ \text{Number of babies born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120 \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[ \text{Total number of babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440 \]

The initial population of porcupines is 50. After a year, the total number of porcupines in the park will be the initial population plus the total number of babies born in a year:

\[ \text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490 \]

"First, we need to calculate the volume of the swimming pool. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:

\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

\[ \text{Volume} = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. There are approximately 7.48052 gallons in a cubic foot. So, we multiply the volume in cubic feet by the conversion factor:

\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = 1400 \times 7.48052 \]

\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = 10472.728 \]

Now, we multiply the volume in gallons by the cost per gallon to find the total cost:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 10472.728 \times 0.10 \]

\[ \text{Total cost} = 1047.2728 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the total cost to fill the pool is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 1047.27 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of students over 16 years old and the number of students under 16 years old.

Brook Hills High School has 3000 students in total.

Half of these students are over 16 years old:
\[ \frac{3000}{2} = 1500 \text{ students over 16 years old} \]

The remaining half are under 16 years old:
\[ \frac{3000}{2} = 1500 \text{ students under 16 years old} \]

Next, we determine the number of male and female students over 16 years old.

One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male:
\[ \frac{1500}{4} = 375 \text{ male students over 16 years old} \]

The remaining three-fourths are female:
\[ 1500 - 375 = 1125 \text{ female students over 16 years old} \]

Now, we determine the number of male and female students under 16 years old.

One-half of the students under 16 years old are male:
\[ \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \text{ male students under 16 years old} \]

The remaining half are female:
\[ 1500 - 750 = 750 \text{ female students under 16 years old} \]

Finally, we add the number of female students over 16 years old and the number of female students under 16 years old to find the total number of female students:

"First, let's determine how many laps each person can run:

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) laps.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps.

Now, to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run:

\[10 - 5 = 5\]

So, Bethany can run 5 more laps than Quinn. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days and then subtract that from the tank's total capacity.

First, let's determine the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day:

- Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity on the first day.
- The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, so Wanda pumped \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons on the first day.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda, so she pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons on the first day.

Next, let's determine the amount of water pumped on the second day:

- Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day, so she pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons on the second day.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day, so she pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons on the second day.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank over the two days:

- Total water pumped by Wanda: \( 4500 + 3000 = 7500 \) gallons.
- Total water pumped by Ms. B: \( 3375 + 1125 = 4500 \) gallons.
- Total water pumped into the tank: \( 7500 + 4500 = 12000 \) gallons.

Finally, we subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity to find out how much water is remaining:

- Remaining water: \( 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \) gallons.

The final numerical answer is 6000 gallons."
"Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as \( C \).

First, we know that the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour for 5 hours. This means that after 5 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ C \times (1 - 0.09)^5 = C \times 0.91^5 \]

Calculating \( 0.91^5 \):
\[ 0.91^5 \approx 0.652 \]

So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is approximately:
\[ C \times 0.652 \]

Next, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour for 3 hours. This means that after another 3 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ C \times 0.652 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = C \times 0.652 \times 0.93^3 \]

Calculating \( 0.93^3 \):
\[ 0.93^3 \approx 0.817 \]

So, after 8 hours, the charge remaining is approximately:
\[ C \times 0.652 \times 0.817 \]

We know that after 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%, or 0.28. Therefore:
\[ C \times 0.652 \times 0.817 = 0.28 \]

Now, we solve for \( C \):
\[ C = \frac{0.28}{0.652 \times 0.817} \]
\[ C = \frac{0.28}{0.534} \]
\[ C \approx 0.523 \]

Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 52.3%."
"First, let's calculate Janet's total weekly earnings. She earns $10 per hour from her job and $15 per hour from tips, so her total hourly wage is:

\[ 10 + 15 = 25 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Since she works 40 hours a week, her weekly earnings are:

\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ dollars per week} \]

Next, we need to determine how much she needs to save to buy the car. The down payment for the car is $10,000. She wants to save 20% of this amount:

\[ 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take for her to save $2000 at a rate of $1000 per week. We do this by dividing the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:

\[ \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

So, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment for the car. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased:

- Peaches: 3 peaches * $0.50/peach = $1.50
- Pears: 4 pears * $0.50/pear = $2.00
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00/kiwi = $2.00
- Apples: 5 apples * $0.75/apple = $3.75

Now, let's sum up the cost of these fruits:

Total cost of purchased fruits = $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar has $10 to spend, so the remaining amount he can spend on plums is:

Remaining amount = $10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums he can buy is:

Number of plums = $0.75 / $0.25/plum = 3 plums

So, the final numerical answer is 3."
"First, let's determine the total number of pieces of sweets Anne purchased. She bought a box with 15 packs, and each pack contains 60 pieces.

\[
\text{Total pieces of sweets} = 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 900 \text{ pieces}
\]

Anne kept 2 packs for herself. Let's calculate how many pieces she kept:

\[
\text{Pieces Anne kept} = 2 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 120 \text{ pieces}
\]

Now, we need to find out how many pieces of sweets she gave to her 10 friends. We subtract the pieces Anne kept from the total pieces:

\[
\text{Pieces given to friends} = 900 \text{ pieces} - 120 \text{ pieces} = 780 \text{ pieces}
\]

Anne gave these 780 pieces equally to her 10 friends. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide the total pieces given to friends by the number of friends:

\[
\text{Pieces per friend} = \frac{780 \text{ pieces}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 78 \text{ pieces}
\]

So, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets. The final numerical answer is:

\[
78

"To calculate the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating compounded price increases:

\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (1 + \text{Rate})^{\text{Number of Years}} \]

Given:
- Initial Price = $120
- Rate = 5% = 0.05
- Number of Years = 3

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 139 \]

So, the price of carrots after three years would be $139."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many selfies and portraits Olivia uploaded to her albums. We know that she uploaded a total of 72 pictures into 8 albums, with 3 albums being selfies only and 2 albums being portraits only. This means the remaining albums are for other types of pictures.

First, let's calculate the number of albums that are not selfies or portraits:
\[ 8 \text{ total albums} - 3 \text{ selfies} - 2 \text{ portraits} = 3 \text{ other albums} \]

Since the 3 other albums are not specified as selfies or portraits, we can assume they are neither. This means the selfies and portraits are the only types of pictures in the albums.

Next, we need to determine how many pictures are in the selfies and portraits albums. Since the number of pictures in each album is the same, we divide the total number of pictures by the total number of albums:
\[ \frac{72 \text{ pictures}}{8 \text{ albums}} = 9 \text{ pictures per album} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of selfies and portraits:
- Number of selfies = 3 albums * 9 pictures per album = 27 pictures
- Number of portraits = 2 albums * 9 pictures per album = 18 pictures

Therefore, the total number of selfies and portraits is:
\[ 27 \text{ selfies} + 18 \text{ portraits} = 45 \text{ pictures} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 45 \]"
"To determine how long James spends reading, we first need to find out how many minutes it takes him to read one page. Since it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can calculate the time it takes to read one page by dividing 10 minutes by 3 pages:

\[ \text{Time per page} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages. We do this by multiplying the time it takes to read one page by 18:

\[ \text{Time to read 18 pages} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes} \]

Let's perform the multiplication:

\[ 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, James spends 60 minutes reading. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 60 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.
2. 24 guests checked out early, reducing the number of guests by 24.
3. 15 guests checked out late, reducing the number of guests by 15.
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, twice that number is \(2 \times 15 = 30\) guests.
5. After dinner, 7 more people checked in.

Now, let's calculate the number of guests after each step:

- Initial guests: 100
- After 24 guests checked out early: \(100 - 24 = 76\)
- After 15 guests checked out late: \(76 - 15 = 61\)
- After 30 guests checked in in the afternoon: \(61 + 30 = 91\)
- After 7 more guests checked in after dinner: \(91 + 7 = 98\)

So, the final number of guests in the hotel is 98."
"On Wednesday, John picks 4 bananas.
On Thursday, John picks 6 bananas.
On Friday, John picks triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

To find the total number of bananas John has, we add the bananas from each day:
4 (Wednesday) + 6 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) = 22 bananas.

The final numerical answer is 22."
"First, let's determine the number of easy, average, and difficult questions in the quiz.

- Total number of questions: 60
- Easy questions: 40% of 60 = 0.40 * 60 = 24 questions
- Average and difficult questions combined: 60 - 24 = 36 questions
- Since the average and difficult questions are equally divided, there are 36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct. Therefore, the number of easy questions she is sure to get correct is:
\[ 75\% \text{ of } 24 = 0.75 \times 24 = 18 \]

Aries is sure to get half of the average and difficult questions correct. Therefore, the number of average and difficult questions she is sure to get correct is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \text{ of } 18 = 9 \]

Adding the number of questions she is sure to get correct from the easy, average, and difficult questions:
\[ 18 \text{ (easy)} + 9 \text{ (average)} + 9 \text{ (difficult)} = 36 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the price of a large stuffed animal. Since each small stuffed animal costs $4 and large stuffed animals cost three times as much, the price of a large stuffed animal is:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( L \). According to the problem, the number of small stuffed animals sold is twice the number of large stuffed animals sold, so the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2L \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as the sum of the earnings from the large stuffed animals and the small stuffed animals. The earnings from the large stuffed animals are \( 12L \) dollars, and the earnings from the small stuffed animals are \( 4 \times 2L = 8L \) dollars. The total earnings are given as $120, so we can set up the following equation:
\[ 12L + 8L = 120 \]
\[ 20L = 120 \]
\[ L = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ L = 6 \]

Since the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2L \), we have:
\[ 2L = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we first need to calculate the total number of sandwiches they eat in one day and then multiply that by 7 (the number of days in a week).

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, the wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and the son eats 2 sandwiches per day. So, the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by the family is:

\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \text{ sandwiches per day} \]

Now, to find out how many sandwiches they eat in one week, we multiply the daily total by 7:

\[ 11 \times 7 = 77 \text{ sandwiches per week} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the ore mining rate with a steel pickaxe:**
   - A dwarf with an iron pickaxe mines 12 pounds per day.
   - A dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 50% more than a dwarf with an iron pickaxe.
   - 50% of 12 pounds is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6\) pounds.
   - Therefore, a dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines \(12 + 6 = 18\) pounds per day.

2. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in one day:**
   - Each dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 18 pounds per day.
   - 40 dwarves would mine \(18 \times 40 = 720\) pounds per day.

3. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month:**
   - There are 30 days in the month.
   - The total ore mined in a month is \(720 \times 30 = 21600\) pounds.

The final numerical answer is 21600 pounds."
"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to use the information that the prices are proportional. We can set up a proportion based on the given information:

- 2 sandwiches cost $3.
- 4 sandwiches cost $6.
- 8 sandwiches cost an unknown amount, which we will call \( x \).

First, let's find the cost per sandwich for the first two packages:

- For 2 sandwiches at $3, the cost per sandwich is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) dollars.
- For 4 sandwiches at $6, the cost per sandwich is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) dollars.

Since the prices are proportional, the cost per sandwich remains the same for the third package. Therefore, the cost for 8 sandwiches can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Cost per sandwich} = 1.5 \text{ dollars} \]
\[ \text{Cost for 8 sandwiches} = 8 \times 1.5 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost \( x = 12 \) dollars.

"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst due to the gust of wind. Sally initially had 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst.

\[ \text{Red balloons that burst} = 25 \times \frac{40}{100} = 25 \times 0.4 = 10 \]

So, the number of red balloons remaining is:

\[ \text{Remaining red balloons} = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Next, Sally accidentally released half of the yellow balloons. She initially had 12 yellow balloons.

\[ \text{Yellow balloons released} = 12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons remaining is:

\[ \text{Remaining yellow balloons} = 12 - 6 = 6 \]

Sally found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining balloons.

\[ \text{Blue balloons added} = 8 \times \frac{75}{100} = 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \]

So, the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school is the sum of the remaining red, yellow, and the added blue balloons.

\[ \text{Total balloons} = \text{Remaining red balloons} + \text{Remaining yellow balloons} + \text{Blue balloons added} \]
\[ \text{Total balloons} = 15 + 6 + 6 = 27 \]

"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of the different scenarios and their outcomes.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of the substitute teacher collecting the homework: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of having to turn in the homework: 50% or 0.50

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having the normal teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of getting an extension from the normal teacher: 40% or 0.40
   - Probability of not getting an extension from the normal teacher: 60% or 0.60
   - Probability of convincing the teacher to give a personal extension: 20% or 0.20
   - Probability of not convincing the teacher: 80% or 0.80

Now, let's calculate the overall probability of having to turn in the homework:

- **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
  - Probability of having to turn in the homework: 50% or 0.50

- **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
  - Probability of not getting an extension: 60% or 0.60
  - Probability of having to turn in the homework: 100% - 20% = 80% or 0.80

Now, we combine these probabilities:

- Probability of having to turn in the homework given the substitute teacher:
  - 50% or 0.50

- Probability of having to turn in the homework given the normal teacher:
  - 60% (not getting an extension) * 80% (convinced to get a personal extension) = 0.60 * 0.80 = 0.48

Now, we sum the probabilities of the two scenarios:

- Total probability of having to turn in the homework:
  - 50% (substitute teacher) + 40% (normal teacher) = 90%

Thus, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 90%."
"First, we need to determine the total number of seats that are not occupied by graduates and faculty. The total capacity of the Fine Arts Center is 6000 seats. After accounting for 950 seats for graduates and 300 seats for faculty, the number of seats available for distribution to graduates' friends and family is:

\[ 6000 - 950 - 300 = 5750 \]

Next, we need to split these 5750 seats equally among the 950 graduates. To find out how many tickets each graduate will receive, we divide the number of available seats by the number of graduates:

\[ \frac{5750}{950} = 6.052631578947368 \]

Since the number of tickets must be a whole number, we round down to the nearest whole number, as partial tickets are not practical. Therefore, each graduate will receive 6 tickets.

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we first need to calculate the number of soda bottles he will place along the driveway.

The width of the driveway is 24 feet, and he wants to place a bottle every 3 feet. Therefore, the number of bottles is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Number of bottles} = \frac{\text{Total width of the driveway}}{\text{Distance between each bottle}} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles}
\]

Richard will need to go from one bottle to the next and drop the candy in each time. Since he starts at the first bottle and goes to the next 7 times, he will need to make 7 trips.

Each trip takes 5 seconds, so the total time for all trips is:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Number of trips} \times \text{Time per trip} = 7 \times 5 \text{ seconds} = 35 \text{ seconds}

"First, let's calculate the total amount Jim borrowed during his college years. He borrowed $50,000 per year for 4 years, so the total amount borrowed is:

\[ 50,000 \times 4 = 200,000 \]

Next, let's determine his income after graduating from college. His original income was $25,000 per year, and his income tripled, so his new income is:

\[ 25,000 \times 3 = 75,000 \]

Now, let's calculate the total income he would have earned if he had not gone to college. He would have earned $25,000 per year for 4 years:

\[ 25,000 \times 4 = 100,000 \]

The total income he would have earned if he had not gone to college is $100,000. The total income he earned during his college years is $200,000. Therefore, the total income he lost by going to college is:

\[ 200,000 - 100,000 = 100,000 \]

Now, we need to determine how long it would take for him to earn back the $200,000 he borrowed, plus the $100,000 he lost in income during his college years. The total amount he needs to earn back is:

\[ 200,000 + 100,000 = 300,000 \]

Since his new income after college is $75,000 per year, the number of years it would take to earn $300,000 is:

\[ \frac{300,000}{75,000} = 4 \]

Therefore, it would take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total square feet of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of each piece of fabric he requires. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each piece of fabric is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

First, calculate the dimensions of one piece of fabric:
- Length: \( 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \)
- Width: \( 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \)

Next, calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
\[ \text{Area of one piece} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[ \text{Total area} = 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Thus, the total square feet of fabric Jim needs to buy is:
\[ 160 \text{ square feet} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Monday's Deliveries**: The post office delivered 425 letters.
2. **Tuesday's Deliveries**: The number of letters delivered on Tuesday is 17 more than one-fifth of the number delivered on Monday. 
   - One-fifth of Monday's deliveries: \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \)
   - Tuesday's deliveries: \( 85 + 17 = 102 \)
3. **Wednesday's Deliveries**: The number of letters delivered on Wednesday is 5 more than twice the number delivered on Tuesday.

   - Johnny's dad lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost.
   - Amount lost in the first race = $5.
   - Twice the amount lost in the first race = $5 * 2 = $10.
   - Amount won in the second race = $10 + $1 = $11.
   - Since he won, this is a positive amount, but for the purpose of calculating loss, we consider the negative of this amount.
   - Amount lost in the second race = -$11.

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Amount won in the second race = $11.
   - 1.5 times the amount won in the second race = $11 * 1.5 = $16.5.
   - Amount lost in the third race = $16.5.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost:
- Total amount lost = Amount lost in the first race + Amount lost in the second race + Amount lost in the third race.
- Total amount lost = $5 + (-$11) + $16.5 = $5 - $11 + $16.5 = $10.5.

To find the average amount lost per race, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races:
- Number of races = 3.
- Average amount lost per race = Total amount lost / Number of races = $10.5 / 3 = $3.5.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{3.5}

"To find the total population in South America, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country and then by the number of people living in each city.

Number of countries in South America = 26
Number of cities in each country = 5
Number of people in each city = 1000

Total population = Number of countries × Number of cities per country × Number of people per city
Total population = 26 × 5 × 1000

Now, let's calculate the total population.
Total population = 26 × 5 × 1000 = 130,000

The final numerical answer is 130,000."
"First, we need to convert all measurements to the same unit for easier comparison. Let's use inches.

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, Xavier's height in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Xavier grew 3 inches, so his current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole's initial height was 50 inches. Cole grew 2 inches, so his current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier’s height now is 1 inch."
"Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( 420 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 420 \]"
"To determine the number of hours each painter worked, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of days the painters worked:**
   - There are 3 weeks of work.
   - Each week has 7 days.
   - Therefore, the total number of days is \(3 \times 7 = 21\) days.

2. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by the team:**
   - Each day, the team worked \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day.
   - Therefore, the total number of hours worked by the team is \( 21 \times \frac{3}{8} \).

3. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by the team:**
   \[
   21 \times \frac{3}{8} = \frac{21 \times 3}{8} = \frac{63}{8} = 7.875 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of hours each painter worked:**
   - There are 4 painters.
   - Therefore, each painter worked \( \frac{7.875}{4} \) hours.

5. **Calculate the number of hours each painter worked:**
   \[
   \frac{7.875}{4} = 1.96875 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, each painter put in approximately 1.96875 hours of work. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, Rory retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2}) = 2 \cdot 19 \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now that we know \( x = 6 \), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

So, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation year by year from 2007 to 2010.

The formula for depreciation is:
\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^{\text{Number of Years}} \]

Given:
- Initial Price = $20000
- Depreciation Rate = 21% = 0.21
- Number of Years from 2007 to 2010 = 3

Now, we can plug these values into the formula:
\[ \text{Final Price} = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]

Calculating \( (0.79)^3 \):
\[ (0.79)^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.493039 \]

Now, multiply this by the initial price:
\[ \text{Final Price} = 20000 \times 0.493039 = 9860.78 \]

Therefore, the price of the car in the year 2010 is approximately $9860.78."
"First, let's determine the number of English books. Since half of the 50 books are written in English, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of English books} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

Next, we calculate the number of German books. Since 10% of the books are written in German, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of German books} = 10\% \times 50 = 0.10 \times 50 = 5 \]

Now, to find the number of Spanish books, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:

\[ \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - (\text{Number of English books} + \text{Number of German books}) \]
\[ \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - (25 + 5) \]
\[ \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - 30 \]
\[ \text{Number of Spanish books} = 20 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 20."
"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we first need to determine how far she has already driven. According to the information provided, Bernice drove 325 kilometers over 4 days.

The total distance from San Diego to New York City is approximately 1955 kilometers. To find out how much farther Bernice needs to drive, we subtract the distance she has already covered from the total distance:

\[ \text{Remaining distance} = \text{Total distance} - \text{Distance already driven} \]

\[ \text{Remaining distance} = 1955 \text{ km} - 325 \text{ km} \]

\[ \text{Remaining distance} = 1630 \text{ km} \]

So, Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers."

"To determine the cost of renovating the kitchen floor with square tiles, we first need to calculate how many tiles are required to cover the 200 square feet area.

Each tile is a square with a side length of 1 foot, so the area of each tile is:
\[ \text{Area of one tile} = 1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt} \]

Given the total area of the kitchen floor is 200 square feet, the number of tiles needed is:
\[ \text{Number of tiles} = \frac{\text{Total area of the kitchen floor}}{\text{Area of one tile}} = \frac{200 \text{ SqFt}}{1 \text{ SqFt/tile}} = 200 \text{ tiles} \]

Each tile costs $12, so the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Number of tiles} \times \text{Cost per tile} = 200 \text{ tiles} \times 12 \text{ dollars/tile} = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much James pays for insurance a year after his accident, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the increased monthly cost due to the accident.
2. Multiply the increased monthly cost by 12 to find the annual cost.

First, let's calculate the increased monthly cost:
- The normal cost is $120 a month.
- The increase is 60% of $120.

To find 60% of $120:
\[ 0.60 \times 120 = 72 \]

So, the increased monthly cost is:
\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Now, to find the annual cost:
\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, James pays $2304 a year for insurance."
"To determine how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the number of loads required for the twin beds and the king size bed separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of loads for the twin beds:
- Greg has 4 twin beds.
- Each load can wash 2 twin sets of sheets.
- Therefore, the number of loads needed for the twin beds is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) loads.

Next, let's calculate the number of loads for the king size bed:
- Greg has 1 king size bed.
- Each load can wash 1 king set of sheets.
- Therefore, the number of loads needed for the king size bed is \( \frac{1}{1} = 1 \) load.

Now, we sum the loads for the twin beds and the king size bed:
- Total loads per week = 2 (twin beds) + 1 (king size bed) = 3 loads.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total number of loads Greg does in a year is:
- Total loads per year = 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we first need to calculate the total amount of cat food Imma's cats consume per day.

Imma has 3 cats, and each cat is fed 60 grams of cat food twice a day. Therefore, the total amount of cat food consumed per day is:

\[ 3 \text{ cats} \times 60 \text{ grams/cat} \times 2 \text{ feedings/day} = 360 \text{ grams/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:

\[ \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams/day}} = 2 \text{ days} \]

"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time for the meal is the sum of the times for both parts, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Next, we isolate \( D \) by subtracting 18 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Then, we solve for \( D \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's part as follows:

\[ Betsy's\ part = D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 58 \]"
"First, let's break down the costs:

"First, let's determine how many emails James doesn't need to respond to each day. Since 20% of the 80 emails don't require any response, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 80 = \frac{20}{100} \times 80 = 0.2 \times 80 = 16 \]

So, James doesn't need to respond to 16 emails each day. This means he does need to respond to the remaining emails:

\[ 80 - 16 = 64 \]

James responds to 64 emails each day. To find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of emails he responds to each day by 5:

\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 320."
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to calculate the number of classes for each day and then sum them up.

So, the glee club has:

\[ \text{Pizzas left with glee club} = 20 - 14 = 6 \]

Next, let's calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the football team. They ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

The football team ate 80% of their pizzas.

\[ \text{Pizzas eaten by football team} = 40 \times \frac{80}{100} = 40 \times 0.8 = 32 \]

\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, and he is sending out 700 small coupons:

\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, and he is sending out 1400 big coupons:

\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of mailing all the coupons, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the cost of mailing the big coupons:

\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats in a week, we subtract the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a week from the total number of bananas:
\[ 315 - (24 \times 7) = 315 - 168 = 147 \text{ bananas in a week} \]

Now, to find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we divide the weekly consumption by 7:
\[ \frac{147}{7} = 21 \text{ bananas each day} \]

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 21 \]"
"Teddy finished half of the first 500-piece puzzle, which means Teddy placed 500 / 2 = 250 pieces of the first puzzle. Teddy also finished the second 500-piece puzzle, which means Teddy placed 500 pieces of the second puzzle. Therefore, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is 250 + 500 = 750 pieces."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the roses Jenny bought. She bought 15 roses, and since roses cost $2 each, the total cost for the roses is:

\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2/\text{rose} = \$30 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jenny has initially. She arrived with five 5 dollar bills, so she has:

\[ 5 \times \$5 = \$25 \]

Since the total cost of the roses is $30 and Jenny only has $25, she needs an additional $5 to pay for the roses. However, the question asks how many quarters she leaves with, which implies we need to find out how many quarters she receives in change.

The change she receives is:

\[ \$30 - \$25 = \$5 \]

Since quarters are worth $0.25 each, the number of quarters she receives in change is:

\[ \frac{\$5}{\$0.25/\text{quarter}} = 20 \text{ quarters} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"To calculate the total money Terry makes, we need to calculate the earnings from each item separately and then sum them up.

2. Earnings from burger platters: \(9 \times 11 = 99.00\)
3. Earnings from sodas: \(20 \times 1.50 = 30.00\)

Now, we sum these amounts to find the total earnings:
\[33.00 + 99.00 + 30.00 = 162.00\]

So, the total money Terry makes is $162.00."
"To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, let's break down the schedule step by step:

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays in the station for 20 minutes.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives half an hour after the first train leaves the station.
   - The first train leaves the station 10 minutes after it arrives, so it leaves at 10 + 10 = 20 minutes.
   - The second train arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves, so it arrives at 20 + 30 = 50 minutes.
   - Stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives an hour after the second train leaves the station.
   - The second train leaves the station 50 minutes after it arrives, so it leaves at 50 + 60 = 110 minutes.
   - The third train arrives 60 minutes after the second train leaves, so it arrives at 110 + 60 = 170 minutes.
   - Leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it stays in the station for 0 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station.
   - The third train leaves the station at 170 minutes, so it arrives at 170 + 20 = 190 minutes.
   - This is the train Paul needs to board.

Now, let's calculate the time Paul will wait for his train:
- The fourth train arrives at 190 minutes.
- Paul arrives at 10 minutes (when the first train arrives).
- Therefore, Paul will wait for 190 - 10 = 180 minutes.

The final numerical answer is 180 minutes."
"To determine how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we first need to calculate how many toothpicks she has already saved.

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks:
\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie needs a total of 200 toothpicks. She has already saved 120 toothpicks, so the number of toothpicks she still needs is:
\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks, we divide the number of toothpicks she still needs by the number of toothpicks she saves each week:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks."
"First, let's determine the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch. The original price of the watch is $2000, and he bought it at 75% of its original price.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers paid} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage discount Mr. Rogers's friend obtained from the original price. The original price was $2000, and the friend paid $1800 for the watch.

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

To find the percentage discount, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage Discount} = \left( \frac{\text{Discount Amount}}{\text{Original Price}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage Discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers's friend from the original price is 10%."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs over a period of 4 hours.

   \[
   4 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} \times 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 14400 \text{ seconds}
   \]

2. Since one spring creates one jellyfish every second, in 14400 seconds, one spring would create:
   \[
   14400 \text{ jellyfish}
   \]

3. With 5 springs working simultaneously, the total number of jellyfish created in 4 hours would be:

1. Binkie's score is 90.
2. Frankie's score is 15 more than twice Binkie's score.

First, calculate twice Binkie's score:
\[ 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Then, add 15 to this value to find Frankie's score:
\[ 180 + 15 = 195 \]

So, Frankie's score is 195."
"First, let's determine the total distance James walked. He walked halfway to the store, which is 2 miles, and then walked back home, which is another 2 miles. So, the total distance he walked is 2 miles + 2 miles = 4 miles.

James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour. To find out how long it took him to walk 4 miles, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 1 hour."
"First, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually.

Jenny buys 10 bunches, and each bunch has 4 bananas. Therefore, the total number of bananas she buys is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

The cost of buying 40 bananas individually at $0.80 each is:
\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches.

Jenny buys 10 bunches at $3.00 per bunch, so the total cost is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

Now, we find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually:
\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Jenny saved is:
\[ \$2.00 \]"
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) and the amount Harry gets as \( H \). According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so we can write:

\[ H = S + 60 \]

Since the total amount of fence is 100 feet, we can also write:

\[ S + H = 100 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Subtract 60 from both sides:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"To determine how many inches a crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to find the growth rate per year. The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, so the growth rate per year is:

\[ \text{Growth rate per year} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \]

Now, to find out how many inches it will grow in 13 years, we multiply the growth rate per year by 13:

\[ \text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month, we need to calculate the total earnings from each type of bike and then sum them up.

First, let's determine the number of each type of bike sold:
- Total bikes sold = 300
- Number of Trekking bikes sold = 50% of 300 = 0.5 * 300 = 150
- Number of BMX bikes sold = 15% of 300 = 0.15 * 300 = 45
- Number of MTB bikes sold = Total bikes sold - Trekking bikes sold - BMX bikes sold = 300 - 150 - 45 = 65

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike:
- Price of one MTB = $500
- Price of one BMX = Half the price of an MTB = $500 / 2 = $250
- Price of one Trekking bike = $450

Now, we calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:
- Earnings from MTB bikes = Number of MTB bikes sold * Price of one MTB = 65 * $500 = $32,500
- Earnings from BMX bikes = Number of BMX bikes sold * Price of one BMX = 45 * $250 = $11,250
- Earnings from Trekking bikes = Number of Trekking bikes sold * Price of one Trekking bike = 150 * $450 = $67,500

Finally, we sum up the earnings from all types of bikes to find the total earnings:
- Total earnings = Earnings from MTB bikes + Earnings from BMX bikes + Earnings from Trekking bikes = $32,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $111,250

The final numerical answer is $111,250."

"To determine the total number of hours John spends learning each week, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. **Calculate the total number of periods John has to attend each day:**
   - A normal student has 6 periods.
   - John has 2 extra classes.
   - Therefore, John has \(6 + 2 = 8\) periods each day.

2. **Calculate the total number of minutes John spends in class each day:**
   - Each class is 40 minutes long.
   - John has 8 periods each day.
   - Therefore, John spends \(8 \times 40 = 320\) minutes in class each day.

3. **Calculate the total number of minutes John spends in class each week:**
   - John goes to class 5 days a week.
   - Therefore, John spends \(320 \times 5 = 1600\) minutes in class each week.

4. **Calculate the total number of minutes John spends on Saturday and Sunday:**
   - John spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday.
   - Therefore, John spends \(\frac{1}{16} \times 1600 = 100\) minutes on Saturday and Sunday combined.

5. **Calculate the total number of minutes John spends learning each week:**
   - John spends 1600 minutes in class each week and 100 minutes on Saturday and Sunday.
   - Therefore, John spends \(1600 + 100 = 1700\) minutes learning each week.

6. **Convert the total number of minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, John spends \(\frac{1700}{60} = \frac{1700 \div 10}{60 \div 10} = \frac{170}{6} = 28.3333...\) hours learning each week.

"First, we need to determine the initial height from which the ball is dropped. Since the ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony and each story is 24 feet high, the height from the third-floor balcony is:

\[ 3 \text{ stories} \times 24 \text{ feet/story} = 72 \text{ feet} \]

The ball bounces to 2/3 of its starting height with each bounce. Therefore, on the first bounce, the ball will reach:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 72 \text{ feet} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

On the second bounce, the ball will again bounce to 2/3 of its height from the first bounce:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 48 \text{ feet} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height the ball reaches on its second bounce is:

\[ 32 \text{ feet} \]"
"First, let's convert all heights to inches for easier calculation. The first child is 6 feet tall, which is 6 * 12 = 72 inches. The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall. The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

The final numerical answer is 72 inches."
"To determine the earnings from selling 2000 apples at a rate of $5 per bag, we first need to find out how many bags were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can calculate the number of bags sold as follows:

\[ \text{Number of bags sold} = \frac{\text{Total number of apples sold}}{\text{Number of apples per bag}} = \frac{2000}{10} = 200 \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags sold by the price per bag:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of bags sold} \times \text{Price per bag} = 200 \times 5 = 1000 \]

So, the orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the meat, so it left \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
3. The Allosaurus then ate the remaining meat, which is \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms. According to the problem, this amount is 270 kilograms.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]

To find \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

Therefore, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 kilograms.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted.

The north and south walls are each 10 feet by 8 feet, so the area of each is:
\[ 10 \times 8 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is:
\[ 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The east and west walls are each 5 feet by 8 feet, so the area of each is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is:
\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Adding the areas of all four walls together gives the total area to be painted:
\[ 160 + 80 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, since each gallon of paint costs $12, the total cost to paint the room is:

"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the probabilities accordingly.

Initially, Ellen has:
- 3 shaken sodas
- 9 unshaken sodas

Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving:
- 3 shaken sodas
- 8 unshaken sodas

Ellen's brother then takes 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas, leaving:
- 2 shaken sodas
- 6 unshaken sodas

Now, Ellen's friend comes along. The friend can get soda from a shaken can if they get one of the 2 remaining shaken sodas. The total number of sodas left is 2 (shaken) + 6 (unshaken) = 8 sodas.

The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left:
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \]

To express this probability as a percentage:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100\% = 25\% \]

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 25%."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours and then sum these distances since the trains are traveling in opposite directions.

The first train travels at 60 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will travel:

"First, let's calculate the initial charge and the return:

Initial charge: $85.00
Returned item: $15.00

After the return, the charge on the credit card is:
$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of the items she bought after the discounts:

Frying pan on sale for 20% off $20.00:
Discounted price = $20.00 - (20% of $20.00) = $20.00 - ($20.00 * 0.20) = $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Set of towels on sale for 10% off $30.00:
Discounted price = $30.00 - (10% of $30.00) = $30.00 - ($30.00 * 0.10) = $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, let's add the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels to the remaining balance on the credit card:

Remaining balance: $70.00
Frying pan: $16.00
Set of towels: $27.00

"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem:
- A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{1}{5}J \).
- A third of the large jellyfish change color under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{5}J = \frac{1}{15}J \).
- When the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color. Therefore, \( \frac{1}{15}J = 6 \).

To find \( J \), we solve the equation:

"To find out the length of each final cut, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, Marty cuts the 100 centimeters of ribbon into 4 equal parts. To find the length of each part, we divide 100 by 4:
   \[
   \frac{100}{4} = 25 \text{ cm}
   \]
   So, each of the 4 parts is 25 centimeters long.

2. Next, each of these 25 centimeter parts is divided into 5 equal parts. To find the length of each of these smaller parts, we divide 25 by 5:
   \[
   \frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ cm}
   \]
   Therefore, each of the final cuts will be 5 centimeters long.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total number of students in the school, we start by understanding that 40% of the school population consists of 240 boys. Let's denote the total number of students in the school as \( T \).

Given that 40% of \( T \) is equal to 240 boys, we can write the equation as:
\[ 0.40 \times T = 240 \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} \]

Now, let's calculate the value of \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} = 600 \]

So, the total number of students in the school is 600.

Next, we need to find the number of girls in the school. Since 40% of the students are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. We can calculate the number of girls by finding 60% of the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times 600 \]

Let's calculate the number of girls:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times 600 = 360 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360."

The cost of the pots is $19.
The cost of the sack of garden soil is $26.
The value of the coupon is $7.

First, we add the cost of the pots and the sack of garden soil:
\[ 19 + 26 = 45 \]

Next, we subtract the value of the coupon from the total:
\[ 45 - 7 = 38 \]

So, the final amount of money my mom spent at the gardening shop is $38."
"To find the average height of the heels, we need to calculate the mean of the heights of the heels worn by the women at the party.

First, we note the number of women wearing each type of heel:
- 4 inch heels: 3 women
- 2 inch heels: 3 women

Next, we calculate the total height of the heels:
- Total height from 4 inch heels: \( 4 \text{ inches} \times 3 \text{ women} = 12 \text{ inches} \)
- Total height from 2 inch heels: \( 2 \text{ inches} \times 3 \text{ women} = 6 \text{ inches} \)

Now, we find the combined total height of all heels:
- Combined total height: \( 12 \text{ inches} + 6 \text{ inches} = 18 \text{ inches} \)

To find the average height of the heels, we divide the combined total height by the total number of heels:
- Total number of heels: \( 3 \text{ women} + 3 \text{ women} = 6 \text{ heels} \)
- Average height of the heels: \( \frac{18 \text{ inches}}{6 \text{ heels}} = 3 \text{ inches} \)

Thus, the average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches."
"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time, we first need to calculate the total number of miles she needs to hike in June and then figure out how many miles she can hike in a day under her current plan.

Soledad plans to hike 9,300 miles in June. She intends to walk twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. Therefore, the total number of miles she plans to hike per day is:
\[ 125 \text{ miles/time} \times 2 \text{ times/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of days in June:
\[ \text{June has 30 days} \]

Now, we determine how many miles she can hike in June if she walks 250 miles per day:
\[ 250 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 7500 \text{ miles} \]

Since she needs to hike 9,300 miles and can only hike 7,500 miles with her current plan, we find the difference:
\[ 9300 \text{ miles} - 7500 \text{ miles} = 1800 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike, we divide the additional miles by the number of days in June:
\[ \frac{1800 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her journey on time. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 60 \]"

"First, let's determine how many kilograms of apples each person wants.

Pierre wants a quarter of the total 12 kg of apples:
\[ \text{Pierre's share} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg} \]

Paul wants one third of the total 12 kg of apples:
\[ \text{Paul's share} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg} \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount of apples that Pierre and Paul want:
\[ \text{Total wanted by Pierre and Paul} = 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg} \]

Since the total amount of apples is 12 kg, the amount of apples that James will have left is:
\[ \text{James's share} = 12 \text{ kg} - 7 \text{ kg} = 5 \text{ kg} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Raymond initially had $21. He saved an additional $11, so his total became $21 + $11 = $32. Then he spent $5 on a comic book and $19 on a puzzle, which totals $5 + $19 = $24. Subtracting the total amount spent from his total after saving, we get $32 - $24 = $8. Therefore, Raymond has $8 left."
"First, let's determine how much money Anna has spent in total. She started with a budget of $16 and has $2 left after her purchases. Therefore, the total amount spent is:

\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \]

Anna has already spent $4 on other items, so the amount spent on the books is:

\[ 14 - 4 = 10 \]

Anna bought 2 books, and each book cost the same amount. To find the cost of each book, we divide the total amount spent on books by 2:

\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

So, each book cost Anna $5. The final numerical answer is:

So, the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class is 60."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the rate at which the lighthouse's light blinks. We know that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. Therefore, the rate of blinking is:

\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times. We can use the rate we just calculated to find the time required:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} \]

Now, let's perform the division:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459}{51} = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times."

"First, let's determine the time each person took to complete their chores:

1. Amalia mowed the lawn, which took her 4 hours.
2. Megan walked the dog, which took her 2 hours longer than Amalia. Therefore, Megan's chore took her \(4 + 2 = 6\) hours.
3. Dior did the laundry, which took her well over 4 hours longer than Amalia. Since Amalia's chore took 4 hours, Dior's chore took more than \(4 + 4 = 8\) hours. Let's denote the time Dior took as \(D\). According to the problem, \(D > 8\).

Now, we need to calculate the total time they all took to do their chores altogether. We know:
- Amalia's time: 4 hours
- Megan's time: 6 hours
- Dior's time: \(D\) hours, where \(D > 8\)

The total time is:
\[ 4 + 6 + D = 10 + D \]

Since \(D > 8\), the minimum value for \(D\) is 9 hours. Therefore, the minimum total time they all took to do their chores is:
\[ 10 + 9 = 19 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total distance John drives each month for his visits to his parents.

First, we need to find the distance for a one-way trip. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Given:
- Speed = 70 mph
- Time for one-way trip = 2 hours

So, the distance for one-way trip is:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{one-way}} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

Since John visits his parents twice a month, the round trip distance is:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{round-trip}} = 2 \times \text{Distance}_{\text{one-way}} = 2 \times 140 \, \text{miles} = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the total distance John drives each month for his visits to his parents is:

\[ 280 \, \text{miles} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"If Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day for 7 days, she will walk a total of \(10 \times 7 = 70\) miles in 7 days.

According to the question, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Therefore, Brian will walk half the distance that Sofie walks in 7 days. So, Brian will walk \(70 \div 2 = 35\) miles in 7 days.

The final numerical answer is 35."
"To solve this, let's first calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers.

Two workers produce 6 toys per hour, so together they produce \(2 \times 6 = 12\) toys per hour. Over a 10-hour shift, they produce \(12 \times 10 = 120\) toys.

The other two workers produce 4 toys per hour, so together they produce \(2 \times 4 = 8\) toys per hour. Over a 10-hour shift, they produce \(8 \times 10 = 80\) toys.

Adding the toys produced by all four workers, we get \(120 + 80 = 200\) toys.

The total order is 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, they have produced 200 toys. This means they still need \(400 - 200 = 200\) toys to complete the order.

Since the fifth worker is also working for a 10-hour shift, let's denote the number of toys the fifth worker produces per hour as \(x\). Over 10 hours, the fifth worker will produce \(10x\) toys.

The total number of toys produced by all five workers is \(200 + 10x\). This must equal the total order of 400 toys, so we set up the equation:

\[200 + 10x = 400\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[10x = 200\]
\[x = 20\]

Therefore, the fifth worker produces 20 toys per hour. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total weight of the M&Ms John has:

John buys 3 large bags, each weighing 10 ounces. Therefore, the total weight is:
\[ 3 \text{ bags} \times 10 \text{ ounces per bag} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to determine how many M&Ms are in the 30 ounces of M&Ms. We know that 1 ounce of M&Ms contains 30 M&Ms. Therefore, the total number of M&Ms is:
\[ 30 \text{ ounces} \times 30 \text{ M&Ms per ounce} = 900 \text{ M&Ms} \]

Now, John wants to put 10 M&Ms in each small bag. To find out how many small bags he can make, we divide the total number of M&Ms by the number of M&Ms per small bag:

"To solve this problem, let's first determine Liam's age two years ago. Since Liam is currently 16 years old, two years ago he was:

\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \text{ years old} \]

According to the problem, two years ago Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. Let's denote Vince's age two years ago as \( V \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 14 = 2V \]

To find \( V \), we solve for \( V \):

\[ V = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]

So, two years ago Vince was 7 years old. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:

\[ 7 + 2 = 9 \]

Therefore, Vince is currently 9 years old. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline as \( A \). Since they painted the same number of eggs, we have \( A = A \).

Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Sarah as \( S \). Then, the number of eggs painted by Camden is \( S + 12 \) because Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah.

We know that the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ A + A + S + (S + 12) = 56 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2A + 2S + 12 = 56 \]
Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get:
\[ 2A + 2S = 44 \]
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
\[ A + S = 22 \]

We also know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, so:
\[ S + (S + 12) = 30 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get:
\[ 2S = 18 \]
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, substituting \( S = 9 \) back into the equation \( A + S = 22 \), we get:
\[ A + 9 = 22 \]
Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get:
\[ A = 13 \]

So, Arnold painted 13 eggs, Madeline painted 13 eggs, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

To find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold, we calculate:
\[ 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons. 

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups} \]

Each group of 8 crayons will be placed in a box. Since each box contains 8 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the weight of each box will be:

\[ \text{Weight of each box} = 8 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 8 \text{ ounces} \]

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the weight of each box in pounds is:

\[ \text{Weight of each box in pounds} = \frac{8 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes. There are 25 boxes, each weighing 0.5 pounds:

\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 0.5 \text{ pounds/box} = 12.5 \text{ pounds} \]

The total weight of the crayons is:

\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Converting the total weight of the crayons to pounds:

\[ \text{Total weight of crayons in pounds} = \frac{200 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 12.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 12.5 \text{ pounds (crayons)} + 12.5 \text{ pounds (boxes)} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

Next, we need to find out how many 4-foot logs can be cut from 64 feet of wood:

\[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

Now, we need to determine how many planks John can get from these 16 logs. Since he cuts 5 planks from each log:

\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

Finally, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling these 80 planks at $1.2 per plank:

\[ 80 \text{ planks} \times \$1.2/\text{plank} = \$96 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns half of what her brother earns, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Valerie's salary} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

Given that Valerie earns $5000 per month, we can solve for her brother's salary:

\[ 5000 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

\[ \text{Brother's salary} = 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Now, we know Valerie's brother earns $10000 per month. Next, we need to find out how much their mother earns. Their mother earns twice their combined salary. First, we calculate their combined salary:

\[ \text{Combined salary} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} \]

\[ \text{Combined salary} = 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Their mother earns twice this amount:

\[ \text{Mother's salary} = 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \]

Now, we can find the total amount of money they all have together by adding their salaries:

\[ \text{Total amount} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} + \text{Mother's salary} \]

\[ \text{Total amount} = 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk, and then calculate the total time for the entire walk.

First, let's find Grandma's speed on the beach. We know that she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes. Therefore, her speed on the beach is:
\[ \text{Speed on the beach} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} \]

Since she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is:
\[ \text{Speed on the sidewalk} = 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, we calculate the time spent on the sidewalk. Since she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk in 10 minutes, the time spent on the sidewalk is:
\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the total time spent on the entire walk. The time spent on the beach is 40 minutes, and the time spent on the sidewalk is 10 minutes. Therefore, the total time is:
\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how much Jane has saved so far. She has saved $4 each week for 8 weeks, so:

\[ 4 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 8 \, \text{weeks} = 32 \, \text{dollars} \]

Jane's goal is to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she has already saved from her goal:

\[ 60 \, \text{dollars} - 32 \, \text{dollars} = 28 \, \text{dollars} \]

Jane saves $4 each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28, we divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings:

\[ \frac{28 \, \text{dollars}}{4 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 7 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60."

\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Next, we have 2 trees with 4 blue birds each:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

Finally, we have 1 tree with 3 blue birds:
\[ 1 \times 3 = 3 \]

Now, we sum these amounts to find the total number of blue birds:

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"First, let's determine the initial number of marbles Bob has. If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen is equal to 24 marbles, we can set up the following equation to find the initial number of marbles \( x \):

\[ x + 24 = 60 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 60 - 24 \]
\[ x = 36 \]

So, Bob initially has 36 marbles. Now, if Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, we need to subtract 10 from the initial number of marbles:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, the final number of marbles Bob will have is 26."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the second mug of water such that after Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle, the resulting water can be drunk (i.e., at least 40 degrees).

Let's denote the temperature of the second mug of water as \( T \) degrees.

1. Initially, the 33-degree mug has 4 ounces of water, and the second mug has \( x \) ounces of water.
2. After pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug, the remaining water in the 33-degree mug is \( 4 - 4 = 0 \) ounces, and the temperature of the remaining water is still 33 degrees.
3. After pouring 1 ounce from the second mug, the remaining water in the second mug is \( x - 1 \) ounces, and the temperature of the remaining water is \( \frac{T \cdot 1 + (x-1) \cdot 33}{x} = \frac{T + 33x - 33}{x} \) degrees.

The resulting mixture in Donny's water bottle will have a total of 5 ounces of water (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug). The temperature of this mixture should be at least 40 degrees. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{T + 33x - 33}{x} \geq 40
\]

To find the minimum temperature \( T \), we need to consider the worst-case scenario where \( x \) is as small as possible, which is 1 ounce (since pouring 1 ounce from the second mug is the smallest amount we can consider).

Substituting \( x = 1 \) into the equation:

\[
\frac{T + 33 \cdot 1 - 33}{1} \geq 40
\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[
T \geq 40
\]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the second mug of water is 40 degrees.

The final numerical answer is:

40"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of animals added to the farm over the course of three weeks and then add that to the initial number of animals.

First, let's calculate the number of animals added by Milkie Cows Limited:
- Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day.
- There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, they bring \(20 \times 7 = 140\) cows.
- For three weeks, they bring \(140 \times 3 = 420\) cows.

Next, let's calculate the number of animals added by Broilers Limited:
- Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day.
- There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, they bring \(10 \times 7 = 70\) chickens.
- For three weeks, they bring \(70 \times 3 = 210\) chickens.

Now, let's add the initial number of animals to the total number of animals added:
- Initial number of cows: 50
- Initial number of chickens: 20
- Total number of cows after three weeks: \(50 + 420 = 470\)
- Total number of chickens after three weeks: \(20 + 210 = 230\)

Finally, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is:
\[470 + 230 = 700\]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount:

Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs cost:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Since he orders 4 packs, he gets a 10% discount on the total cost. The discount amount is:
\[ 40 \times 0.10 = 4 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels he gets in total. Since each pack contains 9 bagels and he orders 4 packs, the total number of bagels is:
\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \]

To find the cost per bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels:
\[ \frac{36}{36} = 1 \]

So, the cost per bagel is $1.00. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1 \]"
"First, let's determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. According to the question, Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, we calculate:

\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 1 less than 3 is 2 scoops, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. The question states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, 1 less than 3 scoops is 2 scoops, and 3 less than 6 potatoes is 3 potatoes. Therefore, 2 scoops of mashed potatoes require 3 potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes are required for 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 2 scoops require 3 potatoes, 18 scoops would require:

\[ \frac{18}{2} \times 3 = 9 \times 3 = 27 \]

So, Gomer ate 27 potatoes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 27 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days:
- Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days.
- Total eggs in the first 30 days = 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs.

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the next 30 days:
- Chester eats 5 eggs a day for 30 days.
- Total eggs in the next 30 days = 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.

Now, let's find the total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days:
- Total eggs in 60 days = 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.

To find out how many dozens of eggs this is, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs):
- Total dozens of eggs = 240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens.

The final numerical answer is 20 dozens."
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we first need to determine the number of red jellybeans and then subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus initially.

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can represent the number of men as \(5x\) and the number of women as \(9x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of passengers is given as 84. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[5x + 9x = 84\]
\[14x = 84\]
\[x = 6\]

Now, we can find the number of men and women:
- Number of men = \(5x = 5 \times 6 = 30\)
- Number of women = \(9x = 9 \times 6 = 54\)

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:
\[54 - 20 = 34\]

So, the number of women who have remained on the bus is 34."
"To determine how many sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to first calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day and then multiply by 3.

From the information given:
- Each bouquet of sunflowers costs $8 and contains 12 sunflowers.
- Faraday earned $56 from selling bouquets per day.

First, we calculate the number of bouquets sold per day:
\[ \text{Number of bouquets sold per day} = \frac{\text{Earnings from bouquets per day}}{\text{Cost of one bouquet}} = \frac{56}{8} = 7 \text{ bouquets per day} \]

Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold per day is:
\[ \text{Number of sunflowers sold per day} = \text{Number of bouquets sold per day} \times 12 = 7 \times 12 = 84 \text{ sunflowers per day} \]

Now, to find the total number of sunflowers sold over 3 days:
\[ \text{Total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days} = \text{Number of sunflowers sold per day} \times 3 = 84 \times 3 = 252 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 252 \]"
"First, let's determine how many rocks Adam can buy with his $100. Each rock costs $5.

\[
\text{Number of rocks} = \frac{\text{Total money}}{\text{Cost per rock}} = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \text{ rocks}
\]

Adam can buy 20 rocks and then sell 60% of them. Let's calculate how many rocks he sells:

\[
\text{Number of rocks sold} = 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ rocks}
\]

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling these 12 rocks. Each rock is sold for $7.

\[
\text{Revenue from selling 12 rocks} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ dollars}
\]

Adam initially had $100. After selling 12 rocks, he has $84. The loss is the difference between the initial amount and the revenue from selling the rocks.

\[
\text{Loss} = 100 - 84 = 16 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, Adam loses $16."
"To determine the total number of days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the time required for each type of picture scene separately and then sum these times.

For the large-sized picture scenes:
Lauren can draw 5 large-sized scenes per day.
She needs to draw 45 large-sized scenes.
The number of days required for large-sized scenes is:
\[ \frac{45 \text{ scenes}}{5 \text{ scenes/day}} = 9 \text{ days} \]

For the medium-sized picture scenes:
Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized scenes per day.
She needs to draw 36 medium-sized scenes.
The number of days required for medium-sized scenes is:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ scenes}}{6 \text{ scenes/day}} = 6 \text{ days} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that both tickets are winners.

First, let's denote the probability of winning with the first ticket as \( P(W_1) \). According to the problem, \( P(W_1) = 0.20 \).

The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning with the second ticket, \( P(W_2) \), is:
\[ P(W_2) = 3 \times P(W_1) = 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60 \]

Since the events are independent (the outcome of one ticket does not affect the outcome of the other), the probability that both tickets are winners is the product of their individual probabilities:
\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = P(W_1) \times P(W_2) = 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

Thus, the probability that both tickets are winners is:
\[ \boxed{12\%} \]"

"To calculate the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to consider the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the number he eats on weekends.

Mason eats 4 carrots each weekday. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is:
\[ 4 \text{ carrots/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ carrots} \]

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is:
\[ 5 \text{ carrots/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ carrots} \]

Adding the carrots eaten on weekdays and the weekend gives us the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week:

"To determine how many more bottles of juices Hortex would have to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bottles needed to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.
2. Subtract the current daily production from the total number of bottles needed.

First, let's calculate the total number of bottles needed:
- Each person's daily energy demand is covered by 20% of a bottle.
- Therefore, to cover 100% of a person's daily energy demand, we need 5 bottles (since 100% / 20% = 5).

For 2300 people, the total number of bottles needed is:
\[ 2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we know that Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles are needed, we subtract the current production from the total number of bottles needed:
\[ 11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles} \]

So, Hortex would have to produce 7300 more bottles of juices to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of babies dressed in purple and blue, and then calculate the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple.

First, let's find the number of babies dressed in purple and blue:
- Total babies = 8
- Babies dressed in purple = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- Babies dressed in blue = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we calculate the number of babies who wear bows:
- Babies wearing bows among the blue-wearers = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 2 = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.6667 \) (rounding to the nearest whole number, 1 baby)
- Babies wearing bows among the purple-wearers = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is \( 1 + 2 = 3 \).

Now, we need to find the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. This is given by the number of purple-wearers wearing bows divided by the total number of babies wearing bows:
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of purple-wearers wearing bows}}{\text{Total number of babies wearing bows}} = \frac{2}{3} \]

To convert this probability to a percentage:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 100\% = \frac{200}{3}\% \approx 66.67\% \]

Therefore, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is approximately \( 66.67\% \)."

"To determine how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Daily Face Mask Usage:**
   - Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out.
   - He goes out three times a day.
   - Therefore, the number of face masks he uses in one day is:
     \[
     2 \text{ (times per outing)} \times 3 \text{ (outings per day)} = 6 \text{ face masks per day}
     \]

2. **Face Mask Usage Over 2 Days:**
   - To find out how many face masks he uses over 2 days, we multiply the daily usage by 2:
     \[

"First, let's calculate the total number of apartments in the first two complexes:
- Each of the first two complexes has 200 apartments.
- Therefore, the total number of apartments in the first two complexes is \(200 + 200 = 400\) apartments.

Next, we calculate the number of apartments in the third complex, which is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two complexes:
- The combined total of the first two complexes is 400 apartments.
- 60% of 400 apartments is \(0.60 \times 400 = 240\) apartments.
- Therefore, the third complex has \(400 + 240 = 640\) apartments.

Now, we calculate the total number of apartments across all three complexes:
- The total number of apartments is \(400 + 640 = 1040\) apartments.

2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we substitute \( B \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ R = 4(Y - 7) \]

Next, we substitute \( B \) and \( R \) into the third equation:
\[ 4(Y - 7) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]

Add 35 to both sides:
\[ 6Y = 72 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now, we find \( B \) and \( R \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \]
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Thus, the length of the red rope is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine how much money Rissa and Ronnie were given initially:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = $15\).

2. **Let \(x\) be the amount of money each of them gave to their sister.**
   - After giving \(x\) dollars to their sister, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her initial amount.
   - Therefore, \(15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15\).

3. **Solve for \(x\):**
   \[
   15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
   \]
   \[
   15 - x = 12
   \]
   \[
   x = 15 - 12
   \]
   \[
   x = 3
   \]

4. **Determine how much money Rissa has left:**
   - Rissa initially had $15 and gave $3 to her sister.
   - Therefore, Rissa is left with \(15 - 3 = 12\) dollars.

5. **Determine how much money Ronnie has left:**
   - Ronnie initially had $5 and did not give any money to his sister.
   - Therefore, Ronnie is left with $5.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}

"Let's break down the information given:

- There are four different colors of paint: red, white, purple, and yellow.
- There are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint.
- Half the mural is yellow.
- The total amount of paint used is 12 pints.

Let's denote the amount of red paint as \( R \), white paint as \( W \), purple paint as \( P \), and yellow paint as \( Y \).

From the information given:
- \( R = W = P \)
- \( Y = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \) pints (since half the mural is yellow)
- The total amount of paint is \( R + W + P + Y = 12 \) pints

Since \( R = W = P \), we can substitute \( W \) and \( P \) with \( R \) in the total paint equation:
\[ R + R + R + 6 = 12 \]
\[ 3R + 6 = 12 \]

Now, solve for \( R \):
\[ 3R = 12 - 6 \]
\[ 3R = 6 \]
\[ R = 2 \]

Therefore, the number of pints of red paint used is 2 pints.

The final numerical answer is:
2"
"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. The area of one bedroom is given by the product of its length and width:

\[ \text{Area of one bedroom} = 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

\[ \text{Total area of bedrooms} = 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so:

\[ \text{Area of the living room} = 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

\[ \text{Total area of the house} = 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

So, the total area of the house is:

\[ 3160 \text{ square feet} \]"
"To find the total number of puffs of clouds Alice counts from Monday to Friday, we need to calculate the number of puffs for each day and then sum them up.

- Monday: 3 puffs
- Tuesday: 2 * Monday's count = 2 * 3 = 6 puffs
- Wednesday: 2 * Tuesday's count = 2 * 6 = 12 puffs
- Thursday: 2 * Wednesday's count = 2 * 12 = 24 puffs
- Friday: 2 * Thursday's count = 2 * 24 = 48 puffs

Now, we sum the puffs from each day:
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93

The total number of puffs of clouds Alice counts at the end of the week is 93."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of pods in the new box and then calculate how many cycles can be run with $1 worth of pods.

First, let's find out how many pods are in the new box. The new box has 20% more pods than the regular box. The regular box has 100 pods.

20% of 100 pods is calculated as:
\[ 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ pods} \]

So, the new box has:
\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

Next, we need to determine how many cycles can be run with $1 worth of pods. Since each cycle uses 1 pod, $1 worth of pods will allow you to run 1 cycle.

Therefore, the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run with $1 is:
\[ 1 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1 \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of 20 dollar bills Thomas initially withdrew from the bank. Since he withdrew $1000 in 20 dollar bills, we can calculate the number of bills as follows:

\[ \text{Number of 20 dollar bills} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \]

Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home, so the number of bills he has left is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Next, Thomas uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. The number of bills he uses is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, the number of bills he has left is:

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \]

Thomas then triples his money. Since each bill is worth $20, the total amount of money he has after tripling is:

\[ 20 \times 20 \times 3 = 1200 \]

Finally, Thomas converts all his money to 5 dollar bills. The number of 5 dollar bills he has is:

\[ \frac{1200}{5} = 240 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 240 \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. In the first half, team A scores 4 goals.
2. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A in the first half, so team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals in the first half.
3. In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so team B scores \(2 \times 4 = 8\) goals in the second half.
4. In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, so team A scores \(8 / 4 = 2\) goals in the second half.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by each team:

- Team A scores \(4 + 2 = 6\) goals in the match.
- Team B scores \(2 + 8 = 10\) goals in the match.

The total number of goals scored in the match is the sum of the goals scored by team A and team B:

\[6 + 10 = 16\]

So, the final numerical answer is 16."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chalk the teacher has left and then calculate how many days he can use the chalk before it reaches 2 inches.

1. **Initial Chalk Length**: The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
2. **Chalk Used on Monday**: The teacher used 45% of the chalk by the end of Monday. So, the chalk used on Monday is:
   \[
   5 \times 0.45 = 2.25 \text{ inches}
   \]
   Therefore, the chalk remaining after Monday is:
   \[
   5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \text{ inches}
   \]
3. **Chalk Usage Rate**: The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day after Monday. So, the chalk used each day after Monday is:
   \[
   2.75 \times 0.20 = 0.55 \text{ inches per day}
   \]
4. **Chalk Recycle Condition**: The teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. We need to find out how many days the teacher can use the chalk before it reaches 2 inches.

Let's calculate the number of days \(d\) before the chalk is recycled:
\[
2.75 - 0.55d < 2
\]
Solving for \(d\):
\[
0.55d > 0.75
\]
\[
d > \frac{0.75}{0.55}
\]
\[
d > 1.3636
\]
Since \(d\) must be a whole number, the teacher can use the chalk for 2 days before it is recycled.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
2

One-fourth of the boys are on varsity:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ boys on varsity} \]

Next, we calculate the number of girls and boys not on varsity.

Number of girls not on varsity:
\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ girls not on varsity} \]

Number of boys not on varsity:
\[ 12 - 3 = 9 \text{ boys not on varsity} \]

Finally, we add the number of girls and boys not on varsity to find the total number of students not on varsity:
\[ 8 + 9 = 17 \]

"First, let's determine how many face masks Mike bought. According to the problem, Mike bought 5 face masks.

Next, we need to calculate how many face masks Johnny bought. The problem states that Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike. We can express this mathematically as:

\[ \text{Number of masks Johnny bought} = 3 \times (\text{Number of masks Mike bought}) + 2 \]

Substituting the number of masks Mike bought (5):

\[ \text{Number of masks Johnny bought} = 3 \times 5 + 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of masks Johnny bought} = 15 + 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of masks Johnny bought} = 17 \]

So, Johnny bought 17 face masks. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of teeth that the dentist fixes. According to the problem, the dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills. Since he drills 4 teeth, the number of teeth capped is:

\[ 4 + 7 = 11 \]

So, the total number of teeth fixed by the dentist is the sum of the teeth drilled and the teeth capped:

\[ 4 + 11 = 15 \]

Now, we need to find what percentage of James' teeth (which is 30) are fixed. The percentage can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:

"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the milk that Mr. Marcellus initially purchased. The company sold 4000 gallons of milk at $3.5 per gallon. Therefore, the total cost is:

\[ 4000 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = \$14000 \]

Next, we need to determine how much of this milk had passed the expiry date. Mr. Marcellus returned 2/5 of the milk. So, the amount of milk that was returned is:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \text{ gallons} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

Since the company sold the milk at $3.5 per gallon, the refund amount for the returned milk is:

\[ 1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = \$5600 \]

Therefore, the refund amount Mr. Marcellus received is:

"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now, we substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5(C + 7)) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5(C + 7)}{3} \]
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old. Let's verify this by calculating Wendy's current age using the first equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) = 5(20 + 7) = 5 \times 27 = 135 \]

Now, let's check the second condition:
\[ C + 25 = 20 + 25 = 45 \]
\[ \frac{1}{3}W = \frac{1}{3} \times 135 = 45 \]

Both conditions are satisfied, so Colin's current age is indeed 20 years. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to account for the rate at which Jay builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which means he builds 20/60 = 1/3 of a snowball per minute.

Every 15 minutes, 2 snowballs melt. So, in 15 minutes, 1/3 * 15 = 5/3 snowballs are built and 2 snowballs melt, resulting in a net gain of 5/3 - 2 = 1/3 of a snowball.

To find out how many minutes it takes to get 60 snowballs, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Total snowballs} = \text{Net gain per minute} \times \text{Total minutes} \]

\[ 60 = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Total minutes} \]

Solving for the total minutes:

\[ \text{Total minutes} = 60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take Jay 180 minutes to have 60 snowballs. To convert this into hours, we divide by 60:

\[ \text{Total hours} = \frac{180}{60} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it will take Jay 3 hours to have 60 snowballs."
"If John is 28 years old now and he is twice as old as Jim when the Digimon series came out, we can determine Jim's age at that time by dividing John's age by 2. 

So, Jim's age at that time was \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \) years old.

Since the question asks for Jim's current age, and no information is given about the passage of time since the series came out, we can assume Jim is also 14 years old now.

"Let's break down the problem day by day to find out how many bandages were used and how many were left at the end of each day.

**First Day:**
- They used 38 bandages.
- They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
- Total bandages at the end of the first day: \(38 - 38 + 50 = 50\).

**Second Day:**
- They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
- Total bandages at the end of the second day: \(50 - 28 = 22\).

**Third Day:**
- They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered \(2 \times 50 = 100\) bandages.
- They used half a pack, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.
- Total bandages at the end of the third day: \(22 - 25 + 100 = 97\).

According to the problem, they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. However, based on our calculations, they had 97 bandages left. This discrepancy suggests there might be an error in the problem statement or an additional constraint not considered.

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to consider her regular pay and the additional attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her regular pay:
- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- She works 6 days a week.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

So, her daily pay is \(7.5 \times 1.5 = 11.25\) dollars.
Her weekly pay is \(11.25 \times 6 = 67.5\) dollars.

Since there are exactly 4 weeks in April, her total pay for April is \(67.5 \times 4 = 270\) dollars.

Additionally, since she did not incur any absences, she receives an additional $10 for each week she worked. Therefore, the additional bonus for the 4 weeks is \(10 \times 4 = 40\) dollars.

Adding the regular pay and the bonus together, Jen's total earnings for April are \(270 + 40 = 310\) dollars.

- On the second day, 7 gallons were accidentally spilled by Barbie, so we subtract 7 gallons: \(20 - 7 = 13\) gallons.
- On the third day, 5 gallons were taken by Ronnie, so we subtract 5 gallons: \(13 - 5 = 8\) gallons.

On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party, and the remaining 8 gallons were shared equally among them. Therefore, each person would get \(8 / 3\) gallons.

To find the numerical answer:
\[ \frac{8}{3} = 2 \frac{2}{3} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \frac{2}{3} \]"
"Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as \( x \).

"First, let's determine the number of fish with red stripes. Since one-third of the fish have red stripes, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of fish with red stripes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

Next, we need to find out how many fish are left after accounting for the fish with red stripes. This is:

\[
\text{Remaining fish} = 66 - 22 = 44
\]

Now, we need to find out how many of these remaining fish have blue stripes. Since 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of fish with blue stripes} = \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
\]

Finally, to find the total number of fish that have either red or blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes to the number of fish with blue stripes:

\[
\text{Total number of fish with red or blue stripes} = 22 + 20 = 42
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
42

"First, let's calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had:

- Two eyeshadow palettes, each with four colors: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors
- Three makeup sets, each with six colors: \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors

So, the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had is:
\[8 + 18 = 26\]

Her sister steals one of the palettes, which means Amy loses 4 colors:
\[26 - 4 = 22\]

Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which means she uses up 3 colors (since half of 6 is 3):
\[22 - 3 = 19\]

Therefore, the final number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is:
\[19\]"
"First, let's determine the height of Mattison's house and the height of the first floor.

Mattison's height is 60 inches. The house is 7 times as high as he is:
\[ \text{Height of the house} = 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

The first floor is thrice as high as Mattison is:
\[ \text{Height of the first floor} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Since the house has two stories, the height of the second floor is the total height of the house minus the height of the first floor:
\[ \text{Height of the second floor} = 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height from the floor to the roof of the second floor is the height of the second floor:
\[ \text{Height from the floor to the roof of the second floor} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 240 \]"
"First, let's calculate how many shells team Alphas found. They found 40% of the 700 shells:

\[ \text{Shells found by Alphas} = 0.40 \times 700 = 280 \]

Next, we need to find out how many shells are left after team Alphas have found their share:

\[ \text{Remaining shells} = 700 - 280 = 420 \]

Team The finders then found 60% of the remaining shells:

\[ \text{Shells found by The finders} = 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \]

Finally, to find out how many shells team Gogetters found, we subtract the shells found by Alphas and The finders from the total:

\[ \text{Shells found by Gogetters} = 700 - 280 - 252 = 168 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 168 \]"
"Let's denote the number of miles the last dog needs to walk as \( x \).

The total number of miles the four dogs need to walk per day is the sum of the miles each dog needs:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 + x \]

According to the problem, the average number of miles the dogs need to walk per day is 3 miles. Since there are 4 dogs, the total number of miles they need to walk per day is:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \]

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 + x = 12 \]

Simplifying the left side:
\[ 8 + x = 12 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 12 - 8 \]
\[ x = 4 \]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day.

"First, let's calculate the loan amount John gets. The loan is worth 40% of the value of his house, which is $250,000.

\[ \text{Loan Amount} = 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

Next, John uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts.

\[ \text{Amount Used to Pay Off Debt} = 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

To find out how much money he has leftover after paying off his debts, we subtract the amount used to pay off the debts from the loan amount.

\[ \text{Money Leftover} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 40,000 \]"

"To find the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed per day for each setting and then multiply by the number of days it was used at that setting.

1. **Low setting:**
   - Removes 1 liter of water per day.
   - Brian used it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed at low setting: \(1 \, \text{liter/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3 \, \text{liters}\).

2. **Medium setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the low setting.
   - Therefore, it removes \(2 \times 1 = 2\) liters of water per day.
   - Brian used it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed at medium setting: \(2 \, \text{liters/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 6 \, \text{liters}\).

3. **High setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting.
   - Therefore, it removes \(2 \times 2 = 4\) liters of water per day.
   - Brian used it for 5 days.
   - Total water removed at high setting: \(4 \, \text{liters/day} \times 5 \, \text{days} = 20 \, \text{liters}\).

Now, we sum up the total water removed from all settings:

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of the jar:**
   The jar has a square base with dimensions 6 inches by 6 inches and a height of 15 inches.
   \[
   \text{Volume of the jar} = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans:**
   Given the packing efficiency is 80%, the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans is:
   \[
   \text{Effective volume} = \text{Volume of the jar} \times \text{Packing efficiency} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of jelly beans that fit in the jar:**
   Each jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches.
   \[
   \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{\text{Effective volume}}{\text{Volume per jelly bean}} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880

"To find the final price of the toy after the price changes, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price of the toy in December after an 80% increase.
2. Calculate the price of the toy in January after a 50% decrease from the December price.

**Step 1: Calculate the price in December.**

The original price of the toy in November was $40. In December, the price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we calculate 80% of $40 and add it to the original price.

\[ \text{Increase in December} = 40 \times \frac{80}{100} = 40 \times 0.8 = 32 \]

So, the price in December is:

\[ 40 + 32 = 72 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the price in January.**

In January, the price decreased by 50% from the December price. To find the new price, we calculate 50% of $72 and subtract it from the December price.

\[ \text{Decrease in January} = 72 \times \frac{50}{100} = 72 \times 0.5 = 36 \]

So, the price in January is:

\[ 72 - 36 = 36 \]

The final price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."

"First, let's determine how many apples Walter ate. He bought 60 apples and ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of them:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ apples}
\]

So, the number of apples remaining after Walter ate 24 is:

\[
60 - 24 = 36 \text{ apples}
\]

Next, Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. We calculate 25% of 36:

\[
0.25 \times 36 = 9 \text{ apples}
\]

So, the number of apples remaining after giving 9 apples to his sister is:

\[
36 - 9 = 27 \text{ apples}
\]

Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. The total amount of money he received is:

\[
27 \times 3 = 81 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
81

"If Regina wrote 9 novels last year and this is 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year, we can set up the following equation to find the total number of novels she has written this year:

\[ 9 = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{novels this year} \]

To find the number of novels she has written this year, we can rearrange the equation to solve for the number of novels this year:

\[ \text{novels this year} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} \]

Now, let's calculate the value:

\[ \text{novels this year} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \]

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

The final numerical answer is 12."
"To find the percentage of the distance Michael has covered, we first need to calculate the total distance he travels in 3 days.

Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr. There are 24 hours in a day, so in 3 days, the total number of hours is:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 72 \text{ hours} \]

The total distance Michael travels in 72 hours at 50 km/hr is:
\[ 72 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ km/hr} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

The distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. To find the percentage of the total distance that Michael has covered, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{\text{Distance covered}}{\text{Total distance}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 0.6 \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the distance Michael has covered is:
\[ 60\% \]"
"First, let's determine the number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother to make the grape juice.

Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother used up 5 times as many grapes as Madeline:
\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ grapes} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother:
\[ 6 + 30 = 36 \text{ grapes} \]

Their mother then used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. Each pie recipe calls for 12 grapes. Therefore, the total number of grapes used to make the pies is:
\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ grapes} \]

To find the initial number of grapes, we add the grapes used by Madeline and her brother to the grapes used to make the pies:
\[ 36 + 48 = 84 \text{ grapes} \]

Thus, the initial number of grapes is:
\[ \boxed{84} \]"
"To find out how many teachers were at school that day, we need to subtract the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers and then add the number of substitute teachers.

Total number of teachers = 82
Number of sick teachers = 13
Number of substitute teachers = 9

Number of teachers at school = Total number of teachers - Number of sick teachers + Number of substitute teachers

Number of teachers at school = 82 - 13 + 9

Now, let's perform the calculation:

Number of teachers at school = 69 + 9 = 78

So, the final numerical answer is 78."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the cheese per week:
- Cheddar cheese costs $3.00.
- Gruyere cheese costs twice the amount of cheddar cheese, which is \(2 \times 3.00 = 6.00\) dollars.

So, the total cost of cheese per week is:
\[ 3.00 + 6.00 = 9.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we add the cost of the pasta:
- The pasta costs $1.00 per box.

Therefore, the total cost per week for making macaroni and cheese is:
\[ 1.00 + 9.00 = 10.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much Bud spends in one year, we multiply the weekly cost by the number of weeks in a year:
\[ 10.00 \times 52 = 520.00 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 520.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms. Since it takes 15 minutes per classroom, the total time required is:

\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert the total time into hours because the workday is given in hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 1200 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

The custodian works 8 hours per day. To find out what percentage of their day is spent cleaning, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent cleaning}}{\text{Total workday}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours/day}} \right) \times 100 = 2.5 \times 100 = 250\% \]

However, this percentage seems unreasonably high, so let's recheck the calculations. The total time required is 20 hours, and the workday is 8 hours, so the percentage of the day spent cleaning is:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours/day}} \right) \times 100 = 2.5 \times 100 = 250\% \]

This indicates that the custodian spends 250% of their workday cleaning, which is not possible in reality. The correct interpretation should be that the custodian spends 250% of their workday cleaning, but practically, it means they spend 250% of their 8-hour workday, which is 20 hours, but since the workday is only 8 hours, they would need to work more than one day to complete the cleaning. 

Given the constraints of the 8-hour workday, the correct interpretation is that the custodian spends 250% of their workday cleaning, which is not practically possible in a single day. However, the question asks for the percentage of their day spent cleaning, which is 250%.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 250\% \]"
"First, let's determine the capacity of each shelf:

- Each of the middle shelves can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase:

- The total capacity of one bookcase is the sum of the capacities of all the shelves: \(10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books.

Given that Elly has 110 books, we need to determine how many bookcases are required to hold all of them:

- The number of bookcases needed is the total number of books divided by the capacity of one bookcase: \(110 \div 55 = 2\).

Therefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books. The final numerical answer is:

2"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs Rose bought. Since she bought five dozens of eggs and each dozen costs $2.40, the total cost is:

\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12.00 \]

Next, let's determine the total number of eggs Rose bought. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, let's calculate how much Rose will earn by selling the eggs. She sells the eggs at the rate of $1 for every 3 eggs. Therefore, the total earnings from selling 60 eggs can be calculated as follows:

\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ sets of 3 eggs} \]

Since each set of 3 eggs is sold for $1, the total earnings are:

\[ 20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find Rose's profit, we subtract the total cost from the total earnings:

\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \]

So, Rose's profit is:

\[ 8 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 8 \]"
"To determine the number of white hats Skyler has, we can follow these steps:

1. **Total Hats**: Skyler has 100 hats in total.

2. **Red Hats**: Half of the hats are red.
   \[
   \text{Number of red hats} = \frac{100}{2} = 50
   \]

3. **Remaining Hats After Red Hats**: Subtract the number of red hats from the total number of hats.
   \[
   \text{Remaining hats} = 100 - 50 = 50
   \]

4. **Blue Hats**: 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue.
   \[
   \text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]

5. **White Hats**: The rest of the hats are white. Subtract the number of red and blue hats from the remaining hats.
   \[
   \text{Number of white hats} = 50 - 30 = 20
   \]

So, the number of white hats Skyler has is 20."
"First, let's determine the cost of the beef jerky when it is $3.00 off. The original price of the bag is $18.00, so the discounted price is:

\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many sticks of beef jerky are in the bag. Since each bag contains 30 sticks, we can calculate the cost per stick by dividing the discounted price by the number of sticks:

\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

The cost per stick is $0.50, which is equivalent to 50 cents. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 50 \]"
"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to calculate how many questions she answered correctly on the first test.

The first test has 70 questions, and she gets 60% of them correct:
\[ 70 \times 0.60 = 42 \]
So, Audrey got 42 questions correct on the first test.

To pass 6th grade, she needs to correctly answer 70% of the total questions. The total number of questions across both tests is:
\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]
So, she needs to correctly answer:
\[ 110 \times 0.70 = 77 \]
questions in total to pass.

Since she already got 42 questions correct on the first test, the number of questions she needs to get correct on the second test is:
\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions correct on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, which can be written as:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

The total number of ice cubes is the sum of the strawberry and blueberry cubes, which is given as 116:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:
\[ S = 20 \]

Now, substituting \( S = 20 \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is 96."
"To calculate the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of games Ara has played in four years.
2. Calculate the total points scored by multiplying the number of games by her average score per game.

First, Ara has been playing 40 games every year. Over four years, the total number of games she has played is:
\[ 40 \text{ games/year} \times 4 \text{ years} = 160 \text{ games} \]

Next, her score for every game is 21 points. Therefore, the total number of points she has scored in the four years is:
\[ 160 \text{ games} \times 21 \text{ points/game} = 3360 \text{ points} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this, let's break down the time it takes John to solve each side of the Rubik's cube:

1. The first side takes 5 minutes.
2. The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so each takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes.
3. The fourth and fifth sides each take half as long as the first side, so each takes \(5 / 2 = 2.5\) minutes.

Now, let's add up the time for all sides:

- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes

Total time = \(5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30\) minutes.

3. In the next 30 seconds, four times the initial amount pop, which is \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels.
4. In the final 30 seconds, half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, which is \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) kernels.

Now, let's sum up the total number of kernels that popped in the first 120 seconds:
\[ 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 \]

After the pan is taken off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds pop from the residual heat. The number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds is 40, so a quarter of that is:
\[ \frac{40}{4} = 10 \]

Adding these to the initial total:
\[ 200 + 10 = 210 \]

Therefore, the final number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat is:
\[ 210 \]"
"To determine the total number of lemons Tim needs, we can break down the problem into parts:

1. **Lemons needed for 4 gallons of lemonade:**
   - The recipe calls for 1 cup of fresh lemon juice per gallon of lemonade.
   - Tim needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade.
   - Therefore, he needs \(4 \text{ gallons} \times 1 \text{ cup/gallon} = 4 \text{ cups of lemon juice}\).

2. **Lemons needed for 3 regular gallons:**
   - Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, to get 3 cups of juice (for 3 gallons), Tim needs \(3 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 18 \text{ lemons}\).

3. **Lemons needed for 1 extra gallon (twice as tart):**
   - The extra gallon is twice as tart, so it will still require 1 cup of lemon juice.
   - Therefore, Tim needs 6 lemons for this extra gallon.

4. **Total lemons needed:**
   - Adding the lemons needed for the 3 regular gallons and the extra gallon, Tim needs \(18 \text{ lemons} + 6 \text{ lemons} = 24 \text{ lemons}\).

Thus, the total number of lemons Tim will need is 24."

4. **Weekly consumption:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Weekly consumption: \(21 \times 7 = 147\) kilograms

Therefore, the Kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week."
"To find the total number of pairs of animal legs, we first need to calculate the total number of legs and then divide by 2.

For the 2-legged animals:
10 animals * 2 legs/animal = 20 legs

For the 4-legged animals:
15 animals * 4 legs/animal = 60 legs

Adding these together gives the total number of legs:
20 legs + 60 legs = 80 legs

To find the number of pairs of legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2:
80 legs / 2 = 40 pairs

So, the final numerical answer is 40."
"Let's denote the number of red blocks as \( R \).

Given:
- The number of blue blocks is 4.
- The number of yellow blocks is twice the number of blue blocks, which is \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \).
- The total number of blocks is 32.

The total number of blocks can be expressed as the sum of blue, yellow, and red blocks:
\[ 4 + 8 + R = 32 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 12 + R = 32 \]

To find \( R \), we subtract 12 from both sides of the equation:
\[ R = 32 - 12 \]
\[ R = 20 \]

So, the number of red blocks is 20."
"To determine how far Elvis is from his house, we need to calculate the distance he traveled west and the distance he traveled east, and then find the net distance from his starting point.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled west:
- Elvis drives west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance west = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled east:
- Elvis drives east for 8 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance east = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles

Now, we need to find the net distance from his starting point. Since he traveled west first and then east, we subtract the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east:
- Net distance = Distance east - Distance west
- Net distance = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

Therefore, Elvis is 54 miles from his house now."
"To find the final value of the boat after three years of depreciation, we need to calculate the value after each year's depreciation step by step.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   - Initial value: $9000
   - Depreciation rate: 30%
   - Depreciation amount: \( 9000 \times 0.30 = 2700 \)
   - Value after first year: \( 9000 - 2700 = 6300 \)

2. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   - Value at the start of the second year: $6300
   - Depreciation rate: 30%
   - Depreciation amount: \( 6300 \times 0.30 = 1890 \)

"To determine how many pounds of feed are left after a week, we need to calculate the total amount of feed consumed by the pigs over that period.

First, let's find out how much feed one pig consumes in a day:
- Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day.
- Therefore, one pig eats \(4 \times 2 = 8\) pounds of feed per day.

Next, we calculate the total feed consumption for all five pigs in one day:
- Five pigs each eat 8 pounds of feed per day.
- Therefore, the total feed consumption for five pigs in one day is \(5 \times 8 = 40\) pounds.

Now, we determine the total feed consumption for one week (7 days):
- Five pigs consume 40 pounds of feed per day.
- Therefore, in one week, they consume \(40 \times 7 = 280\) pounds of feed.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. To find out how much feed is left after a week, we subtract the total feed consumed from the initial amount:
- Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed.
- The pigs consumed 280 pounds of feed in a week.

"First, we need to calculate the total number of hot dogs required for the party. John invited 20 people and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs, so:

\[ 20 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ hot dogs/guest} = 40 \text{ hot dogs} \]

John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party, so we need to subtract these from the total required:

\[ 40 \text{ hot dogs} - 4 \text{ hot dogs} = 36 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Next, we need to determine how many packs of hot dogs John needs to buy. Each pack contains 6 hot dogs, so we divide the number of hot dogs needed by the number of hot dogs per pack:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ hot dogs}}{6 \text{ hot dogs/pack}} = 6 \text{ packs} \]

Each pack costs $2, so the total cost for the packs is:

\[ 6 \text{ packs} \times 2 \text{ dollars/pack} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, John needs to spend:

"First, let's calculate the time Charisma spends meditating each day. She meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes at night, which totals to 30 minutes per day.

Next, let's calculate the time she spends on yoga each week. She practices yoga for 1 hour (60 minutes) 5 days a week, so she spends 5 * 60 = 300 minutes on yoga each week.

Now, let's calculate the total time spent on meditation and yoga in one week. Since she meditates for 30 minutes each day and there are 7 days in a week, she spends 7 * 30 = 210 minutes on meditation each week. Adding the time spent on yoga, she spends 210 + 300 = 510 minutes on meditation and yoga each week.

Finally, to find out how much time she has spent on meditation/yoga practice in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly total by 4:

510 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 2040 minutes.

The final numerical answer is 23."
"To calculate the total amount of money Matthew would earn, we need to break down the collection into two halves and calculate the earnings from each half separately.

Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers, so each half would consist of 6 toy soldiers.

For the first half (6 toy soldiers at $5 each):
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \]

For the second half (6 toy soldiers at $7 each):
\[ 6 \times 7 = 42 \]

Now, we add the earnings from both halves to find the total amount Matthew would earn:
\[ 30 + 42 = 72 \]

So, Matthew would earn $72 if he agrees to the offer."
"First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate returns, he starts filling in 9 holes a day, but the dog continues to dig 6 holes every night. So, the net number of holes filled each day is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/day} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take to fill in all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

To find out how many weeks it takes, we divide the number of days by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"To find the difference in enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we first need to determine the average enrollment at Butler High School.

Given:
- Norman High School's average enrollment = 4000 students
- Butler High School's average enrollment = \(\frac{3}{4}\) of Norman High School's average enrollment

First, calculate Butler High School's average enrollment:
\[
\text{Butler High School's enrollment} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 = 3000 \text{ students}
\]

Next, find the difference in enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Norman High School's enrollment} - \text{Butler High School's enrollment} = 4000 - 3000 = 1000 \text{ students}
\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies the Adams family has made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.

Total cookies made = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies made - Rainbow cookies - Oatmeal cookies
Chocolate chip cookies = 7995 - 2595 - 3075

Now, let's perform the calculation:

Chocolate chip cookies = 7995 - 2595 - 3075
Chocolate chip cookies = 5400 - 3075
Chocolate chip cookies = 2325

So, the number of chocolate chip cookies made is 2325."
"First, let's determine the number of each item Igor gathered by accident:

- Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many, which is \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes.
- Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes, but Igor gathered two more than requested, which is \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes.
- Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, and Igor picked up the correct number, which is 7 beakers.

Now, let's calculate the total number of items Igor gathered:

- Test tubes: 8
- Beakers: 7
- Petri dishes: 16

Adding these together gives:
\[ 8 + 7 + 16 = 31 \]

Dr. Grumpus wanted a total of 29 items placed on the lab bench. Since Igor gathered 31 items, the number of items he lost is:
\[ 31 - 29 = 2 \]

Therefore, the number of beakers Igor lost is 2."
"First, we need to determine the total number of screws required for all the tables.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. Therefore, the number of screws needed for one table is:
\[ 4 \text{ legs/table} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 8 \text{ screws/table} \]

James is assembling 4 tables, so the total number of screws needed for all the tables is:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws/table} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the number of screws he has:
\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

Thus, the number of screws James will have left over is:
\[ 8 \]"
"If there are 10 eggs in the first basket and twice as many in the second basket, then the second basket has \(10 \times 2 = 20\) eggs.

Therefore, the total number of eggs in both baskets is \(10 + 20 = 30\).

The final numerical answer is 30."
"First, let's determine how much money each person raised individually.

Alexandra raised $430.

Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so:
\[ \text{Kim's amount} = 430 + 320 = 750 \]

Next, we need to find out how much Sarah raised. We know that Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, and Sarah raised $300, so:
\[ \text{Maryam's amount} = 300 + 400 = 700 \]

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money raised by adding the amounts raised by each person:
\[ \text{Total amount} = \text{Alexandra's amount} + \text{Kim's amount} + \text{Sarah's amount} + \text{Maryam's amount} \]
\[ \text{Total amount} = 430 + 750 + 300 + 700 \]

Adding these amounts together:
\[ 430 + 750 = 1180 \]
\[ 1180 + 300 = 1480 \]
\[ 1480 + 700 = 2180 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money raised by all of them is:
\[ 2180 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2180 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Aaron's speed:**
   - Let's denote the distance Aaron ran as \(d_A\) miles.
   - Since Aaron ran each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, if Vanessa's speed is \(v_V\) miles per minute, then Aaron's speed is \(2v_V\) miles per minute.
   - Given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, we can write the equation for the distance Aaron ran as:
     \[
     d_A = 16 \times 2v_V = 32v_V
     \]

2. **Determine Vanessa's distance:**
   - We know that Vanessa ran 4 miles.
   - According to the problem, Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron did. Therefore, we can write:
     \[
     4 = 2d_A
     \]
   - Solving for \(d_A\):
     \[
     d_A = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ miles}
     \]

3. **Verify the consistency:**
   - From the first step, we have \(d_A = 32v_V\).
   - Substituting \(d_A = 2\) miles into the equation:
     \[
     2 = 32v_V
     \]
   - Solving for \(v_V\):
     \[
     v_V = \frac{2}{32} = \frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute}
     \]

4. **Determine Vanessa's time to complete her part:**
   - Vanessa's speed is \(v_V = \frac{1}{16}\) miles per minute.
   - Since Vanessa ran 4 miles, the time \(t_V\) she took to complete her part is:
     \[
     t_V = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{\frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute}} = 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race."
"First, we need to calculate the total amount of line required based on the current dock length. The caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. With 200 feet of dock, the total line required is:

\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Next, we need to determine how much more line is needed after accounting for the 6 feet of new line he already has:

\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of new line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

So, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."

- Each reservation includes 2 meals at $5 each and 1 bottle of wine at $5.
- The total cost per reservation is \(2 \times 5 + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15\) dollars.

Next, calculate the total cost per night:
- The restaurant gets 6 reservations per night.
- The total cost per night is \(6 \times 15 = 90\) dollars.

Now, calculate the total cost per week:
- The restaurant is open 2 days a week.
- The total cost per week is \(2 \times 90 = 180\) dollars.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total selling price of the watermelons. The vendor made a 25% profit on the cost price. The cost price for 50 watermelons is $80.

To find the selling price, we calculate the profit first:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Cost Price} \times \text{Profit Percentage} \]
\[ \text{Profit} = 80 \times 0.25 = 20 \]

Now, we add the profit to the cost price to get the total selling price:
\[ \text{Total Selling Price} = \text{Cost Price} + \text{Profit} \]
\[ \text{Total Selling Price} = 80 + 20 = 100 \]

The total selling price for 50 watermelons is $100. To find the selling price per watermelon, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:
\[ \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{\text{Total Selling Price}}{\text{Number of Watermelons}} \]
\[ \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{100}{50} = 2 \]

So, each watermelon was sold for $2."
"First, let's determine James's current age. Since Dora will be 12 in 3 years, she is currently 9 years old. James is now twice as old as Dora, so James is currently 2 * 9 = 18 years old.

John had James when he was 19, so John is currently 19 + 18 = 37 years old.

Now, let's find out how old John's youngest son is. The youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest son is currently 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, the youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

The final numerical answer is 8."
"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in that time.

First, let's find out how many oranges each can peel in one minute:
- Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in one minute, she peels \( \frac{1}{3} \) of an orange.
- Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in one minute, she peels \( \frac{1}{4} \) of an orange.

Next, we calculate how many oranges each can peel in one hour (60 minutes):
- In one hour, Ana peels \( 60 \times \frac{1}{3} = 20 \) oranges.
- In one hour, Jane peels \( 60 \times \frac{1}{4} = 15 \) oranges.

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane in one hour:
- The difference is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \).

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

The final numerical answer is:
5"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400, and Mark gets it at 80% off. 

The discount amount is:
\[ 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \]

So, the cost of the radiator after the discount is:
\[ 400 - 320 = 80 \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost of hiring the mechanic. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.

The total cost for the mechanic is:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator after the discount to the cost of hiring the mechanic:
\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

Therefore, the total amount Mark paid is:
\[ 230 \]"
"Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( K \).

We know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

From the first piece of information, we can write the equation:
\[ C + K = 20 \]

From the second piece of information, we know that chickens have 2 legs each and cows have 4 legs each, so we can write the equation:
\[ 2C + 4K = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

To solve this system, we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ C + 2K - C - K = 15 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 20 - 15 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is 5. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of slices available from the 7 pizzas. Since each pizza is cut into 8 slices, we can calculate the total number of slices as follows:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to divide the total number of slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends, which makes a total of 4 people. We can find out how many slices each person gets by dividing the total number of slices by the number of people:

\[ \frac{56 \text{ slices}}{4 \text{ people}} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

So, each of them can have 14 slices. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 14 \]"
