"First, let's figure out how many eggs Janet has left after eating and baking.

She starts with 16 eggs a day.
She eats 3 eggs for breakfast.
She bakes muffins with 4 eggs.

So, the number of eggs left is:
16 - 3 - 4 = 9 eggs

Janet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg.

So, the total amount she makes every day is:
9 eggs * $2/egg = $18

The final numerical answer is $18."
"A half of 2 is 1. So, the robe takes 1 bolt of white fiber. 
To find the total, we add the blue fiber and the white fiber together: 2 bolts of blue fiber + 1 bolt of white fiber = 3 bolts in total. 

The final numerical answer is 3."
"First, let's find out how much the house increased in value. The house increased by 150% of its original value. The original value of the house was $80,000.

To find 150% of $80,000, we calculate:
\[ 150\% \times 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

So, the house increased in value by $120,000. Now, we add this increase to the original value of the house to find the new value:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Josh bought the house for $80,000 and then spent $50,000 on repairs. So, the total amount he spent is:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total amount spent from the new value of the house:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

So, Josh made a profit of $70,000."
"James runs 3 sprints a day, so in a week, he runs:
3 sprints/day * 3 days/week = 9 sprints/week

Each sprint is 60 meters, so in a week, he runs:
9 sprints/week * 60 meters/sprint = 540 meters/week

The final numerical answer is 540 meters."
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs for the final meal, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she gives her chickens in the morning and afternoon.

In the morning, she gives 15 cups of feed.
In the afternoon, she gives 25 cups of feed.

So, the total feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
15 cups + 25 cups = 40 cups

Since she has 20 chickens and she feeds each chicken 3 cups of feed every day, the total feed needed for all chickens is:
20 chickens * 3 cups/chicken = 60 cups

To find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total feed needed for all chickens:
60 cups - 40 cups = 20 cups

So, Wendi needs 20 cups of feed for the final meal of the day."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses.
2. The first glass costs $5.
3. Every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $5 * 0.60 = $3.

Now, let's count how many glasses cost $5 and how many cost $3:
- There are 8 glasses that cost $5 (since every second glass is $3, we divide 16 by 2).
- There are also 8 glasses that cost $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost:
- Cost of 8 glasses at $5 each: 8 * $5 = $40.
- Cost of 8 glasses at $3 each: 8 * $3 = $24.

Adding these together gives the total cost:
- Total cost = $40 + $24 = $64.

So, Kylar needs to pay $64 for the 16 glasses."
"First, we need to find out how many sheep Charleston has. Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, and Seattle has 20 sheep, we can calculate the number of sheep in Charleston as follows:

Number of sheep in Charleston = 4 * Number of sheep in Seattle
Number of sheep in Charleston = 4 * 20
Number of sheep in Charleston = 80

Next, we need to find out how many sheep Toulouse has. Since Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, and Charleston has 80 sheep, we can calculate the number of sheep in Toulouse as follows:

Number of sheep in Toulouse = 2 * Number of sheep in Charleston
Number of sheep in Toulouse = 2 * 80
Number of sheep in Toulouse = 160

Now, to find out how many sheep Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together, we add the number of sheep in each city:

Total number of sheep = Number of sheep in Toulouse + Number of sheep in Charleston + Number of sheep in Seattle
Total number of sheep = 160 + 80 + 20
Total number of sheep = 260

So, the final numerical answer is 260."
"First, we need to find out how much of the file Carla has downloaded before the restart. Since the file is 200 GB and she has downloaded 40% of it, we calculate:

\[ 200 \text{ GB} \times 0.40 = 80 \text{ GB} \]

This means she has 80 GB downloaded before the restart. Now, she needs to download the remaining part of the file. The total file size is 200 GB, so the remaining part is:

\[ 200 \text{ GB} - 80 \text{ GB} = 120 \text{ GB} \]

The download speed is 2 GB/minute, so to find out how long it takes to download the remaining 120 GB, we divide:

\[ 120 \text{ GB} \div 2 \text{ GB/minute} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Since she had to restart the download after the 20 minutes of the Windows update, we add this time to the 60 minutes:

\[ 60 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it takes to download the file is 80 minutes."
"First, let's calculate how far John drove in the first 3 hours. He drove at 60 mph for 3 hours, so:
\[ 60 \text{ mph} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \]

Next, he spends 2 hours in traffic, so he doesn't drive any distance during this time.

Then, he drives at 30 mph for 0.5 hours, so:
\[ 30 \text{ mph} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ miles} \]

After that, he drives at 80 mph for the remaining time. He has 4 hours in total and has already used 3 hours (3 hours initially + 2 hours in traffic + 0.5 hours at 30 mph), so he has:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} - 3.5 \text{ hours} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \]
to drive at 80 mph. So, the distance he covers in 0.5 hours at 80 mph is:
\[ 80 \text{ mph} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ miles} \]

Now, let's add up all the distances he drove:
\[ 180 \text{ miles} + 15 \text{ miles} + 40 \text{ miles} = 235 \text{ miles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 235 \text{ miles} \]"
"Eliza worked 45 hours this week. The first 40 hours are at her regular rate of $10 per hour. The remaining 5 hours are overtime at 1.2 times her regular rate.

First, let's calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

Next, let's calculate her overtime pay rate:
$10/hour * 1.2 = $12/hour

Now, let's calculate her earnings for the 5 hours of overtime:
5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Finally, let's add the earnings from the regular hours and the overtime hours to get her total earnings for the week:
$400 + $60 = $460

So, Eliza's total earnings for this week are $460."
"First, let's calculate the number of downloads in the second month. If the first month had 60 downloads and the second month had three times as many, then:

\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ downloads} \]

Next, we need to find out how many downloads there were in the third month. The number of downloads in the third month was reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we do:

\[ 180 \times 0.30 = 54 \text{ downloads} \]

So, the number of downloads in the third month is:

\[ 180 - 54 = 126 \text{ downloads} \]

Now, to find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month:

\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \text{ downloads} \]

So, the total number of downloads over the three months is 366."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of pastry:

- Donuts: 3 dozen at $68 per dozen
- Mini cupcakes: 2 dozen at $80 per dozen
- Mini cheesecakes: 6 dozen at $55 per dozen

Now, let's calculate the cost for each type:

- Cost of donuts = 3 dozen * $68 per dozen = $204
- Cost of mini cupcakes = 2 dozen * $80 per dozen = $160
- Cost of mini cheesecakes = 6 dozen * $55 per dozen = $330

Now, let's add up all the costs to get the total cost:

Total cost = Cost of donuts + Cost of mini cupcakes + Cost of mini cheesecakes
Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330

Now, let's add these numbers:

Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694

So, the total cost is $694."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. The tree costs $90 to plant.
2. Each year, the tree gives 7 lemons.
3. Each lemon can be sold for $1.5.
4. Each year, it costs $3 to water and feed the tree.

First, let's calculate how much money Carlos gets from selling the lemons each year:
- 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.50

Now, let's see how much money he spends each year:
- $3 for water and feed

To find out how many years it takes for Carlos to start earning money, we need to find out when the money he gets from selling lemons is more than the money he spends on water and feed.

So, we need to find the number of years (let's call it 'y') when the money he earns from lemons is greater than the money he spends on water and feed:
- $10.50 * y > $3 * y

This simplifies to:
- $10.50 > $3

This inequality is always true, which means that in the first year, Carlos will start earning money. 

So, it will take 1 year for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree."
"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Let's say Melanie started with X vacuum cleaners.
2. She sold 1/3 of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. So, she sold X/3 vacuum cleaners there.
3. Then she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house.
4. After selling at the green and red houses, she had X - X/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.
5. She then sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she sold (X - X/3 - 2)/2 vacuum cleaners there.
6. After selling at the orange house, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left.

Now, let's set up an equation based on the information given:

\[ X - \frac{X}{3} - 2 - \frac{X - \frac{X}{3} - 2}{2} = 5 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ X - \frac{X}{3} - 2 - \frac{X}{2} + \frac{X}{6} + 1 = 5 \]

Combining like terms:

\[ X - \frac{2X}{6} - \frac{X}{3} - 1 = 5 \]

\[ X - \frac{2X + 2X - 6X}{6} - 1 = 5 \]

\[ X - \frac{0}{6} - 1 = 5 \]

\[ X - 1 = 5 \]

\[ X = 6 \]

So, Melanie started with 6 vacuum cleaners."
"First, let's find out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance. 20% of 20 students is:

\( 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \) students

So, 4 students are in contemporary dance. Now, we subtract these from the total to find out how many are left:

\( 20 - 4 = 16 \) students

Next, we find out how many of these 16 students enrolled in jazz dance. 25% of 16 students is:

\( 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \) students

So, 4 students are in jazz dance. Now, we subtract these from the remaining students to find out how many are left for hip-hop dance:

\( 16 - 4 = 12 \) students

Therefore, 12 students are in hip-hop dance. To find out what percentage of the entire class this is, we use the formula:

\( \frac{12}{20} \times 100\% = 60\% \)

So, 60% of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance."
"First, let's calculate the increase in value for each item based on the financial advisor's speculation.

For the jewelry:
- Original value: $5,000
- Increase: 2.5% of $5,000 = 0.025 * $5,000 = $125

So, the jewelry will be worth:
- $5,000 + $125 = $5,125

For the electronic gadgets:
- Original value: $8,000
- Increase: 1.2% of $8,000 = 0.012 * $8,000 = $96

So, the electronic gadgets will be worth:
- $8,000 + $96 = $8,096

Now, let's calculate the profit for each option:
- Jewelry profit: $5,125 - $5,000 = $125
- Electronic gadgets profit: $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

The merchant would make more profit by choosing the jewelry. The profit would be:
- $125"
"To solve this, let's break it down into parts:

1. The trains travel westward for 80 miles each.
2. The next day, they travel northwards for 150 miles each.

So, the total distance covered by each train in the two days is the sum of the distances covered in both directions:

80 miles (west) + 150 miles (north) = 230 miles

The final numerical answer is:
230"
"First, let's calculate how much Jill earns as a teacher in a year:
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings as a teacher are:
\[ 35 \text{ hours/week} \times $20/\text{hour} = $700/\text{week} \]

Then, her annual earnings as a teacher are:
\[ $700/\text{week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = $35,000/\text{year} \]

Next, let's calculate how much Jill earns as a cheerleading coach in a year:
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings as a coach are:
\[ 15 \text{ hours/week} \times $30/\text{hour} = $450/\text{week} \]

Then, her annual earnings as a coach are:
\[ $450/\text{week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = $22,500/\text{year} \]

Now, let's add her annual earnings as a teacher and as a coach to find her total annual salary:
\[ $35,000/\text{year} + $22,500/\text{year} = $57,500/\text{year} \]

So, Jill's annual salary is $57,500."
"First, we need to find out how many eggs Claire uses in one day. She uses 3 eggs each day.

Next, we need to find out how many eggs she uses in one week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of eggs she uses in one day by 7:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Now, we need to find out how many eggs she uses in 4 weeks:
\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Finally, we need to convert the total number of eggs into dozens. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:
\[ 84 \text{ eggs} \div 12 = 7 \text{ dozens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 7 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time Marissa has already spent hiking. She took 1 hour for the first 4 miles and another 1 hour for the next 2 miles. So, she has already spent 1 + 1 = 2 hours.

The total distance of the trail is 12 miles. So, the remaining distance she needs to walk is 12 - 4 - 2 = 6 miles.

Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour. To find out how long she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles to achieve this average speed, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Plugging in the values for the remaining distance and the desired average speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in 1.5 hours to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

Now, to find out the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

Plugging in the values for the remaining distance and the time:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1.5 \text{ hours}} = 4 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles at a speed of 4 miles per hour."
"First, let's find out how much water is in the 10 liters of orange drink. Since two-thirds of the orange drink is water, we calculate:

Water in orange drink = 2/3 * 10 liters = 20/3 liters = 6.666... liters

Next, let's find out how much water is in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since three-fifths of the pineapple drink is water, we calculate:

Water in pineapple drink = 3/5 * 15 liters = 9 liters

Now, we add the water from both drinks before any spillage:

Total water before spillage = Water in orange drink + Water in pineapple drink
Total water before spillage = 6.666... liters + 9 liters = 15.666... liters

But we spill one liter of the orange drink, so we need to subtract that from the total:

Total water after spillage = Total water before spillage - 1 liter
Total water after spillage = 15.666... liters - 1 liter = 14.666... liters

So, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 14.666... liters."
"First, we need to find out Samantha's age when Raymond had his son. Since Raymond had his son at the age of 23 and Samantha is now 31, we can calculate the number of years between Raymond's age when he had his son and Samantha's current age.

Samantha's current age is 31, and Raymond was 23 when he had his son. So, the number of years between them is:
31 - 23 = 8 years

Since Raymond was 23 when he had his son, and 8 years have passed since then, we can conclude that Raymond's son was born 8 years ago."
"Billy sold 3 DVDs to the first 3 customers because each bought one DVD. He sold 2 DVDs to the next 2 customers because each bought two DVDs. The last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs.

So, the total number of DVDs sold is 3 + 2 = 5 DVDs."
"From 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is a total of 4 hours.
If the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, then in 4 hours it will melt by 2 * 4 = 8 centimeters.
So, the final numerical answer is 8."
"To find the original price of the book, we need to understand that Kyle paid $19.50 which is 75% of the original price (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

Let's denote the original price as \( P \).

So, \( 0.75P = $19.50 \).

To find \( P \), we divide $19.50 by 0.75.

\( P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \).

\( P = 26 \).

So, the original price of the book was $26."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the items Marie ordered that we know the price for:

- Chicken meal: $12
- 5 packs of milk at $3 each: 5 * $3 = $15
- 4 apples at $1.50 each: 4 * $1.50 = $6

Now, let's add up these known costs:
$12 + $15 + $6 = $33

Marie paid a total of $50, so the cost of the boxes of pizza is:
$50 - $33 = $17

Each box of pizza costs $8.50, so to find out how many boxes Marie ordered, we divide the total cost of the pizza by the cost of one box:
$17 ÷ $8.50 = 2

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza. The final numerical answer is 2."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the shorts:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts.
- Each pair of shorts costs $16.50.

So, the total cost for the shorts is:
3 pairs * $16.50/pair = $59.50

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pants:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
- Each pair of pants costs $22.50.

So, the total cost for the pants is:
3 pairs * $22.50/pair = $67.50

Then, let's calculate the cost of the shoes:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
- Each pair of shoes costs $42.

So, the total cost for the shoes is:
3 pairs * $42/pair = $126

Now, let's add up the total cost for all the clothing items:
Total cost = Cost of shorts + Cost of pants + Cost of shoes
Total cost = $59.50 + $67.50 + $126

Adding these together:
$59.50 + $67.50 = $127
$127 + $126 = $253

So, Mishka spent $253 on all the clothing items."
"Cynthia eats 1 serving of ice cream every night, so in 60 days, she will eat 60 servings of ice cream.

Each carton of ice cream has 15 servings, so she will need 60 / 15 = 4 cartons of ice cream.

Each carton costs $4.00, so 4 cartons will cost 4 * $4.00 = $16.00.

The final numerical answer is $16.00."
"Henry traveled 35 miles between his first and second stops.

To find this, we subtract the distance of his first stop from the distance of his second stop. His second stop was 15 miles before the end, so it was 60 - 15 = 45 miles into his trip. His first stop was at 20 miles. So, the distance between his first and second stops is 45 - 20 = 25 miles."
"First, let's find out how much the two pairs of high heels cost together. We know one pair costs $33 and the other costs twice as much, so the other pair costs $33 * 2 = $66. Together, the two pairs cost $33 + $66 = $99.

The boots cost five dollars more than the two pairs of high heels together. So, the boots cost $99 + $5 = $104.

The final numerical answer is:
104"
"First, let's find out how many parts the ratio 7:11 represents. The total number of parts is 7 + 11 = 18 parts.

Since their total age is 162, each part of the ratio represents 162 / 18 = 9 years.

Now, to find out Allen's current age, we multiply his part of the ratio (11 parts) by the value of each part (9 years):
Allen's current age = 11 * 9 = 99 years.

To find out Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 years to his current age:
Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109 years.

So, the final numerical answer is 109."
"First, let's find out how many jelly beans each friend guessed:

1. The first friend guessed 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guessed 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60. So, the second friend guessed 60 jelly beans.
3. The third friend guessed 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, and adding that to 80 gives us 100. So, the third friend guessed 100 jelly beans.

Now, let's add up all the guesses:
80 + 60 + 100 = 240

To find the average guess, we divide the total by the number of guesses, which is 3:
240 ÷ 3 = 80

So, the average guess is 80 jelly beans."
"Each dog takes .5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business.
So, for 10 dogs, it would be:
.5 hours/dog * 10 dogs = 5 hours a day.

To find out how many hours a week he spends, we multiply the daily hours by the number of days in a week:
5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 35 hours/week.

The final numerical answer is 35 hours."
"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Let's say Gretchen has \( S \) silver coins.
2. According to the problem, she has 30 more gold coins than silver coins, so she has \( S + 30 \) gold coins.
3. The total number of coins is 110, which is the sum of silver coins and gold coins. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   S + (S + 30) = 110
   \]
4. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   2S + 30 = 110
   \]
5. Subtract 30 from both sides:
   \[
   2S = 80
   \]
6. Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   S = 40
   \]
7. Now, to find the number of gold coins, we add 30 to the number of silver coins:
   \[
   S + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70
   \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final numerical answer is 70."
"First, let's find out how many jewels Aaron has. We know that Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Raymond has 40 jewels.

Half of Raymond's jewels is:
40 / 2 = 20 jewels

So, Aaron has:
20 + 5 = 25 jewels

Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, if Aaron has 25 jewels, then:

Siobhan has:
25 - 2 = 23 jewels

The final numerical answer is 23."
"Mike scores 4 points in the first 20 minutes.
In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than 4 points. To find 25% of 4 points, you multiply 4 by 0.25, which equals 1 point.
So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores 4 + 1 = 5 points.
In total, Mike scores 4 points + 5 points = 9 points."
"First, we need to find out how much one yogurt costs. Since 4 yogurts cost $5.00, one yogurt costs $5.00 divided by 4, which is $1.25.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in one day, he spends $1.25 * 2 = $2.50.

Over 30 days, he will spend $2.50 * 30 = $75.00.

So, the final numerical answer is 75."
"John sells all his lego sets for $15 each and he has 13 lego sets. So the total money he gets from selling the lego sets is:
13 lego sets * $15/lego set = $195

He uses this $195 to buy 8 video games for $20 each. So the total cost for the 8 video games is:
8 video games * $20/video game = $160

After buying the video games, he has $5 left. So the total amount of money he had initially is:
$195 (from selling lego sets) + $160 (for video games) + $5 (leftover) = $360

Since he sold all his lego sets and he still has no lego sets left, the answer is:
13 lego sets"
"First, we need to find out how many miles John runs each day. He runs 3 days a week and the total miles he runs in a week is 60 miles.

So, to find out how many miles he runs each day, we divide the total miles by the number of days he runs:
\[ \text{Miles per day} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ days}} = 20 \text{ miles/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours he runs each day. He runs 3 hours the first day and half as much the other two days. So, the other two days he runs:
\[ \text{Hours on the other two days} = \frac{3 \text{ hours}}{2} = 1.5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Now, we can calculate the speed. Speed is calculated as distance divided by time. So, for the first day:
\[ \text{Speed on the first day} = \frac{20 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} \]

For the other two days:
\[ \text{Speed on the other two days} = \frac{20 \text{ miles}}{1.5 \text{ hours}} \]

Let's calculate these speeds:
\[ \text{Speed on the first day} = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ miles/hour} \]
\[ \text{Speed on the other two days} = \frac{20}{1.5} = \frac{20 \times 2}{3} = \frac{40}{3} \approx 13.33 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Since the question asks for the speed, we can consider the average speed over the week. The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time:
\[ \text{Total distance} = 60 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Total time} = 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Average speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles/hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/hour} \]"
"First, let's find out how fast Dana can walk. If she can skip at 3 miles per hour and that's half as fast as she can run, then she can run at 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Now, we know she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. If she runs for one-third of the time, she walks for two-thirds of the time. The total time is six hours.

So, the time she spends running is 6 * 1/3 = 2 hours.
And the time she spends walking is 6 * 2/3 = 4 hours.

Now, let's calculate how far she can run in 2 hours. Since she runs at 6 miles per hour, in 2 hours she can run 6 * 2 = 12 miles.

Next, let's calculate how far she can walk in 4 hours. Since she walks at the same speed as she can walk, which is 4 miles per hour, in 4 hours she can walk 4 * 4 = 16 miles.

So, in six hours, Dana can travel a total of 12 miles running + 16 miles walking = 28 miles.

The final numerical answer is 28 miles."
"First, let's find out how old Ben's iPhone is. Since Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone and Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, we can calculate Ben's iPhone's age as follows:

Ben's iPhone = 2 * Suzy's iPhone
Ben's iPhone = 2 * 1
Ben's iPhone = 2 years old

Now, we know Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. So, we can calculate Brandon's iPhone's age as follows:

Brandon's iPhone = 4 * Ben's iPhone
Brandon's iPhone = 4 * 2
Brandon's iPhone = 8 years old

So, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old."
"First, we need to find out how far Polly can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone. We know that without the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet. When holding the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther. So, we calculate:

400 feet * 3 = 1200 feet

The dragon's flames reach 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance Polly can throw the javelin:

1200 feet - 1000 feet = 200 feet

So, the final numerical answer is 200 feet."
"Grandma Jones had 5 pies and each pie was cut into 8 pieces, so she had a total of 5 * 8 = 40 pieces of pie. At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces left. To find out how many pieces the guests took, we subtract the remaining pieces from the total pieces:

40 - 14 = 26

So, the guests took 26 pieces of pie."
"First, let's find out how many calories are in one serving of chips. We know that a 300g bag has 5 servings and has 250 calories per serving. So, the total calories in the bag is:

\[ 5 \text{ servings} \times 250 \text{ calories/serving} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to find out how many calories are left for the day. Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories:

\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Since each serving has 250 calories, we need to find out how many servings you can have with the remaining 200 calories:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories/serving}} = 0.8 \text{ servings} \]

Since each serving is 300g, we can find out how many grams you can eat:

\[ 0.8 \text{ servings} \times 300 \text{ grams/serving} = 240 \text{ grams} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 240 grams."
"First, let's find out how much beeswax Charlie needs to make 20 candles. Since he can make 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles.

The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax is $10.00.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles at $2.00 each.

Total revenue = 20 candles * $2.00/candle = $40.00

The total cost for supplies is $10.00.

Net profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $10.00 = $30.00

So, Charlie's net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles is $30.00."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of articles Meredith wrote on each day:**
   - On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.
   - On Tuesday, she wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. So, she wrote \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles on Tuesday.
   - On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, she wrote \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles on Wednesday.

2. **Calculate the total number of articles written over the three days:**
   - Total articles = Articles on Monday + Articles on Tuesday + Articles on Wednesday
   - Total articles = 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

3. **Calculate the total number of hours spent writing articles:**
   - Each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write about.
   - Total hours = Total articles \(\times\) Hours per article
   - Total hours = 26 \(\times\) 4 = 104 hours.

So, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days is 104 hours."
"Candice started with 80 post-it notes and had 23 left after placing them on the coffee cups. This means she used 80 - 23 = 57 post-it notes for the coffee cups. Since she placed one on each of 220 different cups, she used 220 post-it notes for the coffee cups. Therefore, the package she bought must have contained 220 - 57 = 163 post-it notes."
"First, let's find out how many blue ties John bought. If each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost of one blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, so:

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, each red tie costs:

\[ \text{Cost of one red tie} = \text{Cost of one blue tie} + 0.5 \times \text{Cost of one blue tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60 \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost of one red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

Finally, to find out how much John spent on ties in total, we add the cost of the blue ties and the cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total spent on ties} = \text{Total cost of blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800 \]

So, the total amount John spent on ties is $800."
"First, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches because the pieces are measured in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot.

So, 4 feet of wire is:
4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Now, we need to find out how many 6-inch pieces can be cut from 48 inches of wire.

To do this, we divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:
48 inches / 6 inches/piece = 8 pieces

So, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"First, let's find out the total number of units in the building.

The building has 15 floors, and each floor has 8 units.
So, the total number of units is 15 floors * 8 units/floor = 120 units.

Now, we know that 3/4 of the building is occupied. To find out how many units are occupied, we calculate 3/4 of 120 units:
Occupied units = 3/4 * 120 = 90 units.

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the occupied units from the total units:
Unoccupied units = Total units - Occupied units = 120 - 90 = 30 units.

So, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"First, we need to find out how many dozens of eggs Lloyd gets from his chickens each day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

252 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 21 dozens

Now, we know Lloyd sells 21 dozens of eggs each day. To find out how much he makes each day, we multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen:

21 dozens * $2/dozen = $42 per day

To find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in a week:

$42/day * 7 days/week = $294/week

So, Lloyd makes $294 on eggs per week."
"First, we need to find out how far Tom traveled from 1 to 4 PM. He traveled for 3 hours at a speed of 10 miles per hour. 

To find the distance, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

So, the distance he traveled is:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles} \]

Now, Tom is traveling back at a speed of 6 miles per hour. To find out how long it takes him to travel back 30 miles, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time it takes him to get back is:
\[ \frac{30 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ miles/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:
5"
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes.

He removes 30 comic books, and each comic book weighs 1/4 pound.
So, the total weight of the comic books is:
30 comic books * 1/4 pound/comic book = 7.5 pounds

Now, Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, the remaining weight he needs to remove is:
15 pounds - 7.5 pounds = 7.5 pounds

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove to make up the remaining 7.5 pounds, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:
7.5 pounds / 1/2 pound/toy = 15 toys

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys."
"First, let's calculate the revenue for Thursday:
- For each truck tire, the mechanic charges $60. On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires, so the revenue from truck tires is 6 * $60 = $360.
- For each car tire, the mechanic charges $40. On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 4 car tires, so the revenue from car tires is 4 * $40 = $160.
- Total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

Next, let's calculate the revenue for Friday:
- For each car tire, the mechanic charges $40. On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires, so the revenue from car tires is 12 * $40 = $480.
- Total revenue on Friday is $480.

Now, we compare the revenues:
- Revenue on Thursday is $520.
- Revenue on Friday is $480.

To find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on Thursday, we subtract the Friday revenue from the Thursday revenue:
- $520 - $480 = $40.

So, the mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday than on Friday."
"First, we need to find out how many kittens Patchy had. The problem states that Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens. Since the adopted kittens are 7, we calculate:

\[ \text{Patchy's kittens} = 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Next, we add the number of adopted kittens to the number of Patchy's kittens:

\[ \text{Total from Patchy} = 21 + 7 = 28 \]

Trixie had 12 kittens. So, we add the number of Trixie's kittens to the total from Patchy:

\[ \text{Total kittens} = 28 + 12 = 40 \]

So, the Doubtfire family now has 40 kittens."
"Jean starts with 30 lollipops and eats 2, so she has 30 - 2 = 28 lollipops left. If she packages 2 lollipops in one bag, she can fill 28 ÷ 2 = 14 bags."
"Peter spends $7 on a ticket and $7 on popcorn, so that's $7 + $7 = $14 each time he goes to the movies.

He has $42 for the week. To find out how many times he can go to the movies, we divide the total money he has by the amount he spends each time.

So, $42 ÷ $14 = 3.

Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week."
"First, we need to find out how much weight the boxes can add to the truck without exceeding the bridge's limit. The bridge can carry no more than 5000 pounds. The weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. So, the remaining weight capacity for the boxes is:

5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds

Each box weighs 15 pounds. To find out how many boxes can be loaded without exceeding the weight limit, we divide the remaining weight capacity by the weight of one box:

1245 ÷ 15 = 83

So, the maximum number of boxes which can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83."
"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to add the delivery fee and the tip to the original bill.

The original bill was $40.00.

The delivery fee was $3.00.

The tip was $4.00.

$40.00 + $3.00 + $4.00 = $47.00

So, the final price of Stephen's groceries is $47.00."
"First, we need to find out how many fruits are in the clusters. There are 6 clusters and each cluster has 20 fruits. So, we multiply the number of clusters by the number of fruits in each cluster:

\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \]

Next, we add the 67 individual fruits to the 120 fruits from the clusters:

\[ 120 + 67 = 187 \]

So, the total number of raspberries is 187."
"First, let's find out how many oranges are unripe. If 20% of the oranges are unripe, we can calculate this as follows:

20% of 25 oranges = 0.20 * 25 = 5 oranges

Now, we know there is 1 bad orange and 2 sour oranges. So, let's add these up:

5 (unripe) + 1 (bad) + 2 (sour) = 8 oranges

Since there are 25 oranges in total, we can find out how many are good by subtracting the number of unripe, bad, and sour oranges from the total:

25 (total) - 8 (unripe, bad, sour) = 17 oranges

So, the number of good oranges is 17."
"First, let's add up the cost of the material and the jeweler's work:

Now, let's calculate the cost of insurance, which is 10% of $1300:
10% of $1300 = 0.10 * $1300 = $130

Finally, let's add the cost of the material, the jeweler's work, and the insurance cost to find the total amount Janet paid:
$1300 (material and jeweler) + $130 (insurance) = $1430

So, the final numerical answer is:
$1430"
"First, let's break down the pension calculation:

1. For the first 20 years, Marcy gets $50,000 per year.
2. After 20 years, she starts getting 5% of the value of her pension per year. The value of her pension at that point is $50,000 * 20 years = $1,000,000.
3. So, starting from year 21, her pension becomes $1,000,000 * 5% = $50,000 per year.

Since Marcy quits after 30 years, we need to calculate her pension for the first 20 years and then for the next 10 years (from year 21 to year 30).

For the first 20 years:
- She gets $50,000 per year.
- Total for 20 years = $50,000 * 20 = $1,000,000.

For the next 10 years (from year 21 to year 30):
- She gets $50,000 per year.
- Total for 10 years = $50,000 * 10 = $500,000.

So, her total pension after 30 years is $1,000,000 + $500,000 = $1,500,000.

Now, we need to find out her annual pension after 30 years:
- Her pension after 30 years is $1,500,000.
- She gets 5% of this value per year.
- So, her annual pension after 30 years = $1,500,000 * 5% = $75,000.

The final numerical answer is:
75000"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the monthly cost for the first half of the year:**
   - The monthly cost is $140.
   - There are 6 months in the first half of the year.
   - So, the total cost for the first half of the year is \( 140 \times 6 = 840 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the monthly cost for the second half of the year:**
   - The cost for the second half is 10% less than the monthly cost.
   - 10% of $140 is \( 140 \times 0.10 = 14 \) dollars.
   - So, the cost for the second half is \( 140 - 14 = 126 \) dollars per month.
   - There are also 6 months in the second half of the year.
   - So, the total cost for the second half of the year is \( 126 \times 6 = 756 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total cost for the whole year:**
   - Add the cost of the first half to the cost of the second half.
   - Total cost = \( 840 + 756 = 1596 \) dollars.

So, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is **1596** dollars."
"Sophia has put in 4 gallons of gas to fill her tank again. Her car's tank holds 12 gallons of gas. So, if 4 gallons allow her to drive 100 miles, we can find out how many miles she can drive with 12 gallons by setting up a proportion.

First, we calculate how many miles she can drive per gallon:
\[ \text{Miles per gallon} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

Now, to find out how many miles she can drive with 12 gallons:
\[ \text{Miles with 12 gallons} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how long Jim spends on TV and reading in one session.

He spends 2 hours watching TV.
He reads for half as long as he watches TV, so he reads for 2 / 2 = 1 hour.

So in one session, he spends 2 hours (TV) + 1 hour (reading) = 3 hours.

He does this 3 times a week, so in one week, he spends 3 hours/session * 3 sessions/week = 9 hours.

Now, we need to find out how many hours he spends in 4 weeks.

So, 9 hours/week * 4 weeks = 36 hours.

The final numerical answer is 36 hours."
"Each school has sent:
- 5 players for the girls' team
- 5 players for the boys' team
- 1 coach for the girls' team
- 1 coach for the boys' team

So, each school has sent a total of 5 + 5 + 1 + 1 = 12 people.

Since there are 4 schools, the total number of people sent by all the schools is 4 * 12 = 48.

The final numerical answer is 48."
"First, let's find out how many rubies there are. If there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, and there are 175 diamonds, then:

Rubies = Diamonds - 35
Rubies = 175 - 35
Rubies = 140

Next, we find out how many emeralds there are. If there are twice as many emeralds as rubies, and there are 140 rubies, then:

Emeralds = 2 * Rubies
Emeralds = 2 * 140
Emeralds = 280

Now, to find the total number of gems, we add the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds together:

Total Gems = Diamonds + Rubies + Emeralds
Total Gems = 175 + 140 + 280
Total Gems = 595

So, the total number of gems in the chest is 595."
"If there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls, then the number of boys is:

"First, we need to calculate how much money Tommy makes from selling brownies. He sells each brownie for $3 and he sells 43 brownies, so we multiply 43 by 3.

43 brownies * $3 per brownie = $129

Next, we calculate how much money Tommy makes from selling cheesecakes. He sells each cheesecake for $4 and he sells 23 cheesecakes, so we multiply 23 by 4.

23 cheesecakes * $4 per cheesecake = $92

Now, we add the money from brownies and cheesecakes to find the total amount Tommy raises.

$129 from brownies + $92 from cheesecakes = $221

So, the total amount of money Tommy raises is $221."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the cell phones before interest. Shiela bought five cell phones for $150 each.

Total cost of cell phones = 5 * $150 = $750

Next, we need to calculate the interest. The interest rate is 2% for each unit.

Interest per unit = 2% of $150 = 0.02 * $150 = $3

Since Shiela bought five cell phones, the total interest is:

Total interest = 5 * $3 = $15

Now, we add the total interest to the total cost of the cell phones to get the total amount Shiela will pay.

Total amount to pay = Total cost of cell phones + Total interest = $750 + $15 = $765

Shiela will pay this amount over 3 months, so we divide the total amount by 3 to find out how much she will pay each month.

Amount to pay each month = Total amount to pay / 3 = $765 / 3 = $255

So, Shiela will pay $255 each month for 3 months."

"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4 leveled sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level.

Given:
- The top level (level 4) has a square footage of 16.
- Each level below has half the square footage of the level above it.

Let's calculate the square footage for each level:

- Level 4 (top level): 16 square feet.
- Level 3: Half of Level 4, so 16 / 2 = 8 square feet.
- Level 2: Half of Level 3, so 8 / 2 = 4 square feet.
- Level 1: Half of Level 2, so 4 / 2 = 2 square feet.

Now we have the square footage for each level:
- Level 1: 2 square feet
- Level 2: 4 square feet
- Level 3: 8 square feet
- Level 4: 16 square feet

To find the average square footage, we add up the square footage of all levels and divide by the number of levels:

Total square footage = 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 30 square feet
Number of levels = 4

Average square footage = Total square footage / Number of levels = 30 / 4 = 7.5 square feet

The average square footage of a level is 7.5 square feet."
"First, we need to calculate how much dog food Cecilia will use in the first 180 days. She feeds the puppy 1 cup of dog food every day for these 180 days. So, we multiply 1 cup/day by 180 days:

\[ 1 \, \text{cup/day} \times 180 \, \text{days} = 180 \, \text{cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how much dog food the puppy will need for the rest of its life. Since the question doesn't specify how long the puppy will live, we'll assume the rest of its life is not needed for the first year. So, we only need to calculate the dog food for the first 180 days.

Cecilia uses 180 cups of dog food in the first 180 days. Since one bag contains 110 cups, we need to find out how many bags are needed for 180 cups. We do this by dividing the total cups needed by the number of cups per bag:

\[ \frac{180 \, \text{cups}}{110 \, \text{cups/bag}} = 1.636363636 \, \text{bags} \]

Since Cecilia can't buy a fraction of a bag, we round up to the next whole number. Therefore, she will need 2 bags of dog food for the first year.

The final numerical answer is:
2"
"First, let's find out how much laundry Sarah does. According to the question, Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.

Next, we need to find out how much laundry David does. The question states that Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. So, to find out how much David does, we divide the amount Sarah does by 4.

\[ \text{David's laundry} = \frac{\text{Sarah's laundry}}{4} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we know that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. So, to find out how much Raymond does, we divide the amount Sarah does by 2.

\[ \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{\text{Sarah's laundry}}{2} = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we subtract the amount David does from the amount Raymond does.

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Raymond's laundry} - \text{David's laundry} = 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 100 pounds."
"First, let's find out how much it costs to buy 18 flowers in each package.

For packages of 3 flowers:
- Vincent needs 18 flowers / 3 flowers per package = 6 packages.
- Each package costs $2.50, so 6 packages cost 6 * $2.50 = $15.

For packages of 2 flowers:
- Vincent needs 18 flowers / 2 flowers per package = 9 packages.
- Each package costs $1, so 9 packages cost 9 * $1 = $9.

Now, we see that buying in packages of 2 flowers is cheaper. To find out how much money Vincent saves, we subtract the cheaper price from the more expensive price:
- $15 (cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3) - $9 (cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2) = $6.

So, Vincent saves $6 by buying 18 flowers at the better price."
"The groomer originally charges $100 for grooming. With a 30% discount, the discount amount is calculated as follows:

100 * 30% = 100 * 0.30 = 30

So, the discount is $30. To find out how much John has to pay after the discount, we subtract the discount from the original price:

100 - 30 = 70

Therefore, the cost of grooming after the discount is $70."
"First, we need to find out how much water each girl got. Since each girl got 1/6 of the 24 liters, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters} \]

So, each girl got 4 liters of water. Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they got together is:

\[ 4 \text{ liters} + 4 \text{ liters} = 8 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we add the 6 liters of water that the boy got:

\[ 8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters} \]

The total amount of water initially was 24 liters. So, the amount of water left is:

\[ 24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters} \]

The final numerical answer is:

10"
"Charlie started with 10 stickers.
He bought 21 stickers, so he had 10 + 21 = 31 stickers.
He got 23 stickers for his birthday, so he had 31 + 23 = 54 stickers.
He gave 9 stickers to his sister, so he had 54 - 9 = 45 stickers.
He used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, so he had 45 - 28 = 17 stickers left.
The final numerical answer is 17."
"First, we need to find out how much Alex weighs. Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. Grace weighs 125 pounds.

To find out how much Alex weighs, we calculate:
\[ 4 \times 125 = 500 \]
Then we subtract 2 pounds from 500 pounds:
\[ 500 - 2 = 498 \]
So, Alex weighs 498 pounds.

Now, to find their combined weights, we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight together:
\[ 125 + 498 = 623 \]

The combined weight of Grace and Alex is 623 pounds."
"First, we need to find out how many roses there are in total. Dan has 3 rose bushes and each bush has 25 roses. So, we multiply the number of bushes by the number of roses per bush:

3 bushes * 25 roses/bush = 75 roses

Now, we know that each rose has 8 thorns. To find the total number of thorns, we multiply the total number of roses by the number of thorns per rose:

75 roses * 8 thorns/rose = 600 thorns

So, the total number of thorns is 600."
"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Let's say the number of games they lost is L.
2. According to the problem, they won 8 more games than they lost, so the number of games they won is L + 8.
3. The total number of games played is the sum of the games they won and the games they lost, which is L + (L + 8) = 22.
4. Simplifying the equation, we get 2L + 8 = 22.
5. Subtract 8 from both sides: 2L = 14.
6. Divide both sides by 2: L = 7.
7. So, they lost 7 games.
8. To find out how many they won, we add 8 to the number of games they lost: 7 + 8 = 15.

The number of games they won is 15."
"Gene is 34 years old now and he started vacationing when he was 23. So, he has been vacationing for 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Since he gets one shirt from each vacation and each shirt is a quilt block, he has 11 quilt blocks from his first 11 vacations.

Since he makes a row with blocks from a different year of vacations, and he has been vacationing for 11 years, he can make 11 rows.

Therefore, the total number of quilt blocks he has is 11 rows * 1 quilt block per row = 11 quilt blocks.

So, the final numerical answer is 11."
"The first time the alarm rang, it rang 4 times.
The second time it rang, it rang for three times as long as the first time, so it rang 4 * 3 = 12 times.
The third time it rang, it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we add up all the times it rang each time:
4 (first time) + 12 (second time) + 6 (third time) = 22 times.

So, the final numerical answer is 22."
"First, let's find out Sylvie's salary after the first year of the 10% increase. Her initial salary is $600.

10% of $600 is calculated as:
\[ 600 \times \frac{10}{100} = 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \]

So, her salary after the first year will be:
\[ 600 + 60 = 660 \]

After the second year, her salary will increase by another 10% of $660:
\[ 660 \times \frac{10}{100} = 660 \times 0.10 = 66 \]

So, her salary after the second year will be:
\[ 660 + 66 = 726 \]

After the third year, her salary will increase by another 10% of $726:
\[ 726 \times \frac{10}{100} = 726 \times 0.10 = 72.6 \]

So, her salary after the third year will be:
\[ 726 + 72.6 = 798.6 \]

Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service will be $798.60."
"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Let's say Harald sold \( H \) copies.
2. Marilyn sold 10 times as many copies as Harald, so Marilyn sold \( 10H \) copies.
3. Together, they sold 88,000 copies, so we can write the equation: \( H + 10H = 88,000 \).
4. Simplifying the left side, we get \( 11H = 88,000 \).
5. To find \( H \), we divide both sides by 11: \( H = \frac{88,000}{11} \).
6. Calculating this, we get \( H = 8,000 \).

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

The final numerical answer is 8,000."
"First, we need to find out how many friends actually come to the party. If 1/4 of the friends don't show up, then 3/4 of the friends do come.

Christina invited 16 friends, so:
\[ \text{Friends who come} = 16 \times \frac{3}{4} = 12 \]

Christina needs .75 gift bags per invited guest, so:
\[ \text{Gift bags needed} = 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \]

Each gift bag costs $2, so:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

Christina will spend $18 on gift bags."
"First, we need to find out how much potato salad the adults will eat. Since each adult eats 10 lbs and there are 20 adults, we multiply 10 by 20:
10 * 20 = 200 lbs

Next, we need to find out how much potato salad the children will eat. Since each child eats half as much as an adult, each child eats 10 / 2 = 5 lbs. With 5 children, we multiply 5 by 5:
5 * 5 = 25 lbs

Now, we add the potato salad needed for adults and children:
200 + 25 = 225 lbs

So, Ted needs to bring 225 lbs of potato salad to the picnic."
"Cindy has 4 pets.
Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.

The final numerical answer is 28."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. James is 10 years old.
2. Corey is 1 year older than James, so Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.
3. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.
4. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

"If Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, and he used to be two seconds faster than Gerald, then Gerald used to run it in 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

With his improved diet, Gerald's speed improved by 10%. To find out how fast Gerald can now run, we need to calculate 10% of 40 seconds and then subtract it from 40 seconds.

10% of 40 seconds is 0.10 * 40 = 4 seconds.

So, Gerald's new time would be 40 seconds - 4 seconds = 36 seconds.

The final numerical answer is:
36"
"First, let's find out how many cats there are. If there are two cats for every dog and there are 60 dogs, then there are 60 * 2 = 120 cats.

Now, we know the number of dogs is 60 and the number of cats is 120. So, the total number of dogs and cats is 60 + 120 = 180.

The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. So, the number of rabbits is 180 - 12 = 168.

To find the total number of pets, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits together: 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) + 168 (rabbits) = 348.

So, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348."
"First, let's find out how many boys and girls there are in Grade 5.

There are 200 students in total.

2/5 of the students are boys, so:
Boys = 2/5 * 200 = 80 boys

The rest are girls, so:
Girls = 200 - 80 = 120 girls

2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout, so:
Girls in girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 80 girls

To find out how many girls are not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
Girls not in girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40 girls

So, the final numerical answer is 40."
"James slept 2/3 of what Harry slept, so we first need to find out how many hours that is. 

To find 2/3 of Harry's sleep, we calculate:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Harry slept 9 hours, and James slept 6 hours. To find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we subtract the hours James slept from the hours Harry slept:
\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"First, we need to find out how many ounces of tomatoes Freda started with. Since her sauce made 32 ounces and the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked, the original tomatoes must have been 32 * 2 = 64 ounces.

Each 16 ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes. To find out how many 16 ounce cans she used, we divide the total ounces of tomatoes by the ounces in a can: 64 / 16 = 4 cans.

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes used is 4 * 3 = 12 tomatoes.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We start with 30 cars on the motorway.
2. 5 cars take an exit, so we subtract 5 from 30. That leaves us with 30 - 5 = 25 cars.
3. In the first 15 minutes, 20 more cars drive through the traffic jam.
4. We need to find out how many cars drove through in the first 15 minutes. We know that 20 cars drove through in the first 15 minutes, and we also know that 25 cars were left after the 5 cars took an exit.

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 20.

The final numerical answer is:

"Mary already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so she has:
2 potted plants/ledge * 40 ledges = 80 potted plants.

She decides to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family, so she will give away:
1 potted plant/ledge * 40 ledges = 40 potted plants.

Subtracting the plants she gives away from the plants she already has:
80 potted plants - 40 potted plants = 40 potted plants.

So, Mary will remain with 40 potted plants."
"First, let's find out how many times the second friend pressed the doorbell. The second friend pressed it 1/4 times more than the first friend. The first friend pressed it 20 times.

To find 1/4 of 20:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \]

So, the second friend pressed it 5 more times than the first friend:
\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \]

Next, we know the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times. The third friend pressed 10 times more than the fourth friend:
\[ 60 + 10 = 70 \]

Now, we add up all the doorbell rings:
\[ 20 \text{ (first friend)} + 25 \text{ (second friend)} + 70 \text{ (third friend)} + 60 \text{ (fourth friend)} \]

Adding these together:
\[ 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175 \]

So, the total number of doorbell rings is:

40 pages - 15 pages = 25 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read, on average, in one day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days left:
25 pages ÷ 4 days = 6.25 pages per day

The final numerical answer is 6.25."
"Let's break this down step by step:

- John drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day.
- He drinks one glass of water before bed every day.
- He drinks a soda with dinner on weekends.

First, let's calculate how many glasses of water John drinks on a weekday:
- Breakfast: 1 glass
- Lunch: 1 glass
- Dinner: 1 glass
- Bedtime: 1 glass

So, on a weekday, he drinks 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 glasses of water.

Since there are 5 weekdays in a week, he drinks 4 glasses of water each day for 5 days:
4 glasses/day * 5 days = 20 glasses of water for weekdays.

Now, let's calculate for the weekend:
- He drinks 1 glass of water before bed each day.
- There are 2 days in the weekend.

So, on the weekend, he drinks 1 + 1 = 2 glasses of water.

Now, let's add the glasses of water for the weekdays and the weekend:
20 glasses (weekdays) + 2 glasses (weekend) = 22 glasses of water.

So, the final number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is 22."
"To solve this, we need to find out how many 3-mile sections are in the 42-mile city.

First, we divide the total length of the city by the length of each section covered in 10 minutes:
\[ \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/section}} = 14 \text{ sections} \]

Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each 3-mile section, we multiply the number of sections by the time it takes to cover one section:
\[ 14 \text{ sections} \times 10 \text{ minutes/section} = 140 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the fog bank will take 140 minutes to cover the whole city."
"First, let's find out how many pieces Poppy placed on the board. Since she placed a quarter of the 1000 pieces, we calculate:

1000 / 4 = 250 pieces

So, 250 pieces are placed by Poppy. Now, let's find out how many pieces are left after Poppy placed hers:

1000 - 250 = 750 pieces

Next, Poppy's mom places a third of the remaining 750 pieces. So, we calculate:

750 / 3 = 250 pieces

Now, we subtract the 250 pieces placed by her mom from the 750 pieces that were left:

750 - 250 = 500 pieces

So, the number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed is 500."
"If Amir eats 5 cookies, and Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir, then Cody eats:

"First, let's find the inner volume of one box. The box has walls that are 1 inch thick, so we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side) to get the inner dimensions.

The original dimensions of the box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. So, the inner dimensions are:
- Length: 5 - 2 = 3 inches
- Width: 6 - 2 = 4 inches
- Height: 4 - 1 = 3 inches (we subtract 1 inch for the thickness of the top and bottom walls)

Now, we calculate the inner volume of one box:
\[ \text{Inner volume of one box} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} = 3 \times 4 \times 3 = 36 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3 to get the total inner volume:
\[ \text{Total inner volume} = 36 \times 3 = 108 \text{ cubic inches} \]

So, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 108 cubic inches."
"Let's break it down:

- On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1 hour each night, so that's 1 + 1 = 2 hours.
- On Thursday, he watched 1 hour and 30 minutes, so that's 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 hours.
- On Friday, he watched 2 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours he watched from Monday to Friday:
2 (Monday and Tuesday) + 1.5 (Thursday) + 2 (Friday) = 5.5 hours.

He watched a total of 7 hours of TV. So, the hours he watched on Wednesday is:
7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode is 30 minutes (which is 0.5 hours), we divide the hours he watched on Wednesday by 0.5 to find out how many episodes he watched:
1.5 / 0.5 = 3 episodes.

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday."
"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Henry meant to make twice as many cookies as he did last year. Let's say he made \(x\) cookies last year.
2. So, he wanted to make \(2x\) cookies this year.
3. He actually made 15 more than he meant to, so he made \(2x + 15\) cookies.
4. He dropped 5 cookies, so he has \(2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10\) cookies left.
5. We know he has 110 cookies now, so \(2x + 10 = 110\).

Now, let's solve for \(x\):

\[
2x + 10 = 110
\]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[
2x = 100
\]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[
x = 50
\]

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year."
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas without any cashback. The gas station sells gas for $3.00 a gallon.

So, the cost for 10 gallons is:
\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.00 \text{ per gallon} = \$30.00 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total cashback. The cashback is $.20 per gallon.

So, the total cashback for 10 gallons is:
\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.20 \text{ per gallon} = \$2.00 \]

Now, we subtract the total cashback from the total cost of the gas to find the final amount after cashback:
\[ \$30.00 - \$2.00 = \$28.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$28.00 \]"
"First, we need to calculate how many fruit roll-ups Beatrice ate. She had a roll-up that was 2 wide and 24 long. To find out how many she ate, we multiply the width by the length:
2 * 24 = 48

Next, we calculate how many fruit roll-ups Marcell ate. He had a roll-up that was 3 wide and 14 long. To find out how many he ate, we multiply the width by the length:
3 * 14 = 42

Now, we add the number of roll-ups they both ate:
48 + 42 = 90

To find the average, we divide the total number of roll-ups by the number of people, which is 2:
90 / 2 = 45

So, the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate is 45."
"First, we need to find out how many seconds it took Julia to row 10 feet. Since it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, it would take her 8 seconds to row 10 feet.

Now, we know the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet Julia rows. So, for every second she rows, the boat takes on 2 liters / 10 feet = 0.2 liters per second.

Julia's total rowing time to the shore is 64 seconds. So, the total amount of water the boat took on is 0.2 liters/second * 64 seconds = 12.8 liters.

So, the boat had taken on 12.8 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore."
"Each teacher uses the whiteboard 2 times a day because they have 2 lessons. Since there are 4 teachers, the total number of times the whiteboard is used in a day is 4 teachers times 2 times a day, which equals 8 times a day. Since the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times during each lesson, the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day is 8 times a day times 3 times a lesson, which equals 24 times a day.

The final numerical answer is:

"Ryan plants 2 flowers a day for 15 days, so he plants a total of 2 * 15 = 30 flowers. If 5 of these did not grow, then the number of flowers he has is 30 - 5 = 25 flowers."
"First, let's find out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold. Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's, we can divide the number of photographs Jamal's phone can hold by 6.

Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
So, Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs.

Now, we know that Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photographs than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. To find out how many birds are in Jamal's photograph, we divide the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold by 50.

Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs.
So, the number of birds in Jamal's photograph is 300 / 50 = 6 birds.

Therefore, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is 6.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the leftover lumber Sasha has.

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 10 boards.
- Each board cost her $10.
- So, the total cost for these boards is 10 boards * $10/board = $100.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 5 boards.
- Each board cost her $16.
- So, the total cost for these boards is 5 boards * $16/board = $80.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the leftover lumber:
- Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180.

Since Sasha is selling all the leftover lumber, the total selling price will be the same as the total cost, which is $180.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total selling price:
- Profit = Total selling price - Total cost = $180 - $180 = $0.

So, Sasha makes a profit of $0."
"First, we need to understand the ratio given, which is 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total number of parts is 7 + 13 = 20 parts.

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water. To find out how many teaspoons of sugar she used, we need to divide the total parts into the sugar part of the ratio.

The number of teaspoons of sugar used is calculated by:
\[ \text{Number of teaspoons of sugar} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 120 \]

Now, let's do the calculation:
\[ \text{Number of teaspoons of sugar} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 120 = 7 \times 6 = 42 \]

So, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used is 42."

"First, let's find out how many vehicles were in the containers on the first day. There were 2 containers, and each container had 5 vehicles.

So, the number of vehicles on the first day is:
2 containers * 5 vehicles/container = 10 vehicles

On the second day, the total number of vehicles became 30. To find out how many vehicles were added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles on the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day.

Number of vehicles added on the second day = 30 vehicles - 10 vehicles = 20 vehicles

Since each container has 5 vehicles, we can find out how many containers were added on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles added by the number of vehicles per container.

Number of containers added on the second day = 20 vehicles / 5 vehicles/container = 4 containers

So, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is 4."
"First, let's find out Lylah's salary four years ago. If Adrien's salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Adrien's salary} = \text{Lylah's salary} \times 1.30 \]

Given that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000, we can find Lylah's salary four years ago by dividing Adrien's salary by 1.30:

\[ \text{Lylah's salary four years ago} = \frac{\$40000}{1.30} \]

Let's calculate Lylah's salary four years ago:

\[ \text{Lylah's salary four years ago} = \frac{\$40000}{1.30} = \$30769.23 \]

Now, let's find out Adrien's salary four years later. We know that his salary increased by 40% from what it was four years ago:

\[ \text{Adrien's salary four years later} = \text{Adrien's salary four years ago} \times 1.40 \]

\[ \text{Adrien's salary four years later} = \$40000 \times 1.40 = \$56000 \]

Since Adrien and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously, Lylah's salary four years later would also be 40% higher than what it was four years ago:

\[ \text{Lylah's salary four years later} = \text{Lylah's salary four years ago} \times 1.40 \]

\[ \text{Lylah's salary four years later} = \$30769.23 \times 1.40 = \$43076.92 \]

Finally, to find the total salary the two were receiving four years later, we add Adrien's and Lylah's salaries together:

\[ \text{Total salary four years later} = \text{Adrien's salary four years later} + \text{Lylah's salary four years later} \]

\[ \text{Total salary four years later} = \$56000 + \$43076.92 = \$99076.92 \]

So, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is \$99076.92."
"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, find out how many sheets of paper he uses in a week. Since he uses 2 pads of paper a week and each pad has 30 sheets, we multiply 2 by 30.
   - 2 pads/week * 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets/week

2. Next, we need to find out how many sheets he uses in a month. There are usually about 4 weeks in a month, so we multiply the number of sheets he uses in a week by 4.
   - 60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month

So, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month."
"Morisette brought 5 apples + 8 oranges = 13 fruits.
Kael brought 2 * 5 apples = 10 apples and 8 oranges / 2 = 4 oranges.
So, Kael brought 10 apples + 4 oranges = 14 fruits.
Together, they brought 13 fruits + 14 fruits = 27 fruits.
The final answer is 27 fruits."
"To solve this, let's break it down day by day:

- Monday: Sadie slept 8 hours.
- Tuesday: She slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours.
- Wednesday: She also slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours.
- Thursday and Friday: She slept 1 hour more than Tuesday and Wednesday, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day.

Now, let's add up the hours for the week:
- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday: 6 hours
- Wednesday: 6 hours
- Thursday: 7 hours
- Friday: 7 hours

Total hours = 8 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 7 = 34 hours

So, the total number of hours Sadie slept in the week is 34 hours."
"First, let's calculate how many miles Rosie can run at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours.

10 miles per hour * 3 hours = 30 miles

Now, we need to find out how many miles she can run at 5 miles per hour for the remaining time.

She has 7 hours in total and she has already used 3 hours, so she has 7 - 3 = 4 hours left.

Now, let's calculate how many miles she can run in the remaining 4 hours at 5 miles per hour.

5 miles per hour * 4 hours = 20 miles

Now, let's add the miles she ran at 10 miles per hour to the miles she ran at 5 miles per hour.

30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles

So, Rosie can run 50 miles in 7 hours."
"Jennie puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, so she stamps 60 letters / 3 = 20 letters.

This means she still has 60 letters - 20 letters = 40 letters needing stamps.

Since there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters, and she has already stamped 20 letters, the number of letters in the pile when Jennie began was 20 letters + 30 letters = 50 letters.

So, the final answer is 50."
"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Julia's husband gave her 5 new spoons.
2. Julia used 3 spoons to taste her stew.
3. After using 3 spoons, she had 12 spoons left.

To find out how many spoons Julia originally bought, we need to add the spoons her husband gave her to the spoons she had left after tasting her stew.

So, if she had 12 spoons left after using 3, that means before using the 3 spoons, she had 12 + 3 = 15 spoons.

Since her husband gave her 5 spoons, we add those to the 15 spoons she had before tasting her stew.

So, 15 + 5 = 20 spoons.

Therefore, Julia bought a package with 20 spoons."
"Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages.
He bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, so he bought 38 + 6 = 44 fish sausages.
In total, Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages + 44 fish sausages = 82 sausages.
The final numerical answer is 82."
"Lily made 50 friends.
Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, so Amy made 50 + 20 = 70 friends.
Together, Lily and Amy have 50 + 70 = 120 friends."
"First, let's find out how much each watermelon costs. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, and each pepper costs 15$, then each watermelon costs 15 * 3 = 45$.

Next, we find out how much each orange costs. Since an orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs, and a watermelon costs 45$, then each orange costs 45 - 5 = 40$.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the items Dillon is buying.

For the watermelons: 4 watermelons * 45$ each = 180$
For the peppers: 20 peppers * 15$ each = 300$
For the oranges: 10 oranges * 40$ each = 400$

Adding these up: 180$ + 300$ + 400$ = 880$

So, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is 880$."
"First, let's find out how many hours the hospital sees patients in a day. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide the total minutes by 60.

500 people * 24 minutes = 12000 minutes

12000 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 200 hours

Now, let's calculate the cost the hospital incurs for these 200 hours. The doctors charge $150 an hour.

200 hours * $150 per hour = $30000

Next, let's calculate the revenue the hospital gets from these 200 hours. The hospital charges $200 an hour.

200 hours * $200 per hour = $40000

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue.

$40000 - $30000 = $10000

So, the hospital makes a profit of $10000 from these visits."
"First, we need to find out how many elves quit after children vomit on them. Since a third of the elves quit, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \]

So, 20 elves quit after children vomit on them. Now we subtract these 20 elves from the total number of elves:

\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \]

Next, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. We subtract these 10 elves from the remaining 40 elves:

\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \]

So, the number of elves left is 30."
"In June, Joseph's expenditure was $500 - $60 = $440.

So, his total expenditure for May and June was $500 + $440 = $940."
"Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and Fred rode it 4 times, so together they rode it 2 + 4 = 6 times. Each ride costs 6 tickets, so for the roller coaster, they used 6 rides * 6 tickets/ride = 36 tickets.

They also rode the luge 2 times each, so together they rode the luge 2 + 2 = 4 times. For the luge, they used 4 rides * 6 tickets/ride = 24 tickets.

In total, they used 36 tickets for the roller coaster + 24 tickets for the luge = 60 tickets.

The final numerical answer is 60."
"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, let's break down the information given:

- On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.
- On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he did on Monday, which is \(6 \times 4 = 24\) miles.
- The total mileage from Monday through Wednesday is 41 miles.

To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we can subtract the miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage.

So, the calculation is:
\[ \text{Miles on Wednesday} = \text{Total mileage} - (\text{Miles on Monday} + \text{Miles on Tuesday}) \]
\[ \text{Miles on Wednesday} = 41 - (4 + 24) \]
\[ \text{Miles on Wednesday} = 41 - 28 \]
\[ \text{Miles on Wednesday} = 13 \]

So, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday."
"To find out how much Tom pays in a year for car washes, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, find out how many car washes Tom gets in a year. Since he gets 4 car washes a month, we multiply 4 by 12 (months in a year):
   \[
   4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ car washes in a year}
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how much 48 car washes cost if each one costs $15. We do this by multiplying the number of car washes by the cost of each one:
   \[
   48 \times 15 = 720
   \]

So, Tom pays $720 in a year for car washes."
"First, let's find out how many video games Brian has after losing 5.

Brian originally has 20 video games, but he lost 5, so:
20 - 5 = 15 video games

Now, we know that Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian has now.

So, we calculate 3 times the number of games Brian has now:
3 * 15 = 45

Then, we subtract 5 from this number to find out how many games Bobby has:
45 - 5 = 40

Therefore, Bobby has 40 video games."
"First, we need to find out how many unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands. Since one third of the unicorns are there, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of Scottish unicorns} = \frac{1}{3} \times 27 = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these Scottish unicorns are female. Since two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of female Scottish unicorns} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

6"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the subs:
2 subs at $7.50 each is 2 * $7.50 = $15.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of the chips:
2 bags of chips at $1.50 each is 2 * $1.50 = $3.00

Then, let's calculate the cost of the cookies:
2 cookies at $1.00 each is 2 * $1.00 = $2.00

Now, let's add up the cost of the subs, chips, and cookies:
$15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

The delivery fee is 20% of the total cost before the fee:
20% of $20.00 is 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00

Now, let's add the delivery fee to the total cost:
$20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Finally, let's add the tip:
$24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

So, the total cost of Rory's delivery order is $29.00."
"First, let's find out how many questions Mark could complete in the time he had for each test.

For the first test:
- He had 8 hours.
- He completes 5 questions per hour.
- So, in 8 hours, he could complete \(8 \times 5 = 40\) questions.

For the second test:
- He had 6 hours.
- He completes 5 questions per hour.
- So, in 6 hours, he could complete \(6 \times 5 = 30\) questions.

Now, let's see how many questions he left incomplete for each test.

For the first test:
- The test had 75 questions.
- He completed 40 questions.
- So, he left \(75 - 40 = 35\) questions incomplete.

For the second test:
- The test had 100 questions.
- He completed 30 questions.
- So, he left \(100 - 30 = 70\) questions incomplete.

Now, let's add the incomplete questions from both tests:
- From the first test: 35 questions
- From the second test: 70 questions
- Total incomplete questions: \(35 + 70 = 105\)

So, the total number of questions Mark left incomplete is 105."
"First, let's find out how many blue gumballs there are. We are told there are 12 blue gumballs.

Now, we need to find out how many pink gumballs there are. The problem states that there are 22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs as there are blue gumballs.

So, we calculate four times the number of blue gumballs:
4 * 12 = 48

Then, we add 22 to this number to find the number of pink gumballs:
48 + 22 = 70

Therefore, there are 70 pink gumballs."
"First, we need to find out how many semi-automatic cars there are. We know there are 20 cars in total. Out of these, 12 are automatic and 4 are manual. So, we subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars:

20 - 12 - 4 = 4

So, there are 4 semi-automatic cars.

To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of semi-automatic cars is 20%."
"First, let's figure out how many baby bees there are. If there are twice as many baby bees as queens, and we don't know the number of queens yet, let's call the number of queens Q. So, the number of baby bees is 2Q.

Next, we know there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees. If the number of baby bees is 2Q, then the number of worker bees is 2 * 2Q = 4Q.

We know the total number of bees is 700. So, the sum of the number of queens, baby bees, and worker bees is 700. This can be written as:
Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700

Combining like terms, we get:
7Q = 700

To find Q, we divide both sides by 7:
Q = 700 / 7
Q = 100

Now that we know there are 100 queens, we can find the number of baby bees and worker bees:
Number of baby bees = 2Q = 2 * 100 = 200
Number of worker bees = 4Q = 4 * 100 = 400

So, the number of worker bees is 400."
"Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day. In one week, which has 7 days, he would play video games for 2 hours/day * 7 days/week = 14 hours/week.

So, the final numerical answer is $140."
"First, let's add up the cost of all the items before tax:
- Milk: 2 dollars
- Eggs: 3 dollars
- Light bulbs: 3 dollars
- Cups: 3 dollars
- Roach traps: 4 dollars

Total cost before tax = 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 15 dollars

Now, let's calculate the tax. The tax is 10% on nonfood items. Since all the items are nonfood items, we calculate the tax as follows:
- Tax on milk: 2 * 10% = 0.20 dollars
- Tax on eggs: 3 * 10% = 0.30 dollars
- Tax on light bulbs: 3 * 10% = 0.30 dollars
- Tax on cups: 3 * 10% = 0.30 dollars
- Tax on roach traps: 4 * 10% = 0.40 dollars

Total tax = 0.20 + 0.30 + 0.30 + 0.30 + 0.40 = 1.50 dollars

Now, let's add the tax to the total cost before tax to get the final cost:
- Final cost = Total cost before tax + Total tax = 15 + 1.50 = 16.50 dollars

So, the final numerical answer is 16.50 dollars."
"First, let's calculate the total number of clients Kim will have:
- He already has 3 clients.
- He is talking to 5 potential clients.
So, the total number of clients is 3 + 5 = 8 clients.

Each client needs:
- 2 bottles of bleach.
- 1 pack of cloths.

The cost of bleach per bottle is $2, and the cost of a pack of cloths is $5.

So, the cost for one client is:
- 2 bottles of bleach at $2 each = 2 * $2 = $4.
- 1 pack of cloths at $5 each = $5.

Therefore, the total cost for one client is $4 + $5 = $9.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for all 8 clients:
- Total cost for 8 clients = 8 * $9 = $72.

Kim's total income each week is $92.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total income:
- Profit = Total income - Total cost = $92 - $72 = $20.

So, the profit Lucas will make each week is $20."
"First, we need to find out how many pineapples John gets from one hectare in a year. Since he can harvest every 3 months and there are 12 months in a year, he can harvest 12 / 3 = 4 times in a year.

Now, if there are 100 pineapples per hectare, then in a year he can get 100 * 4 = 400 pineapples from one hectare.

John has 10 hectares, so in a year he can get 400 * 10 = 4000 pineapples.

The final numerical answer is 4000."
"First, let's find out how many pieces are in the second lego set. It has 3 times more pieces than the 500 piece one, so:
3 * 500 = 1500 pieces

Now, let's find out how many pieces are in the third lego set. It has 1/4 the number of pieces as the first one, so:
1/4 * 500 = 125 pieces

Now, let's add up all the pieces:
500 (from the first set) + 1500 (from the second set) + 125 (from the third set) = 2125 pieces

So, Johnny picks up 2125 blocks."
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours.
2. Half as many bees as left return in the next 6 hours. So, 30 / 2 = 15 bees return.
3. Twice as many bees as left leave in the next 6 hours. So, 30 * 2 = 60 bees leave.

Now, let's calculate the total number of bees that left the hive:
30 bees left in the first 6 hours.
60 bees left in the next 6 hours.
So, 30 + 60 = 90 bees left the hive in total.

Next, let's calculate the total number of bees that returned to the hive:
15 bees returned in the next 6 hours.
So, 15 bees returned in total.

Now, we need to find out how many bees returned in the last 6 hours. According to the information, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the next 6 hours. Since 90 bees left and 15 bees returned, the number of bees that returned in the last 6 hours is the total number of bees that left minus the number of bees that already returned:
90 (total bees that left) - 15 (bees that already returned) = 75 bees.

So, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours is 75."
"The cost of 1 adult ticket is $12 and the cost of 1 child ticket is $10. So, the total cost for 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket is $12 + $10 = $22. If Brittany's mom received $8 in change, it means she gave the cashier $22 + $8 = $30.

"First, we need to find out how many friends Dorothy has. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy and Charlie has 12 friends, we can find Dorothy's friends by dividing Charlie's friends by 3.

So, Dorothy has \( \frac{12}{3} = 4 \) friends.

Now, since James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, we can find James' friends by multiplying Dorothy's friends by 4.

So, James has \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) friends.

The final numerical answer is 16."
"First, we need to convert miles to feet because the speeds are given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance in feet:
3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet

Tim's distance in feet:
2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now we calculate the time it takes for each to get home.

Time for Steve:
15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes

Time for Tim:
10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

The winner is Steve, who takes 36 minutes to get home. The loser is Tim, who takes 40 minutes to get home. The difference in their times is:

40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

So, the winner will be waiting at their house 4 minutes before the loser finishes the race."
"First, let's calculate the cost for each type of vehicle:

For bicycles, each bicycle has 2 tires. If 5 people came to get their bicycles inflated, the cost for bicycles is:
5 bicycles * 2 tires/bicycle * $0.25/tire = $2.50

For tricycles, each tricycle has 3 tires. If 3 people came to get their tricycles inflated, the cost for tricycles is:
3 tricycles * 3 tires/tricycle * $0.25/tire = $2.25

For a unicycle, it has 1 tire. If 1 person came to get their unicycle inflated, the cost for the unicycle is:
1 unicycle * 1 tire/unicycle * $0.25/tire = $0.25

Now, let's add up all the costs:
$2.50 (bicycles) + $2.25 (tricycles) + $0.25 (unicycle) = $5.00

So, Shawnda made $5.00 that day."
"First, let's find out how many cookies Carl has in total. He buys ten packs, and each pack has six cookies.

So, the total number of cookies is:
10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies

Next, we need to find out the total cost of these cookies. Each cookie costs $0.10.

So, the total cost is:
60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6.00

Carl pays with a $10 bill. To find out how much change he receives, we subtract the total cost from the amount he paid:

$10.00 - $6.00 = $4.00

So, the final numerical answer is:
4"
"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, so the seagull ate 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so the pigeons ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries.
4. After the pigeons, the number of fries left is 14 (Dave) + 7 (seagull) + 9 (pigeons) = 30 fries.
5. The raccoon ate two thirds of the remaining fries, so the raccoon ate 2/3 * 30 = 20 fries.
6. After the raccoon, the number of fries left is 30 - 20 = 10 fries.
7. Ants carried off a final french fry, leaving 10 - 1 = 9 fries.

So, the pack had 30 fries before the pigeons ate, and 30 fries before the raccoon ate. Therefore, the pack had 30 + 20 = 50 fries when Dave bought it.

The final numerical answer is 50."
"To solve this, let's break it down day by day and then add them up.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes each day. Each class is 1 hour long.
So, for each of these days, he spends 3 hours in class.
Since there are 3 such days in a week, he spends 3 hours/day * 3 days = 9 hours in class each week on these days.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes each day. Each class is 2 hours long.
So, for each of these days, he spends 2 hours/day * 2 classes = 4 hours in class.
Since there are 2 such days in a week, he spends 4 hours/day * 2 days = 8 hours in class each week on these days.

Now, let's add the hours from both types of days:
9 hours (Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays) + 8 hours (Tuesdays and Thursdays) = 17 hours per week.

Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, we multiply the weekly hours by the number of weeks:
17 hours/week * 16 weeks = 272 hours.

So, in one semester, Kimo spends 272 hours attending classes."
"First, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good in inches.

For the rolls:
300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches

For the chocolate croissants:
120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches

For the baguettes:
60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = 120 feet
Since we need the length in inches, we convert 120 feet to inches:
120 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1440 inches

Now, let's add up all the lengths in inches:
1200 inches (rolls) + 720 inches (croissants) + 1440 inches (baguettes) = 3360 inches

To find the total length in feet, we divide the total inches by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
3360 inches / 12 inches/foot = 280 feet

So, the total length of all the baked goods put end to end is 280 feet."
"First, let's calculate the total number of bananas needed by all the apes in one month:

- Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
- Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
- Baboons need 100 bananas per month.

So, the total number of bananas needed per month is:
200 (monkeys) + 400 (gorillas) + 100 (baboons) = 700 bananas per month.

Since the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months, we need to find out how many bananas are needed for 2 months:

700 bananas per month * 2 months = 1400 bananas.

So, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"First, let's calculate how far Blake runs. Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. So, for each round trip, he runs 100 yards to the end and 100 yards back, which is 200 yards. Since he does this 15 times, the total distance Blake runs is:
\[ 200 \text{ yards/round trip} \times 15 \text{ round trips} = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate how far Kelly runs. Kelly runs back and forth once to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards for each round trip. She does this 34 times, so the total distance Kelly runs is:
\[ 80 \text{ yards/round trip} \times 34 \text{ round trips} = 2720 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we need to find out how much farther Blake runs than Kelly. We subtract the total distance Kelly runs from the total distance Blake runs:
\[ 3000 \text{ yards} - 2720 \text{ yards} = 280 \text{ yards} \]

So, the winner runs 280 yards farther than the loser."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the pens:
- Raphael bought 4 pens.
- Each pen costs $1.5.

So, the total cost for the pens is:
4 pens * $1.5/pen = $6

Next, let's calculate the cost of the notebooks:
- Raphael bought 2 notebooks.
- Each notebook costs $4.

So, the total cost for the notebooks is:
2 notebooks * $4/notebook = $8

Now, let's add the cost of the rim of bond paper:
- The rim of bond paper costs $20.

To find the total amount Raphael spent, we add the cost of the pens, notebooks, and the bond paper:
Total cost = Cost of pens + Cost of notebooks + Cost of bond paper
Total cost = $6 + $8 + $20

Now, let's add these amounts:
$6 + $8 = $14
$14 + $20 = $34

So, Raphael spent $34 in total."
"Finn originally saw 11 tadpoles. Then 6 more came out, so that's 11 + 6 = 17 tadpoles. But then 2 hid, so now Finn can see 17 - 2 = 15 tadpoles in the pond."
"On Tuesday, the tank had 17 + 7 = 24 feet of water.
On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of 24 feet, which is 24 * (2/3) = 16 feet.

The final numerical answer is 16."
"First, let's find out how many starfish Locsin caught. Anakin caught 10 starfish, and Locsin caught 5 fewer, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.

Next, let's find out how many sea horses Locsin caught. Anakin caught 6 sea horses, and Locsin caught 3 fewer, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.

Now, let's find out how many clownfish Locsin caught. Anakin caught 3 clownfish, and Locsin caught 2 more, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's add up all the fish they caught together.

Anakin caught: 10 starfish + 6 sea horses + 3 clownfish = 19 fish.
Locsin caught: 5 starfish + 3 sea horses + 5 clownfish = 13 fish.

Together, they caught: 19 + 13 = 32 fish.

So, the final numerical answer is 32."
"First, we need to find out how much the price increases each time. The price increases by 20% of the original price every two months. The original price is $20.

To find 20% of $20:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 20 = \frac{20}{100} \times 20 = 0.2 \times 20 = 4 \]

So, the price increases by $4 every two months.

Next, we need to find out how many times the price increases in 36 months. Since the price increases every two months:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months per increase}} = 18 \text{ increases} \]

Now, we calculate the total increase in price over 36 months. Each increase is $4, and there are 18 increases:
\[ 18 \times 4 = 72 \]

Finally, we add this total increase to the original price to find the new price:
\[ 20 + 72 = 92 \]

So, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is:
\[ 92 \]"
"First, let's find out how much one red car costs. We know that one red car costs $4.

Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and we know one action figure costs $5, then 3 action figures would cost 3 times $5, which is $15.

Now, we know that one red car costs $4 and that the doll costs $15. So, the total cost of the red car and the doll is $4 + $15 = $19.

We also know that the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and since one action figure costs $5, 3 action figures would cost $15.

So, the total cost of all the toys is the cost of the red car, the doll, and the action figures, which is $19 + $15 = $34.

The final numerical answer is $34."
"First, we need to find out how much money Jackie loses if she does her taxes herself. She loses $35/hour and she would do 3 fewer hours of freelance work. So, the total loss is:

\[ 35 \times 3 = 105 \]

This means if Jackie does her taxes herself, she will lose $105. If she hires an accountant, she won't lose any money, so she will gain $105.

So, the additional money she will have if she hires the accountant is:

\[ 105 \]

The final numerical answer is:
105"
"First, let's add up the cost of all the computer accessories Elvira bought:
- Screen, keyboard, and mouse: €1090
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Now, let's add these amounts together:
€1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1423

Elvira's total budget is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost of the accessories from her budget:
€1500 - €1423 = €77

So, Elvira will have €77 left for her clothing."
"To make 1 Spanish flan, Sandra needs 3 eggs.
To make 15 Spanish flans, she needs 15 * 3 = 45 eggs.
Her neighbor gives her 9 eggs every time she babysits.
So, she needs to babysit 45 / 9 = 5 times.

The final answer is 5."
"Let's break this down step by step.

1. Let's say Brooke's current age is \( B \).
2. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's current age is \( 2B \).
3. In 2 years, Brooke will be \( B + 2 \) years old.
4. In 2 years, Seth will be \( 2B + 2 \) years old.
5. The sum of their ages in 2 years will be \( (B + 2) + (2B + 2) \).
6. According to the problem, this sum is 28. So we can write the equation:
   \[
   (B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28
   \]
7. Simplify the left side of the equation:
   \[
   B + 2 + 2B + 2 = 28
   \]
   \[
   3B + 4 = 28
   \]
8. Subtract 4 from both sides:
   \[
   3B = 24
   \]
9. Divide both sides by 3:
   \[
   B = 8
   \]
10. Now that we know Brooke is 8 years old, we can find Seth's age:
    \[
    \text{Seth's age} = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16
    \]

So, Seth is 16 years old."
"Twice the money Ethel has is 2 * $8 = $16.
Jimmy has $2 more than this amount, so Jimmy has $16 + $2 = $18.

"Pancho walks 20 miles a day for 5 days which is 20 * 5 = 100 miles.
On weekends, he walks 10 miles each day, so that's 10 * 2 = 20 miles.
In total, he walks 100 + 20 = 120 miles in a week."
"First, let's find out how much the jacket costs. The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so:
Jacket cost = 3 * Hat cost
Jacket cost = 3 * $25
Jacket cost = $75

Next, we find out how much the pants cost. The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket, so:
Pants cost = (Hat cost + Jacket cost) / 2
Pants cost = ($25 + $75) / 2
Pants cost = $100 / 2
Pants cost = $50

Now, we add up the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of one uniform:
Total cost = Hat cost + Jacket cost + Pants cost
Total cost = $25 + $75 + $50
Total cost = $150

So, each uniform costs $150 in total."
"First, let's calculate the total number of legs for the spiders:
80 spiders * 8 legs each = 640 legs

Next, let's calculate the total number of legs for the insects:
90 insects * 6 legs each = 540 legs

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs for the rare mutant invertebrates:
3 invertebrates * 10 legs each = 30 legs

Now, let's add all the legs together:
640 legs (spiders) + 540 legs (insects) + 30 legs (invertebrates) = 1210 legs

So, the total number of legs Jake sees is 1210."
"First, let's figure out the ages of the birds.

1. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, let's add up the ages of the four birds:
8 (Sally Thirtytwo) + 8 (Sally Four) + 16 (Granny Red) + 19 (Sally Two) = 51

The total age of the four birds is 51."
"First, we need to find out how much Jessica pays each month if she pays 50% more than the minimum.

For the student loans:
50% of $300 is $300 * 0.50 = $150
So, she pays $300 + $150 = $450

For the credit card:
50% of $200 is $200 * 0.50 = $100
So, she pays $200 + $100 = $300

For the mortgage:
50% of $500 is $500 * 0.50 = $250
So, she pays $500 + $250 = $750

Now, we add up all the payments she makes each month:
$450 (student loans) + $300 (credit card) + $750 (mortgage) = $1500

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12:
$1500 * 12 = $18000

So, the final numerical answer is $18000."
"First, let's find out how long it takes Billy to peel one potato and one potato cut up. It takes 1.5 minutes to peel a potato and 5 seconds to cut it up. 

To make it easier, let's convert everything to seconds. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so 1.5 minutes is 1.5 * 60 = 90 seconds.

So, peeling one potato takes 90 seconds and cutting one potato takes 5 seconds. 

Now, let's add these times together to find out how long it takes to peel and cut one potato: 90 seconds + 5 seconds = 95 seconds.

Billy has 60 potatoes to prepare. If it takes 95 seconds to prepare one potato, then for 60 potatoes it will take 95 * 60 seconds.

Let's calculate that: 95 * 60 = 5700 seconds.

To convert 5700 seconds back to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute): 5700 / 60 = 95 minutes.

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes."
"First, let's find out how much they spend on sugar for each gallon. They spend $2 on sugar.

Now, let's find out how much they spend on lemons for each gallon. They spend $3 on lemons.

So, for each gallon, they spend $2 on sugar + $3 on lemons = $5.

They sell 20 glasses of lemonade for $0.50 each, so the total revenue from selling lemonade is 20 glasses * $0.50/glass = $10.

They made a profit of $25, which means the total cost (cost of lemons, sugar, and other expenses) was $10 (revenue) - $25 (profit) = -$15. This negative value indicates they spent more than they made, but we are only interested in the cost of lemons and sugar.

Since we know they spent $5 on lemons and sugar for each gallon, and we need to find out how many gallons they made to have a total cost of $15, we can divide the total cost by the cost per gallon.

Total cost = $15
Cost per gallon (lemons and sugar) = $5

Number of gallons = Total cost / Cost per gallon
Number of gallons = $15 / $5
Number of gallons = 3

Now, to find out how much they spent on lemons, we multiply the number of gallons by the cost of lemons per gallon.

Cost of lemons = Number of gallons * Cost of lemons per gallon
Cost of lemons = 3 * $3
Cost of lemons = $9

So, they spent $9 on lemons."
"First, we need to find out how many Chinese people were in the race. We know there were 240 Asians in total, and 80 of them were Japanese. So, the number of Chinese people is:

240 Asians - 80 Japanese = 160 Chinese

We are told that there were 60 boys on the Chinese team. To find out how many girls were on the Chinese team, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese people:

160 Chinese - 60 boys = 100 girls

So, the number of girls on the Chinese team is 100."
"First, let's find out how much Zaid spends on rent, car fuel, and then calculate the remaining amount after those expenses. 

Zaid's salary is 6000$ per month.

1. Rent: 1/4 of his salary
   Rent = 1/4 * 6000$ = 1500$

2. Car fuel: 1/3 of his salary
   Car fuel = 1/3 * 6000$ = 2000$

Now, let's find out how much money is left after spending on rent and car fuel.
Remaining money = Zaid's salary - (Rent + Car fuel)
Remaining money = 6000$ - (1500$ + 2000$) = 6000$ - 3500$ = 2500$

Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
Donation to charity = 1/2 * 2500$ = 1250$

Now, let's subtract the donation to charity from the remaining money.
Money left after donation = Remaining money - Donation to charity
Money left after donation = 2500$ - 1250$ = 1250$

Zaid gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$.
Total given to daughter and wife = 200$ + 700$ = 900$

Finally, let's subtract the amount given to his daughter and wife from the money left after the donation.
Money left after all expenses and donations = Money left after donation - (Amount given to daughter + Amount given to wife)
Money left after all expenses and donations = 1250$ - 900$ = 350$

So, the final numerical answer is 350$."
"First, let's find out how many crabs Monic has. Since Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, and Bo has 40 crabs, Monic has:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ crabs} \]

Next, we know Rani has ten more crabs than Monic. Since Monic has 36 crabs, Rani has:
\[ 36 + 10 = 46 \text{ crabs} \]

Now, to find the total number of crabs the three have together, we add the number of crabs each one has:
\[ 40 + 36 + 46 = 122 \]

So, the total number of crabs the three have together is:
\[ 122 \]"
"To find out how much Lloyd earned, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then add them together.

For the first week:
- He tutored for 5 hours.
- He earns $10 an hour.
- So, his earnings for the first week = 5 hours * $10/hour = $50.

For the second week:
- He tutored for 8 hours.
- He earns $10 an hour.
- So, his earnings for the second week = 8 hours * $10/hour = $80.

Now, we add the earnings from both weeks:
- Total earnings = $50 (first week) + $80 (second week) = $130.

So, Lloyd earned $130 for the first two weeks."
"First, we need to find out how many votes the winner got. The winner got 3/4 of the votes. If the total number of students who voted was 80, we can calculate the winner's votes as follows:

Votes for winner = 3/4 * 80

Now, let's calculate that.
3/4 of 80 is 60. So, the winner got 60 votes.

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser got would be the total votes minus the votes the winner got:

Votes for loser = Total votes - Votes for winner
Votes for loser = 80 - 60

Now, let's calculate that.
80 - 60 is 20.

So, the loser got 20 votes."
"First, let's figure out how many white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations. So, if the number of pink calla lilies is 200, we can find the number of white carnations by dividing 200 by 5.

200 ÷ 5 = 40

So, Sandra ordered 40 white carnations.

Next, we know that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. So, we multiply the number of white carnations by 4 to find the number of red roses.

40 × 4 = 160

Therefore, Sandra must have 160 red roses delivered by 5 pm to keep her business."
"If Jan is 30 years old, then two years ago Jan was 28 years old.

Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age two years ago, so:
Half of Jan's age two years ago = 28 / 2 = 14
Mark was 5 years older than this, so Mark was 14 + 5 = 19 years old two years ago.

If two years ago Mark was 19 years old, then currently Mark is 19 + 2 = 21 years old.

Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean is 21 + 2 = 23 years old.

The final numerical answer is 23."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes for the faster team to complete the race.

Each member of the faster team runs their leg in 55 seconds. Since there are four members, the total time for the faster team is:
55 seconds/member * 4 members = 220 seconds

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for the slower team to complete the race.

The first runner takes 60 seconds. The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so that's 60 - 3 = 57 seconds. The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so that's 57 - 3 = 54 seconds. The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so that's 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

Now, let's add up the time for the slower team:
60 seconds + 57 seconds + 54 seconds + 51 seconds = 222 seconds

Now we can find out how many seconds the faster team wins by:
222 seconds (slower team) - 220 seconds (faster team) = 2 seconds

So, the faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:**
   - A six-sided die has numbers 1 through 6.
   - Numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6.
   - So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.
   - The probability is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \) or 50%.

2. **Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:**
   - Even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6.
   - The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \).
   - The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also \( \frac{1}{2} \).
   - Since the rolls are independent, the probability of both happening is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} \) or 25%.

3. **Comparing the probabilities:**
   - We need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row.
   - The difference in probability is \( 50\% - 25\% = 25\% \).

So, Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row."
"Jenna's mother picked 20 apples.
Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, so Jenna picked 20 / 2 = 10 apples.

The final numerical answer is 30."
"First, let's figure out how many pieces of straw are given to the hamsters. There are 10 cages of hamsters and each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw. So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is:

10 cages * 5 pieces/cage = 50 pieces

Now, we know that 20 pieces of straw are given to the rabbits. So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters and rabbits is:

50 pieces (hamsters) + 20 pieces (rabbits) = 70 pieces

We are told that 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents. So, the number of pieces of straw given to the rats is:

160 pieces (total) - 70 pieces (hamsters and rabbits) = 90 pieces

The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. To find out how many rats there are, we divide the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats by the number of pieces each rat gets:

90 pieces / 6 pieces/rat = 15 rats

Now, to find out how many rats are in each cage, we divide the total number of rats by the number of cages:

15 rats / 3 cages = 5 rats/cage

So, the final numerical answer is 5."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the interest for 3 months and add it to the original amount Mandy owes.

First, let's find the monthly interest:
- Monthly interest = 2% of $100 = 0.02 * $100 = $2

Since the interest is for 3 months, we multiply the monthly interest by 3:
- Total interest for 3 months = $2 * 3 = $6

Now, we add the total interest to the original amount Mandy owes:
- Total amount Mandy should give = $100 + $6 = $106

So, the final numerical answer is:
106"
"First, let's calculate the total cost for the trader. The trader buys the wheat at $20 per bag and spends $2 to transport each bag. So, the total cost per bag is $20 + $2 = $22. 

The trader made a total profit of $400 after selling all the bags at $30 each. To find out the total revenue from selling all the bags, we add the profit to the total cost. So, the total revenue is $400 + $22 per bag * number of bags.

Let's denote the number of bags as 'n'. The total revenue can be expressed as $30 per bag * n. So, we have:

\[ 30n = 22n + 400 \]

Now, let's solve for 'n':

\[ 30n - 22n = 400 \]
\[ 8n = 400 \]
\[ n = \frac{400}{8} \]
\[ n = 50 \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat."
"First, let's find out how much they spent on food. They spent $4.50 less on food than on tickets. They spent $20.25 on tickets, so:

\[ \text{Food cost} = \text{Ticket cost} - 4.50 = 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Now, let's add up all the costs:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Ticket cost} + \text{Food cost} + \text{Ride cost} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 20.25 + 15.75 + 2 \times 33 \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 102 \]

They agreed to split all the costs evenly, so each person paid:

\[ \text{Cost per person} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{3} = \frac{102}{3} = 34 \]

So, each of them paid $34."
"John collects peaches for 3 hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so in 3 hours, there are 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

He can collect 2 peaches a minute, so in 180 minutes, he collects 180 * 2 = 360 peaches.

The final numerical answer is 360."
"First, we need to find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ten ducks need in total each day. 

Ducks need 3.5 pounds of insects each week. So, each day they need 3.5 pounds / 7 days = 0.5 pounds of insects.

For ten ducks, they need 0.5 pounds/day * 10 ducks = 5 pounds of insects per day.

So, the final numerical answer is 5."
"Tom starts with 50 trees. Each year, he plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees, so the net increase in trees each year is 10 - 2 = 8 trees. Over 10 years, the total increase in trees is 8 trees/year * 10 years = 80 trees. Adding this to the initial 50 trees, he has 50 + 80 = 130 trees. After 10 years, 30% of these trees die. So, 30% of 130 trees die, which is 0.30 * 130 = 39 trees. Therefore, the number of trees left is 130 - 39 = 91 trees."
"First, let's find out how many flamingos were taken back on Saturday. The neighbors took back one third of the 18 pink flamingos, so:

1/3 * 18 = 6 flamingos

These 6 flamingos were taken back and painted white. So, the number of pink flamingos left on Sue's front yard after Saturday is:

18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos

On Sunday, they added another 18 pink flamingos, so the total number of pink flamingos on Sunday is:

12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos

On Sunday, they also added 18 white flamingos, so the total number of white flamingos is:

6 white flamingos (from Saturday)

Now, we need to find out how many more pink flamingos there are than white flamingos:

30 pink flamingos - 6 white flamingos = 24 more pink flamingos

So, the final numerical answer is 24."
"Violetta needs crayons in 5 different colors, and each crayon costs $2. So, the total cost for 5 crayons is 5 * $2 = $10. Violetta prepared $20 for this purchase. Therefore, the change she will get is $20 - $10 = $10."
"First, we need to find out how much a pen costs. We know that a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined. So, we add the cost of a pencil and an eraser:

Cost of a pencil = $1.20
Cost of an eraser = $0.30

Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser
Cost of a pen = $1.20 + $0.30
Cost of a pen = $1.50

Now, we need to find out how much 8 pens will cost. We multiply the cost of one pen by 8:

Cost of 8 pens = Cost of one pen × 8
Cost of 8 pens = $1.50 × 8
Cost of 8 pens = $12.00

So, the final numerical answer is $12.00."
"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we first need to calculate the total amount of carrots that will be distributed to the restaurants.

Each restaurant gets 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. So, the total amount of carrots distributed is:
2 pounds/restaurant * 40 restaurants = 80 pounds

Now, we subtract the total amount of carrots distributed from the initial amount of carrots:
200 pounds - 80 pounds = 120 pounds

So, the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used is 120 pounds."
"To find out how many kids there are in Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

Total population = 23786
Number of men = 8417
Number of women = 9092

Number of kids = Total population - (Number of men + Number of women)

Let's do the math:

Number of kids = 23786 - (8417 + 9092)
Number of kids = 23786 - 17509
Number of kids = 6277

So, the number of kids in Soda is 6277."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.
2. After a month, she collected three times that number. So, she collected \(3 \times 20 = 60\) cards.
3. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month. So, she collected \(60 - 20 = 40\) cards.
4. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number of cards from the first and second months is \(20 + 60 = 80\). So, she collected \(2 \times 80 = 160\) cards.

Now, let's add up all the cards she collected over the three months:
- Initial cards: 20
- Cards collected in the first month: 60
- Cards collected in the second month: 40
- Cards collected in the third month: 160

Total cards = Initial cards + Cards in the first month + Cards in the second month + Cards in the third month
Total cards = 20 + 60 + 40 + 160 = 280

So, Elaine now has 280 Pokemon cards in total."
"First, we need to find out how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher. Since he edits an equal number of sentences each week for both publishers and he edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits 1000 / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher.

Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. So, for 500 sentences, Mark earns 500 * 5 = 2500 cents from Publisher A.

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays Mark 5 * 2 = 10 cents per sentence. For 500 sentences, Mark earns 500 * 10 = 5000 cents from Publisher B.

To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we add the earnings from both publishers: 2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents.

So, the final numerical answer is 7500 cents."
"Baldur gets 5 pails of water in the morning and 6 pails of water in the afternoon. So, he gets a total of 5 + 6 = 11 pails of water every day. Since each pail contains 5 liters of water, he gets 11 * 5 = 55 liters of water every day. 

The final numerical answer is 55."
"First, let's calculate the raise in John's salary. If his salary is $2000 a week and he gets a 5% raise, we calculate the raise as follows:

\[ \text{Raise} = 2000 \times \frac{5}{100} = 2000 \times 0.05 = 100 \]

So, his new weekly salary after the raise is:

\[ \text{New Weekly Salary} = 2000 + 100 = 2100 \]

Now, to find out how much he makes in a year, we multiply his new weekly salary by the number of weeks in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so:

\[ \text{Yearly Salary} = 2100 \times 52 = 109200 \]

Adding the one-time monetary reward of $5000 to his yearly salary:

\[ \text{Total Yearly Income} = 109200 + 5000 = 114200 \]

So, the total amount of money John made that year is $114,200."
"First, we need to find out how many tons of grapes Josie's farm produces in a year. Since each acre produces 5 tons of grapes and she has 10 acres, we multiply 5 tons by 10 acres:

5 tons/acre * 10 acres = 50 tons

Next, we need to find out how many barrels of wine can be made from 50 tons of grapes. Since each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine, we multiply 50 tons by 2 barrels/ton:

50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels

So, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year."
"Carl ate a sandwich every day for 7 days, using 2 slices of cheese each day. So, he used 2 slices/day * 7 days = 14 slices of cheese for the sandwiches.

For breakfast, he ate omelets 3 days and used 2 slices of cheese per omelet plus 1 more slice than he used per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich, he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices of cheese per omelet. So, for breakfast, he used 3 slices/omelet * 3 days = 9 slices of cheese.

He also made a big dish of macaroni and cheese using 8 slices of cheese.

To find the total slices of cheese he used, we add the slices used for sandwiches, breakfast, and the big dish:
14 slices (sandwiches) + 9 slices (breakfast) + 8 slices (macaroni and cheese) = 31 slices of cheese.

So, the final numerical answer is 31."
"First, let's calculate the number of blue pens Janet bought:
6 bags * 9 pens per bag = 54 blue pens

Next, let's calculate the number of red pens Janet bought:
2 bags * 6 pens per bag = 12 red pens

Now, let's add all the pens together:
Green pens: 22
Yellow pens: 10
Blue pens: 54
Red pens: 12

Total pens = 22 + 10 + 54 + 12 = 98 pens

So, the final numerical answer is 98."
"First, let's find the sum of Brinley's first five test scores:
89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438

Mr. Bert allows Brinley to remove the lowest score from the average. To find out which score is the lowest, we need to compare the scores:
89, 71, 92, 100, 86
The lowest score is 71.

Now, we remove the lowest score (71) from the sum:
438 - 71 = 367

Brinley wants an average of 93 after six tests. To find out the total score needed for an average of 93 over six tests, we multiply 93 by 6:
93 * 6 = 558

To find out the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we subtract the sum of the first five scores (after removing the lowest) from the total score needed:
558 - 367 = 191

So, Brinley needs a score of 191 on the sixth test to get an average of 93."
"First, let's calculate how many kilometers Micheal rode in the first four weeks. He rode at least 5 times a week and each time he rode 25 kilometers.

So, in one week, he rode:
5 rides/week * 25 km/ride = 125 km/week

For four weeks, he rode:
125 km/week * 4 weeks = 500 km

Next, let's calculate how many kilometers he rode in the next three weeks. He decided to ride 2 times a week and each time 60 kilometers.

So, in one week, he rode:
2 rides/week * 60 km/ride = 120 km/week

For three weeks, he rode:
120 km/week * 3 weeks = 360 km

Now, let's add the kilometers from both periods to find the total:
500 km + 360 km = 860 km

So, the total number of kilometers Micheal rode is 860 km."
"First, we need to find out how much each candied apple weighs. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple and each chocolate bar weighs 40g, each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g.

Now, we can calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then add them together.

The total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 bars * 40g/bar = 1000g.
The total weight of the candied apples is 80 apples * 20g/apple = 1600g.

Adding these together gives the total weight of the bag of candy:
1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

So, Joe's bag of candy weighs 2600 grams."
"First, let's find out how many cakes Rose bought on Tuesday. She bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. Since she bought 4 cakes on Monday, on Tuesday she bought:

\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ cakes} \]

Next, let's find out how many cakes she bought on Wednesday. She bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. Since she bought 12 cakes on Tuesday, on Wednesday she bought:

\[ 12 \times 5 = 60 \text{ cakes} \]

Now, let's add up all the cakes she bought over the three days:

\[ 4 \text{ (Monday)} + 12 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 60 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 76 \text{ cakes} \]

So, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is:

\[ 76 \]"
"First, let's find out how many cups and plates are being talked about.

A dozen is 12, so twenty dozen cups would be:
20 x 12 = 240 cups

Half a dozen plates would be:
12 / 2 = 6 plates

The total cost of half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each would be:
6 x $6000 = $36000

The question states that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the cost of the cups would be:
$36000 - $1200 = $34800

To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of the cups by the number of cups:
$34800 / 240 = $145

So, the total cost of buying each cup is $145."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes.

The jacket costs $30.
Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the shoes cost $20 * 2 = $40.

The total cost is $30 + $40 = $70.

Now, let's calculate how much money Sara can earn from babysitting and mowing the lawn.

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits, and she babysits 4 times, so she earns $5 * 4 = $20 from babysitting.

Sara's parents pay her $4 each time she mows the lawn. We need to find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the rest of the money.

Sara already has $10 saved. So, the total amount she needs to earn is $70 - $10 = $60.

Now, we need to find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn $60. Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we divide $60 by $4.

$60 / $4 = 15.

So, Sara must mow the lawn 15 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes.

The final numerical answer is 15."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let's say Jerry has \( r \) red chickens.
2. Since he has two more white chickens than red chickens, he has \( r + 2 \) white chickens.
3. Red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, so \( r \) red chickens produce \( 3r \) eggs a day.
4. White chickens produce 5 eggs a day, so \( r + 2 \) white chickens produce \( 5(r + 2) \) eggs a day.
5. The total number of eggs collected each day is the sum of the eggs from the red and white chickens, which is \( 3r + 5(r + 2) \).
6. We know that the total number of eggs collected each day is 42, so we can set up the equation: \( 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \).

Now, let's solve the equation:

\[
3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
\]

\[
3r + 5r + 10 = 42
\]

\[
8r + 10 = 42
\]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[
8r = 32
\]

Divide both sides by 8:

\[
r = 4
\]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens."
"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the total distance he walks. Since the park is a rectangle, the distance around it (the perimeter) is calculated by adding up all the sides. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the length is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles, we can plug these values into the formula:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know Gary walks 15 miles at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So,

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park."
"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, let's break down the information given:

- On the first day, she counted 100 customers.
- On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so that's 100 + 50 = 150 customers.
- By the end of the third day, the total number of customers counted was 500.

To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we can subtract the number of customers counted on the first and second days from the total number of customers counted by the end of the third day.

So, the calculation is:
500 (total by the third day) - 100 (first day) - 150 (second day) = 250 customers.

Therefore, the number of customers she counted on the third day is 250."
"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Let's say the small pool has \( S \) gallons of water now.
2. Since the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool now, the big pool has \( 4S \) gallons of water now.
3. Four minutes ago, the small pool had \( S - 4 \times 4 \) gallons because it lost 4 gallons per minute for 4 minutes.
4. Four minutes ago, the big pool had \( 4S - 4 \times 4 \) gallons because it also lost 4 gallons per minute for 4 minutes.
5. According to the problem, four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So, \( 4S - 16 = 2(S - 16) \).

Now, let's solve the equation:
\[ 4S - 16 = 2S - 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = -32 + 16 \]
\[ 2S = -16 \]
\[ S = -8 \]

Since we can't have a negative amount of water, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the setup. Let's recheck the setup:

The correct equation should be:
\[ 4S - 16 = 2(S - 16) \]
\[ 4S - 16 = 2S - 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = -32 + 16 \]
\[ 2S = -16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now."
"First, we need to find out the total cost of the shoes and the belt. The shoes cost $320.00 and the belt costs $32.00. So, we add these two amounts together:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

The total cost of the shoes and the belt is $352.00.

Lori earns $8.00 per hour at her part-time job. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[ 352.00 \div 8.00 = 44.00 \]

So, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase."
"First, let's find out how much Janeth promised to return. She promised to return the original $2000 plus 10% of that amount. So, 10% of $2000 is calculated as follows:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$2000 = \frac{10}{100} \times 2000 = \$200 \]

So, the total amount she promised to return is:

\[ \$2000 + \$200 = \$2200 \]

Janeth is paying $165 a month for 12 months. So, the total amount she will pay in 12 months is:

\[ \$165 \times 12 = \$1980 \]

Now, to find out the remaining balance, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she promised to return:

\[ \$2200 - \$1980 = \$220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance by the end of 12 months will be \$220."
"There are 4 roses + 7 more dahlias = 11 dahlias.
So, the total number of flowers in the vase is 4 roses + 11 dahlias = 15 flowers.
The final numerical answer is 15."
"First, let's find out how old Adrian and Zack are now based on Harriet's age.

If Harriet is 21 years old now, and Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, then:
Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age = 3 * 21 = 63 years old.

If Harriet is half the age of Zack, then:
Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age = 2 * 21 = 42 years old.

Now, let's calculate their ages in three years:
- Adrian's age in three years = 63 + 3 = 66 years.
- Harriet's age in three years = 21 + 3 = 24 years.
- Zack's age in three years = 42 + 3 = 45 years.

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages together and divide by 3:
Average age = (Adrian's age in three years + Harriet's age in three years + Zack's age in three years) / 3
Average age = (66 + 24 + 45) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45

So, the final numerical answer is 45."
"First, let's find out how many points Yuri and Brianna scored.

Naomi scored 68 points.

Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. So, half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. Then Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, let's add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna: 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points.

The total points scored by all four students is 251. So, to find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points:

251 - 197 = 54 points.

So, Jojo scored 54 points."
"Carmen spent 10 minutes on each crossword puzzle and she solved 3 crossword puzzles, so she spent 10 * 3 = 30 minutes on crossword puzzles. For the sudoku puzzles, she spent 5 minutes on each and solved 8, so she spent 5 * 8 = 40 minutes on sudoku puzzles. In total, she spent 30 + 40 = 70 minutes playing these games."
"First, we need to find out how much water is left in the tank after Celine used some for her garden. The tank originally had 120 liters of water, and she used 90 liters. So, we subtract:

120 liters - 90 liters = 30 liters left.

Next, Celine collected rainwater that is twice the amount left in the tank. Since there are 30 liters left, the amount of rainwater collected is:

2 * 30 liters = 60 liters.

Now, we add the rainwater collected to the water left in the tank:

30 liters + 60 liters = 90 liters.

So, the final amount of water in the tank is 90 liters."
"Andy plants 90 geraniums. He plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, so he plants 90 - 40 = 50 petunias. To find the total number of flowers he plants, we add the number of geraniums and petunias together: 90 + 50 = 140 flowers. 

The final numerical answer is 140."
"First, we need to find out how much the company spent on advertising for the second year. Since they spent a third of $15000 on the second year, we calculate:

\[ \frac{15000}{3} = 5000 \]

So, the company spent $5000 on advertising for the second year.

Now, to find the total amount spent on advertising for the two years, we add the amount spent in the first year to the amount spent in the second year:

\[ 15000 + 5000 = 20000 \]

So, the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20000."
"First, we need to calculate how much Carlos pays for renting the canoe. He pays $30 an hour and he uses it for 3 hours, so:
\[ 30 \times 3 = 90 \]
Carlos pays $90 for the canoe.

Next, we calculate how much Benji pays for renting the banana boat raft. He pays $18 an hour and he uses it for 5 hours, so:
\[ 18 \times 5 = 90 \]
Benji pays $90 for the banana boat raft.

Now, we add the amounts they both paid to find the total cost:
\[ 90 + 90 = 180 \]

So, the total amount they will pay for their rentals is:
\[ 180 \]"
"First, we need to find out how many days it takes to travel by car. Since it takes 6 days to travel by bus and half as many days to travel by car, we divide 6 by 2 to find the car travel time.

6 days ÷ 2 = 3 days

Now, we need to calculate the total travel time for Andrew's trip. He plans to travel by bus to Rochester and then return by car. So, we add the travel time by bus to the travel time by car.

6 days (bus) + 3 days (car) = 9 days

So, the total number of days Andrew will travel is 9 days."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cards James has after the changes.

He starts with:
- 30 fire type cards
- 20 grass type cards
- 40 water type cards

He loses 8 water type cards, so he has:
- 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards

He buys 14 more grass type cards, so he has:
- 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards

Now, let's find the total number of cards he has:
- 30 fire type cards
- 34 grass type cards
- 32 water type cards

Total number of cards = 30 + 34 + 32 = 96 cards

Now, to find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

So,
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

Let's calculate this.
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 = 0.3333 \times 100 = 33.33 \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33%."
"First, let's add up all the items Chad ordered:

- Base burrito: $6.50
- Extra meat: $2.00
- Extra cheese: $1.00
- Avocado: $1.00
- 2 sauces: $0.25 each, so 2 * $0.25 = $0.50

Now, let's add these amounts together:

$6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $11.00

Chad also adds an extra $3.00 for chips and a drink, so we add that to the total:

$11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00

Chad has a gift card worth $5.00, so we subtract that from the total:

$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

So, Chad still owes $9.00."
"First, let's find out how many pieces Kalinda and her mom can add together in one minute.

Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute.
Her mom can add half as many pieces as Kalinda, so her mom can add \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

Together, they can add \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces per minute.

The puzzle has 360 pieces. To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can add together in one minute:

\( \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \).

To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\( \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \).

So, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle."
"First, let's find out how many watermelons were ready for harvest after the first two months. If 30% of the 120 watermelons were ready, we calculate:

30% of 120 = 0.30 * 120 = 36 watermelons

So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest and Ashlyn took them home. This means the number of watermelons left is:

120 - 36 = 84 watermelons

Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest. So, we calculate:

3/4 of 84 = 0.75 * 84 = 63 watermelons

This means 63 watermelons were ready for harvest. Therefore, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:

84 - 63 = 21 watermelons

So, the final numerical answer is 21."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the cars before tax and registration:
- Each car costs $20,000.
- Mark buys 12 cars.
- So, the total cost for the cars is 12 * $20,000 = $240,000.

Next, let's calculate the tax on the cars:
- The tax rate is 10%.
- So, the tax on the cars is 10% of $240,000 = 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000.

Now, let's add the tax to the cost of the cars to get the total cost before registration:
- Total cost before registration = $240,000 + $24,000 = $264,000.

Then, let's calculate the registration cost:
- Registration cost per car is $1000.
- For 12 cars, the total registration cost is 12 * $1000 = $12,000.

Finally, let's add the registration cost to the total cost before registration to get the final amount Mark pays:
- Final amount = $264,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

So, the final numerical answer is $276,000."
"On Monday, Robert collects 20 shells. Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, so Kylie collects 20 + 5 = 25 shells.

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. Since she collected 25 shells on Monday, on Tuesday she collects 25 * 2 = 50 shells."
"If there were 50 ants and Dax found half as many bugs as ants, then the number of bugs is half of 50, which is 25.

To find the total number of insects, we add the number of ants and the number of bugs together:
50 ants + 25 bugs = 75 insects

So, the total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"First, we need to find out how many penguins jump in the ocean. Since one-third of the 36 penguins do this, we calculate:
36 / 3 = 12 penguins jump in the ocean.

Next, we find out how many penguins go inside the cave. Again, one-third of the 36 penguins do this, so:
36 / 3 = 12 penguins go inside the cave.

Now, we add the number of penguins that went to the ocean and the cave:
12 (ocean) + 12 (cave) = 24 penguins.

Finally, we subtract the number of penguins that went to the ocean and the cave from the total number of penguins to find out how many are left sunbathing:
36 (total) - 24 (ocean and cave) = 12 penguins.

So, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is 12."
"First, let's find out how much Steve's girlfriend eats. Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, we can divide Steve's daily intake by 2 to find out how much his girlfriend eats.

Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, so his girlfriend eats 6 / 2 = 3 tomatoes per day.

Now, let's find out how many tomatoes they eat together in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply their daily intake by 7.

Steve's weekly intake: 6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week
His girlfriend's weekly intake: 3 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 21 tomatoes/week

Together, they eat 42 + 21 = 63 tomatoes per week.

Now, we know that one vine produces 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines they need, we divide the total number of tomatoes they eat in a week by the number of tomatoes one vine produces.

Number of vines needed = 63 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/vine/week = 21 vines.

So, Steve needs 21 vines."
"First, we need to find out how many slices of pizza John needs in total. Since there are 20 friends and each friend gets 4 slices, we multiply 20 by 4:

20 friends * 4 slices per friend = 80 slices

Now, we know that each pizza is sliced into 8 portions. To find out how many pizzas John needs, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza:

80 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 10 pizzas

So, John needs to order 10 pizzas."
"Ram starts with 25 pens. For every 5 empty pens he mixes, he gets 1 new pen. 

To find out how many new pens he can make, we divide the number of pens he has by 5:

25 ÷ 5 = 5

So, Ram can make 5 new pens from the 25 empty pens he has. 

Adding the 5 new pens to the original 25 pens, he gets:

25 + 5 = 30

Therefore, the total number of pens Ram has is 30."
"Johnny's total money after adding extra $10 to his allowance of $20 is:
$20 + $10 = $30

After investing this sum and it tripling in a year, Johnny would have:
$30 * 3 = $90

So, the final numerical answer is:
$90"
"First, let's find out how old Joan is. Since Joan is five years older than Jessa, and Jessa is 20 years old, Joan is 20 + 5 = 25 years old.

Now, let's find out how old Mary is. Since Mary is two years younger than Joan, and Joan is 25 years old, Mary is 25 - 2 = 23 years old.

Now we know the ages of all three girls:
- Jessa is 20 years old.
- Joan is 25 years old.
- Mary is 23 years old.

To find the sum of their ages, we add them together: 20 + 25 + 23 = 68.

So, the sum of the ages of the three girls is 68."
"First, let's find out how many students went out through exit A. Since 30% of the students went out through exit A, we calculate:

30% of 1000 = 0.30 * 1000 = 300 students

So, 300 students went out through exit A. This means the remaining students are:

1000 - 300 = 700 students

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining students went out through exit B. Since 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B, we calculate:

3/5 of 700 = (3/5) * 700 = 420 students

So, 420 students went out through exit B. This means the rest of the students went out through exit C. The number of students who went out through exit C is:

700 - 420 = 280 students

So, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
"First, we need to find out how many candies Robert has. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert and John has 54 candies, we can find out how many candies Robert has by dividing John's candies by 2.

Robert's candies = John's candies / 2
Robert's candies = 54 / 2
Robert's candies = 27

Now we know Robert has 27 candies. Since James has 6 more candies than Robert, we can find out how many candies James has by adding 6 to Robert's candies.

James's candies = Robert's candies + 6
James's candies = 27 + 6
James's candies = 33

Now we know James has 33 candies. To find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract James's candies from John's candies.

More candies John has than James = John's candies - James's candies
More candies John has than James = 54 - 33
More candies John has than James = 21

So, John has 21 more candies than James."
"Dolly has 2 books and Pandora has 1 book. If they read each other's books as well as their own, Dolly will read 2 (her own) + 1 (Pandora's) = 3 books. Pandora will read 1 (her own) + 2 (Dolly's) = 3 books. So, together they will read 3 + 3 = 6 books. 

The final numerical answer is 6."
"Mike was pen pals with 5 people, but he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he is still pen pals with 5 - 2 = 3 people.

Each of these 3 people sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. So, each person sends 2 * 5 = 10 pages a week.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also sends 10 pages a week to each of the 3 people. So, he sends 10 * 3 = 30 pages a week in total.

Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. So, to write 30 pages, he spends 30 * 6 = 180 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 because there are 60 minutes in an hour. So, 180 minutes is 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

The final numerical answer is 3 hours."
"First, let's calculate the total minutes Jason has used this month.

He has a plan of 1000 minutes per month. 

He makes a 15-minute call to his boss every day. Since there are 30 days in the month, he makes 15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes to his boss.

He also used 300 extra minutes for other people.

So, the total minutes used are 450 minutes (to his boss) + 300 minutes (extra) = 750 minutes.

Now, let's find out how many minutes he has left.

He has a total of 1000 minutes, and he has used 750 minutes.

So, the minutes left are 1000 - 750 = 250 minutes.

The final numerical answer is 250."
"Kyle took 5 fries.
Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took 5 * 2 = 10 fries.
Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries.
Before any fries were taken, Griffin had 24 fries.
After Kyle, Billy, and Colby took their fries, Griffin had 24 - 5 - 10 - 2 = 7 fries left.
If Griffin had 27 fries in the end, then Ginger must have given Griffin 27 - 7 = 20 fries.

The final numerical answer is 20."
"First, let's find the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums:

4 snails - 32 snails = -28 snails

The difference is -28 snails, which means there are 28 more snails in the second aquarium than in the first one.

Now, let's say the number of fish in each aquarium is F. According to the question, the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in both aquariums. So we can write the equation:

-28 = 2 * (2F)

This equation comes from the fact that the difference in snails is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums, and since both aquariums have the same number of fish, we multiply the number of fish in one aquarium by 2.

Now, let's solve for F:

-28 = 4F
F = -28 / 4
F = -7

However, the number of fish cannot be negative. It seems there might be a misunderstanding in the setup of the problem. Let's re-evaluate the problem with the correct understanding that the difference in snails is twice the number of fish in one aquarium (since both aquariums have the same number of fish):

-28 = 2 * F
F = -28 / 2
F = -14

Again, we see that the number of fish cannot be negative. Let's assume the problem meant to say the difference in snails is twice the number of fish in one aquarium, and we need to find a positive number of fish. So, let's correct the equation:

28 = 2 * F
F = 28 / 2
F = 14

So, there are 14 fish in each aquarium."
"First, let's calculate the total hours the makeup artist works for the movie.

She works 6 hours a day and needs it done 4 times a week. So, in one week, she works:
6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week

The movie takes 5 weeks to finish, so in total, she works:
24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours

The makeup artist charges $250 an hour, so for 120 hours, she charges:
$250/hour * 120 hours = $30000

After the movie is done, she gives Jean a 10% discount. So, the discount amount is:
10% of $30000 = 0.10 * $30000 = $3000

Therefore, the amount Jean pays after the discount is:
$30000 - $3000 = $27000

So, the final numerical answer is:
27000"
"First, we need to find out the total amount Isabelle spent on the party supplies. We do this by adding up all the individual costs:

$12 (ingredients) + $43 (birthday presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags) = $96

Now, Isabelle is splitting this total cost evenly among her three parents. To find out how much each person pays, we divide the total cost by 3:

$96 ÷ 3 = $32

So, each person paid $32."
"First, we need to find out how many pounds of onions the chef bought in total. The chef bought 4 bags and each bag weighs 50 pounds, so:

4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds

Now, we know that a pound of onions costs $1.50. To find out how much the chef spent, we multiply the total pounds of onions by the cost per pound:

200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $300

So, the chef spent $300."
"First, let's find out how many cookies Sue's sister ate each day.

On Monday, her sister ate 5 cookies.
On Tuesday, her sister ate 13 cookies.

Now, let's find out how many cookies Sue ate each day.

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. So, Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies on Monday.
On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. So, Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies on Tuesday.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate.

Sue's total cookies = 20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies.
Her sister's total cookies = 5 (Monday) + 13 (Tuesday) = 18 cookies.

Each cookie has 200 calories, so let's calculate the total calories each of them consumed.

Sue's total calories = 46 cookies \(\times\) 200 calories/cookie = 9200 calories.
Her sister's total calories = 18 cookies \(\times\) 200 calories/cookie = 3600 calories.

Finally, let's find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister.

Sue's calories - Her sister's calories = 9200 calories - 3600 calories = 5600 calories.

So, Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister."
"First, let's find out how many students are in the school in total.

Each class has 20 students and there are 3 classes.
So, the total number of students in the school is 20 * 3 = 60 students.

Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the number of boys and girls in the school is the same.
So, there are 60 / 2 = 30 boys in the school.

Now, let's find out how many girls are in the school.

The first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls.
So, the total number of girls in the first and second classes is 15 + 12 = 27 girls.

Since the school has 30 boys in total, and 27 of those are girls, the number of boys in the third class is 30 - 27 = 3 boys.

So, the number of boys in the third class is 3."
"Travis originally had 61 apps. He deleted 9 apps, so he had:
61 - 9 = 52 apps left.

The final number of apps on his tablet is 70."
"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.
2. Today, he killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's say he killed \(x\) cougars today. So, he killed \(3x\) wolves.
3. He also killed three fewer cougars than the previous night. The previous night he killed 15 cougars, so today he killed \(15 - 3 = 12\) cougars.
4. Since he killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, he killed \(3 \times 12 = 36\) wolves today.
5. Now, let's add up all the animals he killed:
   - Wolves: 10 (last night) + 36 (today) = 46 wolves
   - Cougars: 15 (last night) + 12 (today) = 27 cougars
6. Total animals killed: 46 wolves + 27 cougars = 73 animals

So, the final numerical answer is 73."
"Bill starts on the 3rd floor. To find out the floor he rides to, we multiply his starting floor by 4 and then add 6.

Then, \( 12 + 6 = 18 \)

Bill is now on the 18th floor."
"First, let's find out how many times Anne went down the water slide. If Mitchel went down 30 times and Anne went down 30% less, we need to calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30.

30% of 30 is calculated as:
30 * (30/100) = 9

So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Now, Robert went down the water slide 4 times as much as Anne. So, we multiply the number of times Anne went down by 4.

Robert went down the slide 21 * 4 = 84 times.

The final numerical answer is 84."
"First, let's find out how many cows are in each of the original stalls. Since there are 10 stalls and each has 20 cows, we can calculate the total number of cows as follows:

10 stalls * 20 cows/stall = 200 cows

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. So, we divide the 40 cows by 20 stalls:

40 cows / 20 stalls = 2 cows/stall

Now, Mr. Sylas has a total of:

200 cows + 40 cows = 240 cows

These 40 new cows are distributed equally among the 20 stalls, so each stall gets 2 cows. Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. Since each stall has 2 cows, we can calculate the total for 8 stalls as follows:

8 stalls * 2 cows/stall = 16 cows

So, the final numerical answer is 16."
"First, let's count the total amount of money Brady has:

- Pennies: 100 pennies = 100 * $0.01 = $1.00
- Nickels: 40 nickels = 40 * $0.05 = $2.00
- Dimes: 20 dimes = 20 * $0.10 = $2.00
- Dollar bills: 40 pieces = 40 * $1.00 = $40.00

Now, let's add all the amounts together:

$1.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $40.00 = $45.00

So, Brady has $45.00 in his piggy bank."
"First, we need to find out how many sections the redwood tree has. Since each section is 10 feet and the tree is 200 feet tall, we divide the total height by the height of each section:

200 feet / 10 feet/section = 20 sections

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so the total weight of the tree before the termites ate is:

20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds

Termites ate 30% of the tree's wood, so we need to find out how much 30% of 8000 pounds is:

30% of 8000 pounds = 0.30 * 8000 pounds = 2400 pounds

Now, we subtract the weight the termites ate from the original weight to find out how much the tree weighs now:

8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds

So, the final numerical answer is 5600 pounds."
"First, we need to calculate the cost for the overdue books. Nancy has 8 books overdue, and each book costs $0.50. So, we multiply 8 by $0.50:

8 * $0.50 = $4.00

Next, we add the flat fee for having at least one book over a week overdue, which is $2.00:

$4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00

So, Nancy has to pay a total of $6.00."
"First, let's find out how many apples Jamal has. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal and Andrea has 52 apples, we can find out how many apples Jamal has by subtracting 8 from 52.

52 - 8 = 44

So, Jamal has 44 apples.

Next, we need to find out how many bananas Jamal has. We know that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. Since Jamal has 44 apples, we can find out how many bananas Jamal has by adding 4 to 44.

44 + 4 = 48

So, Jamal has 48 bananas.

Now, we need to find out how many bananas Andrea has. We know that Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal. Since Jamal has 48 bananas, we can find out how many bananas Andrea has by dividing 48 by 2.

48 / 2 = 24

So, Andrea has 24 bananas.

Now, let's add up all the fruits Andrea and Jamal have:

Andrea's apples: 52
Andrea's bananas: 24
Jamal's apples: 44
Jamal's bananas: 48

Total fruits = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48

Let's add these numbers:

52 + 24 = 76
76 + 44 = 120
120 + 48 = 168

So, the total number of fruits is 168."
"To make a dozen cookies, Carla needs 2 cups of flour.
She is making 36 cookies today, which is 3 dozen cookies.
So, for 3 dozen cookies, she will need 3 * 2 = 6 cups of flour.
She is also making 30 cookies tomorrow, which is 2.5 dozen cookies.
So, for 2.5 dozen cookies, she will need 2.5 * 2 = 5 cups of flour.
Therefore, in total, Carla will need 6 + 5 = 11 cups of flour.
The final numerical answer is 11."
"First, we need to find out how many pennies are in two thirds of the cup. We do this by multiplying the total number of pennies by two thirds.

Total pennies in the cup = 9,300

Pennies in two thirds = 9,300 * (2/3)

Let's calculate that:
9,300 * (2/3) = 6,200

So, there are 6,200 pennies in the stack.

Since 100 pennies make a dollar, we need to find out how many dollars are in 6,200 pennies.

Dollars in the stack = 6,200 / 100

Let's calculate that:
6,200 / 100 = 62

Therefore, the total dollar amount in the stack is 62 dollars."
"Maddison originally has 5 boxes * 50 marbles/box = 250 marbles.
After getting 20 more marbles from her friend, she has 250 marbles + 20 marbles = 270 marbles.

"First, let's find out how many trees Ferdinand has. Since Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, and Chris has 6 trees, we can calculate the number of trees Ferdinand has as follows:

\[ \text{Ferdinand's trees} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we need to find out how many trees Harry has. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. So, we calculate twice the number of trees Ferdinand has and then add 5:

\[ \text{Twice Ferdinand's trees} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \]
\[ \text{Harry's trees} = 6 + 5 = 11 \]

Now, to find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand, we subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has:

\[ \text{Difference} = 11 - 3 = 8 \]

So, Harry has 8 more trees than Ferdinand. The final numerical answer is:

8"
"First, let's find out how much money each girl has:

Carmen has $100.

Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so:
Samantha = Carmen + $25 = $100 + $25 = $125.

Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so:
Daisy = Samantha + $50 = $125 + $50 = $175.

Now, to find out how much all three girls have combined, we add their amounts together:
Total = Carmen + Samantha + Daisy = $100 + $125 + $175 = $400.

So, the final numerical answer is:
400"
"First, let's calculate the total price of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

The selling price of the house is $350,000.

The brokerage fee is 5% of $350,000:
\[ 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500 \]

The transfer fee is 12% of $350,000:
\[ 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000 \]

Now, let's add the brokerage fee and the transfer fee to the selling price to get the total price of the house:
\[ 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500 \]

Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. To find out how much more the total price of the house is than her budget, we subtract her budget from the total price:
\[ 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500 \]

So, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget."
"First, let's calculate the transfer fees. The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price, which is $400 000. So, the transfer fees are:
\[ 400 000 \times 0.03 = 12 000 \]

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee. The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is $400 000. So, the brokerage fee is:
\[ 400 000 \times 0.05 = 20 000 \]

Now, let's add the transfer fees and the brokerage fee to find the total fees Mr. Tan paid:
\[ 12 000 + 20 000 = 32 000 \]

Mr. Tan also paid $250 000 for the remaining loan amount of the house. So, the total amount he paid is:
\[ 32 000 + 250 000 = 282 000 \]

The net proceeds from selling the house is the selling price minus the total amount paid:
\[ 400 000 - 282 000 = 118 000 \]

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is:
\[ 118 000 \]"
"First, we need to find out how long it takes to heat the oil to 400 degrees. We know it takes 20 minutes to heat the oil to 300 degrees. To find out how long it takes to heat it to 400 degrees, we calculate 40% of 20 minutes and add that to the original 20 minutes.

40% of 20 minutes is:
0.40 * 20 = 8 minutes

So, it takes:
20 minutes + 8 minutes = 28 minutes to heat the oil to 400 degrees.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes to cook the chicken. We know it takes 5 minutes less to cook than it took to heat the oil. Since it took 28 minutes to heat the oil, we subtract 5 minutes from that time to find the cooking time.

28 minutes - 5 minutes = 23 minutes

To find the total time from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken, we add the time to heat the oil to the cooking time.

28 minutes (heating) + 23 minutes (cooking) = 51 minutes

So, the total time is 51 minutes."
"First, we need to calculate how much the real estate agent spent on newspaper ads. He bought 50 newspaper ads at $5 each, so we multiply 50 by 5:

50 * 5 = 250

Next, we calculate how much he spent on television ads. He bought 15 television ads at $75 each, so we multiply 15 by 75:

15 * 75 = 1125

Now, we add the cost of the newspaper ads and the television ads to find the total amount spent:

250 + 1125 = 1375

So, the real estate agent spent a total of 1375 on buying all the ads."
"First, we need to find out how many golf balls there are. Since the juggler can juggle 16 balls and half of them are golf balls, we divide 16 by 2:

16 / 2 = 8

So, there are 8 golf balls.

Next, we need to find out how many of these golf balls are blue. Since half of the golf balls are blue, we divide the number of golf balls by 2:

8 / 2 = 4

Therefore, there are 4 blue golf balls.

The final numerical answer is 4."
"First, let's find out how many M&Ms are in each bag:

- The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
- The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.
- The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add them all up to find the total number of M&Ms:

300 (from the first bag) + 312 (from the second bag) + 150 (from the third bag) = 762 M&Ms

So, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"First, let's calculate the number of windows in one house:

- Each house has 3 bedrooms.
- Each bedroom has 2 windows.
- So, in one house, there are 3 bedrooms * 2 windows/bedroom = 6 windows from bedrooms.
- There are also 4 windows not connected to bedrooms in each house.

So, in one house, there are 6 windows from bedrooms + 4 windows not connected to bedrooms = 10 windows.

Since John has 2 houses, we multiply the number of windows in one house by 2:

- Total windows in 2 houses = 10 windows/house * 2 houses = 20 windows.

The final numerical answer is:
20"
"To find out how much change the mother gets, we need to add up the cost of the items she bought and then subtract that total from the amount she paid.

First, let's add up the cost of the items:
- Cocoa costs $4.20
- Laundry costs $9.45
- Pasta costs $1.35

Adding these together:
$4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35 = $15.00

Now, the mother paid $20.00. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:
$20.00 - $15.00 = $5.00

So, the change the cashier gives back is $5.00."
"First, let's find out how many stitches the collar takes. The collar takes a tenth of the stitches for the body of the sweater. So, the collar takes:

\[ \frac{900}{10} = 90 \text{ stitches} \]

Next, the rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar. So, the rosette takes:

\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ stitches} \]

Now, let's add up the stitches for the collar and the rosette:

\[ 90 + 180 = 270 \text{ stitches} \]

The total stitches for the whole sweater is 1800. So, the stitches for the body and the sleeves together are:

\[ 1800 - 270 = 1530 \text{ stitches} \]

Since there are two sleeves, we need to divide the remaining stitches equally between the two sleeves:

\[ \frac{1530}{2} = 765 \text{ stitches per sleeve} \]

So, each sleeve takes 765 stitches."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the tomato seeds:
- Mrs. Rylan bought 20 packets of tomato seeds.

20 packets * $40/packet = $800

Next, let's calculate the cost of the celery seeds:
- Mrs. Rylan bought 80 packets of celery seeds.
- Each packet of celery seeds costs $30.

So, the total cost for celery seeds is:
80 packets * $30/packet = $2400

Now, let's add the total cost of tomato seeds and celery seeds to find the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used:
Total cost = Cost of tomato seeds + Cost of celery seeds
Total cost = $800 + $2400 = $3200

The final numerical answer is:
3200"
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Sean has to memorize 54 lines for his solo song.
2. The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song. So, the first scene has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.
3. Only a third of the first scene's lines are Sean's lines. So, Sean has \(108 \div 3 = 36\) lines for the first scene.
4. The second scene has six more lines than the song. So, the second scene has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
5. Four-fifths of the second scene's lines are Sean's lines. So, Sean has \(60 \times \frac{4}{5} = 48\) lines for the second scene.

Now, let's add up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
- Solo song: 54 lines
- First scene: 36 lines
- Second scene: 48 lines

Total lines Sean has to memorize: \(54 + 36 + 48 = 138\)

So, the final numerical answer is 138."
"First, let's find out how many cards had the letter A on them. Since 2/5 of the cards had the letter A, we calculate:

\( \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \) cards had the letter A.

Now, we subtract the cards with letter A from the total to find out how many cards are left:

\( 80 - 32 = 48 \) cards are left.

Next, we find out how many of these remaining cards had the letter B on them. Since 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B, we calculate:

\( \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \) cards had the letter B.

We subtract the cards with letter B from the remaining cards to find out how many cards are left:

\( 48 - 24 = 24 \) cards are left.

Now, we find out how many of these remaining cards had the letter C on them. Since 5/8 of the remaining cards had the letter C, we calculate:

\( \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \) cards had the letter C.

We subtract the cards with letter C from the remaining cards to find out how many cards had the letter D:

\( 24 - 15 = 9 \) cards had the letter D.

So, the final numerical answer is 9."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes to dig all the small holes and large holes separately.

Matthew takes 3 minutes to dig one small hole. So, for 30 small holes, it will take:
\[ 3 \text{ minutes/hole} \times 30 \text{ holes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Matthew takes 10 minutes to dig one large hole. So, for 15 large holes, it will take:
\[ 10 \text{ minutes/hole} \times 15 \text{ holes} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's add the time for both types of holes:
\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 150 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ 240 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} \]"
"To solve this, let's think about it step by step:

1. Mico and Marco's current ages add up to 20.
2. In 10 years, each of them will be 10 years older.
3. So, if we add 10 years to each of their current ages, the total increase in their combined age will be 10 + 10 = 20 years.
4. Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be the current sum of their ages plus the 20 years that will have passed.

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be:
20 (current sum) + 20 (years added) = 40

The final numerical answer is 40."
"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Let's say Sam's current age is \( S \).
2. Since Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, Ruby's current age is \( 6S \).
3. In 9 years, Sam's age will be \( S + 9 \).
4. In 9 years, Ruby's age will be \( 6S + 9 \).
5. According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
   \]

Now, let's solve this equation:

\[
6S + 9 = 3S + 27
\]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:

\[
3S + 9 = 27
\]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[
3S = 18
\]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[
S = 6
\]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old."
"First, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles. Peter bought 20 popsicles at $0.25 each. So, the cost of the popsicles is:
20 * 0.25 = $5.00

Next, we calculate the cost of the ice cream bars. Peter bought 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each. So, the cost of the ice cream bars is:
4 * 0.50 = $2.00

Now, we add the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars to find the total amount Peter paid:
5.00 + 2.00 = $7.00

So, the total amount Peter paid is $7.00."
"First, let's find out how many spots a mamba has. Since a cobra has 70 spots and a mamba has half as many spots as a cobra, a mamba has:

\[ 70 \div 2 = 35 \text{ spots} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and all the mambas.

For the cobras:
\[ 40 \text{ cobras} \times 70 \text{ spots per cobra} = 2800 \text{ spots} \]

For the mambas:
\[ 60 \text{ mambas} \times 35 \text{ spots per mamba} = 2100 \text{ spots} \]

Now, we add the total spots of all the cobras and mambas:
\[ 2800 \text{ spots} + 2100 \text{ spots} = 4900 \text{ spots} \]

To find half the number of spots they all have combined:
\[ \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

So, half the number of spots they all have combined is:
\[ 2450 \]"
"First, let's find out how many people are coming to the soccer game.

There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so that's 12 + 3 = 15 people.

Each team member brings 2 guests, so 15 team members * 2 guests = 30 guests.

So, the total number of people is 15 team members + 3 coaches + 30 guests = 48 people.

Each pizza serves 3 people, so Maddy will need 48 people / 3 people per pizza = 16 pizzas.

Each pizza costs $15, so Maddy will spend 16 pizzas * $15 per pizza = $240.

The final answer is $240."
"First, let's find out how many inches of the necklace are taken up by the topaz gemstones.

Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace.
So, the total length of the topaz gemstones is:
8 gemstones * 1 inch/gemstone = 8 inches

Now, we know the total length of the necklace is 25 inches. To find out how many inches are left for the sterling silver beads, we subtract the length taken by the topaz gemstones from the total length of the necklace:
25 inches - 8 inches = 17 inches

Each sterling silver bead is 1/4 of an inch long. To find out how many beads are needed for the remaining 17 inches, we divide the remaining length by the length of one bead:
17 inches / (1/4 inch/bead) = 17 * 4 beads = 68 beads

So, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace."
"First, let's calculate the number of stories each person wrote in the second week.

Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week. In the second week, she doubled that number:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ stories} \]

Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week. In the second week, he doubled that number:
\[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ stories} \]

Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week. In the second week, she doubled that number:
\[ 60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ stories} \]

Now, let's add up all the stories they wrote in the first and second weeks.

Alani's total:
\[ 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ stories} \]

Braylen's total:
\[ 40 + 80 = 120 \text{ stories} \]

Margot's total:
\[ 60 + 120 = 180 \text{ stories} \]

Finally, let's add up all the stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot:
\[ 60 + 120 + 180 = 360 \text{ stories} \]

So, the total number of stories they wrote altogether is:
\[ 360 \]"

In 3 years, her brother will be 18 + 3 = 21 years old."
"Kelly has 5 quarters, which is 5 * 25 = 125 cents.
She also has 2 dimes, which is 2 * 10 = 20 cents.
In total, Kelly has 125 + 20 = 145 cents.
If she buys a can of pop for 55 cents, she will have 145 - 55 = 90 cents left."
"First, let's find out how many stars are in the rows with 8 and 6 stars.

There are three rows of 8 stars, so that's 3 * 8 = 24 stars.
There are two rows of 6 stars, so that's 2 * 6 = 12 stars.

Now, let's add the stars in these rows together: 24 + 12 = 36 stars.

The flag has a total of 76 stars. So, to find out how many stars are in the 5-star rows, we subtract the stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows from the total number of stars:

76 - 36 = 40 stars.

Since each 5-star row has 5 stars, we divide the number of 5-star rows by 5:

40 ÷ 5 = 8 rows.

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars altogether on the flag."
"First, we need to find out the total weight of 80 flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so:

\[ 80 \text{ flagstones} \times 75 \text{ pounds/flagstone} = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

The delivery trucks can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds. To find out how many trucks are needed to transport 6000 pounds, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:

\[ \frac{6000 \text{ pounds}}{2000 \text{ pounds/truck}} = 3 \text{ trucks} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 3 trucks."
"First, we need to find out the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since it's traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, we divide 60 miles/hour by 2:

\[ 60 \div 2 = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it took the car in the fast lane to travel 480 miles. We use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the fast lane:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{fast}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at 30 miles/hour and it needs to cover the same 480 miles, we use the same formula to find the time it took:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{slow}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

So, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"First, let's find out how many medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, we subtract 5 from the number of medals Ali has:

Ali's medals: 22
Izzy's medals: 22 - 5 = 17

Now, let's find out the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:

Total medals Ali and Izzy have: 22 + 17 = 39

The problem states that Ali and Izzy together have 10 times less medals than have been given out. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have. So, we multiply the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have by 10:

Total medals given out: 39 * 10 = 390

The final numerical answer is 390."
"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars:

- Each packet has 5 chocolate bars.
- There are 8 packets.
- So, the total number of chocolate bars is \(8 \times 5 = 40\).

Next, let's find out how many chocolate bars the adults get:

- There are 4 adults.
- Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars.
- So, the total number of chocolate bars for the adults is \(4 \times 6 = 24\).

Now, let's find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children:

- The total number of chocolate bars is 40.
- The adults get 24 chocolate bars.
- So, the children get \(40 - 24 = 16\) chocolate bars.

Finally, we need to share these 16 chocolate bars equally among the 8 children:

- There are 8 children.
- So, each child gets \(16 \div 8 = 2\) chocolate bars.

The final numerical answer is 2."
"Susan works for 4 hours in total. Since she pauses for half an hour, she works for 4 - 0.5 = 3.5 hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so in 3.5 hours, she works for 3.5 * 60 = 210 minutes. She earns $5 every 10 minutes, so for 210 minutes, she earns 210 / 10 * $5 = 21 * $5 = $105. 

The final numerical answer is 105."
"First, let's find out how many points each player has after the first three rounds.

Mike has 21 points.

Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so:
Jim = Mike - 3 = 21 - 3 = 18 points.

Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so:
Tony = 2 * Mike = 2 * 21 = 42 points.

Now, let's see if they get extra points in the fourth round. Extra points are given if a player has over 20 points.

Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so he gets 1 extra point.
Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he does not get extra points.
Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets 1 extra point.

So, after the extra points are distributed:
Mike = 21 + 1 = 22 points.
Jim = 18 points (no extra points).
Tony = 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's add up all their points:
Total points = Mike + Jim + Tony = 22 + 18 + 43 = 83 points.

The final numerical answer is 83."
"First, let's find out how old the sons are. The oldest son is 8 years old. The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, so the youngest son is 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

Will asks his sons to wash as many oranges as they are years old. So, the oldest son will wash 8 oranges and the youngest son will wash 4 oranges.

Will bought 15 oranges in total. If the sons wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges, then the number of oranges left unwashed is 15 - 12 = 3.

So, the final numerical answer is 3."
"First, let's calculate the number of each activity Darren does on the second day.

On the first day, he does:
- 100 pushups
- 50 squats
- 20 dumbbell presses

On the second day, he does:
- 20 more pushups than on the first day, so 100 + 20 = 120 pushups
- 10 fewer squats than on the first day, so 50 - 10 = 40 squats
- Doubles the number of dumbbell presses, so 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses

Now, let's add up the total number of activities for both days.

For the first day:
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

For the second day:
- Pushups: 120
- Squats: 40
- Dumbbell presses: 40

Total pushups for two days: 100 + 120 = 220
Total squats for two days: 50 + 40 = 90
Total dumbbell presses for two days: 20 + 40 = 60

Now, let's add up all the activities:
220 (pushups) + 90 (squats) + 60 (dumbbell presses) = 370

So, the total count of the activities he's done in the two days is 370."
"First, let's find out how much rice the family eats in one day. Since there are 5 members and each eats 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and they eat every lunch and dinner, we can calculate the daily rice consumption as follows:

- Lunch: 5 members * 0.2 kg/member = 1 kg
- Dinner: 5 members * 0.2 kg/member = 1 kg

So, the total daily rice consumption is 1 kg + 1 kg = 2 kg.

Next, we need to find out how many days the 42 kg bag of rice will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of rice by the daily consumption:

- Total rice: 42 kg
- Daily consumption: 2 kg/day

So, the number of days the rice will last is 42 kg / 2 kg/day = 21 days.

Finally, to find out how many weeks the rice will last, we divide the number of days by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):

- Number of days: 21 days
- Number of weeks: 21 days / 7 days/week = 3 weeks.

So, the 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks."
"Sam sold bread from Tuesday to Friday, and over the weekend. Let's add up the crates he sold:

- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates
- Over the weekend: 20 crates

Now, let's add these up: 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 crates

Sam's target was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off by, we subtract the crates he sold from his target:

120 - 65 = 55 crates

So, Sam was 55 crates off from his target for the week."
"First, let's understand the bidding process:

- The first person bids $200.
- The second person bids $200 + $50 = $250.
- The third person bids $250 + $50 = $300.
- Carmen bids $300 + $50 = $350.

So, Carmen wins the desk for $350."
"First, let's calculate the total miles John drives in a year.

John drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back home each day. So, he drives 60 miles each day.

He goes to work 5 days a week, so in a week, he drives 5 * 60 = 300 miles.

There are 50 weeks in a year, so in a year, he drives 50 * 300 = 15,000 miles.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the miles driven.

He is charged $2 per mile, so for 15,000 miles, the cost is 15,000 * $2 = $30,000.

Next, let's calculate the bonus he gives the driver per year.

The driver gets a $150 bonus per month, and there are 12 months in a year, so the total bonus is 12 * $150 = $1,800.

Now, let's add the cost of the miles driven and the bonus to find the total amount John pays in a year.

Total amount = Cost of miles + Bonus
Total amount = $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

So, John pays $31,800 a year for driving."
"First, we need to find out how much time Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined. On Monday, he exercised for 16 minutes and on Sunday he exercised for 23 minutes. So, we add these two times together:

16 minutes (Monday) + 23 minutes (Sunday) = 39 minutes

Peter wants to exercise for twice this amount on Tuesday. So, we multiply the combined time by 2:

39 minutes * 2 = 78 minutes

Therefore, Peter has to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.

The final numerical answer is 78."
"To solve this, let's think about how many pages we have and how they are folded.

A 32-page tabloid has 32 pages. When you fold a piece of paper vertically, you get two pages on each fold. So, for 32 pages, you would need to fold the paper 5 times (because 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 equals 32).

Each fold gives you 2 pages, so for 5 folds, you would need 5 pieces of paper.

The final answer is 5 pieces of paper."
"Annika spent half of $50 on food and snacks, which is $50 / 2 = $25. After spending $25 on food and snacks, she had $50 - $25 = $25 left. She then spent an additional $10 on rides. So, she had $25 - $10 = $15 left.

The final amount left is $15."
"First, let's find out how many books Elise sold this year. We know she sold 45 books this year.

Since she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, she sold 45 * 2 = 90 books in the first year.

Now, let's find out how many books she sold in the second year. We know the total number of books is 250, and there are 50 unsold books. So, the number of books sold in the first two years is 250 - 50 = 200 books.

Since she sold 90 books in the first year and 45 books in the second year, the total number of books sold in the first two years is 90 + 45 = 135 books.

This means the number of books sold in the third year is 200 - 135 = 65 books.

Now, we know each book sells for $20. So, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 45 books * $20/book = $900.

The final numerical answer is $900."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, calculate how many hours Watson works in a week:
   - He works 10 hours a day.
   - He works 5 days a week.
   - So, 10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week.

2. Next, calculate how much he earns in a week:
   - He earns $10 per hour.
   - So, 50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week.

3. Since the company performed very well, he gets a $300 bonus each week.

4. Now, calculate his total earnings for a week:
   - His weekly earnings are $500.
   - Plus the $300 bonus.
   - So, $500 + $300 = $800/week.

5. Finally, calculate his total earnings for the month of April:

"First, let's find out how many loaves are sold in the morning. The bakery produces 60 loaves each day, and two-thirds of them are sold in the morning.

Two-thirds of 60 is calculated as:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \]

So, 40 loaves are sold in the morning.

Now, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales:
\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \]

Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. So, we need to find half of the 20 loaves:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \]

Therefore, 10 loaves are sold in the afternoon.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to find out how much weight Joey loses in one week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so we divide 8 pounds by 4 weeks to find out how much he loses in one week.

\[ \text{Weight Joey loses in one week} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Now, we know that Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in one week, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds.

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey does in a single week, we can use the information that Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds. Therefore, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds, which is the same amount of weight Joey loses in one week.

Now, if you buy 2 tubs of ice cream, the total savings would be:

$2 x 2 = $4

Next, let's find out how much you save on one packet of milk. The discount is $0.5, so the savings on one packet of milk is $0.5.

If you buy 4 packets of milk, the total savings would be:

$0.5 x 4 = $2

Now, to find the total savings for buying 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk, we add the savings from the ice cream and the milk:

"First, we need to find out how many extra arms the person will grow. The serum makes an extra arm every 3 days. So, we divide the total days by 3:

15 days ÷ 3 days/extra arm = 5 extra arms

Next, we need to find out how many extra legs the person will grow. The serum makes an extra leg every 5 days. So, we divide the total days by 5:

15 days ÷ 5 days/extra leg = 3 extra legs

Now, we add the extra arms and extra legs together to find the total number of new limbs:

5 extra arms + 3 extra legs = 8 new limbs

So, the final numerical answer is 8."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the business suits:
- Theo buys 6 business suits at $100 each.
- So, the total cost for the business suits is 6 * $100 = $600.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the suitcases:
- Theo buys 3 suitcases at $50 each.
- So, the total cost for the suitcases is 3 * $50 = $150.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket:
- The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit.
- The cost of one business suit is $100, so 5 times the cost of a business suit is 5 * $100 = $500.
- Therefore, the cost of the flight ticket is $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Cost of business suits: $600
- Cost of suitcases: $150
- Cost of flight ticket: $1200
- Total cost: $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.

Theo has $6000 to spend and wants to save $2000 for the trip. So, the amount he can spend on the trip is:
- Total money - Savings = $6000 - $2000 = $4000.

To find out how much he has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners, we subtract the total cost of the trip from the amount he can spend:
- Amount to spend on gifts = Total amount to spend - Total cost of trip = $4000 - $1950 = $2050.

So, Theo has to spend $2050 on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa."
"First, let's find out how many eggs the three people eat in a day. Each of these three people eats 3 eggs a day, so together they eat:
3 people * 3 eggs/person/day = 9 eggs/day

The rest of the family, which is 2 people (since there are 5 people in total and 3 are already accounted for), eat 2 eggs each day. So together they eat:
2 people * 2 eggs/person/day = 4 eggs/day

Now, let's add the eggs eaten by both groups to find out how many eggs the family eats in a day:
9 eggs/day (from the first group) + 4 eggs/day (from the second group) = 13 eggs/day

To find out how many eggs the family eats in a week, we multiply the daily total by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):
13 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 91 eggs/week

So, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week."
"First, we need to find out how old Jane is. Since Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, and Quinn is 30, we can calculate Jane's age as follows:

Jane's age = Quinn's age - 3
Jane's age = 30 - 3
Jane's age = 27

Now, we know that Trent is 5 years older than Jane. So, we can find Trent's age by adding 5 to Jane's age:

Trent's age = Jane's age + 5
Trent's age = 27 + 5
Trent's age = 32

So, the final numerical answer is 32."
"First, let's find out Noah's age six years ago. If Cera was 46 years old six years ago, then Noah was half that age, which is 23 years old.

Six years ago, Noah was 23 years old, so now he is 23 + 6 = 29 years old.

Six years ago, the population of Chile was half what it is now. If we let the current population of Chile be P, then six years ago the population was P/2.

We are also told that six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times the age of Noah. Since Noah was 23 years old six years ago, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 * 23.

So, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 * 23 = 69000.

Since this is half of the current population, we can find the current population by doubling 69000.

Therefore, the current population of Chile is 69000 * 2 = 138000.

The final numerical answer is 138000."
"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Let's say the number of players on the defense is D.
2. Then the number of players on the offense is 2D (twice as many as on the defense).
3. The number of players on the special teams is D/2 (half the number of players on the defense).

Now, if we add all these up, we get the total number of players:

D (defense) + 2D (offense) + D/2 (special teams) = 105

Combining like terms, we get:

3.5D = 105

To find D, we divide both sides by 3.5:

D = 105 / 3.5

D = 30

So, there are 30 players on the defense.

The final numerical answer is 30."
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\)
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\)

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we know that 8 people couldn't come due to illness. So, the number of people who couldn't come due to previous commitments is \(8 \div 4 = 2\).

Therefore, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Now, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited to find out how many people showed up for the party:

\(24 - 10 = 14\)

So, the final numerical answer is 14."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna.
2. The store already had 50 marbles.
3. Solomon's father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. So, Solomon's father gave him \( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \) marbles.
4. Now, let's calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has:
   - Marbles from Johanna: 20
   - Marbles from his father: 8
   - Marbles already in the store: 50
   - Total marbles: \( 20 + 8 + 50 = 78 \)
5. Each marble weighs 2 kgs, so the total weight of the marbles is \( 78 \times 2 = 156 \) kgs.

The final numerical answer is 156 kgs."
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The volume of a rectangular prism (which is what the pool is) is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and height (or depth in this case).

The pool's dimensions are:
- Length: 6 feet
- Width: 4 feet
- Depth: 5 feet

So, the volume is:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} \times 4 \text{ feet} \times 5 \text{ feet} = 120 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Now, we know it costs $0.1 per cubic foot to fill. To find the total cost, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot:
\[ 120 \text{ cubic feet} \times 0.1 \text{ dollars per cubic foot} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"First, let's find out how many girls are in the classroom. If there are 3 times as many girls as boys, and there are 30 boys, then the number of girls is:
\[ 30 \times 3 = 90 \]

Next, let's find out how many nongendered children there are. If there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, and there are 30 boys, then the number of nongendered children is:
\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{10} = 3 \]

Now, to find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children together:
\[ 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 \]

So, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"If the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and there are 45 electric wires, we can find out how many electric poles there are by understanding that for every 3 wires, there is 1 pole.

To find out how many poles there are, we divide the number of wires by 3:
\[ \text{Number of poles} = \frac{\text{Number of wires}}{3} = \frac{45}{3} = 15 \]

So, the total number of electric poles required is 15."
"First, let's find out how many people were at the party at the beginning. There were 25 men and 15 women, so the total number of people was:

25 men + 15 women = 40 people

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. So, 1/4 of 40 people left:

1/4 * 40 = 10 people left

This means that 10 people left the party. If 22 men stayed at the party, we can find out how many men left by subtracting the number of men who stayed from the total number of men:

25 men - 22 men = 3 men left

Since 10 people in total left and 3 of them were men, the remaining 7 people must have been women. So, the number of women left at the party is:

15 women - 7 women = 8 women

The final numerical answer is 8."
"First, we need to find out how much the magazine costs. Since the book costs $4 and the magazine costs half as much as the book, we can calculate the cost of the magazine as follows:

Cost of magazine = Cost of book / 2
Cost of magazine = $4 / 2
Cost of magazine = $2

Now, we know the pen costs $1 less than the magazine. So, we can calculate the cost of the pen as follows:

Cost of pen = Cost of magazine - $1
Cost of pen = $2 - $1
Cost of pen = $1

So, the pen costs $1."
"First, let's find out how many pencils Jam has in boxes. We know that Jam has 2 loose pencils and a total of 26 pencils. So, we subtract the loose pencils from the total to find out how many are in boxes:

26 total pencils - 2 loose pencils = 24 pencils in boxes

Now, we need to find out how many boxes Jam has. Since the question doesn't specify how many pencils are in each box, we can assume that each box has the same number of pencils. However, we don't need to know the exact number of pencils per box to solve the problem. We just need to know how many boxes are needed to store 24 pencils.

Since we don't have the exact number of pencils per box, let's assume each box can hold 1 pencil (the simplest case). This means Jam has 24 boxes.

Now, let's add the pencils Meg has to the pencils Jam has:

24 pencils (Jam's boxes) + 2 loose pencils (Jam) + 46 pencils (Meg) = 72 pencils

To find out how many boxes are needed to store 72 pencils, we need to know how many pencils each box can hold. Since we assumed each box holds 1 pencil, Jam and Meg need 72 boxes to store all their pencils.

So, the final numerical answer is:
72"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
2. Shannon wants to cool the coffee by 65 degrees.
3. She adds 15 milliliters of cream.

To find out how many milliliters weaker the coffee is after cooling by 65 degrees, we can divide the total cooling degrees by the cooling effect of one ice cube:

\[ \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \]

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so:

\[ \text{Total weakness due to ice cubes} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters} \]

Adding the cream does not weaken the coffee, so we do not need to add any additional weakness from the cream.

Therefore, the total weakness of the iced coffee is 60 milliliters.

The final numerical answer is:
60"
"If 5 people leave with 7 new records, and each person can get 1 new record for every 2 old records they bring, then we can calculate the total number of old records brought in by dividing the number of new records by 1 (since each new record is traded for 1 old record) and then by 2 (since 2 old records are needed for 1 new record).

So, we have:
\[ 7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records per new record} = 14 \text{ old records} \]

The final numerical answer is:
14"
"First, let's find out how many junior programmers there are. Since the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

Next, we know that each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. So, the total amount paid to junior programmers per month is:

\[ \text{Total for junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

Now, we need to find out how much each senior programmer is paid. Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, each senior programmer is paid:

\[ \text{Senior programmer's pay} = 2000 + 400 = 2400 \]

To find the number of senior programmers, we subtract the number of junior programmers from the total number of employees:

\[ \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Now, we calculate the total amount paid to senior programmers per month:

\[ \text{Total for senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

Finally, to find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we add the total amount paid to junior programmers and the total amount paid to senior programmers:

\[ \text{Total amount} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

So, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is:

\[ 224000 \]"
"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Let's say the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( x \).
2. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in. So now the number of people on the bus is \( x + 5 \).
3. At the second bus stop, 7 people got down (which means they left the bus), and 8 more people got in. So the number of people on the bus becomes \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).
4. Simplifying the expression for the number of people on the bus after the second stop gives us \( x + 5 - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).
5. We know that at the third stop, there were 20 people on the bus. So, \( x + 6 = 20 \).

Now, to find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]
Subtract 6 from both sides:
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

The final numerical answer is:
14"
"Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left. He passes 14 to his friends, so he has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Adding these to the 8 he had left, he now has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops. He eats 3 more that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops. In the morning, he eats 2 more, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

The final numerical answer is 31."
"First, we need to find out how much more the phone needs to be charged to reach 100%. Since the phone is already at 60%, it needs to be charged by 40% more.

The phone charges at a rate of 1% every 3 minutes. So, to charge 40%, it will take 40 times 3 minutes.

40% of 100% is 40, and 40 times 3 minutes is 120 minutes.

Now, we need to convert 120 minutes into hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

120 minutes ÷ 60 minutes/hour = 2 hours

So, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone."
"Erin originally has 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her 10 more, so she has 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops. Then she gives 3 to Ella, so she has 17 - 3 = 14 lollipops left."
"The customer spent $80 last time and got rewards. For every $20 spent, they get $1 off their next purchase. So for $80, they would get $8 off their next purchase because $80 divided by $20 equals 4, and 4 times $1 equals $8.

This time, they spent $43. They can use the $8 rewards they got from their last shopping trip. They also used a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. So the coupon took $8 * 2 = $16 off the price.

Now, subtract the rewards and the coupon from the total spent:
$43 - $8 - $16 = $19

So, the customer paid $19 on this shopping trip."
"First, let's calculate how much Nick will make at Job A.

Job A pays $15 an hour for 2000 hours a year.
So, the total pay for Job A is $15 * 2000 = $30,000 a year.

Now, we need to calculate the tax on Job A. The state has a 20% total tax rate.
So, the tax on Job A is $30,000 * 20% = $6,000.

Therefore, the net pay for Job A is $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000 a year.

Next, let's calculate how much Nick will make at Job B.

Job B pays $42,000 a year, but there is a $6,000 property tax.
So, the net income after property tax for Job B is $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000.

Now, we need to calculate the tax on Job B. The state has a 10% tax rate on net income after property tax.
So, the tax on Job B is $36,000 * 10% = $3,600.

Therefore, the net pay for Job B is $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400 a year.

Now, we need to find out how much more money Nick will make at the job with a higher net pay rate, compared to the other job.

The difference in net pay between Job B and Job A is $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

So, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with a higher net pay rate, compared to the other job."
"First, we need to find out how many castles are ruins. We know that 40 percent of the 220 castles are ruins. To find this, we calculate:

\( 220 \times 0.40 = 88 \)

So, there are 88 ruined castles.

Next, we need to find out how many of these ruined castles are unmanned. We know that half of the ruined castles are unmanned. So, we calculate:

\( 88 \times 0.50 = 44 \)

Therefore, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

The final numerical answer is 44."
"First, let's calculate the total cost for each offer.

For Furniture United:
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 installments of $350 each
- Total installments: 6 * $350 = $2,100
- Total cost for Furniture United: $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

For Cozy Homes:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 installments of $250 each
- Total installments: 9 * $250 = $2,250
- Total cost for Cozy Homes: $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

Now, let's find the difference between the two offers:
- Difference: $3,450 - $3,350 = $100

The cost difference between the two offers is $100."
"First, we need to find out how many paintball guns they have in total. We do this by adding the number of guns each person has:

DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, RJ has 1 gun, and Richard has 5 guns.

So, the total number of guns is:
8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24 guns

Now, we need to share these 24 guns equally among the 4 people. To find out how many guns each person would get, we divide the total number of guns by the number of people:

24 guns ÷ 4 people = 6 guns per person

So, each of them would have 6 guns."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how much sugar is needed for 8 batches of suckers. Since one batch of suckers needs 30 ounces of sugar, 8 batches will need:
   30 ounces/batch * 8 batches = 240 ounces

2. Next, we need to find out how much sugar is needed for 1 batch of fudge. One batch of fudge needs 70 ounces of sugar.

3. Now, we add the sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge together:
   240 ounces (for suckers) + 70 ounces (for fudge) = 310 ounces

So, Mason needs 310 ounces of sugar to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge."
"Maria initially buys 8 shares at $8 each, so the total cost is:
8 shares * $8/share = $64

After the first year, the stock price increases by 50%, so the new price is:
$8 + ($8 * 50%) = $8 + $4 = $12

Now, Maria has 8 shares at $12 each, so the total value is:
8 shares * $12/share = $96

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%, so the new price is:
$12 - ($12 * 25%) = $12 - $3 = $9

Now, Maria has 8 shares at $9 each, so the total value is:
8 shares * $9/share = $72

So, the final value of all Maria's shares is $72."
"Thomas ate 3 times more hot dogs than Luke, so Thomas ate 2 * 3 = 6 hot dogs.

John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so John ate 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.

To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number John ate: 3 - 2 = 1.

So, John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke. The final numerical answer is 1."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know there are 200 students in total.
2. The class is split into 3 groups: 2 groups are equal in number, and the last group is 10 students less than each of the other groups.
3. Let's say each of the equal groups has \(x\) students. So, the last group will have \(x - 10\) students.
4. The total number of students can be represented as the sum of the students in all three groups: \(x + x + (x - 10) = 200\).
5. Simplifying the equation: \(3x - 10 = 200\).
6. Adding 10 to both sides: \(3x = 210\).
7. Dividing by 3: \(x = 70\).
8. So, each of the equal groups has 70 students.
9. The smallest group, which is \(x - 10\), will have \(70 - 10 = 60\) students.

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's say Farmer Brown has 'C' cows.
2. Since he has twice as many chickens as cows, he has '2C' chickens.
3. The total number of animals is 60, so we can write the equation: C + 2C = 60.
4. Simplifying the equation, we get 3C = 60.
5. Solving for C, we find C = 60 / 3 = 20. So, Farmer Brown has 20 cows.
6. Since he has twice as many chickens as cows, he has 2 * 20 = 40 chickens.
7. Now, let's calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each.
8. So, the total number of legs from the cows is 20 * 4 = 80 legs.
9. And the total number of legs from the chickens is 40 * 2 = 80 legs.
10. Adding these together, the total number of legs is 80 + 80 = 160 legs.

The final numerical answer is 160."
"Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week. So after 4 weeks, he would have added 4 balls (1 ball per week for 4 weeks). That means he would have 3 original balls + 4 added balls = 7 balls.

But when he starts juggling on stage, he drops 3 balls. So he has 7 - 3 = 4 balls left to juggle."
"First, let's find out the weight of each animal based on the information given:

1. Pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. A blue beetle weighs the same as a pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
3. A green toad weighs the same as a pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
4. A yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than a pink frog, so it weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
5. A red bird weighs 20 pounds less than a pink frog, so it weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add up the weights of one of each animal:
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds

Total weight of the animals = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 240 pounds.

The container itself weighs 20 pounds, so the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is:
240 + 20 = 260 pounds.

The final numerical answer is 260 pounds."

"First, we need to find out how many meters Tyson runs if he follows his coach's advice. The coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters than he currently runs. Since Tyson runs 5000 meters every day, we calculate 1/5 of 5000 meters:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 5000 = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

So, if Tyson follows the coach's advice, he will run:

\[ 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days are in June. June has 30 days. If Tyson runs 6000 meters every day for 30 days, the total distance he covers in June is:

\[ 6000 \times 30 = 180000 \text{ meters} \]

So, the total distance Tyson covered in June is 180000 meters."
"First, let's find out how much Juice Box B and Juice Box C cost.

Juice Box A costs 4 dollars.

Juice Box B costs 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, so:
Juice Box B = Juice Box A + 5 = 4 + 5 = 9 dollars.

Juice Box C costs 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, so:
Juice Box C = Juice Box A + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11 dollars.

Now, to find out how much more Juice Box C costs than Juice Box B, we subtract the cost of Juice Box B from the cost of Juice Box C:
Difference = Juice Box C - Juice Box B = 11 - 9 = 2 dollars.

So, Juice Box C is 2 dollars more than Juice Box B."

40 tables * 4 legs/table = 160 legs

Now, let's calculate the number of legs for the tables with 3 legs:
50 tables * 3 legs/table = 150 legs

Now, let's add the two totals together to get the total number of legs:
160 legs + 150 legs = 310 legs

So, the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is 310."
"First, let's find out how many cookies Jenny puts in her son's lunch box in a week. She puts 4 cookies in his lunch box 5 days a week, so:

4 cookies/day * 5 days/week = 20 cookies/week

Next, let's find out how many cookies Jenny's husband eats in a week. He eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so:

1 cookie/day * 7 days/week = 7 cookies/week

Now, let's find out how many cookies Jenny has in total in a week. She buys 1 bag of cookies a week with 36 cookies, so:

36 cookies - 20 cookies (for her son) - 7 cookies (for her husband) = 19 cookies

So, Jenny eats 19 cookies a week."
"First, let's find out the total cost of the 2 shirts without any discount. Since each shirt costs $30, the total cost for 2 shirts is:
\[ 30 \times 2 = 60 \]

Now, let's calculate the discount. A 40% discount means Davos only pays 60% of the original price. To find out how much he pays, we calculate 60% of $60:
\[ 60 \times 0.60 = 36 \]

So, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts."
"First, let's calculate how much they made per day when they made tractors:
- They sold 10 tractors a day.
- They made $100 per tractor.

So, the total money they made per day when making tractors was:
\[ 10 \text{ tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

Now, let's calculate how much they make per day now that they make silos:
- They sell 5 silos a day.
- They make $220 per silo.

So, the total money they make per day now is:
\[ 5 \text{ silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day} \]

To find out what percentage more they are making now, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New amount} - \text{Old amount}}{\text{Old amount}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\$1100 - \$1000}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{\$100}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, they are making 10% more per day now."
"To find out how much money Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to calculate the monthly cost first and then multiply it by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year).

First, let's calculate the monthly cost:
- Food costs $25 per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the cost of food per month is $25 * 4 = $100.
- Treats cost $20 per month.
- Medicine costs $100 per month.

So, the total monthly cost is $100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $120 per month.

Now, to find the yearly cost, we multiply the monthly cost by 12:
- Yearly cost = $120 * 12 = $1440.

So, Madeline spends $1440 on her dog per year."
"First, let's find out how long each activity is:

- Monday's yoga class is 1 hour.
- Tuesday's cooking class is 3 times as long as Monday's yoga, so it's 3 * 1 = 3 hours.
- Wednesday's cheese-tasting event is 0.5 hours.
- Thursday's museum tour is half as long as Tuesday's cooking class, so it's 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours.
- Friday's errands are 2 hours.

Now, let's add up all the hours:

1 (Monday) + 3 (Tuesday) + 0.5 (Wednesday) + 1.5 (Thursday) + 2 (Friday) = 7.5 hours

So, the total number of hours for all Peyton's after-work activities is 7.5 hours."
"First, let's find out how many plant pots April needs for the roses. Since she needs twice as many for the roses as for the daisies, and she needs 30 plant pots for the daisies, we calculate:

2 * 30 = 60 plant pots for the roses.

Now, let's add the plant pots needed for the daisies and the roses:

30 (for daisies) + 60 (for roses) = 90 plant pots in total needed.

April had already bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many she has left over, we subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number she already bought:

100 (bought) - 90 (needed) = 10 plant pots left over.

So, the final numerical answer is 10."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Andrea started with $36.
2. She spent some money on a sweater that cost $11.
3. She also gave her brother $4.

So, the total amount spent or given away is $11 (sweater) + $4 (brother) = $15.

To find out how much she saved, we subtract the total spent or given away from the amount she started with:

$36 (starting amount) - $15 (spent/given away) = $21.

So, Andrea saved $21.

The final numerical answer is:
21"
"First, let's calculate the time John spent on each activity:

1. Boating: 6 hours
2. Swimming: Half the time he spent boating, so 6 / 2 = 3 hours

Now, let's calculate the time he spent watching shows:
- He watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so 3 * 2 = 6 hours

Adding up the time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows:
6 (boating) + 3 (swimming) + 6 (watching shows) = 15 hours

This 15 hours is 30% of the total time he spent on his vacation. To find the total time, we can set up the equation:
15 hours = 30% of total time
Let's call the total time ""T"". So, 15 = 0.30 * T
To find T, we divide both sides by 0.30:
T = 15 / 0.30 = 50 hours

Now, we know that sightseeing took up 40% of his total time. To find the time spent sightseeing, we calculate 40% of 50 hours:
Time spent sightseeing = 40% of 50 hours = 0.40 * 50 = 20 hours

So, John spent 20 hours sightseeing."
"First, let's calculate how much money Annabelle earns from her first job. She works 20 hours at $10 per hour, so:

20 hours * $10/hour = $200

Next, let's calculate how much money she earns from her second job. She works 15 hours at $5 per hour, so:

15 hours * $5/hour = $75

Now, let's add the money she earns from both jobs:

$200 (from first job) + $75 (from second job) = $275

Annabelle already has $80 in her savings. So, let's add that to the money she earned:

$80 (already saved) + $275 (from jobs) = $355

The phone costs $400, so to find out how much more money Annabelle needs, we subtract the total amount she has from the cost of the phone:

$400 (cost of phone) - $355 (total amount she has) = $45

So, Annabelle still needs $45 to save for the phone."
"First, let's find the height of the second tree. The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, which is 6 feet tall. So, the second tree is:
6 + 5 = 11 feet tall.

Now, let's find the combined height of the shortest and the second tree:
6 + 11 = 17 feet.

The tallest tree is twice the height of these two trees combined. So, the height of the tallest tree is:
2 * 17 = 34 feet.

The final numerical answer is 34 feet."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the toy cars. Dean bought 6 toy cars and each one costs $2. So, the total cost for the toy cars is:
6 * 2 = 12 dollars

Next, let's calculate the cost of the teddy bears. Dean bought 5 teddy bears and each one costs $1. So, the total cost for the teddy bears is:
5 * 1 = 5 dollars

Now, let's add the cost of the toy cars and the teddy bears to find out how much Dean spent in total:
12 + 5 = 17 dollars

Dean's mother gave him $28 initially, so after spending $17, Dean has:
28 - 17 = 11 dollars

Then, Dean's mother gives him an extra $10. So, Dean's total money now is:
11 + 10 = 21 dollars

The final numerical answer is 21 dollars."
"First, let's calculate the total cost for Morgan and her friends to play mini-golf and ride the go-karts.

- Cost for one round of mini-golf: $5
- Cost for one go-kart ride: $10
- Number of go-kart rides: 2

So, the cost for one round of mini-golf and two go-kart rides is:
$5 (mini-golf) + 2 * $10 (go-karts) = $5 + $20 = $25

Now, we subtract this cost from the total budget to find out how much money is left for arcade tokens and snacks:
$90 (total budget) - $25 (mini-golf and go-karts) = $65

Morgan wants to have $5 in arcade tokens. So, we subtract this amount from the remaining budget:
$65 (remaining after mini-golf and go-karts) - $5 (arcade tokens) = $60

The remaining $60 can be used for snacks and other expenses. Since the question only asks how many friends she can invite, and we don't have information about the cost of snacks or other expenses, we can assume that the $60 is enough for snacks and other expenses.

Since the question doesn't specify how much each person needs for snacks or other expenses, we can assume that the $60 is enough for all the people, including Morgan, to have enough for snacks and other expenses. Therefore, the number of friends she can invite is the total budget minus 1 (for Morgan herself).

So, the number of friends she can invite is:
$60 (remaining budget) / $10 (cost per person for snacks and other expenses) = 6

Therefore, Morgan can invite 6 friends to her birthday party."
"First, let's calculate how much Marisa spends on lollipops each day.

She buys 4 lollipops each day, and each lollipop costs 25 cents. So, the cost for 4 lollipops is:
\[ 4 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 100 \text{ cents} \]

Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar, Marisa spends $1 on lollipops each day.

Now, let's find out how much money Marisa has after buying the lollipops each day. She gets $5 as pocket money every day, so her savings after buying the lollipops is:
\[ 5 \text{ dollars} - 1 \text{ dollar} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Marisa saves this $4 in her piggy bank every day. Over 5 days, her total savings in the piggy bank will be:
\[ 4 \text{ dollars/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"
"First, let's find out how much money Billy spent on gumballs. If he bought 40 gumballs at $.05 each, we calculate:

40 gumballs * $.05/gumball = $2.00

Billy started with $10 and spent $2.00 on gumballs, so the change he has is:

$10.00 - $2.00 = $8.00

This $8.00 is the amount he had left after buying candy. Since each pound of candy costs $1.5, we can find out how many pounds of candy he bought by dividing the amount he had left by the cost per pound:

$8.00 / $1.5/pound = 5.3333 pounds

So, Billy bought approximately 5.33 pounds of candy."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Carver's age is 45 years.
2. Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. We can write this as an equation: 45 = 2 * (son's age) - 5.

Now, let's solve for the son's age:

1. Add 5 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with the son's age: 45 + 5 = 2 * (son's age).
2. This simplifies to: 50 = 2 * (son's age).
3. Now, divide both sides by 2 to find the son's age: 50 ÷ 2 = son's age.
4. This gives us: 25 = son's age.

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

The final numerical answer is 25."
"First, let's find out the total distance the train travels in one trip.

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs, so it's 75 + 100 - 50 = 125 miles.

So, the total distance for one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

The train does this trip 3 times a day, so the total distance for one day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance the train travels in a day by the distance it needs service.

So, 900 miles / 18,000 miles = 0.05 days.

The train goes between services every 0.05 days."
"First, let's find out how much stuffing a collie bed needs. A collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler and a chihuahua bed. A Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds and a chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds. So, the average is:

\[ \text{Average stuffing} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we know:
- A chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing.
- A collie bed takes 5 pounds of stuffing.

Mark needs to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds. So, the total stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds is:

\[ 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds} \]

And the total stuffing needed for the collie beds is:

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding these together gives the total stuffing needed:

\[ 8 + 15 = 23 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 23 pounds."
"First, we need to calculate the time John spent driving to his friend's house. He drove 200 miles at a speed of 70 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip is calculated as:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{200 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} \]

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{200}{70} \text{ hours} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 2.857 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the time John spent on the detour. The detour added 10 miles to his trip, so the total distance for the detour is:

\[ 200 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 210 \text{ miles} \]

The time taken for the detour is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the time John spent driving home. He drove 240 miles at a speed of 80 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we add up all the times to get the total trip time:

\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} \]

\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{20}{7} + 6 \text{ hours} \]

To add these, we convert 6 hours to a fraction with a denominator of 7:

\[ 6 \text{ hours} = \frac{42}{7} \text{ hours} \]

\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{20}{7} + \frac{42}{7} = \frac{62}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 8.857 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total trip time is:

\[ \frac{62}{7} \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 8.857 \text{ hours} \]"
"First, we need to find out how many fourth-grade boys there are at Small Tree School. We know there are 96 fourth-graders in total and 43 of them are girls. So, the number of boys is:

96 total students - 43 girls = 53 boys

Next, we need to find out how many boys were absent on Friday. We know that 4 boys were absent. So, the number of boys who were at school on Friday is:

53 boys - 4 absent boys = 49 boys

So, the final numerical answer is 49."
"If there are 6 girls in the park and there are twice the number of boys, then there are 6 * 2 = 12 boys in the park.

To find the total number of kids in the park, we add the number of girls and boys together: 6 girls + 12 boys = 18 kids.

So, the final numerical answer is 18."
"To find the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test, we need to add the points she has already scored and see how many more she needs to reach 42 points.

Jane's scores so far are:
First test: 15 points
Second test: 18 points

Total points so far: 15 + 18 = 33 points

To find out how many points she needs on the third test, we subtract the points she has already scored from the total points required:

42 (total required) - 33 (points already scored) = 9 points

So, the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass is 9 points."
"First, let's break down the information given:

- 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
- A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting.
- Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.
- A total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart.

Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as \( C \). So, \( C = 3 \).

The number of shoplifters, \( S \), is four times the number of customers minus 5. So, \( S = 4C - 5 \).

The number of people kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale, \( V \), is three times the number of shoplifters. So, \( V = 3S \).

The total number of people kicked out is the sum of those for each reason, which is 50. So, \( C + S + V = 50 \).

Now, let's calculate the values step by step:

1. Calculate \( S \):
\[ S = 4C - 5 = 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]

2. Calculate \( V \):
\[ V = 3S = 3(7) = 21 \]

3. Now, calculate the total number of people kicked out for each reason:
\[ C + S + V = 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 \]

4. The number of people kicked out for other reasons is the total minus those for each reason:
\[ 50 - 31 = 19 \]

So, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is 19."
"First, let's find out how many points Erin has now. Since Sara scored 8 points and Erin has three times more points than Sara, we can calculate Erin's points as follows:

Erin's points now = 3 * Sara's points
Erin's points now = 3 * 8
Erin's points now = 24

Now, we know Erin scored 14 points after this, but we need to find out how many points she had before. Since she scored 14 points and we know she had 24 points after scoring, it means she gained 10 points. So, the number of points Erin had before is:

Erin's points before = Erin's points now - Points gained
Erin's points before = 24 - 14
Erin's points before = 10

So, the final numerical answer is 10."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. Each frame costs $20 and there are 44 seniors, so we need 44 frames. The cost for the frames is:
\[ 44 \times 20 = 880 \]

Next, we need to add the additional 20% cost for etching the logo on each frame. The additional cost per frame is:
\[ 20 \times 0.20 = 4 \]
So, the total cost for each frame including the additional etching is:
\[ 20 + 4 = 24 \]
Therefore, the total cost for all 44 frames is:
\[ 44 \times 24 = 1056 \]

Now, we need to add the cost of the pins for 2 seniors. Each pin costs $5, so the total cost for the pins is:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the cords for the officers. There are 44 seniors and 1/4 of them are officers, so the number of officers is:
\[ \frac{44}{4} = 11 \]
Each cord costs $12, so the total cost for the cords is:
\[ 11 \times 12 = 132 \]

Now, we add up all the costs:
\[ 1056 + 10 + 132 = 1198 \]

So, the total amount spent on the senior gifts is:
\[ 1198 \]"
"First, we need to find out how much the DIY materials cost. Since the DIY saves 20% on the market price, we can calculate the cost of the DIY materials by subtracting 20% of the market price from the market price.

The market price is $400. So, 20% of $400 is calculated as follows:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 400 = \frac{20}{100} \times 400 = 0.20 \times 400 = 80 \]

Now, subtract this amount from the market price to find the DIY materials cost:
\[ 400 - 80 = 320 \]

So, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.
2. On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday. So, they sold \(14 \times 2 = 28\) pairs.
3. On Sunday, they sold one-half the number of shoes sold on Saturday. So, they sold \(28 \div 2 = 14\) pairs.
4. Six pairs of shoes were returned, so we need to subtract these from the total sold.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pairs sold before considering the returns:
\[ 14 \text{ (Friday)} + 28 \text{ (Saturday)} + 14 \text{ (Sunday)} = 56 \text{ pairs} \]

Since 6 pairs were returned, we subtract these from the total:
\[ 56 - 6 = 50 \]

So, the final number of pairs of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale is 50."
"Hallie had dance practice for 1 hour on Tuesday and 2 hours on Thursday. So, that's 1 + 2 = 3 hours a day for Tuesday and Thursday. On Saturdays, she had practice that lasted twice as long as Tuesday's, so that's 1 * 2 = 2 hours. To find out how many hours a week she had dance practice, we add the hours from Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday together. So, 3 + 3 + 2 = 8 hours a week."
"First, let's find out how many pieces of equipment were faulty. If 40% of the total number of pieces were faulty, then 60% of the total number of pieces were functioning because 100% - 40% = 60%.

The total number of pieces of equipment is $400000 worth, but we don't know how many pieces there are. However, we can calculate the value of the functioning pieces based on the percentage.

The value of the functioning pieces is 60% of $400000.

To find 60% of $400000, we can do the following calculation:

\[ 60\% \times 400000 = 0.60 \times 400000 = 240000 \]

So, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $240000."
"Mary has 30 sheep. Half of them is 30 / 2 = 15 sheep.

From 15 sheep, she gets 1 kg of milk each, so 15 sheep * 1 kg/sheep = 15 kg of milk.

From the other 15 sheep, she gets 2 kg of milk each, so 15 sheep * 2 kg/sheep = 30 kg of milk.

In total, she gets 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg of milk every day.

The final numerical answer is 45."
"Mrs. Sherman made a dozen bread rolls, which is 12 rolls. She gave one roll to each of her 6 children, so she gave away 6 rolls. That leaves her with 12 - 6 = 6 rolls. She then broke each of the remaining 6 rolls into 8 pieces. So, the total number of pieces she fed to the chickens is 6 rolls * 8 pieces per roll = 48 pieces."
"First, we need to find out how many pupils like blue. Since half of the class likes blue, we calculate:

40 pupils / 2 = 20 pupils like blue.

Now, we subtract the number of pupils who like blue from the total number of pupils to find out how many are left:

40 pupils - 20 pupils = 20 pupils are left.

One-fourth of these remaining pupils like green, so we calculate:

20 pupils / 4 = 5 pupils like green.

The rest of the pupils like yellow. To find out how many like yellow, we subtract the number of pupils who like green from the remaining pupils:

20 pupils - 5 pupils = 15 pupils like yellow.

So, the final numerical answer is 15."
"First, we need to find out how many apples Lucy sold on Monday. We know that she sold all the apples she picked on Monday and got $56 from selling them at $4 per piece.

To find out how many apples she sold on Monday, we divide the total money she got by the price per apple:
\[ \text{Number of apples sold on Monday} = \frac{\$56}{\$4/\text{apple}} = 14 \text{ apples} \]

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples. On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday, which means:
\[ \text{Number of apples picked on Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ apples} \]

Now, to find out the total number of apples picked over the three days, we add the apples picked on each day:
\[ \text{Total apples} = 14 \text{ (Monday)} + 12 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 24 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 50 \text{ apples} \]

So, the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days is 50."
"First, let's find out how many socks Lindsay has washed.

A pair of socks consists of 2 socks. So, if Lindsay washes 10 pairs, she washes:
10 pairs * 2 socks/pair = 20 socks

She also has 15 loose socks.

So, the total number of socks she has washed is:
20 socks + 15 socks = 35 socks

Lindsay started with 50 socks. To find out how many socks she has missed, we subtract the number of socks she has washed from the total number of socks:
50 socks - 35 socks = 15 socks

So, Lindsay has missed 15 socks."
"Rachel originally had 23 cookies and Janet gave her 42 more, so she had a total of:
23 + 42 = 65 cookies.

Her brother ate 44 cookies, so the number of cookies left is:
65 - 44 = 21 cookies.

The final answer is 21."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the total amount Karan has to pay back including the interest. The formula to calculate the total amount is:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + (\text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}) \]

Here, the principal is $3,650, the rate is 10% (or 0.10 as a decimal), and the time is 5 months. Since the interest rate is given as an annual rate, we need to adjust it for the time period. However, for simplicity, we can use the annual rate directly in our calculation.

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + (3650 \times 0.10 \times 5) \]

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + (3650 \times 0.50) \]

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 1825 \]

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 5475 \]

Now, Karan has to pay this total amount back over 5 months. So, we divide the total amount by 5 to find out how much she has to pay each month.

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{5475}{5} \]

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 1095 \]

So, Karan has to pay $1095 per month."
"First, we need to calculate how far Cho hiked. Cho hiked at a speed of 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, we calculate how far Chloe hiked. Chloe hiked at a speed of 9 kilometers per hour for 5 hours. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

Now, to find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked, we subtract the distance Chloe hiked from the distance Cho hiked:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

So, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe."
"First, let's find out how many silver and gold pesos Anna has.

Axel has 50 silver pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Axel has 80 gold pesos. Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so:
\[ 80 + 40 = 120 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Now, let's add up all the pesos they have together.

Axel's total:
\[ 50 \text{ silver pesos} + 80 \text{ gold pesos} = 130 \text{ pesos} \]

Anna's total:
\[ 100 \text{ silver pesos} + 120 \text{ gold pesos} = 220 \text{ pesos} \]

Adding Axel's and Anna's totals together:
\[ 130 + 220 = 350 \text{ pesos} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 350 \]"

She can make 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher holds 12 cups.
So, the total number of cups of lemonade she can make is:
3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups

Next, we need to find out how much money she makes by selling all the lemonade.

She sells each cup for $1, so for 36 cups, she makes:
36 cups * $1/cup = $36

Now, we need to find out how long her lemonade stand is open to sell all 36 cups.

She sells an average of 4 cups per hour, so to sell all 36 cups, it will take:
36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours

Finally, we calculate her profit per hour.

She makes $36 in total and it takes her 9 hours to sell all the lemonade, so her profit per hour is:
$36 / 9 hours = $4/hour

So, the final numerical answer is $4/hour."
"To solve this, let's think about it step by step.

If Mr. Ruther has 12.8 hectares left after selling 3/5 of his land, that means he has 2/5 of his land left because 1 - 3/5 = 2/5.

Now, if 2/5 of his land is equal to 12.8 hectares, we can find out how much 1/5 of his land is by dividing 12.8 hectares by 2.

12.8 ÷ 2 = 6.4 hectares

This means 1/5 of his land is 6.4 hectares. To find out how much 5/5 (which is the whole) of his land is, we multiply 6.4 hectares by 5.

6.4 × 5 = 32 hectares

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first."
"First, let's find out how many boys and girls are in the choir.

Since 50% of the choir are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:
- Total members = 52
- Percentage of girls = 50%
- Number of girls = 52 * 50% = 52 * 0.5 = 26

Since the choir decides to perform with just its female members, we have 26 girls performing.

On the day of the performance, half the people performing can't make it because their bus breaks down. So, half of the 26 girls can't make it:
- Half of 26 = 26 / 2 = 13

This means 13 girls can't make it, so the number of girls who do make it is:
- 26 - 13 = 13

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them. So, we add the 3 teachers to the 13 girls who made it:
- 13 girls + 3 teachers = 16

Therefore, the number of people who sang in the performance is 16."
"To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to add up all his test scores and then divide by the number of tests.

His test scores are: 65, 94, 81, 86, and 74.

First, let's add them up:
65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 = 300

Now, we divide the total by the number of tests, which is 5:
300 ÷ 5 = 60

So, Wilson's current math grade is 60.

The final numerical answer is:
60"
"First, we need to find the cost of 6 erasers. Since one eraser costs $2, 6 erasers will cost:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of 8 pencils. Since one pencil costs $3, 8 pencils will cost:
\[ 8 \times 3 = 24 \]

Now, we add the cost of the erasers and the pencils together to find the total cost:
\[ 12 + 24 = 36 \]

So, the total cost for 6 erasers and 8 pencils is $36."
"First, we need to find out how many messages Mr. Yu received. Since Mr. Yu received 1/3 as many messages as Ms. Thompson, we calculate:

\[ \text{Messages to Mr. Yu} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \]

Now, to find the total number of messages delivered, we add the messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu together:

\[ \text{Total messages} = 66 + 22 = 88 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 88."
"First, let's calculate how much money David spends. David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides. So, David spends $30.

Now, let's calculate how much money Dasha spends. Dasha buys tickets. Each ride costs 2 tickets, and she needs 9 rides. So, she needs 9 rides * 2 tickets/ride = 18 tickets. Since each ticket costs $2, she spends 18 tickets * $2/ticket = $36.

Now, let's find out how much money they save together. Dasha spends $36 and David spends $30. So, they spend a total of $36 + $30 = $66.

If they were to buy the ride bracelet for both of them, they would only need to pay $30 for the bracelet, which would give them 9 rides. So, they would spend $30 in total.

To find out how much money they save, we subtract the total cost if they both bought the ride bracelet from the total cost if they bought the tickets. So, they save $66 - $30 = $36.

The final numerical answer is $36."
"Monica has a total of 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 gifts to wrap.

She has 144 inches of ribbon to wrap all the gifts.

To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow, we divide the total inches of ribbon by the number of gifts.

So, 144 inches ÷ 12 gifts = 12 inches per gift.

The final answer is 12 inches."
"To solve this, let's first understand the ratio and the total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. Together, they have 165 popsicles.

First, we need to find out how many parts the total number of popsicles represents. Since the ratio is 5:6, the total parts are 5 + 6 = 11 parts.

Now, we can find out how many popsicles each part represents by dividing the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:
\[ \text{Popsicles per part} = \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now we can find out how many popsicles Betty and Sam have individually:
- Betty has \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \) popsicles.
- Sam has \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ \text{Difference} = 90 - 75 = 15 \]

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty."
"First, let's find out the total cost of the streaming services Tim will get.

Netflix costs $10 a month.

Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 each, but he gets a 20% discount for bundling. So, the discount for each is:
\[ 10 \times 0.20 = 2 \]
So, the cost for each after the discount is:
\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \]
Since he gets both Hulu and Disney Plus, the total cost for both is:
\[ 8 + 8 = 16 \]

Now, let's add the cost of Netflix and the discounted cost of Hulu and Disney Plus:
\[ 10 + 16 = 26 \]

Tim used to have a cable package that cost $60 a month. Now, he is paying $26 a month for streaming services. To find out how much money he saves, we subtract the new cost from the old cost:
\[ 60 - 26 = 34 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 34 \]"
"First, we need to find out how much time Carol spent on each part of her work.

She spent 4 hours writing a song.
She spent half that time recording, so she spent 4 / 2 = 2 hours recording.
She spent 90 minutes editing, which is 90 / 60 = 1.5 hours.

Now, we add up all the time she spent:
4 hours (writing) + 2 hours (recording) + 1.5 hours (editing) = 7.5 hours.

To find out what percentage of her total work time she spent editing, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100 \]

So,
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1.5}{7.5} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{5} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = 20\% \]

The final numerical answer is 20%."
"First, let's find out how many spaces there are in the shelving system.

The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns, so the total number of spaces is:
6 rows * 6 columns = 36 spaces

Now, Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in these spaces.

To find out double the number of spaces, we multiply the total number of spaces by 2:
36 spaces * 2 = 72

Now, to find out 20 more than this number:
72 + 20 = 92

So, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task."
"Erica made 20 cards.
Her dad brought her 2 boxes with 15 cards each, so that's 2 * 15 = 30 cards.
She passed out 24 cards to her classmates.
She gave 5 cards to her family.
She received 17 cards from family and friends.

Now let's add all the cards together:
20 (Erica's) + 30 (from dad) - 24 (passed out) - 5 (given to family) + 17 (received) = 48 cards.

So, Erica now has 48 Valentine's cards."
"First, let's find out how many slices Jenny gives to Bill and Mark.

Bill gets 1/3 of the pizza. Since the pizza has 12 slices, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ slices} \]

Mark gets 1/4 of the pizza. So we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's add the slices given to Bill and Mark:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny eats 2 slices. So, we subtract the slices given to Bill, Mark, and the slices Jenny eats from the total number of slices:
\[ 12 - 7 - 2 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

So, the number of slices left is:
\[ 3 \]"
"Mark already has $50 in his bank account. He needs $300 for the bike. So, he needs $300 - $50 = $250 more.

He earns $10 per day. To find out how many days he needs to save $250, we divide $250 by $10.

$250 ÷ $10 = 25 days

So, Mark has to save for 25 days."
"First, let's find out how many millipedes Nancy saw. Since she saw 1/3 as many millipedes as spiders, and she saw 90 spiders, we calculate:

Millipedes = 1/3 * 90 = 30

Next, we find out how many stink bugs she saw. The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12:

Stink bugs = 2 * 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48

Now, we add up all the bugs she saw:

Total bugs = Spiders + Millipedes + Stink bugs
Total bugs = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168

So, the total number of bugs Nancy counted is 168."
"If Erica is 30 years old, and Beth is 5 years older than Erica, then Beth is:
30 + 5 = 35 years old.

Since Alice is 7 years older than Beth, then Alice is:
35 + 7 = 42 years old.

The difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is:
42 - 30 = 12 years.

So, the final numerical answer is 12."
"First, we need to find out how many ounces of milk John drinks in total. Since each glass is 8 ounces and he drinks 2 glasses, we multiply 8 by 2:

8 ounces/glass * 2 glasses = 16 ounces

Next, we need to find out how many calories are in 16 ounces of milk. Since there are 3 calories in each ounce, we multiply 16 ounces by 3 calories/ounce:

16 ounces * 3 calories/ounce = 48 calories

So, the final numerical answer is 48 calories."
"First, let's calculate how many days the builder works in a month:

He works 6 days a week and there are 4 weeks in a month, so:
6 days/week * 4 weeks/month = 24 days/month

Now, let's calculate how many days he works in a year:

There are 12 months in a year, so:
24 days/month * 12 months/year = 288 days/year

Now, let's calculate his total earnings for the year:

He gets paid $50 every day, so:
288 days/year * $50/day = $14400/year

So, the final numerical answer is $14400."
"First, we need to find out how much flour and milk Mark needs for a quadruple batch of brownies.

For a normal batch:
- Flour: 3 cups
- Milk: 1 cup

For a quadruple batch:
- Flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
- Milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Now, we need to find out how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy.

Flour is sold in 2-cup bags:
- 12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles:
- 4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy:
- 6 bags - 2 bottles = 4 more bags

So, the final numerical answer is 4."
"First, let's find out how much energy the air conditioner uses in one hour. It uses 900 watts of energy.

To find out how much energy it uses in one day, we multiply the energy used in one hour by the number of hours it runs each day:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours/day} = 7200 \, \text{watt-hours/day} \]

Now, if Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, the new daily usage time is:
\[ 8 \, \text{hours/day} - 5 \, \text{hours/day} = 3 \, \text{hours/day} \]

So, the new daily energy usage is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours/day} = 2700 \, \text{watt-hours/day} \]

To find out how much energy he saves in one day, we subtract the new daily usage from the original daily usage:
\[ 7200 \, \text{watt-hours/day} - 2700 \, \text{watt-hours/day} = 4500 \, \text{watt-hours/day} \]

To find out how much energy he saves in 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:
\[ 4500 \, \text{watt-hours/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135000 \, \text{watt-hours} \]

Since 1 kilowatt-hour is equal to 1000 watt-hours, we convert the total watt-hours to kilowatt-hours:
\[ 135000 \, \text{watt-hours} \div 1000 = 135 \, \text{kilowatt-hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 135 \, \text{kilowatt-hours} \]"
"First, let's find out the total number of stripes Jane counted.

Jane counted:
- Two zebras with 17 stripes each: \(2 \times 17 = 34\) stripes
- One zebra with 36 stripes: \(36\) stripes
- One zebra with half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes: \(36 \div 2 = 18\) stripes

Now, let's add all the stripes together:
- Total stripes = \(34 + 36 + 18 = 88\) stripes

To find the average number of stripes, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras:
- Number of zebras = \(2 + 1 + 1 = 4\)
- Average stripes = \(88 \div 4 = 22\)

So, the final numerical answer is:
22"
"First, we need to find out how many sandwiches Tyson needs to make. Since each sandwich serves 4 people and there are 20 people, we divide 20 by 4 to find the number of sandwiches:

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. So, for 5 sandwiches, Tyson will need:

5 sandwiches * 1 pound of meat per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat
5 sandwiches * 1 pound of cheese per sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese

Now, we calculate the cost for the meat and cheese:

The meat costs $7.00 per pound, so for 5 pounds:
5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00

The cheese costs $3.00 per pound, so for 5 pounds:
5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese:

$35.00 (meat) + $15.00 (cheese) = $50.00

So, Tyson would spend $50.00 on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people."
"First, let's find out how many corns Allan has initially. We know that he has twice as much corn as cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, the number of corns he has is:

\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ corns} \]

Next, Allan bought 60 more cannolis. So, the new total number of cannolis is:

\[ 40 + 60 = 100 \text{ cannolis} \]

Now, Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought. Since he bought 60 more cannolis, he bought:

\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ corns} \]

So, the new total number of corns is:

\[ 80 + 20 = 100 \text{ corns} \]

Now, to find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis, we add the new totals together:

\[ 100 \text{ corns} + 100 \text{ cannolis} = 200 \]

So, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:

\[ 200 \]"
"Elliott finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which means he walked 5,000 steps there and 5,000 steps back. He also did another 1,000 steps with his friend. So, before his jog, he had taken 5,000 + 5,000 + 1,000 = 11,000 steps.

He had 2,000 steps left to take, so the number of steps he took during his jog is 11,000 - 2,000 = 9,000 steps."
"First, we need to find out how many words are in the book. The book is 45 pages long and has 200 words per page, so:

45 pages * 200 words/page = 9000 words

Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute, so to read 9000 words, it will take:

9000 words / 300 words/minute = 30 minutes

Toby plans to leave the airport in 60 minutes and it takes 10 minutes to get there, so he needs to start reading 50 minutes before he leaves:

60 minutes - 10 minutes = 50 minutes

Since it will take Toby 30 minutes to read the book, he will finish reading 30 minutes before he needs to leave:

50 minutes - 30 minutes = 20 minutes

So, Toby will be 20 minutes early."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money the company paid in May.

Carolyn hired 40 employees in May, and each worked 40 hours at $15 per hour.

So, the total amount paid in May is:
\[ 40 \text{ employees} \times 40 \text{ hours/employee} \times \$15/\text{hour} \]

Now, let's calculate that:
\[ 40 \times 40 \times 15 = 2400 \times 15 = 36000 \]

So, the company paid $36,000 in May.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired. So, the number of employees whose contracts expired is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

This means that 10 employees' contracts expired, and the company still paid the remaining 30 employees the same amount as in May. So, the total amount paid to the remaining 30 employees in June is:
\[ 30 \text{ employees} \times 40 \text{ hours/employee} \times \$15/\text{hour} \]

Now, let's calculate that:
\[ 30 \times 40 \times 15 = 1200 \times 15 = 18000 \]

So, the company paid $18,000 in June.

Now, let's add the amounts paid in May and June to find the total amount paid in the two months:
\[ 36000 + 18000 = 54000 \]

So, the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is:
\[ \boxed{54000} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale for $3 for the first pound and 1/2 off for the second pound. So, the cost for the first pound is $3 and the cost for the second pound is $3/2 = $1.50. Adding these together, the total cost for the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells. The seashells cost $1.50.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the magnets. Each magnet costs $0.25, and Sally bought 4 magnets, so the total cost for the magnets is $0.25 * 4 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up all the costs Sally spent. The cost of the taffy is $4.50, the cost of the seashells is $1.50, and the cost of the magnets is $1.00. Adding these together, the total cost is $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00.

Sally's parents gave her $10 to spend. After spending $7.00, the amount of money Sally has left is $10 - $7.00 = $3.00.

So, the final numerical answer is:
3"
"First, let's find out how much Tim spent on the two packs of fireworks. The first pack costs $400. The second pack costs twice as much as the first pack, so it costs $400 * 2 = $800.

The total cost for the two packs of fireworks is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Tim gets a 20% discount on the fireworks. To find out how much the discount is, we calculate 20% of $1200, which is $1200 * 0.20 = $240.

So, the cost of the fireworks after the discount is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Tim also buys a finale firework that costs $150.

To find the total amount Tim spent, we add the cost of the fireworks after the discount to the cost of the finale firework: $960 + $150 = $1110.

So, the total amount Tim spent is $1110."
"Shannon eats 2 cookies a night, so in 30 days she will eat:
2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, to find out how many dozens she needs to make 60 cookies, we divide:
60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozens

So, Shannon will need to make 5 dozens of cookies."
"First, we need to find out how many candles are dangerous. Since 5% of the candles are dangerous, we calculate 5% of 50000 candles.

\[ 5\% \text{ of } 50000 = \frac{5}{100} \times 50000 = 0.05 \times 50000 = 2500 \]

So, there are 2500 dangerous candles. Since the question states that 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode, this means 1% of the candles are dangerous and could explode. However, we are only interested in the dangerous candles that also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.

Given that 5% of the candles are dangerous and 1% of the candles are dangerous and could explode, we can assume that the defect (smell like wet dog) is not exclusive to the dangerous ones. Therefore, all 2500 dangerous candles could potentially have the defect.

So, the number of dangerous candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode is 2500.

The final numerical answer is:
2500"
"First, let's find out the discount price for each blouse. If the regular price is $20 and there's a 30% off sale, the discount amount for each blouse is:

\[ 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]

So, the discount price for each blouse is:

\[ 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so the total cost for the discounted blouses is:

\[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \]

The final numerical answer is 56."
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is 15 apples.
- Joanne gathers more apples from the average trees, but we don't know exactly how many yet.
- Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is 2 * 30 = 60 apples.
- Joanne's sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is 3 * 15 = 45 apples.
- Joanne's sister doesn't take any apples from the average trees.

Now, let's calculate the total number of apples gathered by Joanne and her sister from the tallest and shortest trees:

- From the tallest trees: Joanne + Sister = 30 + 60 = 90 apples.
- From the shortest trees: Joanne + Sister = 15 + 45 = 60 apples.

The total number of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees is 90 + 60 = 150 apples.

Since the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, the number of apples gathered from the average trees is:

500 - 150 = 350 apples.

Therefore, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees."
"To solve this problem, let's use a simple method of setting up equations based on the information given.

Let's say:
- \( C \) is the number of camels.
- \( D \) is the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we know:
1. Each camel and each dromedary has one head, so the total number of heads is the sum of the number of camels and dromedaries.
2. Each camel has 2 humps and each dromedary has 1 hump, so the total number of humps is 304.

We can write the following equations based on the information:
1. \( C + D = 180 \) (total number of heads)
2. \( 2C + D = 304 \) (total number of humps)

We need to solve these equations to find the values of \( C \) and \( D \).

First, let's subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( C \):
\[ (2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180 \]
\[ 2C + D - C - D = 124 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

Now that we know \( C = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( D \):
\[ 124 + D = 180 \]
\[ D = 180 - 124 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is 56.

The final numerical answer is:
56"
"First, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days. He traveled 200 kilometers every day, so:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Next, we calculate the distance he traveled in the next two days, which is 30% of the distance he traveled in the first four days. So:
30% of 800 km = 0.30 * 800 km = 240 km

Then, we calculate the distance he traveled during the second week. He traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days, so:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, we add up all the distances to find the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip:
800 km (first 4 days) + 240 km (next 2 days) + 2100 km (second week) = 3140 km

So, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is 3140 kilometers."
"First, let's find out how big Zack's locker is. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can find Zack's locker size by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4.

Zack's locker size = 5 cubic inches * 4 = 20 cubic inches

Now, we know Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. So, to find Timothy's locker size, we need to multiply Zack's locker size by 2.

Timothy's locker size = 20 cubic inches * 2 = 40 cubic inches

So, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches."
"Stanley's comb fell 4,000 feet to the ledge below. Stanley was at 10,000 feet elevation. Oliver was at 3,000 feet elevation.

To find out how many feet Oliver must climb, we need to subtract Oliver's elevation from Stanley's comb's elevation.

Stanley's comb is at 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet.

Oliver needs to climb 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet.

So, the final numerical answer is 3,000 feet."
"The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, so it gave him 2 * $4000 = $8000.
So, the total amount he got from the two banks is $4000 + $8000 = $12000.
If he initially had $5000 in capital, now he has $5000 + $12000 = $17000.

The final capital Mr. Josue has now is $17000."
"First, we start with 50 cats on the rock.

Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats carried away is:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Now, we subtract the number of cats carried away from the initial number of cats:
\[ 50 - 20 = 30 \]

Later, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. So, we need to find out how many cats that is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \]

We subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats:
\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

So, the number of cats left on the rock is:
\[ 12 \]"
"To solve this, let's break it down month by month.

For the first 6 months, the cost is $8 a month. So for 6 months, it would be:
6 months * $8/month = $48

For the next 2 months (months 7 and 8), the cost is $12 a month. So for 2 months, it would be:
2 months * $12/month = $24

After 8 months, the cost goes up to $14 a month. We need to calculate the cost for the remaining 4 months (months 9 to 12) at this new rate:
4 months * $14/month = $56

Now, let's add up all the costs:
$48 (first 6 months) + $24 (next 2 months) + $56 (last 4 months) = $128

So, 2 years of the service cost him $128."
"First, let's find out how much the jogger jeans cost. The tattered jeans cost $28, and the jogger jeans cost $6 less than that. So, the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.

Now, let's find out the total cost of both jeans. The tattered jeans cost $28 and the jogger jeans cost $22, so the total cost is $28 + $22 = $50.

Cole saved a total of $6. If he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, let's find out how much he saved from each.

He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, which is 1/3 * $6 = $2. So, he saved the rest from the tattered jeans, which is $6 - $2 = $4.

Now, let's find out how much he saved per pair of jeans. He saved $4 from the tattered jeans, which originally cost $28. So, the savings per pair of tattered jeans is $4 / $28 = $1 / 7.

For the jogger jeans, he saved $2, which originally cost $22. So, the savings per pair of jogger jeans is $2 / $22 = $1 / 11.

To find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, we subtract the cost of the tattered jeans from the cost of the jogger jeans. The jogger jeans cost $22 and the tattered jeans cost $28, so the difference is $22 - $28 = -$6.

Since the question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, and the result is negative, it means the tattered jeans cost more than the jogger jeans. The difference is $6 more for the tattered jeans than for the jogger jeans.

The final numerical answer is:
-6"
"First, let's calculate the total capacity of the buses:
4 buses * 60 employees per bus = 240 employees

Next, let's calculate the total capacity of the minibusses:
6 minibusses * 30 employees per minibus = 180 employees

Then, let's calculate the total capacity of the minivans:
10 minivans * 15 employees per minivan = 150 employees

Now, let's add up all the capacities:
240 employees (from buses) + 180 employees (from minibusses) + 150 employees (from minivans) = 570 employees

So, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"Lillian builds 3 bird feeders and buys 3 more, so she has a total of 3 + 3 = 6 bird feeders. The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each, so 3 store-bought feeders attract 3 * 20 = 60 birds. The bird feeders Lillian made attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones, so they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each. So, 3 feeders she made attract 3 * 30 = 90 birds. In total, she can expect 90 + 60 = 150 birds to see in her garden each day."
"First, let's find out how much the soup cost. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. The bagel costs $4.

To find 25% of $4, we calculate:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 4 = \frac{25}{100} \times 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]

So, the soup costs $4 + $1 = $5.

The cake costs half of the bagel, so:
\[ \text{Cost of cake} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \]

Now, to find the total cost of the dinner, we add the cost of the soup, the bagel, and the cake:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \]

So, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for the dinner she ordered."
"First, let's find out how much money Kenny made from selling his cards. He got $50 in spending cash and the ticket to the amusement park costs $100, so he must have made $100 - $50 = $50 from selling the cards.

Now, we know he sold the cards for $1.5 each and made a total of $50. To find out how many cards he sold, we divide the total money he made by the price per card:

$50 ÷ $1.5 = 33.333...

Since Kenny can't sell a fraction of a card, we round down to the nearest whole number. So, he sold 33 cards.

Now, we know that he kept 1/3 of his cards, which means he sold 2/3 of his cards. If 2/3 of his cards is equal to 33 cards, we can find out how many cards he started with by setting up a proportion:

(2/3) of total cards = 33 cards

To find the total number of cards, we can set up the equation:

(2/3) * total cards = 33

Now, we solve for total cards:

total cards = 33 * (3/2)
total cards = 33 * 1.5
total cards = 49.5

Since Kenny can't start with half a card, we round up to the nearest whole number. So, Kenny started with 50 cards."
"First, let's find out how many hotdogs the caterer prepared. Since half of the 36 guests would eat two hotdogs each, we calculate:

\[
\frac{36}{2} \times 2 = 18 \times 2 = 36 \text{ hotdogs}
\]

But now, 40 guests showed up, and each guest wanted a second hotdog. So, the total number of hotdogs needed is:

\[
40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ hotdogs}
\]

Since the caterer only prepared 36 hotdogs, we need to find out how many guests did not get a second hotdog. The number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is the difference between the number of guests and the number of hotdogs:

\[
40 - 36 = 4 \text{ guests}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
4
\]"
"Indras has 6 letters in her name.
Half of the letters in Indras' name is 6 / 2 = 3 letters.
Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name, so it has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.
The total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 6 + 7 = 13 letters.
The final numerical answer is 13."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Mixing bowls: $20.00
- Utensils: 5 utensils at $5.00 each, so 5 * $5.00 = $25.00

Now, let's add these amounts together to get the total cost before the discount:
$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

The items are 20% off, so we need to calculate 20% of $165.00 and subtract it from $165.00.

20% of $165.00 is:
$165.00 * 20% = $165.00 * 0.20 = $33.00

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost:
$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

So, the final numerical answer is $132.00."
"First, let's add up the cost of all the items Dora wants to buy:
- Skipping rope: $6
- Board game: $11
- Playground ball: $2

$6 + $11 + $2 = $19

Now, let's add up the money Dora has:
- From her allowance: $2
- From her mother: $16

$2 + $16 = $18

To find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the total money she has from the total cost of the items:

$19 - $18 = $1

So, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball."
"Prince Arthur slew 33 dragons because 100 x 3 / 4 = 75.

Prince Walter slew 150 dragons because 75 x 2 = 150.

Prince Bruce slew 30 dragons because 150 / 5 = 30.

The final numerical answer is 30."
"First, we need to find out how much gas is in each container. If 15 gallons of gas are divided equally into 5 containers, we divide 15 by 5:

15 gallons ÷ 5 containers = 3 gallons per container

Josey needed 1/4 of a container. Since each container has 3 gallons, we calculate 1/4 of 3 gallons:

3 gallons ÷ 4 = 0.75 gallons

Now we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so we multiply 0.75 gallons by 8 pints per gallon:

0.75 gallons × 8 pints/gallon = 6 pints

So, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline."
"First, let's find out how much money George spent on chips. He got 3 bags of chips and each bag costs 40 cents. So, the total cost for chips is:
3 * 40 = 120 cents

George spent $5, which is 500 cents. If he spent 120 cents on chips, then the amount of money he spent on candy bars is:
500 - 120 = 380 cents

Now, we know that each candy bar costs 75 cents. To find out how many candy bars George bought, we divide the total spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar:
380 / 75 = 5.0666...

Since George can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to the nearest whole number. So, George bought 5 candy bars.

The final numerical answer is:
5"
"Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5, so he shared 25 - 5 = 20 lollipops with his friends.

He shared these equally with his four friends, so each friend received 20 ÷ 4 = 5 lollipops.

The final answer is 5 lollipops."
"Rory cuts the cake into 8 pieces, so each piece weighs 20 ounces divided by 8, which is 2.5 ounces per piece.

Rory and her mom each have a piece, so together they have 2 pieces.

The weight of the 2 pieces they have is 2 pieces times 2.5 ounces per piece, which is 5 ounces.

The remaining cake would weigh 20 ounces minus the 5 ounces that Rory and her mom have, which is 15 ounces.

So, the remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"Sitti and Juris together have 34 + 22 = 56 oranges.
Including their 6 friends, there are 6 + 2 = 8 people in total.
To share the oranges equally, each person will get 56 ÷ 8 = 7 oranges."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of onions Antoine needs. The recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, and he likes to double that amount. So, he needs:
2 pounds * 2 = 4 pounds of onions.

The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound, so for 4 pounds, the cost is:
4 pounds * $2.00/pound = $8.00.

Next, Antoine needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box is $2.00, so the cost for the beef stock is:
2 boxes * $2.00/box = $4.00.

Now, let's add the cost of the onions and the beef stock to find the total cost:
$8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

The soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:
$12.00 / 6 servings = $2.00 per serving.

Rounded to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is $2.00."
"First, we need to find out how long it takes to drive to the theater from Bernadette's apartment. We know that it takes Wayne four minutes to drive to the theater. Since the drive from Bernadette’s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne’s hotel, we can calculate the time for Bernadette's drive as follows:

\[ \text{Time for Bernadette's drive} = 4 \times \text{Time for Wayne's drive} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since it takes Bernadette 16 minutes to drive to the theater, we need to subtract 5 minutes from 16 minutes to find out how early Bernadette should leave:

\[ \text{Time Bernadette should leave} = 16 - 5 = 11 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Bernadette should leave 11 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first. The final numerical answer is:

11"
"First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, 3 yards is equal to 3 * 3 = 9 feet.

The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying the length by the width. We know the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, so we can find the width by dividing the area by the length.

Width = Area / Length
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2 * (Length + Width).

Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

So, the perimeter of Billie's bedroom is 98 feet."
"First, let's calculate how many beads Elizabeth bought:
- Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads.
- Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

So, the total number of beads Elizabeth bought is:
\[ 1 \text{ pack of red} + 2 \text{ packs of clear} = 3 \text{ packs} \]
\[ 3 \text{ packs} \times 20 \text{ beads per pack} = 60 \text{ beads} \]

Next, let's calculate how many beads Margareth bought:
- Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads.
- Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

So, the total number of beads Margareth bought is:
\[ 3 \text{ packs of blue} + 4 \text{ packs of red} = 7 \text{ packs} \]
\[ 7 \text{ packs} \times 20 \text{ beads per pack} = 140 \text{ beads} \]

Now, let's find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:
\[ 140 \text{ beads} - 60 \text{ beads} = 80 \text{ beads} \]

So, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth."
"First, let's calculate how much the temperature rises when Marcus is baking. He spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. So, the total increase in temperature from baking is:
3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees

Now, let's calculate how much the temperature drops when Marcus opens the window. He opens the window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. So, the total decrease in temperature from opening the window is:
30 minutes / 10 minutes = 3
3 * 2 degrees = 6 degrees

Now, let's add the temperature increase from baking and the temperature decrease from opening the window to the initial temperature of the house:
40 degrees + 15 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees

So, the house's final temperature is 49 degrees."
"First, let's convert all the times to minutes for easier calculation:
- Jon's swim time: 40 minutes
- Jon's bike ride time: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 60 + 20 = 80 minutes
- Jon's run time: 50 minutes

Now, let's calculate James's times:
- James's swim time: Jon's swim time minus 10% of Jon's swim time
  - 10% of 40 minutes = 0.10 * 40 = 4 minutes
  - James's swim time = 40 - 4 = 36 minutes

- James's bike ride time: Jon's bike ride time plus 5 minutes
  - James's bike ride time = 80 + 5 = 85 minutes

We know that Jon won the race by 10 minutes. So, let's calculate the total time Jon took:
- Jon's total time = 40 (swim) + 80 (bike) + 50 (run) = 170 minutes

If Jon won by 10 minutes, then James's total time must be 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how long it took James to run. We already know James's swim and bike times:
- James's swim time = 36 minutes
- James's bike time = 85 minutes

Let's calculate the run time for James:
- James's total time = 36 (swim) + 85 (bike) + run time = 180 minutes

Now, we can solve for the run time:
- 36 + 85 + run time = 180
- 121 + run time = 180
- run time = 180 - 121 = 59 minutes

So, James's run time is 59 minutes."
"First, we need to find out how long Movie C is in minutes. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 1.25 hours is 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes long.

Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, so Movie A is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes long.

The final numerical answer is 20."
"First, we need to find out how many miles the horse runs. The horse runs at 32 miles per hour for 30 minutes. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the horse runs:
\[ 32 \text{ miles/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

For every mile the horse runs, Michael's horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay. So for 16 miles, the horse eats:
\[ 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail/mile} = 8 \text{ bails of hay} \]

Each bail of hay costs $3, so 8 bails of hay cost:
\[ 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars/bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six 5 dollar bills, which is:
\[ 6 \times 5 \text{ dollars} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the hay, the change Michael has is:
\[ 30 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \]"
"First, let's find out how many eggs Rozanne has in total.

She has 4 dozen eggs. Since one dozen equals 12, 4 dozen is:
\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ eggs} \]

She also has 2 loose eggs. So, the total number of eggs is:
\[ 48 + 2 = 50 \text{ eggs} \]

Each glass of eggnog needs 5 eggs. To find out how many glasses of eggnog she can make, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs needed per glass:
\[ \frac{50}{5} = 10 \text{ glasses} \]

Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog. To find out how many trays she can put out, we divide the total number of glasses by the number of glasses each tray can hold:
\[ \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ trays} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"

Marcy's initial points: 225
Points Marcy scores: 10

Marcy's total points now: 225 + 10 = 235 points

Now, to find out by how many points Joey is winning, we subtract Marcy's total points from Joey's total points:

Joey's total points: 240
Marcy's total points: 235

Difference in points: 240 - 235 = 5 points

So, Joey is now winning by 5 points."
"First, let's find out how much the salesman spent on the sneakers. He bought 48 sneakers for $576.

Next, let's calculate how much he made from selling 17 sneakers at $20 each.
\[ 17 \times 20 = 340 \]

Now, let's find out how many sneakers he sold to the department store. He sold 17 out of 48, so:
\[ 48 - 17 = 31 \]

He sold these 31 sneakers at $25 each.
\[ 31 \times 25 = 775 \]

Now, let's add the money he made from both sales to find the total money he made.
\[ 340 + 775 = 1115 \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the cost of the sneakers from the total money made.
\[ 1115 - 576 = 539 \]

So, the salesman's profit is $539."
"First, let's calculate the total number of crayons in the six packets that each have eight pieces:
6 packets * 8 pieces/packet = 48 pieces

Next, let's calculate the total number of crayons in the four packets that each have sixteen pieces:
4 packets * 16 pieces/packet = 64 pieces

Now, let's add the two totals together to find the total number of crayons Beatrice bought:

"First, let's figure out the total cost of the super ticket with the extra popcorn and soda.

The super ticket costs $20.
The extra popcorn and soda cost $1.

So, the total cost for the super ticket is $20 + $1 = $21.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying a movie ticket and a popcorn and soda separately.

The movie ticket costs $12.
The popcorn and soda cost $3 (soda) + $1 (popcorn) = $4.

So, the total cost for buying a movie ticket and a popcorn and soda is $12 + $4 = $16.

You saved $2 by buying the super ticket instead of buying the movie ticket and the popcorn and soda separately.

Now, to find the regular price of the popcorn, we need to subtract the cost of the soda from the total cost of the popcorn and soda when bought separately.

The total cost for the popcorn and soda is $16, and the soda costs $3.

So, the regular price of the popcorn is $16 - $3 = $13.

The regular price of the popcorn is $13."
"First, we need to find out how much it cost to fill one balloon on the first day. We know that 20 balloons cost $900, so we divide $900 by 20 to find the cost per balloon.

\[
\text{Cost per balloon on the first day} = \frac{900}{20} = 45
\]

On the second day, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20. So, we add $20 to the cost per balloon on the first day to find the new cost per balloon.

\[
\text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65
\]

Now, we need to find out how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons at the new price.

\[
\text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = 170 \times 65
\]

To calculate \(170 \times 65\), we can break it down:

\[
170 \times 65 = 170 \times (60 + 5) = (170 \times 60) + (170 \times 5)
\]

\[
170 \times 60 = 10200
\]

\[
170 \times 5 = 850
\]

Adding these together:

\[
10200 + 850 = 11050
\]

So, Bentley paid $11050 to fill 170 balloons after the price increase."
"To find the average speed, we need to know the total distance the car traveled and the total time it took.

First, let's calculate the distance for each part of the trip:
- For the first part, the car drives 60 mph for 2 hours. So, the distance is 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles.
- For the second part, the car drives 30 mph for 1 hour. So, the distance is 30 mph * 1 hour = 30 miles.

Now, let's add up the total distance and the total time:
- Total distance = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles.
- Total time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.

The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time:
- Average speed = 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph.

So, the car's average speed during this trip is 50 mph."
"Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. So, she has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left. The value of her sapphires is 5 sapphires * $800/sapphire = $4000. The value of her rubies is 2 rubies * $1200/ruby = $2400. So, the total value of all her jewels is $4000 + $2400 = $6400."
"To find out how many apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. First, find out how many apples both of them eat in one day. Since Marin eats 4 apples and Nancy eats 4 apples, together they eat:
   \[
   4 + 4 = 8 \text{ apples per day}
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how many apples they eat in 30 days. Since they eat 8 apples per day, in 30 days they will eat:
   \[
   8 \times 30 = 240 \text{ apples}
   \]

So, the final numerical answer is 240 apples."
"First, we need to find out the total volume of the raised beds. Each raised bed is 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. So, the volume of one raised bed is:

\[ 2 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet} \times 2 \text{ feet} = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of the raised beds is:

\[ 32 \text{ cubic feet/bed} \times 10 \text{ beds} = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. To find out how many bags Bob needs, we divide the total volume by the volume each bag can hold:

\[ \frac{320 \text{ cubic feet}}{2 \text{ cubic feet/bag}} = 160 \text{ bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost for 160 bags is:

\[ 160 \text{ bags} \times 12 \text{ dollars/bag} = 1920 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1920 \]"
"First, let's find out how many green cards there are. If there are 60% more green cards than red cards, and there are 15 red cards, then:

60% of 15 = 0.60 * 15 = 9

So, there are 9 more green cards than red cards. Therefore, the total number of green cards is:

15 (red cards) + 9 (additional green cards) = 24 green cards

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards:

Red cards + Green cards = Yellow cards
15 (red cards) + 24 (green cards) = 39 yellow cards

To find the total number of cards, we add up all the cards:

Red cards + Green cards + Yellow cards = Total cards
15 (red cards) + 24 (green cards) + 39 (yellow cards) = 78 total cards

So, the final numerical answer is 78."
"Katelyn saw 50 fairies.
Her friend saw half as many as Katelyn, so the friend saw 50 / 2 = 25 fairies.
Before the fairies flew away, the total number of fairies was 50 (original) + 25 (joined) = 75 fairies.
Then, 30 fairies flew away, so the remaining number of fairies is 75 - 30 = 45 fairies.

The final numerical answer is 45."
"First, we need to find the total number of puppies. Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. So, the total number of puppies is 8 + 12 = 20.

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. Jennifer's dog has 3 spotted puppies and Brandon's dog has 4 spotted puppies. So, the total number of spotted puppies is 3 + 4 = 7.

To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of Spotted Puppies}}{\text{Total Number of Puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 \]

Now, let's calculate this:
\[ \text{Percentage} = 0.35 \times 100 = 35\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is 35%."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed:

- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
- Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
- Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, let's add up all the weights to find the total weight of the feed:

Total weight = 2 pounds (sugar cubes) + 48 pounds (carrots) + 3150 pounds (hay) + 1300 pounds (oats)
Total weight = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300
Total weight = 4500 pounds

The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips the farmer needs to make, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:

Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
Number of trips = 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip
Number of trips = 2

So, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"First, let's find out how much Grayson earns from recycling cans and bottles in one week.

For cans:
- Each can is worth 2 cents.
- She drinks 3 cans a week.
- So, in one week, she earns 3 cans * 2 cents/can = 6 cents from cans.

For bottles:
- Each bottle is worth 3 cents.
- She drinks 5 bottles a week.
- So, in one week, she earns 5 bottles * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents from bottles.

Now, let's add the earnings from cans and bottles in one week:
- Total in one week = 6 cents (from cans) + 15 cents (from bottles) = 21 cents.

To find out how much she earns in a four-week month:
- Total in four weeks = 21 cents/week * 4 weeks = 84 cents.

So, the final numerical answer is:
84"
"First, we need to find out how many plants Toni has. Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick. If Frederick has 10 plants, then Toni has:

\[ 10 + (10 \times 0.60) = 10 + 6 = 16 \text{ plants} \]

Now, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. Since Toni has 16 plants, Shondra has:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \text{ plants} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 9."

"First, we need to find out what 1/5 of the pizza delivery cost is. The pizza delivery costs $15.

To find 1/5 of $15, we divide $15 by 5:
\[ \frac{15}{5} = 3 \]

So, the tip Ashley should give is $3.

The total amount Ashley should give the delivery man is the cost of the pizza plus the tip:
\[ 15 + 3 = 18 \]

The final numerical answer is:
18"
"Finley started in first place. She fell back 5 spots, so she was in 1 - 5 = -4. Since she can't be in negative spots, this means she was in 4th place. Then she moved ahead 2 spots, so she was in 4 + 2 = 6th place. She fell behind 3 spots, so she was in 6 - 3 = 3rd place. Lastly, she jumped ahead 1 spot, so she was in 3 + 1 = 4th place.

The final place Finley finished in is 4th."
"First, let's find out how many basketball cards Miss Maria has. She has six decks with 25 cards in each deck, so:
6 decks * 25 cards/deck = 150 basketball cards

Next, let's find out how many baseball cards she has. She has five boxes with 40 cards in each box, so:
5 boxes * 40 cards/box = 200 baseball cards

Now, let's add the number of basketball and baseball cards together to find the total number of cards:
150 basketball cards + 200 baseball cards = 350 cards

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so we subtract those from the total to find out how many cards she gave to her students:
350 total cards - 50 cards = 300 cards

If her students got ten cards each, we divide the number of cards given to students by the number of cards each student received:
300 cards / 10 cards/student = 30 students

So, Miss Maria has 30 students."
"First, let's calculate how much Becky paid for the apples.

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each, so:
\[ 20 \times 45 \text{ cents} = 900 \text{ cents} \]

Becky also received a $1 discount, which is 100 cents, so:
\[ 900 \text{ cents} - 100 \text{ cents} = 800 \text{ cents} \]

Now, let's calculate how much Kelly paid for the apples.

Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each, so:
\[ 20 \times 50 \text{ cents} = 1000 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly received a 10 percent discount on the total price. First, we calculate 10 percent of 1000 cents:
\[ 1000 \text{ cents} \times 0.10 = 100 \text{ cents} \]

So, Kelly's total cost after the discount is:
\[ 1000 \text{ cents} - 100 \text{ cents} = 900 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky:
\[ 900 \text{ cents} - 800 \text{ cents} = 100 \text{ cents} \]

So, Kelly paid 100 cents more than Becky. In dollars, 100 cents is $1.00.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how many shoes Fireman Frank has after Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

He starts with 200 shoes.

On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes. Since each pair has 2 shoes, he gets 5 * 2 = 10 shoes.
So, after Monday, he has 200 + 10 = 210 shoes.

On Wednesday, he gets 15 pairs of shoes. So, he gets 15 * 2 = 30 shoes.
After Wednesday, he has 210 + 30 = 240 shoes.

On Friday, he gets 30 pairs of shoes. So, he gets 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.
After Friday, he has 240 + 60 = 300 shoes.

On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes.
So, after Saturday, he has 300 - 180 = 120 shoes.

Therefore, the final number of shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday is 120."
"First, we need to find out how many cupcakes Mary can make with all her sprinkles. Since each jar of sprinkles can decorate 8 cupcakes and she has 6 jars, we multiply the number of jars by the number of cupcakes each jar can decorate:

6 jars * 8 cupcakes/jar = 48 cupcakes

Now, we need to find out how many pans of cupcakes Mary should bake. Since each pan holds 12 cupcakes, we divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes each pan can hold:

48 cupcakes / 12 cupcakes/pan = 4 pans

So, Mary should bake 4 pans worth of cupcakes."
"First, let's find out how much the piece of paper cost. The pen cost $2, and the paper costs $1 less than three times the pen's price. So, we calculate:

Three times the pen's price is: $2 * 3 = $6
The paper costs $1 less than this, so: $6 - $1 = $5

Now, we add the cost of the pen and the paper to find the total cost:
Pen: $2
Paper: $5
Total cost: $2 + $5 = $7

Theo gave the cashier $10. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from $10:
Change: $10 - $7 = $3

So, the amount of change Theo received is $3."
"First, let's find out how many pencils each student had at the start. Each student had 10 pencils, and there are 30 students, so:

10 pencils/student * 30 students = 300 pencils in total.

After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. So, the number of pencils used is:

1/5 * 300 pencils = 60 pencils.

This means the number of pencils left after two months is:

300 pencils - 60 pencils = 240 pencils.

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. So, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is:

1/3 * 240 pencils = 80 pencils.

So, the final numerical answer is 80 pencils."
"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total.
2. The number of cookies he can have is half the number of carrot sticks he eats plus 2 extra.
3. Let's say the number of carrot sticks he eats is \( x \).
4. According to the problem, the number of cookies he can have is \( \frac{x}{2} + 2 \).
5. We know this equals 5 cookies, so we can set up the equation: \( \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \).

Now, let's solve the equation:

1. Subtract 2 from both sides: \( \frac{x}{2} = 3 \).
2. Multiply both sides by 2: \( x = 6 \).

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to convert all measurements to the same unit. Let's use inches for this calculation.

1 foot = 12 inches

So, the shark is 10 feet long, which is:
10 feet * 12 inches/foot = 120 inches

Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras, so the total length of the remoras is:
2 * 6 inches = 12 inches

Now, to find out what percentage of the shark's body length the combined length of the remoras is, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Length of remoras}}{\text{Length of shark}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12}{120} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
10"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know that three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home. This means one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer at home.
2. We are told that 20 students do not have desktop computers. Since this represents one-fourth of the total number of students, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Total number of students} = 20
   \]
3. To find the total number of students, we need to multiply both sides of the equation by 4:
   \[
   \text{Total number of students} = 20 \times 4 = 80
   \]

So, the total number of students at that grade level is 80."
"First, we need to find out how many minutes Jason will walk in three weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, in three weeks there will be 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Jason wants to walk 240 minutes in 21 days. To find out how many minutes he needs to walk each day, we divide the total minutes by the total number of days.

So, we do 240 minutes ÷ 21 days = 11.428571428571429 minutes per day.

Jason needs to spend about 11.43 minutes walking each day to break in the new shoes."
"First, we need to find out how many books Sarah bought. Since each book costs $15 and she spent $300, we divide the total amount spent by the cost of each book:

\[ \text{Number of books} = \frac{\text{Total amount spent}}{\text{Cost per book}} = \frac{300}{15} = 20 \]

Now, Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids. To find out how many books each child got, we divide the total number of books by the number of kids:

\[ \text{Books per child} = \frac{\text{Total number of books}}{\text{Number of kids}} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

So, each child got 5 books."
"First, we need to find out how many kids are allergic to something. We know that 9 kids are allergic to dairy, 6 are allergic to peanuts, and 3 are allergic to both. To find the total number of kids allergic to something, we add the number of kids allergic to dairy and the number of kids allergic to peanuts, and then subtract the number of kids allergic to both (to avoid counting them twice).

So, the calculation is:
9 (dairy allergic) + 6 (peanuts allergic) - 3 (both allergic) = 12 kids allergic to something.

Now, we subtract the number of kids allergic to something from the total number of kids in the class to find out how many aren't allergic to anything.

So, the calculation is:
32 (total kids) - 12 (allergic to something) = 20 kids aren't allergic to anything.

Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, so Jasper has 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of yellow paint.
To find the total number of tubes of paint Jasper has, we add the blue and yellow tubes together: 2 + 9 = 11 tubes of paint.
So, the final numerical answer is 11."
"First, we need to find the weight of the 2010 penny. Since the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can calculate its weight by multiplying the weight of the 1959 penny by three-quarters.

The weight of the 1959 penny is 48 grains.

So, the weight of the 2010 penny is:
\[ \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = 48 \times \frac{3}{4} = 36 \text{ grains} \]

Now, to find the combined weight of the two pennies, we add the weight of the 2010 penny to the weight of the 1959 penny:
\[ \text{Combined weight} = 48 + 36 = 84 \text{ grains} \]

The final numerical answer is:

So, Sally spends $32 in all."
"First, let's find out how many razors are in 2 packs. Since each pack has 4 razors, 2 packs will have 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

Now, Heather is getting a buy one get one free offer. This means for every 2 razors, she only pays for 1. So, for 8 razors, she will pay for 4 razors.

The original price for 1 pack is $4.00, so for 2 packs, it would be $4.00 * 2 = $8.00.

With a $2.00 coupon, the price after the coupon is $8.00 - $2.00 = $6.00.

Now, we need to find out how much each razor costs after the discount. Since she pays for 4 razors and the total cost is $6.00, each razor costs $6.00 / 4 = $1.50.

To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100 (since $1.00 = 100 cents), so each razor costs 1.50 * 100 = 150 cents.

The final numerical answer in cents is:

"First, let's find the average height of the cheerleaders. There are 9 cheerleaders who are 64"" tall and 1 cheerleader who is 60"" tall. 

To find the average height, we add up all the heights and divide by the total number of cheerleaders:

\[ \text{Total height} = (9 \times 64) + 60 = 576 + 60 = 636 \]

\[ \text{Average height} = \frac{636}{10} = 63.6 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the total height of the human pyramid. The pyramid has 4 girls on the bottom, 3 on the next level, 2 on the next, and 1 at the top. The shortest girl is at the top, so her height is 60 inches.

\[ \text{Total height of the pyramid} = 4 \times 64 + 3 \times 64 + 2 \times 64 + 1 \times 60 \]

\[ \text{Total height of the pyramid} = 256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636 \text{ inches} \]

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches):

\[ \text{Total height in feet} = \frac{636}{12} = 53 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 53 feet."
"Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour. Since she works 8 hours a day, we can calculate the total minutes she walks in one day by multiplying 8 hours by 5 minutes per hour.

"First, let's find out how many oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box, so:

5 boxes * 10 oranges/box = 50 oranges

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so:

50 oranges + 20 oranges = 70 oranges

Now, let's add the oranges Ashley and Brianne brought together:

50 oranges + 70 oranges = 120 oranges

One greek orange pie needs three oranges, so to find out how many pies they can make, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed for one pie:

120 oranges / 3 oranges/pie = 40 pies

So, they can make 40 greek orange pies."
"To solve this, let's first write down the cost equations for both venues.

For the first venue:
- The cost is $200 plus $5 for each person.
- So, if \( p \) is the number of people, the total cost is \( 200 + 5p \).

For the second venue:
- The cost is $25 per person plus $5 for each person.
- So, if \( p \) is the number of people, the total cost is \( 25p + 5p = 30p \).

We need to find the number of people \( p \) for which the costs are equal. So we set the two cost equations equal to each other:

\[ 200 + 5p = 30p \]

Now, let's solve for \( p \):

1. Subtract \( 5p \) from both sides:
   \[ 200 = 25p \]

2. Divide both sides by 25:
   \[ p = \frac{200}{25} \]
   \[ p = 8 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 8."
"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Let's say Bodhi found \( B \) insects.
2. David found half of what Bodhi found, so David found \( \frac{B}{2} \) insects.
3. Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found \( \frac{B}{2} + 7 \) insects.
4. Together they found 43 insects, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   B + \frac{B}{2} + \frac{B}{2} + 7 = 43
   \]
5. Simplifying the equation:
   \[
   B + B + 7 = 43
   \]
   \[
   2B + 7 = 43
   \]
6. Subtract 7 from both sides:
   \[
   2B = 36
   \]
7. Divide by 2:
   \[
   B = 18
   \]
8. Now we know Bodhi found 18 insects. So David found \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \) insects.
9. Lily found \( 9 + 7 = 16 \) insects.

So, Lily found 16 insects."
"Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, which is 364 / 4 = 91 yards.
Her grandma used 1/2 of a skein, which is 364 / 2 = 182 yards.
Together, they used 91 + 182 = 273 yards of yarn."
"First, let's calculate the total number of gifts Cherrie bought for her 5 friends.

For 2 friends, each wants 5 gifts:
2 friends * 5 gifts/friend = 10 gifts

For the other 3 friends, each wants 2 gifts:
3 friends * 2 gifts/friend = 6 gifts

Now, add the gifts for her friends:
10 gifts + 6 gifts = 16 gifts

Cherrie also bought 10 more random gifts:
16 gifts + 10 gifts = 26 gifts

So, the total number of gifts Cherrie bought is 26."
"First, let's find out how wide the rug is. The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, and the chair is 3 feet wide. So, the rug is 3 + 5 = 8 feet wide.

Now, we know that the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the width of the rug is 8 * 2 = 16 feet. So, the couch is 16 + 2 = 18 feet long.

The final numerical answer is:
18"
"First, let's figure out how much the green apple gum cost. Since it cost half as much as a pack of grape gum, and a pack of grape gum cost $2, the green apple gum cost $2 / 2 = $1.

Now, let's add up the cost of the grape gum and the green apple gum. The grape gum cost $2 and the green apple gum cost $1, so together they cost $2 + $1 = $3.

Suzie paid $7 in all, and we know that $3 of that was for the grape and green apple gums. So, the cost of the strawberry gum is $7 - $3 = $4.

Since she bought two packs of strawberry gum, each pack cost $4 / 2 = $2.

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2."
"First, we need to find out how many 2 x 4 pieces Frederick can buy with $24. Each 2 x 4 costs $4.

$24 ÷ $4 = 6 pieces of 2 x 4

Now, we know that each 2 x 4 gives him 200 sticks.

6 pieces × 200 sticks = 1200 sticks

Next, we need to find out how many 2 x 8 pieces Frederick can buy with $24. Each 2 x 8 costs $6.

$24 ÷ $6 = 4 pieces of 2 x 8

Now, we know that each 2 x 8 gives him 400 sticks.

4 pieces × 400 sticks = 1600 sticks

Since Frederick wants to buy the cheapest lumber, he should buy the 2 x 4 pieces. So, the most popsicle sticks he can make is 1200 sticks."
"Each dog has 4 legs, so to buy snowshoes for one dog, it costs $12.00. Since Mario has 6 dogs, he needs to buy snowshoes for 6 dogs.

To find the total cost, we multiply the cost for one dog by the number of dogs:

$12.00 x 6 = $72.00

So, the final numerical answer is $72.00."
"First, let's find out how much Janet spends on bus trips each week.

She takes 2 bus trips a day and does this 5 days a week. So, the total number of bus trips she takes in a week is:
2 trips/day * 5 days/week = 10 trips/week

Each bus trip costs her $2.20, so the total cost for 10 trips in a week is:
10 trips/week * $2.20/trip = $22.00/week

Now, if she buys a weekly bus pass for $20, we can find out how much she saves by subtracting the cost of the bus pass from the total cost of the bus trips:
$22.00/week - $20.00/week = $2.00/week

So, Janet would save $2.00 by buying a weekly bus pass."
"The farm has 30 cows and 15 sheep because 15 is half of 30.
The zoo has 20 sheep and 60 cows because 60 is twice 30 and 20 is the number given.
So, the total number of animals on the farm is 30 cows + 15 sheep = 45 animals.
The total number of animals in the zoo is 20 sheep + 60 cows = 80 animals.
Therefore, the total number of animals on the farm and zoo combined is 45 + 80 = 125 animals."
"Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes.
If Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought, then Sophia bought 12 / 4 = 3 onions.
Sophia also bought 4 / 4 = 1 potato.
So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato.
In total, Sophia bought 3 + 1 = 4 onions and potatoes.

The final numerical answer is 4."
"First, we need to find out how many days Andy has until his birthday. From December 31st to July 19th is 181 days.

To lose 30 pounds, Andy needs to burn 30 * 3500 calories = 105000 calories.

To find out how many calories Andy needs to burn each day, we divide the total calories by the number of days:

105000 calories / 181 days = 579.42 calories per day.

Since we need a whole number for the daily calorie deficit, we can round this to 580 calories per day.

So, Andy needs a calorie deficit of 580 calories each day to reach his goal."
"Gerald earns $30 per day and he worked for 7 days in a week, so his total earnings are:
$30 x 7 = $210

He spent $100, so the amount he has left is:
$210 - $100 = $110

The final numerical answer is:
$110"
"First, we need to find out the total distance Hannah will run. She runs 8 laps and each lap is 0.25 km. So, we multiply the number of laps by the distance of each lap:

\[ 8 \text{ laps} \times 0.25 \text{ km/lap} = 2 \text{ km} \]

Now, we know that Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs. So, for 2 km, she will need:

\[ 2 \text{ km} \times 60 \text{ ml/km} = 120 \text{ ml} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 120 ml."
"First, let's find out how much money Julie spent on clothes. She spent 20% of $500 on clothes.

20% of $500 = 0.20 * $500 = $100

So, Julie spent $100 on clothes. Now, let's find out how much money she has left after buying clothes.

Money left after buying clothes = $500 - $100 = $400

Next, Julie spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs.

25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100

So, Julie spent $100 on CDs. Now, let's find out how much money she has left after buying CDs.

Money left after buying CDs = $400 - $100 = $300

Therefore, the final amount of money Julie has left is $300."
"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Let's say the cost of the lot is \( L \).
2. The cost of the house is three times the cost of the lot, so it's \( 3L \).
3. The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000.
4. So, we can write the equation: \( L + 3L = 120,000 \).
5. This simplifies to \( 4L = 120,000 \).
6. To find \( L \), we divide both sides by 4: \( L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000 \).
7. Now that we know the lot costs $30,000, we can find the cost of the house, which is \( 3L = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000 \).

So, the house cost $90,000."
"First, let's find out how many bags Tara bought. She bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags, so:

8 packs * 5 bags/pack = 40 bags

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the bags. She bought each pack for $4, so:

8 packs * $4/pack = $32

Next, let's find out how much money Tara made from selling the bags. She sold each bag for $8, so:

40 bags * $8/bag = $320

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total sales:

$320 (total sales) - $32 (total cost) = $288

So, Tara earned a profit of $288."
"First, we need to find out how many minutes the fight lasts. The fight lasts 5 rounds and each round is 3 minutes, so we multiply 5 by 3:

5 rounds * 3 minutes/round = 15 minutes

Joe throws 25 punches per minute. To find out how many punches he throws in 15 minutes, we multiply the number of punches per minute by the total number of minutes:

25 punches/minute * 15 minutes = 375 punches

So, the final numerical answer is 375."
"First, we need to find out how many cookies Josh made. Since Suzanne made 36 cookies and Josh made one-fourth of what Suzanne made, we calculate:

\[ \text{Josh's cookies} = \frac{36}{4} = 9 \]

Next, we know that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Kelsie's cookies} = 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

So, Kelsie made 18 cookies."
"First, let's find out how much money Ali has in total. He has four $10 bills and six $20 bills.

The total money from the $10 bills is:
4 * $10 = $40

The total money from the $20 bills is:
6 * $20 = $120

So, the total money Ali has is:
$40 + $120 = $160

Ali gives half of this money to his sister:
$160 / 2 = $80

Now, Ali has $80 left. He uses 3/5 of this remaining amount to buy dinner:
3/5 * $80 = $48

So, the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is:
$80 - $48 = $32

The final numerical answer is $32."
"First, we need to convert Rob's time into minutes. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 2 hours is 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.

Now, we know that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time Rob takes. So, we first find out what double the time Rob takes is: 120 * 2 = 240 minutes.

Then, we add 40 minutes to this amount: 240 + 40 = 280 minutes.

So, Royce takes 280 minutes to shingle a house."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Martha needs to make 5 items for each grandchild: a hat, a scarf, a sweater, a pair of mittens, and a pair of socks.
2. For each grandchild, she needs:
   - 2 skeins for a hat
   - 4 skeins for a scarf
   - 12 skeins for a sweater
   - 1 skein for a pair of mittens
   - 2 skeins for a pair of socks
3. To find out how many skeins she needs for one grandchild, we add these up:
   2 + 4 + 12 + 1 + 2 = 21 skeins
4. Since she has 3 grandchildren, we multiply the number of skeins needed for one grandchild by 3:
   21 * 3 = 63 skeins

So, Martha will need to buy 63 skeins of wool."
"First, let's calculate how many problems Chris completes on Tuesday. He completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday. Since he completed 12 problems on Monday, on Tuesday he completes:

12 problems * 3 = 36 problems

Now, let's find out how many problems are left after Tuesday. Initially, he had 100 problems. After Monday and Tuesday, the number of problems left is:

100 problems - 12 problems (Monday) - 36 problems (Tuesday) = 52 problems

On Wednesday, he completes one-quarter of the remaining problems. So, the number of problems he completes on Wednesday is:

52 problems * 1/4 = 13 problems

Now, let's find out how many problems are left after Wednesday. The number of problems left after Wednesday is:

52 problems - 13 problems = 39 problems

So, the number of math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday is 39."
"First, let's find out how many quarts each person can pick per hour:

- Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.
- Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
- Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick \(5 \times 2 = 10\) quarts per hour.
- Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky can pick \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, let's add up the quarts each person can pick per hour:

- Tony: 6 quarts
- Bobby: 5 quarts
- Kathy: 10 quarts
- Ricky: 8 quarts

Total quarts picked per hour by all four is \(6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29\) quarts.

So, the final numerical answer is 29."
"First, let's add up all the bread baked:
200 loaves

Now, let's subtract the loaves sold in the morning:
200 - 93 = 107 loaves

Then, subtract the loaves sold in the afternoon:
107 - 39 = 68 loaves

Finally, add the loaves returned by the grocery store:
68 + 6 = 74 loaves

So, the final number of loaves of bread they had left is 74."
"First, we need to find out how many rows of red tulips Jackson can plant. He has 36 red tulips and can fit 6 red tulips in a row. So, we divide the total number of red tulips by the number of red tulips that fit in a row:

\[ \text{Rows of red tulips} = \frac{36}{6} = 6 \]

Next, we find out how many rows of blue tulips Jackson can plant. He has 24 blue tulips and can fit 8 blue tulips in a row. So, we divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of blue tulips that fit in a row:

\[ \text{Rows of blue tulips} = \frac{24}{8} = 3 \]

Now, to find the total number of rows of flowers Jackson will plant, we add the rows of red tulips and the rows of blue tulips:

\[ \text{Total rows} = 6 + 3 = 9 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 9."
"First, we need to find out how many cups of raisins Heather has in total. She has 27 cups of raisins.

Next, we need to divide these 27 cups equally among oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix. So, we divide 27 cups by 3:

\[ 27 \div 3 = 9 \]

This means Heather has 9 cups of raisins to use for oatmeal cookies.

Now, we know that each batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we divide the 9 cups of raisins by the 3/4 cups needed per batch:

\[ 9 \div \frac{3}{4} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 12 \]

So, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies."
"First, let's calculate Ada's daily electric consumption before adding the new device:
- Ada's daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour
- New device's daily consumption: 2 kilowatts per hour
- Total daily consumption after adding the new device: 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour

Next, let's calculate the cost per day:
- Cost per kilowatt per hour: $1.50
- Cost per day: 14 kilowatts per hour * $1.50 = $21

Now, let's calculate the weekly cost:
- There are 7 days in a week
- Weekly cost: $21 * 7 = $147

Since the question asks for the difference between the weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device, and we only have one scenario (adding the new device), the difference is simply the weekly cost after adding the new device.

So, the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is $147."
"First, let's figure out how much one person can paint in one day. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then in one day, one person can paint:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \text{ house} \div 5 = \frac{1}{10} \text{ house per day} \]

Now, if one person can paint \(\frac{1}{10}\) of a house in one day, then 5 people can paint:

\[ 5 \times \frac{1}{10} = \frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ house in one day} \]

So, 5 people can paint half a house in one day. To paint a whole house, they would need:

\[ 2 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 24 hours in a day, the total number of hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house is:

\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 48 hours."
"If Ophelia has 20 sofas, and she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, then she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

Since Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs, and Jenna has 66 chairs, we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have together.

Ophelia's total: 20 sofas + 22 chairs = 42
Jenna's total: 66 chairs

Total number of sofas and chairs: 42 (Ophelia) + 66 (Jenna) = 108

So, the final numerical answer is 108."
"First, we need to find out how much Tom spent on the headphone set. We know he spent $4 on a CD and the total was $48. So, we subtract the cost of the CD from the total amount:

$48 - $4 = $44

This means Tom spent $44 on the headphone set. If he didn't buy the headphone set, he would have $44 left to spend on CDs. Since each CD costs $4, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one CD to find out how many more CDs he could have bought:

$44 ÷ $4 = 11

So, Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set. The final numerical answer is 11."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Josh worked out for 4 hours every week except for two weeks when he worked out for 5 hours and one week when he worked out for 6 hours.

2. First, calculate the total hours he worked out for the 6 weeks when he worked out for 4 hours each week:
   - 6 weeks * 4 hours/week = 24 hours

3. Then, add the hours he worked out for the two weeks when he worked out for 5 hours each week:
   - 2 weeks * 5 hours/week = 10 hours

4. Finally, add the hours he worked out for the one week when he worked out for 6 hours:
   - 1 week * 6 hours/week = 6 hours

5. Now, add all these hours together:
   - 24 hours + 10 hours + 6 hours = 40 hours

So, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is 40 hours."
"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.
2. At the first stop, 8 people get off. So, the bus now has:
   48 - 8 = 40 people.
3. Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (which is 8) get on the bus. So, 5 * 8 = 40 people get on the bus. Now, the bus has:
   40 + 40 = 80 people.
4. At the second stop, 21 people get off. So, the bus now has:
   80 - 21 = 59 people.
5. Then, 3 times fewer people get on the bus than those who got off at the second stop. Since 21 people got off, 3 times fewer would be:
   21 / 3 = 7 people get on the bus. Now, the bus has:
   59 + 7 = 66 people.

So, the final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is 66."
"First, let's find out Jame's current age. If he will be 27 in 5 years, then now he is 27 - 5 = 22 years old.

Now, let's find out his cousin's age in 8 years. The problem states that in 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. So, in 8 years, Jame will be 22 + 8 = 30 years old. Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be 2 * 30 = 60 years. So, his cousin will be 60 - 5 = 55 years old in 8 years.

To find out his cousin's current age, we subtract 8 years from his age in 8 years: 55 - 8 = 47 years old.

Now, to find out how many years separate the age of the two now, we subtract Jame's current age from his cousin's current age: 47 - 22 = 25 years.

So, the final numerical answer is 25."
"First, let's find out how much Errol paid for the printer. Since he paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100, the printer cost:
\[ 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

Now, let's add up the cost of the computer and the printer:
\[ 1100 + 700 = 1800 \]

Errol also bought 2 monitors. The total cost of the computer, printer, and 2 monitors is $2,400. So, the cost of the 2 monitors is:
\[ 2400 - 1800 = 600 \]

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the total cost of the monitors by 2:
\[ 600 \div 2 = 300 \]

So, the cost of one monitor is $300."
"First, we need to find out how many kids are in each group. Since there are 20 kids and they are divided into two equal groups, we divide 20 by 2:

20 ÷ 2 = 10

So, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

Each boy brought back 60 seashells. The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. So, we calculate the total seashells the girls brought:

60 (number of seashells each boy brought) + 4 × 60 (four times as many as the boys) = 60 + 240 = 300

Now, we need to find out how many seashells each girl brought. Since there are 10 girls and they brought a total of 300 seashells, we divide 300 by 10:

300 ÷ 10 = 30

So, each girl brought 30 seashells."
"George had 3 + 5 = 8 candies before eating.

Since Nick had twice as many candies as George originally, Nick had 8 * 2 = 16 candies.

So, the final answer is 16."
"First, we need to find out how old Alyana is. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, we can calculate Alyana's age as follows:

Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4
Alyana's age = 10 - 4
Alyana's age = 6

Now, we know that Anne is 2 years older than Alyana. So, we can find Anne's age by adding 2 years to Alyana's age:

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2
Anne's age = 6 + 2
Anne's age = 8

So, Anne is 8 years old."
"To find the total thickness of the four books, let's calculate the thickness of each book step by step:

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so it is 50 mm - 5 mm = 45 mm thick.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 mm = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thicknesses of all four books together:

31 mm + 50 mm + 45 mm + 62 mm = 188 mm

So, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma still needs to make, we need to add up the vlogs she has already made and subtract that from the total she needs to make.

She has made:
- 18 vlogs in the first week
- 21 vlogs in the second week
- 15 vlogs in the third week

So, the total vlogs she has made so far is:
18 + 21 + 15 = 54 vlogs

She needs to make 72 vlogs in total, so the number of vlogs she still needs to make is:
72 - 54 = 18 vlogs

The final numerical answer is 18."
"First, we need to calculate the tip. The tip is 20% of the dinner bill. The dinner bill is $50.

To find 20% of $50, we can do the following calculation:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } \$50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = \$10 \]

So, the tip is $10.

Now, to find out how much you ended up paying, we add the tip to the original dinner bill:
\[ \$50 + \$10 = \$60 \]

So, you ended up paying $60."
"First, let's find out how much each boy gets when $18 is shared among 3 boys. We do this by dividing $18 by 3.

\[ \frac{18}{3} = 6 \]

So, each boy gets $6. The eldest boy gets this amount plus an additional $5 the next day.

\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \]

So, the eldest boy has $11. The next day, he adds another $10.

\[ 11 + 10 = 21 \]

So, the eldest boy has $21. He then spends $8.

\[ 21 - 8 = 13 \]

So, the eldest boy has $13 left. He triples the amount he has left after spending the $8.

\[ 13 \times 3 = 39 \]

So, the eldest boy now has $39."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to know how many days are in April. April has 30 days.

2. Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half. So, if we divide the month into two halves, each half has 15 days.

3. Let's say Elvis saves $x in the first half of the month. Then he saves $2x in the second half of the month.

4. The total savings for the month should be $1125. So, the equation for total savings is:
   \[ 15x + 15(2x) = 1125 \]

5. Simplify the equation:
   \[ 15x + 30x = 1125 \]
   \[ 45x = 1125 \]

6. Now, solve for \(x\):
   \[ x = \frac{1125}{45} \]
   \[ x = 25 \]

So, Elvis has to save $25 for each day in the first half of the month. For the second half, he saves twice that amount, which is:
\[ 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save $50 for each day in the second half of the month."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the apples:
- Verna bought 3 apples at $1.50 each.
- So, the cost of apples is 3 * $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the oranges:
- Verna bought 5 oranges at $0.80 each.
- So, the cost of oranges is 5 * $0.80 = $4.00.

Then, let's calculate the cost of the peaches:
- Verna bought 6 peaches at $0.75 each.
- So, the cost of peaches is 6 * $0.75 = $4.50.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the fruits:
- Total cost = cost of apples + cost of oranges + cost of peaches
- Total cost = $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00.

Verna gave $20 to buy the fruits. To find out how much change she received, we subtract the total cost from the amount she gave:
- Change = amount given - total cost
- Change = $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00.

So, the final numerical answer is $7.00."
"First, let's calculate how much Jairus gets for 20 tasks. Jairus gets $0.8 for each task. So for 20 tasks, he gets:

\[ 0.8 \times 20 = 16 \]

Next, let's calculate how much Jenny gets for 20 tasks. Jenny gets $0.5 for each task. So for 20 tasks, she gets:

\[ 0.5 \times 20 = 10 \]

Now, to find out how much more Jairus gets than Jenny, we subtract the amount Jenny gets from the amount Jairus gets:

\[ 16 - 10 = 6 \]

So, Jairus gets $6 more than Jenny."
"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Let's say Brad gets x dollars.
2. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x dollars.
3. The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation: x + 4x = 100.
4. Simplifying the equation, we get 5x = 100.
5. To find x, we divide both sides by 5: x = 100 / 5 = 20.
6. So, Brad gets 20 dollars.
7. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4 * 20 = 80 dollars.

The final numerical answer is 80."
"Jeff walks 3 miles to work and 3 miles back home each day. So each day he walks 3 + 3 = 6 miles.

If he has to work 5 times a week, then he walks 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week.

The final numerical answer is 30."
"The alphabet has 26 letters. Elise writes it in full twice, which is 26 letters x 2 = 52 letters. Then she writes half of it once, which is 26 letters / 2 = 13 letters. She re-writes everything she has already written, which is 52 letters + 13 letters = 65 letters. So, in total, Elise has written 52 letters + 13 letters + 65 letters = 130 letters."
"Let's break this down step by step:

In the first round, Ali calls 3 families.
In the second round, each of the 3 families calls 3 other families, so that's 3 families * 3 = 9 families.
In the third round, each of the 9 families calls 3 other families, so that's 9 families * 3 = 27 families.

Now, we need to find out how many families will be called in the fourth round. Each of the 27 families from the third round will call 3 other families, so that's 27 families * 3 = 81 families.

So, the number of families notified during the fourth round of calls is 81."
"Mark lost 10 pounds each month for 3 months, so he lost a total of 10 * 3 = 30 pounds.

If his final weight was 70 pounds, we can find his initial weight by adding the weight he lost to his final weight. So, his initial weight was 70 + 30 = 100 pounds.

The initial weight of Mark was 100 pounds."
"First, we need to find out how many toys Jonathan needs to have to make a sorted play set that is five times larger than James's play set.

James's play set has 80 toys. So, five times larger would be:
\[ 80 \times 5 = 400 \text{ toys} \]

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have 400 toys. Let's say Jonathan currently has \( x \) toys. Then:
\[ x + 2 = 400 \]

To find out how many toys Jonathan currently has, we solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 400 - 2 \]
\[ x = 398 \]

So, Jonathan currently has 398 toys."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each item Daniel wants to buy without the discount:

- Five notebooks: 5 * $1.50 = $7.50
- Two pens: 2 * $0.25 = $0.50
- One calculator: $12.00
- One geometry set: $10.00

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items:
$7.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $20.00

The shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items. To find the discount amount, we calculate 10% of $20.00:
10% of $20.00 = 0.10 * $20.00 = $2.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find out how much Daniel has to spend:
$20.00 - $2.00 = $18.00

So, Daniel has to spend $18.00 on all the items he wants to buy."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each item Carly ordered:

- Five hamburgers at $4 each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) dollars
- Ten packs of potato fries at $0.30 each: \(10 \times 0.30 = 3\) dollars
- Five cans of fruit drinks at $2 each: \(5 \times 2 = 10\) dollars

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
\(20 + 3 + 10 = 33\) dollars

Carly gives a fifty-dollar bill, so to find out the change she gets back, we subtract the total cost from fifty dollars:
\(50 - 33 = 17\) dollars

So, the change Carly gets back is 17 dollars."
"First, we need to calculate the commission for the first $1000 of sales. Since Antonella sold goods worth $2500, the first $1000 gets her a 30% commission.

Commission for the first $1000 = $1000 * 30% = $1000 * 0.30 = $300

For the sales over $1000, which is $2500 - $1000 = $1500, she gets an additional 10% commission on top of the initial 30%.

Additional commission for the sales over $1000 = $1500 * 10% = $1500 * 0.10 = $150

Now, we add the two commissions together to find out how much Antonella earned in total.

Total commission = $300 + $150 = $450

So, Antonella earned $450."
"First, let's find out how many bottles Bill has already. He has 2 cases of water and each case has 24 bottles. So, we multiply the number of cases by the number of bottles per case:

2 cases * 24 bottles/case = 48 bottles

Now, Bill wants to have 2 bottles of water for each of his 70 guests. So, we multiply the number of guests by the number of bottles per guest:

70 guests * 2 bottles/guest = 140 bottles

Bill needs 140 bottles of water in total, but he already has 48 bottles. To find out how many more bottles he needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles he needs:

140 bottles needed - 48 bottles he has = 92 bottles

So, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water."
"First, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile when the water is warm. We know that when the water is cold, it takes Ray 16 minutes to swim a mile. When the water is warm, it takes him 2 minutes more than twice as long as it does in cold water. So, we calculate twice the cold time and then add 2 minutes:

2 * 16 = 32 minutes
32 + 2 = 34 minutes

So, it takes Ray 34 minutes to swim a mile in warm water.

Now, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water:

Cold water: 16 minutes per mile * 3 miles = 48 minutes
Warm water: 34 minutes per mile * 3 miles = 102 minutes

To find out how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day, we subtract the time it takes in cold water from the time it takes in warm water:

102 minutes - 48 minutes = 54 minutes

So, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day."
"First, let's find out how much money John makes in one day. He gets paid $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day, so:

$2/hour * 5 hours/day = $10/day

Now, let's find out how much money he makes in one week. He works 4 days a week, so:

$10/day * 4 days/week = $40/week

John wants to save $80. To find out how many weeks it will take him, we divide the total amount he wants to save by the amount he makes in one week:

$80 / $40/week = 2 weeks

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80."
"First, we need to find out how much the six-inch cold-cut combo sub costs. If the foot-long fish sub costs $40 and the six-inch cold-cut combo sub costs three times as much, we can calculate the cost of the cold-cut combo sub by multiplying $40 by 3.

Cost of cold-cut combo sub = $40 * 3 = $120

Now, we add the cost of the foot-long fish sub and the cold-cut combo sub to find the total cost.

Total cost = Cost of foot-long fish sub + Cost of cold-cut combo sub
Total cost = $40 + $120 = $160

So, the final numerical answer is $160."
"First, we need to find out how many buttons had four holes. Since there were 21 buttons in total and 7 of them had two holes, we subtract 7 from 21 to find the number of buttons with four holes.

21 - 7 = 14 buttons had four holes.

Next, we calculate the total number of holes. We do this by multiplying the number of buttons with two holes by 2 and the number of buttons with four holes by 4, then adding these two results together.

For the buttons with two holes: 7 buttons * 2 holes = 14 holes.
For the buttons with four holes: 14 buttons * 4 holes = 56 holes.

Now, we add the holes from both types of buttons together:

14 holes + 56 holes = 70 holes.

So, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is 70."
"First, we need to find out how big Zack's locker is. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we divide Timothy's locker size by 2.

Timothy's locker size = 24 cubic inches
Zack's locker size = 24 / 2 = 12 cubic inches

Now, we need to find out how big Peter's locker is. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we divide Zack's locker size by 4.

Zack's locker size = 12 cubic inches
Peter's locker size = 12 / 4 = 3 cubic inches

So, Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches."
"First, we need to find out how many cups of coffee Octavia drinks. The daily recommended cups of coffee is not given, but we know Octavia drinks half of that. So, if we let the daily recommended cups of coffee be \( R \), then Octavia drinks \( \frac{R}{2} \) cups.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, so Juan drinks \( 10 \times \frac{R}{2} = 5R \) cups.

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. This means Juan needs to reduce his coffee intake from \( 5R \) cups to 4 cups.

To find out how many cups Juan must reduce, we subtract the recommended daily intake from the amount he currently drinks:
\[ 5R - 4 \]

Since we don't have the exact value of \( R \), we can't calculate the exact number of cups. But the question asks for the reduction in terms of the recommended daily intake. So, the reduction Juan must make is:
\[ 5R - 4 \]

If we assume \( R = 4 \) (which would make Octavia drink 2 cups and Juan drink 20 cups, but this is just an assumption to fit the doctor's recommendation of 4 cups for Juan), then the reduction would be:
\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \]

So, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups."
"The pet shop had 6 cages of rodents. 

3 cages have 10 hamsters each, so that's 3 * 10 = 30 hamsters.
The other 3 cages have 5 guinea pigs each, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 guinea pigs.

In total, the pet shop had 30 hamsters + 15 guinea pigs = 45 rodents."
"First, let's find out how much Susan weighs. Since Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, we subtract 20 from Mark's weight:

Mark's weight = 150 pounds
Susan's weight = Mark's weight - 20 pounds
Susan's weight = 150 pounds - 20 pounds
Susan's weight = 130 pounds

Now, let's find out how much Bob weighs. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so we multiply Susan's weight by 2:

Bob's weight = 2 * Susan's weight
Bob's weight = 2 * 130 pounds
Bob's weight = 260 pounds

Now we have the weights of all three friends:
- Mark weighs 150 pounds
- Susan weighs 130 pounds
- Bob weighs 260 pounds

To find the average weight, we add up all their weights and then divide by the number of friends:

Total weight = Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight
Total weight = 150 pounds + 130 pounds + 260 pounds
Total weight = 540 pounds

Now we divide the total weight by the number of friends (3):

Average weight = Total weight / Number of friends
Average weight = 540 pounds / 3
Average weight = 180 pounds

So, the final numerical answer is 180 pounds."
"First, we need to understand the movement of the sun relative to the ground. The sun moves 5 degrees up from the pyramid each hour. Over 10 hours, the sun will move:

\[ 5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees} \]

The angle of the great pyramids from the ground is 32 degrees. Since the sun moves 50 degrees up from the pyramid, the angle from the ground to the sun will be the sum of these two angles:

\[ 32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 82 degrees."
"First, we need to find out how old the second son is. Since the second son is 4 years younger than the first son, we subtract 4 from 12:
12 - 4 = 8

So, the first son is 12 years old and the second son is 8 years old.

Next, we need to find the total number of candles James needs. Since he has two sons, he needs 2 candles:
12 + 8 = 20

Now, we need to find out how many packs of candles James needs to buy. Since a pack contains 5 candles, we divide the total number of candles by 5:
20 ÷ 5 = 4

Finally, we need to find out how much James spends. Since each pack costs $3, we multiply the number of packs by $3:
4 × 3 = 12

So, James spends $12 on candles."
"First, let's find out how many minutes Judy read in the first week. She read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week, so:

15 minutes/night * 7 nights/week = 105 minutes/week

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

Now, let's find out how many minutes she read in the second week. We know she reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. To find out how many minutes she reads to read 1 page, we divide 1.5 minutes by 2 pages:

1.5 minutes / 2 pages = 0.75 minutes/page

Now, to find out how many minutes she read to read 100 pages, we multiply 0.75 minutes/page by 100 pages:

0.75 minutes/page * 100 pages = 75 minutes

So, in the second week, she read for 75 minutes.

Now, let's add the minutes she read in the first week and the second week:

105 minutes + 75 minutes = 180 minutes

Since she reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, we can find out how many pages she reads in 180 minutes. First, we find out how many 1.5 minute intervals are in 180 minutes:

180 minutes / 1.5 minutes = 120 intervals

Now, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of pages she reads in each interval:

120 intervals * 2 pages/interval = 240 pages

So, Judy read a total of 240 pages in two weeks."
"Cody ate 12 / 3 = 4 sandwiches.
Trevor ate 12 / 4 = 3 sandwiches.
So, they ate a total of 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches.
Therefore, the number of sandwiches left is 12 - 7 = 5 sandwiches.
The final answer is 5 sandwiches."
"First, let's figure out how old Shiloh will be in 7 years. If Shiloh is 44 years old today, in 7 years he will be:

44 + 7 = 51 years old.

In 7 years, Shiloh will be 51 years old, and he will be three times as old as his nephew. So, if we let the nephew's age in 7 years be \( x \), then:

\[ 51 = 3x \]

To find \( x \), we divide 51 by 3:

\[ x = \frac{51}{3} = 17 \]

So, in 7 years, the nephew will be 17 years old. To find the nephew's current age, we subtract 7 years from 17:

\[ 17 - 7 = 10 \]

Therefore, the nephew is 10 years old today."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. For the first tooth, the tooth fairy gave $5.00.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave $1.00 each. So for three teeth, that's $1.00 * 3 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of money per tooth as the previous three teeth. Since each of the previous three teeth was $1.00, half of that is $0.50. So for two teeth, that's $0.50 * 2 = $1.00.

Now, let's add it all up:
- First tooth: $5.00
- Next three teeth: $3.00
- Last two teeth: $1.00

Total money given by the tooth fairy = $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00

So, the tooth fairy left Sharon $9.00."
"First, let's find out how many goals Mark scored. Since Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark and Richie scored 80 goals, we can subtract 20 from 80 to find out how many goals Mark scored.

80 - 20 = 60

So, Mark scored 60 goals.

Next, let's find out how many goals Anna scored. Since Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna and Richie scored 80 goals, we can subtract 45 from 80 to find out how many goals Anna scored.

80 - 45 = 35

So, Anna scored 35 goals.

Now, to find out how many goals all three teenagers scored, we add the goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna together.

Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals = Total goals
80 + 60 + 35 = 175

So, all three teenagers scored a total of 175 goals."
"First, we need to find out how much Mitchell made. Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 each. So, we multiply the number of lemonades by the price per lemonade:

\[ 21 \text{ lemonades} \times 4 \text{ dollars/lemonade} = 84 \text{ dollars} \]

Liam made $63. To find out how many more dollars Mitchell made than Liam, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings:

\[ 84 \text{ dollars} - 63 \text{ dollars} = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Mitchell made 21 more dollars than Liam. The final numerical answer is:

21"
"First, let's find out how much money Peter spends each day. He has $70 and wants to spend the same amount each day for 7 days, so:

\[ \text{Money spent each day} = \frac{\$70}{7 \text{ days}} = \$10 \text{ per day} \]

Now, let's calculate how much he spends on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. There are 4 days (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday) he spends money on wooden action figures. Each wooden action figure costs $5, so:

\[ \text{Money spent on wooden action figures} = 4 \text{ days} \times \$5 \text{ per figure} = \$20 \]

This means he has:

\[ \$70 - \$20 = \$50 \]

left for the rest of the week. For the rest of the week (Thursday through Sunday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. There are 4 days (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday) he spends money on plastic action figures, so:

\[ \text{Number of plastic action figures} = \frac{\$50}{\$2 \text{ per figure}} = 25 \text{ figures} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of action figures he has by the end of the week. He bought 4 wooden action figures and 25 plastic action figures:

\[ \text{Total number of action figures} = 4 + 25 = 29 \]

So, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is:

\[ 29 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Leah got 3 vaccines and each vaccine costs $20. So, the total cost for the vaccines is:
3 vaccines * $20/vaccine = $60

Next, let's calculate the cost of the broken vases. The kitten broke 4 vases and each vase costs $12. So, the total cost for the broken vases is:
4 vases * $12/vase = $48

Now, we add the cost of spaying the kitten, the cost of the vaccines, and the cost of the broken vases to find the total cost:
$200 (spaying) + $60 (vaccines) + $48 (broken vases) = $308

So, the total cost so far is $308."
"First, let's find out how many roses Ford supplies to the flower shops in a week. 

The first flower shop orders 20 roses.
The second flower shop orders 15 roses.
The third flower shop orders 30 roses.

So, in a week, Ford supplies:
20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.

Now, let's find out how many roses Ford grows in a month. There are 4 weeks in a month, so:
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month.

The flower shops need:
20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses/month.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the roses the shops need from the roses Ford grows:
160 roses/month - 65 roses/month = 95 roses/month.

So, Ford lacks 95 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Katina starts with $3000.
2. She removes $100 every month.
3. There are 12 months in a year, so in 2 years, there are 2 * 12 = 24 months.
4. In 24 months, she will remove $100 * 24 = $2400.
5. To find out how much is left, we subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount: $3000 - $2400 = $600.

So, after 2 years, Katina will have $600 left in her account."
"First, let's calculate how many loaves of bread they need to make 10 sandwiches. Since each loaf makes 10 sandwiches, they need 1 loaf of bread for 10 sandwiches.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the bread. Each loaf costs $3.00, so for 1 loaf, it costs $3.00.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the cheese and condiments. They spend $30.00 on cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches.

So, the total cost for 10 sandwiches is the cost of the bread plus the cost of the cheese and condiments:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$3.00 + \$30.00 = \$33.00 \]

They sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each, so the total revenue from selling 10 sandwiches is:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 10 \times \$7.00 = \$70.00 \]

To find the net profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ \text{Net profit} = \$70.00 - \$33.00 = \$37.00 \]

So, the net profit is $37.00."
"First, we need to find out how many crayons Kate has. She has 3 boxes of 64 crayons each. So, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of crayons in each box:

3 boxes * 64 crayons/box = 192 crayons

Next, we need to find out how many crayon muffins she can make. She melts 8 small pieces of crayons together to make one crayon muffin. So, we divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons needed for one muffin:

192 crayons / 8 crayons/muffin = 24 muffins

Now, if she sells each muffin for $1.50, we can find out how much money she can make by multiplying the number of muffins by the price per muffin:

24 muffins * $1.50/muffin = $36.00

So, the final numerical answer is $36.00."
"First, let's calculate the area of Michael's bedroom:
- The bedroom measures 18 feet by 12 feet.
- Area = length × width = 18 × 12 = 216 square feet.

Next, we calculate the cost for each part of the process:
1. Cost of new carpet:
   - Cost per square foot of new carpet = $12
   - Total cost for new carpet = 216 × $12 = $2592

2. Cost of padding:
   - Cost per square foot of padding = $2
   - Total cost for padding = 216 × $2 = $432

3. Cost to remove the old carpet:
   - Cost per square foot to remove old carpet = $4
   - Total cost to remove old carpet = 216 × $4 = $864

4. Cost to install the new carpet:
   - Cost per square foot to install new carpet = $34
   - Total cost to install new carpet = 216 × $34 = $7344

Now, we add all these costs together to find the total cost:
- Total cost = cost of new carpet + cost of padding + cost to remove old carpet + cost to install new carpet
- Total cost = $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $11232

So, the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet is $11232."
"To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to add up all the birds he saw and then divide by the number of days.

First, let's add up all the birds:
- Day 1 and Day 2: 50 birds
- Day 3: 0 birds
- Day 4 and Day 5: 120 birds
- Day 6: 20 birds
- Day 7: 90 birds

So, the total number of birds is:
50 (Day 1) + 50 (Day 2) + 0 (Day 3) + 120 (Day 4) + 120 (Day 5) + 20 (Day 6) + 90 (Day 7) = 450 birds

Now, we count the number of days:
- Day 1
- Day 2
- Day 3
- Day 4
- Day 5
- Day 6
- Day 7

There are 7 days in total.

To find the average, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days:
450 birds ÷ 7 days = 64.2857 birds per day

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the average number of birds Mack saw in a day is 64 birds."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Diane gave a starting value of 20 to the number train.
2. This starting value plus half the number was divided by 5.
3. The resulting value was multiplied by the starting value minus 12.

Let's start with the first step:
- The starting value is 20.
- Half of the starting value is \(20 \div 2 = 10\).
- Adding this to the starting value gives \(20 + 10 = 30\).
- Now, we divide this sum by 5: \(30 \div 5 = 6\).

Next, we use this result in the next step:
- The starting value minus 12 is \(20 - 12 = 8\).
- We multiply the result from the previous step by this value: \(6 \times 8 = 48\).

So, the final value of the number train is 48."
"The boy has 5 cards.
His brother has 3 fewer cards, so his brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

Together, they have 5 + 2 = 7 cards.

"To solve this, we need to find the percentage by which the oven is off and then use that percentage to find the correct temperature for 520 degrees.

First, let's find the percentage by which the oven is off when set to 450 degrees. The actual temperature is 468 degrees.

The difference is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees.

The percentage off is (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.

Now, we need to apply this 4% off to the 520 degrees.

4% of 520 is (4 / 100) * 520 = 20.8 degrees.

So, Maggie should set the oven to 520 - 20.8 = 499.2 degrees.

The final numerical answer is 499.2."
"First, let's convert the time of the first movie into minutes. The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 1 hour and 30 minutes is 60 + 30 = 90 minutes.

Next, let's convert the time of the second movie into minutes. The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Since 2 hours is 2 * 60 = 120 minutes, 2 hours and 5 minutes is 120 + 5 = 125 minutes.

Now, we add the time of the first movie and the second movie together to find the total time Max will spend watching the movies. So, 90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes.

The final numerical answer is 215."
"First, we need to find out how much Juan's house is worth. If Herb's house is worth $76,000 and Juan's house is 30% less expensive, we can calculate the price of Juan's house by subtracting 30% of $76,000 from $76,000.

30% of $76,000 is calculated as:
\[ 0.30 \times 76,000 = 22,800 \]

So, Juan's house is worth:
\[ 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200 \]

Now, to find the combined value of both houses, we add the value of Herb's house and Juan's house:
\[ 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200 \]

So, the value of the two houses combined is $129,200."
"First, let's figure out how many cups and dishes Judy bought.

Judy bought a dozen cups. A dozen means 12 cups.
She bought twice as many dishes as cups. So, if she bought 12 cups, she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Now, let's find out how many dishes her friend brought. Her friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy. So, her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

Judy's friend brought 40 cups, and Judy brought 12 cups. So, the total number of cups brought by both is 40 + 12 = 52 cups.

Judy's friend brought 44 dishes, and Judy brought 24 dishes. So, the total number of dishes brought by both is 44 + 24 = 68 dishes.

To find the total number of utensils (cups and dishes) brought by both, we add the total number of cups and the total number of dishes:
52 cups + 68 dishes = 120 utensils.

So, the final numerical answer is 120."
"First, let's find out the cost of one box of contacts after the discount.

The original price of one box is $100.00. With a 10% discount, the discount amount is:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the price of one box after the discount is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

Now, Pete is buying 2 boxes. The total cost for 2 boxes is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

There are 90 single use contacts in one box, so in 2 boxes, there are:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \]

To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

So, the cost of each pair of contacts is $1.00."
"First, let's calculate how much Jill earned.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so she worked a total of 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Since she was paid $10 an hour, she earned 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.

Now, let's calculate how much John earned.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday.

John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday.

So, John worked a total of 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Since he was also paid $10 an hour, he earned 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

So, John earned $40 more than Jill."
"First, we need to find out how many calories Hannah burns doing aerobics and running.

For aerobics:
- She does aerobics for 2 hours.
- She burns 500 calories per hour.
- So, she burns 2 * 500 = 1000 calories from aerobics.

For running:
- She runs for 1 hour.
- She burns 600 calories per hour.
- So, she burns 1 * 600 = 600 calories from running.

Now, we add the calories burned from aerobics and running:
- Total calories burned = 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. So, we need to find out how many 200 calorie units are in 1600 calories:
- Number of 200 calorie units in 1600 calories = 1600 / 200 = 8 units.

Since each 200 calorie unit requires 100 ml of water, we multiply the number of units by 100 ml:
- Total ml of water needed = 8 * 100 = 800 ml.

The final numerical answer is 800 ml."
"First, let's understand the information given:
- The jar contains 4500 jelly beans in total.
- The number of red jelly beans is 1% less than the number of blue jelly beans.
- The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans.

Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \).

Then, the number of red jelly beans would be \( B - 0.01B = 0.99B \).
And the number of green jelly beans would be \( B + 0.01B = 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of red, blue, and green jelly beans:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining the terms on the left side:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 3B = 4500 \]

Now, solve for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

So, the number of blue jelly beans is 1500.

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
- Red jelly beans: \( 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \)
- Green jelly beans: \( 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \)

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans:
\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 30 \]"
"First, let's find out the increase in words per minute (WPM) that Jared has achieved. He started at 47 WPM and then increased to 52 WPM. The increase is:

52 WPM - 47 WPM = 5 WPM

Jared continues to increase his typing speed by 5 WPM. So, the next measurement would be:

52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM

Now, we have three measurements: 47 WPM, 52 WPM, and 57 WPM. To find the average, we add these numbers together and then divide by the number of measurements.

47 + 52 + 57 = 156

Now, we divide the total by 3:

156 ÷ 3 = 52

So, the average of the three measurements is 52 WPM."
"First, let's calculate how much weight Martin will lose if he eats Cheerios every day for 5 weeks. If he loses 1.25 pounds each week, then in 5 weeks he will lose:

\[ 1.25 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 6.25 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, let's calculate how much weight Martin will gain if he eats donuts every day for 5 weeks. If he gains 1.75 pounds each week, then in 5 weeks he will gain:

\[ 1.75 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 8.75 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, to find the difference in his weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options, we subtract the weight loss from the weight gain:

\[ 8.75 \text{ pounds} - 6.25 \text{ pounds} = 2.5 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the difference in his weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options is 2.5 pounds."
"First, let's calculate the number of people Alex will have at the event based on the invitations.

Alex invites 100 people. Each of these 100 people invites 2 friends. So, the number of friends invited is:
\[ 100 \times 2 = 200 \]

Next, Alex calls 10 friends and 8 of them bring their spouses. So, the number of people from these 10 friends who will be attending is:
\[ 8 \]

Now, let's add up all the people Alex will have at the event:
\[ 100 \text{ (Alex's invited people)} + 200 \text{ (friends' invited friends)} + 8 \text{ (friends with spouses)} = 308 \]

So, Alex will need 308 seats."
"First, let's find out how much the Dachshund weighs. Since the Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, and the Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds, the Dachshund weighs:
\[ 10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we find out how much the Papillon weighs. The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so:
\[ 20 \div 4 = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we know the Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon. So, the Mastiff weighs:
\[ 5 \times 44 = 220 \text{ pounds} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 220 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost for Amazon.com:
- The boots cost $16.
- Shipping costs $4.
So, the total cost on Amazon.com is $16 + $4 = $20.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for eBay:
- The boots cost $13.
- Shipping costs twice as much as on Amazon, so it's 2 * $4 = $8.
So, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

Now, let's find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon:
- The cost on eBay is $21.
- The cost on Amazon is $20.
So, the difference is $21 - $20 = $1.

The boots are $1 more expensive on eBay."
"First, let's figure out how tall the beanstalk is each day. We know it starts at 4 feet and doubles every day. We need to find out how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than 20 feet.

Day 0: 4 feet
Day 1: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
Day 2: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
Day 3: 16 * 2 = 32 feet

On the third day, the beanstalk is 32 feet tall, which is taller than the 20 feet Mark's window is off the ground.

So, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window."
"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, find out how much protein is in 100 grams of mushrooms. We know it's 3 grams of protein.
2. Then, find out how much protein is in 200 grams of mushrooms. Since 200 grams is twice as much as 100 grams, we need to double the protein amount. So, 200 grams of mushrooms will have 3 grams of protein * 2 = 6 grams of protein.
3. Now, we know John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. So, he gets 6 grams of protein every day.
4. To find out how much protein he gets in a week, we multiply the daily protein amount by 7 (days in a week). So, 6 grams of protein * 7 days = 42 grams of protein.

The final numerical answer is 42 grams of protein per week."
"To solve this, let's think about it step by step.

1. Let's say Jerry's age 5 years ago was X.
2. So, Jerry's current age is X + 5.
3. According to the question, Jerry's current age is twice his age 5 years ago. So, we can write the equation: X + 5 = 2X.
4. Solving the equation, we get: X = 5.
5. This means Jerry's age 5 years ago was 5, so his current age is 5 + 5 = 10.
6. In 3 years, Jerry will be 10 + 3 = 13 years old.

So, the final numerical answer is 13."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

George needs 2 implants. Each implant costs $2000.
So, the cost for 2 implants is: 2 * $2000 = $4000.

For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500.
So, the total cost for the implants and the porcelain crown is: $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already put down a deposit of $600.
So, the remaining amount he needs to pay is: $4500 - $600 = $3900.

George makes $15 per hour at work.
To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
$3900 / $15 per hour = 260 hours.

So, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work."
"To solve this, let's call the smallest angle x degrees. 

According to the question, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it's 2x degrees. The other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it's 3x degrees.

The sum of all angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So we can write the equation:
x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combining like terms, we get:
6x = 180

To find x, we divide both sides by 6:
x = 180 / 6
x = 30

Now we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The largest angle is three times the smallest angle, so:
3x = 3 * 30 = 90 degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees."
"First, we need to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy with the money he has. We need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents.

Colby has:
- 8 quarters, each worth 25 cents, so 8 * 25 = 200 cents
- 6 dimes, each worth 10 cents, so 6 * 10 = 60 cents
- 14 nickels, each worth 5 cents, so 14 * 5 = 70 cents
- 15 pennies, each worth 1 cent, so 15 * 1 = 15 cents

Now, we add all these amounts together to find the total amount of money Colby has in cents:
200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents

Each gumball costs 5 cents, so we divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy:
345 ÷ 5 = 69

So, Colby can buy 69 gumballs."
"To solve this, let's count the legs of each type of pet:

Dogs have 4 legs each. So, 5 dogs have 5 * 4 = 20 legs.
Cats have 4 legs each. So, 2 cats have 2 * 4 = 8 legs.
Birds have 2 legs each. So, 10 birds have 10 * 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add all the legs together:
20 (from dogs) + 8 (from cats) + 20 (from birds) = 48 legs in total.

So, the total number of legs in the pet store is 48."
"First, we need to find out what 50% of 8 pounds is. To do this, we calculate 8 * 0.50 = 4 pounds.

So, Jamaal increases the weight by 4 pounds, making it 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.

Since the weight is too heavy, he uses a weight two pounds lighter than 12 pounds. So, we subtract 2 from 12, which gives us 12 - 2 = 10 pounds.

Therefore, the weight that Jamaal now uses is 10 pounds."
"Steve starts with 5 games. He gets 5 more games for his birthday, so he has 5 + 5 = 10 games.

For the first year, he saves up to buy 1 game per month, so he buys 12 games in the first year. Adding these to his collection, he has 10 + 12 = 22 games.

In the second year, he buys 2 games per month, so he buys 24 games in the second year. Adding these to his collection, he has 22 + 24 = 46 games.

In the third year, he buys 4 games per month, so he buys 48 games in the third year. Adding these to his collection, he has 46 + 48 = 94 games.

He also gets 5 games for Christmas every year, so for 3 years, he gets 5 * 3 = 15 games.

Adding the Christmas games to his collection, he has 94 + 15 = 109 games.

So, the final numerical answer is 109."
"First, we need to find out the speed of the plane. Speed is calculated by dividing the distance by the time. So, the plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours. 

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Speed = 400 miles per hour

Now, we need to find out how many hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

So, it would take 5 additional hours to travel an additional 2000 miles."
"First, let's find out how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz makes in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we divide 120 by 2 to find out how much he makes in one hour:

120 pounds / 2 hours = 60 pounds per hour

Now, Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in one hour. So we calculate 3/4 of 60 pounds:

3/4 * 60 pounds = 45 pounds per hour

Now we know that Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour and Marissa makes 45 pounds per hour. Together, they make:

60 pounds + 45 pounds = 105 pounds per hour

If they worked for 12 hours in a day, the total amount of chocolate they made together is:

105 pounds per hour * 12 hours = 1260 pounds

So, the final numerical answer is 1260 pounds."
"First, let's find out how much money Howard spends each day.

On Monday, he spends $8.

On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as he did on Monday, so:
\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as he did on Tuesday, so:
\[ 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add up all the money he spent:
\[ 8 + 16 + 64 = 88 \text{ dollars} \]

He originally had $100. To find out how much money he has left, we subtract the total amount he spent from the original amount:
\[ 100 - 88 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Howard has 12 dollars left."
"First, let's calculate how much Patrick earned in the first four hours.

He sold 15 cups per hour at $0.50 per cup. So, in one hour, he earned:
15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup = $7.50/hour

For four hours, he earned:
$7.50/hour * 4 hours = $30.00

Next, let's calculate how much he earned in the next two hours.

He sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup. So, in one hour, he earned:
10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup = $6.00/hour

For two hours, he earned:
$6.00/hour * 2 hours = $12.00

Now, let's add the earnings from both periods to find the total earnings.

Total earnings = Earnings from first four hours + Earnings from next two hours
Total earnings = $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00

So, Patrick earned $42.00 from selling lemonade for 6 hours."
"First, we need to find out how many times the tires rotate in total for Jeremy's monthly driving.

If the car's tires rotate 725 times for every 2 miles, then for 400 miles, the tires rotate:
\[ \text{Rotations per 400 miles} = \frac{725 \times 400}{2} \]

Let's calculate that:
\[ \text{Rotations per 400 miles} = \frac{725 \times 400}{2} = 362500 \]

So, the tires rotate 362,500 times in a month.

Next, we need to find out how many months the tires can last if each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations.

\[ \text{Months} = \frac{10,440,000}{362,500} \]

Let's calculate that:
\[ \text{Months} = \frac{10,440,000}{362,500} = 28.7 \]

This means the tires can last for 28.7 months. To find out how many years this is, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):

\[ \text{Years} = \frac{28.7}{12} \]

Let's calculate that:
\[ \text{Years} = \frac{28.7}{12} = 2.39166667 \]

Rounding to two decimal places, the tires can last for approximately 2.39 years.

So, the final numerical answer is:
2.39"
"First, we need to find out how many times Jackie can use the shampoo with 1 pump per wash. Since the directions say 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give half as many washings. So, 120 washings / 2 pumps = 60 washings per pump.

The bottle costs $24.00, and we need to find out how much each pump costs in dollars. Since 1 pump gives 60 washings, we divide the total cost by the number of washings 1 pump gives.

$24.00 / 60 washings = $0.40 per washing.

Since 1 pump gives 60 washings, we multiply the cost per washing by 60 to find the cost of 1 pump.

$0.40 per washing * 60 washings = $24.00 per pump.

To convert this to cents, we know that $1.00 is equal to 100 cents. So, $24.00 is equal to 24 * 100 cents.

24 * 100 cents = 2400 cents.

So, the final numerical answer is 2400 cents."
"First, we need to calculate the discount on the shirt and the shorts.

The shirt originally costs $25 and there is a 30% off sale.
So, the discount on the shirt is 30% of $25, which is:
\[ 0.30 \times 25 = 7.50 \]

Subtracting the discount from the original price of the shirt:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

The shorts originally cost $35 and there is a 30% off sale.
So, the discount on the shorts is 30% of $35, which is:
\[ 0.30 \times 35 = 10.50 \]

Subtracting the discount from the original price of the shorts:
\[ 35 - 10.50 = 24.50 \]

Now, we add the discounted prices of the shirt and the shorts to find the total cost of the outfit:
\[ 17.50 + 24.50 = 42.00 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. After buying the outfit, the amount of money he will have left is:
\[ 50 - 42 = 8 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"First, we need to find out how many dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a day. He wants to make 4 dozen a day.

Next, we need to find out how many dozens of croissants he wants to make in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, he wants to make 4 dozen a day for 7 days, which is 4 * 7 = 28 dozen.

Now, we know that it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. So, to find out how many pounds of butter he needs for 28 dozen, we multiply 28 by 1/4.

28 * 1/4 = 7

So, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

The final numerical answer is 7."
"First, we need to calculate the cost to repave Monica's street. Monica's street is 150 meters long, and it costs $194 per meter. So, the cost to repave Monica's street is:

\[ 150 \text{ meters} \times 194 \text{ dollars/meter} = 29100 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street. Lewis' street is 490 meters long, and it also costs $194 per meter. So, the cost to repave Lewis' street is:

\[ 490 \text{ meters} \times 194 \text{ dollars/meter} = 94860 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we subtract the cost of repaving Monica's street from the cost of repaving Lewis' street:

\[ 94860 \text{ dollars} - 29100 \text{ dollars} = 65760 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 65760 \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. John gets $100,000 for the first 5 months.
2. The research takes 10 times longer than the first 5 months, so it takes 10 * 5 = 50 months in total.
3. The first 5 months cost $100,000 each.
4. The next 45 months (50 months total - 5 months already spent) cost 50% more each month.

Let's calculate the cost for the next 45 months:

- The cost for the first month after the first 5 months is $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000.
- The cost for the second month is also $150,000.
- The cost for the third month is also $150,000.
- The cost for the fourth month is also $150,000.

So, the total cost for the next 45 months is 4 * $150,000 = $600,000.

Now, let's add the cost of the first 5 months to the cost of the next 45 months:

Total cost = $100,000 (first 5 months) + $600,000 (next 45 months) = $700,000.

So, the total cost of John's research is $700,000."
"First, let's calculate the total meat consumed by each player:

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so that's 8 ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, that's 16 ounces.
4. The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they didn't eat any meat.

Now, let's add up the meat consumed by the first three players:

6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces

So, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces."
"To solve this, we need to know how many days are in March. March has 31 days.

If each of the 1000 members posts an average of 3 times a day, then the total number of posts per day for the group is:
1000 members * 3 posts/member/day = 3000 posts/day

Now, to find the total number of posts in March, we multiply the number of posts per day by the number of days in March:
3000 posts/day * 31 days = 93000 posts

So, the total number of posts that the group will have in March is 93000."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Gary does laundry twice a week, so in a year (52 weeks), he does laundry \(52 \times 2 = 104\) times.
2. Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water, so for 104 loads, he uses \(104 \times 20 = 2080\) gallons of water.
3. A gallon of water costs $0.15, so for 2080 gallons, he spends \(2080 \times 0.15 = 312\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is 312."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each item Scarlett bought:

- The aquarium cost $10.00.
- The 2 bags of rocks cost $2.50 each, so 2 bags cost $2.50 × 2 = $5.00.
- The 3 pieces of coral cost $2.00 each, so 3 pieces cost $2.00 × 3 = $6.00.
- The 20 fish cost $0.50 each, so 20 fish cost $0.50 × 20 = $10.00.
- The fish food cost $2.00.

Now, let's add up all the costs:

- Aquarium: $10.00
- Rocks: $5.00
- Coral: $6.00
- Fish: $10.00
- Fish food: $2.00

Total cost = $10.00 + $5.00 + $6.00 + $10.00 + $2.00 = $33.00

So, Scarlett spent $33.00 in total."
"To find out how tall Jane's beanstalk was after 3 weeks, let's add up the growth week by week.

- After the first week, it was 3 inches tall.
- In the second week, it doubled in height. So, 3 inches * 2 = 6 inches.
- In the third week, it grew another 4 inches. So, 6 inches + 4 inches = 10 inches.

So, after 3 weeks, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall."
"First, we need to find out how much meat Prince can sell in one day. Since he sells 15kg of meat every hour and he works 10 hours a day, we can calculate the total meat sold in one day by multiplying these two numbers:

15kg/hour * 10 hours/day = 150kg/day

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for Prince to sell the 750kg of meat from Bill's bull. We can do this by dividing the total weight of the bull by the amount of meat Prince can sell in one day:

750kg / 150kg/day = 5 days

So, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull."
"First, let's find out the total number of seats in the auditorium. There are 4 rows with 18 seats in each row. So, we multiply the number of rows by the number of seats in each row:

4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats

Now, one-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators. So, we calculate one-fourth of 72:

72 seats / 4 = 18 seats occupied by administrators

This means the remaining seats are:

72 seats - 18 seats = 54 seats

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents. So, we calculate one-third of the remaining 54 seats:

54 seats / 3 = 18 seats occupied by parents

The rest of the seats were occupied by the students. So, we subtract the seats occupied by administrators and parents from the total number of seats:

72 seats - 18 seats (administrators) - 18 seats (parents) = 36 seats occupied by students

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is 36."
"First, let's find out how many street lights are there in total.

Each pole has 4 street lights, and there are 6 poles at each intersection. So, at one intersection, the number of street lights is:
\[ 4 \text{ lights/pole} \times 6 \text{ poles} = 24 \text{ lights} \]

Since there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights in all intersections is:
\[ 24 \text{ lights/intersection} \times 4 \text{ intersections} = 96 \text{ lights} \]

Now, we know that 20 of these lights are not working. So, the number of functioning street lights is:
\[ 96 \text{ lights} - 20 \text{ lights} = 76 \text{ lights} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 76 \]"
"First, we need to find out how many times each DVD can still be played.

For the first DVD:
1000 times (total) - 356 times (played) = 644 times left

For the second DVD:
1000 times (total) - 135 times (played) = 865 times left

Now, we add the remaining times both DVDs can be played:
644 times + 865 times = 1509 times

So, the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is 1509."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks.
2. Each week, he went twice for 2 hours at a time.
3. So, each week he spent 2 * 2 = 4 hours at physical therapy.
4. The cost per hour is $125.

Now, let's calculate the total cost:

- Total hours per week = 4 hours
- Total weeks = 6 weeks
- Cost per hour = $125

Total cost = Total hours per week * Total weeks * Cost per hour
Total cost = 4 * 6 * 125

Now, let's do the multiplication:

4 * 6 = 24
24 * 125 = 3000

So, the total cost of the physical therapy is $3000."
"First, let's figure out how many pieces of gum Jim chews during the day.

Jim is at school for 8 hours. He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. So, he chews:
\[ \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours/piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces} \]

He also chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner. So, he chews:
\[ 1 \text{ piece} + 1 \text{ piece} = 2 \text{ pieces} \]

Adding these together, Jim chews:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces} + 2 \text{ pieces} = 6 \text{ pieces} \]

Jim started with a 20 pack of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has:
\[ 20 \text{ pieces} - 6 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

Then, he gives half of the remaining pieces to his sister. So, he gives:
\[ \frac{14 \text{ pieces}}{2} = 7 \text{ pieces} \]

After giving 7 pieces to his sister, Jim has:
\[ 14 \text{ pieces} - 7 \text{ pieces} = 7 \text{ pieces} \]

So, the final number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day is:
\[ 7 \]"
"To find out how old Charmaine will be 4 years from now, we first need to determine her current age. If she will be 16 years old in 12 years, we can subtract 12 from 16 to find her current age.

16 - 12 = 4

So, Charmaine is currently 4 years old. To find out how old she will be 4 years from now, we add 4 to her current age.

4 + 4 = 8

Therefore, Charmaine will be 8 years old 4 years from now."
"First, let's calculate how much the baseball coach spent. He bought 9 baseballs at $3 each, so:

9 baseballs * $3/baseball = $27

Now, let's calculate how much the basketball coach spent. He bought 8 basketballs at $14 each, so:

8 basketballs * $14/basketball = $112

To find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we subtract the amount the baseball coach spent from the amount the basketball coach spent:

$112 - $27 = $85

So, the basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach."
"First, we need to find out how many flowers Arianna planted in total. She has 10 rows of flowers with 20 flowers in each row. So, we multiply the number of rows by the number of flowers in each row:

10 rows * 20 flowers/row = 200 flowers

Now, we know that 4/5 of these flowers have bloomed. To find out how many flowers have bloomed, we multiply the total number of flowers by 4/5:

200 flowers * 4/5 = 160 flowers

So, the number of flowers that have bloomed in Arianna's garden is 160."
"First, we need to convert Ashley's internet speed from kb per second to Mb per second. Since 1 Mb is equal to 1000 kb, we divide the kb per second by 1000 to get Mb per second.

Ashley's speed in Mb per second is:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ kb/s}}{1000} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \]

Next, we need to find out how many seconds are in an hour. There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so:
\[ 60 \text{ seconds/minute} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 3600 \text{ seconds/hour} \]

Now, to find out Ashley's internet speed in Mb per hour, we multiply her speed in Mb per second by the number of seconds in an hour:
\[ 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \times 3600 \text{ s/hour} = 72 \text{ Mb/hour} \]

So, Ashley’s internet connection speed in Mb per hour is:
\[ 72 \text{ Mb/hour} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days. The tow truck pulled ten cars each day for three days, so:

10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars

Next, we need to calculate the number of cars towed on the last four days. On these days, the tow truck pulled four fewer cars than the first three days, which means:

10 cars - 4 cars = 6 cars/day

Now, we calculate the number of cars towed on the last four days:

6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars

Finally, we add the number of cars towed on the first three days to the number of cars towed on the last four days to get the total number of cars towed that week:

30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars

So, the total number of cars the tow truck towed that week is 54."
"First, we need to convert Adam's height from inches to feet to compare it with the requirement. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert Adam's height as follows:

Adam's height in feet = 40 inches / 12 inches/foot = 3.33 feet

The minimum height required to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. So, Adam needs to grow 0.67 feet more to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

Since Adam grows 2 inches (which is 2/12 feet) every year, we need to find out how many years it will take for him to grow 0.67 feet. We can calculate this by dividing the height Adam needs to grow by how much he grows each year:

Years until Adam is tall enough = 0.67 feet / (2/12 feet/year) = 0.67 / (2/12) = 0.67 * (12/2) = 0.67 * 6 = 4.02

Since Adam can't grow for a fraction of a year, we round up to the next whole number. So, Adam will need to wait 5 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster."
"First, let's find out how much James sold the cars for. He sold 10 cars at $25,000 each, so:
\[ 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000 \]

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars, so the company paid:
\[ 250,000 \times 0.30 = 75,000 \]

Now, let's find out how much James made from selling the cars. He made a 10% commission on the profits. The profit is the selling price minus what the company paid:
\[ 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000 \]

So, James's commission is:
\[ 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 17,500 \]"
"First, we need to find out how many riders can stay upright on the wave. Since only 25% of the riders can stay upright, we calculate:

25% of 100 riders = 0.25 * 100 = 25 riders

Out of these 25 riders, 60% are women. So, we find out how many of these 25 riders are women:

60% of 25 riders = 0.60 * 25 = 15 women

Since the rest of the riders are men, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

25 riders - 15 women = 10 men

So, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is 10."
"First, let's find the price of the gold jewel. We know that the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of a diamond jewel. If a diamond jewel costs $2000, then:

Price of gold jewel = 4/5 * $2000

Now, let's calculate that:

Price of gold jewel = 4/5 * $2000 = $1600

Next, we need to find the price of the silver jewel. We know that the silver jewel costs $400 less than the gold jewel. So:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400

Now, let's calculate that:

Price of silver jewel = $1600 - $400 = $1200

Now we have the prices of all three jewels:
- Diamond jewel: $2000
- Gold jewel: $1600
- Silver jewel: $1200

To find the total price for all three jewels, we add their prices together:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
Total price = $2000 + $1600 + $1200

Now, let's calculate the total price:

Total price = $2000 + $1600 + $1200 = $4800

So, the total price for all three jewels is $4800."
"Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.
He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.
He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.
To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we add the number of each type of stamp together: 16 + 19 + 10 = 45 stamps.
So, the final numerical answer is 45."
"To solve this, we need to figure out how long it will take for Tom to close the gap between him and Bob.

Bob is 75 miles ahead and driving at 55 mph.
Tom is driving at 70 mph.

The difference in their speeds is 70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph. This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour.

To find out how long it will take Tom to close the 75-mile gap, we divide the distance by the rate at which Tom is closing the gap:

75 miles ÷ 15 mph = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"First, we need to find out how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate the number of fish Darren caught as follows:

17 (Naomi's fish) - 6 = 11 (Darren's fish)

Now, we know Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. So, we add 3 to the number of fish Darren caught:

11 (Darren's fish) + 3 = 14 (Tommy's fish)

So, Tommy caught 14 fish."
"First, we need to find out how much each class costs. Manny paid $60 for 10 classes, so we divide $60 by 10 to find the cost per class.

\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{\$60}{10 \text{ classes}} = \$6 \text{ per class} \]

Now, we know that the cost per class is $6, which is less than $10. Since the cost per class is not more than $10, Manny's parents will still sign him up for Karate classes.

Therefore, Manny can miss all the classes without them not signing him up again. The number of classes he can miss is:

\[ 10 \text{ classes} \]

Since the question asks how many classes he can miss before they don't sign him up again, and he can miss all 10 classes, the answer is:

\[ 0 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 0 \]"
"First, we need to find out how many customers Julie processes in a day. Since Julie processes twice as many customers as Jewel, we can calculate this as follows:

Customers processed by Jewel in a day = 50
Customers processed by Julie in a day = 2 * 50 = 100

Now, we add the number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel in a day to find the total number of customers processed in a day:

Total customers processed in a day = Customers processed by Jewel + Customers processed by Julie
Total customers processed in a day = 50 + 100 = 150

To find the total weekly production, we multiply the daily total by the number of days in a week (7 days):

Total weekly production = Total customers processed in a day * 7
Total weekly production = 150 * 7 = 1050

So, the total weekly production for the two is 1050 customers."
"Paisley ran 4 miles.
Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles.
Reggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so Lynn ran 20 - 3 = 17 miles.

The final numerical answer is 17."
"First, we need to find the cost of one apple and one orange.

For apples:
- 4 apples cost $5.20
- So, 1 apple costs $5.20 ÷ 4 = $1.30

For oranges:
- 3 oranges cost $3.30
- So, 1 orange costs $3.30 ÷ 3 = $1.10

Now, we need to find the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges:
- 5 apples cost 5 × $1.30 = $6.50
- 5 oranges cost 5 × $1.10 = $5.50

So, the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges is $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00

The final numerical answer is $12.00."
"To solve this, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole Bob wants to dig. The volume of a rectangular prism (which is what the hole is) is calculated by multiplying its length, width, and depth.

The volume of the hole is:
\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]
\[ \text{Volume} = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ \text{Volume} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Now, we know it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel one cubic foot of earth. So, to find out how long it will take him to shovel 72 cubic feet, we multiply the volume by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot:

\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Volume} \times \text{Time per cubic foot} \]
\[ \text{Total time} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot} \]
\[ \text{Total time} = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

So, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each additional feature:

1. King cab upgrade: $7,500
2. Leather seats: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so $7,500 / 3 = $2,500
3. Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats, so $2,500 - $500 = $2,000
4. Upgraded exterior light package: $1,500

Now, let's add up all the extra costs:
$7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (exterior light package) = $13,500

Now, let's add the base price of the truck to the total extra costs:
$30,000 (base price) + $13,500 (extra costs) = $43,500

So, the total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"First, let's calculate Tim's new salary after the raise. A 5% raise on $20000 is calculated as:
\[ 20000 \times 0.05 = 1000 \]
So, his new salary is:
\[ 20000 + 1000 = 21000 \]

Next, we calculate the bonus. The bonus is half a month's salary, which is:
\[ 20000 \div 2 = 10000 \]

So, his total monthly income after the raise and the bonus is:
\[ 21000 + 10000 = 31000 \]

To find out how much he makes in a year, we multiply his monthly income by 12:
\[ 31000 \times 12 = 372000 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 372000 \]"
"First, let's find out the cost of each item:

1. Cost of one suit: $750
2. Cost of one dress pant: $750 / 5 = $150
3. Cost of one dress shirt: $60

Now, let's calculate the total cost for each type of item:

1. Total cost for suits: 10 suits * $750/suit = $7500
2. Total cost for dress pants: 10 dress pants * $150/dress pant = $1500
3. Total cost for dress shirts: 3 dress shirts/suit * 10 suits * $60/dress shirt = $1800

Now, let's add up all the costs:

Total cost = Cost of suits + Cost of dress pants + Cost of dress shirts
Total cost = $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800

So, the total cost is $10800."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many articles each website publishes in February.

For the news website:
- It publishes an average of 20 articles every day.
- February has 28 days.

So, the total number of articles published by the news website in February is:
\[ 20 \text{ articles/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 560 \text{ articles} \]

For the sister company:
- It publishes an average of 10 articles every day.
- February also has 28 days.

So, the total number of articles published by the sister company in February is:
\[ 10 \text{ articles/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 280 \text{ articles} \]

Now, to find the total number of articles published by both websites together in February, we add the number of articles from each website:
\[ 560 \text{ articles} + 280 \text{ articles} = 840 \text{ articles} \]

So, the total number of articles the two websites published together in February is:
\[ 840 \]"
"First, let's find out how old Steve's wife is. Since Steve is 60 years old and his wife is 4 years older, we add 4 to 60:

60 + 4 = 64

So, Steve's wife is 64 years old.

Now, let's find out how old Steve's son is. Since Steve's son is half as old as his mom, we divide Steve's wife's age by 2:

64 / 2 = 32

So, Steve's son is 32 years old.

Now, let's find out how old Steve's son's wife is. Since Steve's son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, we subtract 3 from Steve's son's age:

32 - 3 = 29

So, Steve's son's wife is 29 years old.

The final numerical answer is 29."
"Each bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each. So, the total weight of flour in one bag is:

8 portions * 2 kilograms/portion = 16 kilograms

For three bags, the total weight of flour would be:

3 bags * 16 kilograms/bag = 48 kilograms

So, the final numerical answer is 48."
"First, we need to calculate how many miles Alisa biked. We do this by multiplying her speed by the time she biked:

Alisa's speed = 12 miles per hour
Alisa's time = 4.5 hours

Alisa's total miles = Alisa's speed × Alisa's time
Alisa's total miles = 12 miles/hour × 4.5 hours
Alisa's total miles = 54 miles

Next, we calculate how many miles Stanley biked. We do this by multiplying his speed by the time he biked:

Stanley's speed = 10 miles per hour
Stanley's time = 2.5 hours

Stanley's total miles = Stanley's speed × Stanley's time
Stanley's total miles = 10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours
Stanley's total miles = 25 miles

Now, we add the miles biked by Alisa and Stanley to find the total:

Total miles = Alisa's total miles + Stanley's total miles
Total miles = 54 miles + 25 miles
Total miles = 79 miles

So, the final numerical answer is 79 miles."
"First, we need to find out how fast Bill can dig through clay. Since he can dig 4 feet/hour through soil, he can dig half that fast through clay, which means he can dig 2 feet/hour through clay.

Now, let's calculate how long it will take him to dig through the soil and the clay.

For the soil:
- He has to dig 24 feet.
- He can dig 4 feet per hour.
- So, it will take him 24 / 4 = 6 hours to dig through the soil.

For the clay:
- He has to dig 8 feet.
- He can dig 2 feet per hour.
- So, it will take him 8 / 2 = 4 hours to dig through the clay.

Now, we add the time it takes to dig through the soil and the clay:
- 6 hours (soil) + 4 hours (clay) = 10 hours.

So, the final numerical answer is 10 hours."
"Howie needs to get cupcakes for himself, his teacher, and his 25 classmates. That makes a total of 27 people. Since he wants to get one vanilla and one chocolate cupcake for each person, he needs to buy 27 vanilla cupcakes and 27 chocolate cupcakes. So, he should buy 27 + 27 = 54 cupcakes in total. 

The final numerical answer is 54."
"First, we need to find out how many likes Fishio had after three weeks. We know that after one week, she had 2000 likes. Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes. So, we calculate the likes after three weeks as follows:

\[ 70 \times 2000 = 140000 \]

This means that after three weeks, Fishio had 140,000 likes. Now, we are told that she received 20,000 more likes recently. To find the total number of likes now, we add these 20,000 likes to the 140,000 likes she had after three weeks:

\[ 140000 + 20000 = 160000 \]

So, the total number of likes Fishio has now is:

\[ 160000 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the pomegranates Clara bought on Tuesday.

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each.
So, the total cost before the discount is: 20 * $20 = $400.

She got $2 off because of the voucher.
So, the final cost for Clara on Tuesday is: $400 - $2 = $398.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pomegranates Sheila bought on the next day.

The price per pomegranate increased to $30.
So, the total cost before the discount is: 20 * $30 = $600.

The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost.
So, the discount amount is: $600 * 10% = $60.

The final cost for Sheila after the discount is: $600 - $60 = $540.

Now, let's find the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila.

The difference is: $540 - $398 = $142.

So, the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $142."
"First, let's find out how much Ariadne earned from selling green hats in the first month. We know that her sales from red hats were $400, which was half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. So, if we let the total amount earned from green hats be \( G \), then:

\[ \frac{1}{2}G = 400 \]

To find \( G \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ G = 400 \times 2 \]
\[ G = 800 \]

So, Ariadne earned $800 from selling green hats in the first month.

Now, let's calculate the total amount she made in the first month. This is the sum of her sales from red and green hats:

\[ \text{Total first month} = 400 + 800 \]
\[ \text{Total first month} = 1200 \]

For the second month, her sales were \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total sales of the first month:

\[ \text{Second month sales} = \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 \]
\[ \text{Second month sales} = 900 \]

Now, let's find the total amount she made in two months:

\[ \text{Total two months} = \text{Total first month} + \text{Second month sales} \]
\[ \text{Total two months} = 1200 + 900 \]
\[ \text{Total two months} = 2100 \]

So, the total amount Ariadne made in two months is $2100."
"James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is 4 hours. But he gets 1 hour free, so he pays for 3 hours.

The first hour costs $15.
The second hour costs $15 * 2 = $30.
The third hour costs $30 * 2 = $60.

So, the total cost is $15 + $30 + $60 = $105.

The final numerical answer is 105."
"Sally's bank account increased from $200 to $420. The increase is $420 - $200 = $220. If her weekly wage should be $300, then the amount withheld from her wage is $300 - $220 = $80.

"First, let's find out how many deviled egg halves Lori needs in total. If each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves and she is inviting 16 guests, then:

\[ 3 \text{ halves/guest} \times 16 \text{ guests} = 48 \text{ halves} \]

Since 2 deviled egg halves make 1 whole egg, we need to find out how many whole eggs are needed for 48 halves:

\[ \frac{48 \text{ halves}}{2 \text{ halves/egg}} = 24 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we need to find out how many dozens of eggs Lori needs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozen} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 2 dozen eggs."
"Shiela has written 1/3 of the 15-page research paper. To find out how many pages she has written, we calculate:

1/3 * 15 = 5 pages

15 - 5 = 10 pages

So, the final numerical answer is 10."
"Mike plans to read 10 pages a day. If the book is 200 pages long, we can find out how many days it will take him to finish by dividing the total number of pages by the number of pages he reads each day.

So, 200 pages ÷ 10 pages/day = 20 days.

Mike will finish his reading 20 days before the deadline."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. The plane costs $150,000.
2. James pays $5000 a month to rent a hanger.
3. He spends twice as much on fuel as he does on renting the hanger, so he spends $5000 * 2 = $10,000 on fuel each month.
4. To find out how much he spends on maintenance for the first year, we add the rent and fuel costs for a year: $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month.
5. For a year, he spends $15,000 * 12 = $180,000 on maintenance.
6. The total cost for the first year is the cost of the plane plus the total maintenance cost: $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000.

So, the final numerical answer is $330,000."
"First, let's find out how long it took to cook pork. Since it took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, and it took 30 minutes to cook rice, we can calculate the time for pork as follows:

Cooking time for pork = Cooking time for rice + 20 minutes
Cooking time for pork = 30 minutes + 20 minutes
Cooking time for pork = 50 minutes

Next, we need to find out the combined cooking time for pork and rice:

Combined cooking time for pork and rice = Cooking time for pork + Cooking time for rice
Combined cooking time for pork and rice = 50 minutes + 30 minutes
Combined cooking time for pork and rice = 80 minutes

Now, we know that beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice:

Cooking time for beans = 1/2 * Combined cooking time for pork and rice
Cooking time for beans = 1/2 * 80 minutes
Cooking time for beans = 40 minutes

Finally, to find out the total cooking time for all the food, we add the cooking times for rice, beans, and pork:

Total cooking time = Cooking time for rice + Cooking time for beans + Cooking time for pork
Total cooking time = 30 minutes + 40 minutes + 50 minutes
Total cooking time = 120 minutes

So, it took Finley 120 minutes to cook all the food."
"First, let's find out how much 1/2 pound of almonds costs. Since 1 pound of almonds costs $10, 1/2 pound would cost half of that, which is $5.

Next, let's find out how much 1/3 pound of walnuts costs. Since 1 pound of walnuts costs $15, 1/3 pound would cost a third of that, which is $5.

Now, let's add the cost of 1/2 pound of almonds and 1/3 pound of walnuts together. That would be $5 + $5 = $10.

Now, let's find out how much 1/5 pound of almonds costs. Since 1 pound of almonds costs $10, 1/5 pound would cost a fifth of that, which is $2.

Next, let's find out how much 1/3 pound of walnuts costs, which we already know is $5.

Now, let's add the cost of 1/5 pound of almonds and 1/3 pound of walnuts together. That would be $2 + $5 = $7.

Finally, let's find out how much more it costs for the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts compared to the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. That would be $10 - $7 = $3.

So, the final numerical answer is $3."
"To solve this, let's think about the legs and heads of the animals.

Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head.
Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.

We know there are 20 heads in total, so there are 20 heads that could be either sheep or geese.

Let's say there are 's' sheep. Then there are 's' heads from sheep and 's' * 4 legs from sheep. The remaining heads are from geese, which would be '20 - s'. Geese have 1 head and 2 legs each, so they contribute '20 - s' * 2 legs.

The total number of legs is 70. So we can write the equation for the legs as:
\[ 4s + 2(20 - s) = 70 \]

Let's solve this equation step by step:
\[ 4s + 40 - 2s = 70 \]
\[ 2s + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2s = 30 \]
\[ s = 15 \]

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm."
"First, let's find out how much the more expensive coffee costs per pound. The more expensive coffee costs 20% more than the normal $5 per pound coffee. So, we calculate 20% of $5:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } \$5 = 0.20 \times \$5 = \$1 \]

So, the more expensive coffee costs:

\[ \$5 + \$1 = \$6 \text{ per pound} \]

Roger needs to buy coffee for a week, and he uses 1 pound of coffee per day. Therefore, he needs to buy:

\[ 7 \text{ pounds of coffee} \]

The total cost for the coffee is:

\[ 7 \text{ pounds} \times \$6 \text{ per pound} = \$42 \]

Roger also buys a donut for $2. So, the total cost for everything is:

"First, let's add up the cost of the items Gus bought:

- 2 bags of chips at $2.00 each: 2 * $2.00 = $4.00
- A bucket of fried chicken: $8.00
- A bottle of soda: $1.00

Now, let's add these amounts together:

$4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00

Gus spent a total of $20.00. To find out how much the apple pie cost, we subtract the total cost of the other items from the total amount spent:

$20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

So, the apple pie cost $7.00."
"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered in a day.

So, we do the following calculation:
Total newspapers delivered = 600
Newspapers to District A = 198
Newspapers to District C = 209

Newspapers to District B = Total newspapers delivered - Newspapers to District A - Newspapers to District C
Newspapers to District B = 600 - 198 - 209

Now, let's do the math:
600 - 198 = 402
402 - 209 = 193

So, James delivers 193 newspapers to District B.

The final numerical answer is 193."
"First, let's find out how many hours John spends in class in total.

He takes the class 4 times a week for 2 hours each time. So, in one week, he spends:
\[ 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ hours} \]

The class meets for 6 weeks, so in total, he spends:
\[ 8 \times 6 = 48 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we know that John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. To find out how many recipes he learns, we divide the total class hours by the number of hours it takes to learn one recipe:
\[ \frac{48}{1.5} = 32 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to find out how many history teachers there are. We know that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers. To find this number, we calculate:

\[ 60\% \text{ of } 150 = \frac{60}{100} \times 150 = 0.60 \times 150 = 90 \]

So, there are 90 history teachers. Since the rest of the teachers are math teachers, we can find the number of math teachers by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[ 150 - 90 = 60 \]

So, there are 60 math teachers. Each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day, we multiply the number of math teachers by the number of hours each teacher sleeps:

\[ 60 \times 6 = 360 \]

So, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 360 hours."
"First, let's find out how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120, we can calculate Kassidy's money as follows:

Kassidy's money = 3/4 * Aurelia's money
Kassidy's money = 3/4 * $120
Kassidy's money = $90

Now, we know Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's money as follows:

Rayna's money = Kassidy's money + $60
Rayna's money = $90 + $60
Rayna's money = $150

Now we have the total amount of money they have together:

Total money = Aurelia's money + Kassidy's money + Rayna's money
Total money = $120 + $90 + $150
Total money = $360

If they decide to add together their money and share equally, each person would get:

Money each = Total money / 3
Money each = $360 / 3
Money each = $120

So, the final numerical answer is $120."

For one muffin:
- Flour: 5 tablespoons
- Sugar: 3 tablespoons
- Salt: 0.25 tablespoons

Total dry ingredients for one muffin = 5 + 3 + 0.25 = 8.25 tablespoons

Now, we multiply this by 16 to find out for 16 muffins:
8.25 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 132 tablespoons

So, Svetlana would need 132 tablespoons of dry ingredients to make 16 muffins."
"First, we need to find out how much candy they have in total. Robert has 3 pounds, Cindy has 5 pounds, and Aaron has 4 pounds. So, we add these amounts together:

3 + 5 + 4 = 12 pounds of candy in total.

Now, they want to share this candy equally among the three of them. To find out how much candy each person will get, we divide the total amount of candy by 3:

12 ÷ 3 = 4 pounds of candy.

So, each of them would have 4 pounds of candy."
"First, let's find out how much Adam spent on candies of type A. He bought 7 candies of type A, and each costs $0.5. So, the total cost for type A candies is:
7 * $0.5 = $3.5

Next, let's find out how much Adam spent on candies of type B. He bought 10 candies of type B, and each costs $0.75. So, the total cost for type B candies is:
10 * $0.75 = $7.5

Now, let's add the cost of type A and type B candies to find the total amount Adam spent:
$3.5 + $7.5 = $11

Adam paid the cashier $15. To find out how much change he got, we subtract the total amount he spent from the amount he paid:

"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know Janey has 21 books.
2. Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has. This can be written as: Janey's books = 2 * Sally's books + 3.
3. We can substitute the number of books Janey has into the equation: 21 = 2 * Sally's books + 3.
4. To find out how many books Sally has, we need to solve for Sally's books. First, we subtract 3 from both sides: 21 - 3 = 2 * Sally's books.
5. This simplifies to: 18 = 2 * Sally's books.
6. Now, we divide both sides by 2 to find out how many books Sally has: 18 ÷ 2 = Sally's books.
7. This gives us: 9 = Sally's books.

So, Sally has 9 books.

The final numerical answer is 9."
"First, we need to convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches because the growth rate is given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot.

So, 20 feet = 20 * 12 inches = 240 inches.

The bamboo grows 30 inches a day. We need to find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches.

The total growth needed is 600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches.

If the bamboo grows 30 inches a day, then the number of days required to grow 360 inches is 360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days.

So, the final answer is 12 days."
"James currently has toys for 4 dogs. He has 8 more dogs now, so he needs toys for 8 more dogs. That's a total of 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.

When he came back, there were twice as many more dogs than when he left, which means there were 8 * 2 = 16 dogs.

So, he needs toys for 16 dogs. Adding the toys he already has, he needs 16 + 4 = 20 toys in total."
"First, let's find out how much Dylan invested. Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount, which is $1200.

Dylan's investment = 2/5 * $1200 = $480

Now, let's find out how much is left after Dylan's investment.

Remaining amount = Total amount - Dylan's investment
Remaining amount = $1200 - $480 = $720

Frances then invested 2/3 of the remaining amount.

Frances's investment = 2/3 * $720 = $480

Now, let's find out how much Skyler invested. Skyler's investment is the rest of the money after Dylan and Frances have invested.

Skyler's investment = Remaining amount - Frances's investment
Skyler's investment = $720 - $480 = $240

So, Skyler's investment was $240."

"First, we need to find out the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults.

Jack weighs 80 kg.
Each of the 8 other adults weighs 80 kg, so together they weigh 8 * 80 kg.

Now let's calculate the total weight:
Total weight of adults = 8 * 80 kg
Total weight of adults = 640 kg

Now we add Jack's weight to the total weight of the adults:
Total weight = Jack's weight + Total weight of adults
Total weight = 80 kg + 640 kg
Total weight = 720 kg

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg. To find out how much they will have exceeded the maximum load, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight:
Exceeded load = Total weight - Maximum load
Exceeded load = 720 kg - 700 kg
Exceeded load = 20 kg

So, they will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg."
"First, let's find out how many cookies Max has. Since Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, and Katarina has 68 cookies, we can find out how many cookies Max has by adding 5 to 68.

68 + 5 = 73

So, Max has 73 cookies.

Next, we know that Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster. To find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has, we subtract 12 from the number of cookies Max has.

73 - 12 = 61

So, the Cookie Monster has 61 cookies.

Now, we know that Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. To find out how many cookies Summer has, we add 23 to the number of cookies Max has.

73 + 23 = 96

So, Summer has 96 cookies.

To find out the total number of cookies they all have, we add the number of cookies each person has.

Katarina's cookies + Max's cookies + the Cookie Monster's cookies + Summer's cookies = Total cookies

68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298

So, the total number of cookies they have is 298."
"To find the original length of the dress, we need to work backwards from the final length of 140cm.

Shania extended the dress by 50% of its original length and then added 20cm. So, if we let the original length of the dress be \( x \) cm, then:

1. The dress was extended by 50% of \( x \), which is \( 0.5x \).
2. Then, 20cm was added to the extended length.

So, the equation for the final length is:
\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms gives:
\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Now, divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} \]
\[ x = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80cm."

1 hour = 60 minutes
Half of 60 minutes = 30 minutes

In ""rabbit"" mode, it takes 40 minutes to mow the whole lawn. Half of the lawn would take half of that time:
40 minutes = 40 minutes
Half of 40 minutes = 20 minutes

Now, we add the time it took to mow each half of the lawn:
30 minutes (turtle mode) + 20 minutes (rabbit mode) = 50 minutes

So, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the lawn."

"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We have one set of twins and one set of triplets. So, we have 2 twins and 3 triplets.
2. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet.
3. The total age of all these children is 44 years.

Let's assume the age of one triplet is T. Then the age of the twin who is 7 years older than that triplet would be T + 7.

Since there are 2 twins and 3 triplets, the total age can be represented as:
\[ 2(T + 7) + 3T = 44 \]

Now, let's solve this equation:
\[ 2T + 14 + 3T = 44 \]
\[ 5T + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5T = 44 - 14 \]
\[ 5T = 30 \]
\[ T = 6 \]

So, the age of one triplet is 6 years. Now, we can find the age of the twin:
\[ T + 7 = 6 + 7 = 13 \]

Therefore, one of the twins is 13 years old.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how many coins Neil saves each month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Neil's coins per month} = \text{Rong's coins per month} + \frac{2}{5} \times \text{Rong's coins per month} \]
\[ \text{Neil's coins per month} = 20 + \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \]
\[ \text{Neil's coins per month} = 20 + 8 \]
\[ \text{Neil's coins per month} = 28 \]

Now, we know Rong saves 20 coins per month and Neil saves 28 coins per month. To find out how many coins they have after ten years, we need to calculate the total number of coins each has saved over ten years.

There are 12 months in a year, so in ten years, there are:
\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of coins Rong has saved in ten years:
\[ \text{Total coins Rong has} = 20 \times 120 \]
\[ \text{Total coins Rong has} = 2400 \]

And the total number of coins Neil has saved in ten years:
\[ \text{Total coins Neil has} = 28 \times 120 \]
\[ \text{Total coins Neil has} = 3360 \]

To find the total number of coins they have together after ten years, we add the total coins Rong has to the total coins Neil has:
\[ \text{Total coins together} = 2400 + 3360 \]
\[ \text{Total coins together} = 5760 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, and each vaccine costs $20. So, the cost of the vaccines is:
2 vaccines * $20/vaccine = $40

Next, we need to find out the cost of the heartworm check. We know that the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as T. So, the cost of the heartworm check is 0.60 * T.

The total bill (T) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
T = $40 + 0.60 * T

To find T, we need to solve this equation. Let's isolate T on one side:
T - 0.60 * T = $40
0.40 * T = $40
T = $40 / 0.40
T = $100

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him. To find out how much he leaves with, we subtract the total bill from the amount he brought:
$125 - $100 = $25

John leaves with $25."
"First, let's find out how much one banana costs. Since one apple costs $0.5 and a banana costs twice as much as an apple, one banana costs $0.5 * 2 = $1.

Next, we find out how much one orange costs. Since oranges are the most expensive and cost three times as much as a banana per piece, one orange costs $1 * 3 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the crate. The crate has 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges.

The cost for the bananas is 5 * $1 = $5.
The cost for the apples is 12 * $0.5 = $6.
The cost for the oranges is 7 * $3 = $21.

Adding these up, the total cost for the crate is $5 + $6 + $21 = $32.

So, the price for such a crate of fruit is $32."
"First, let's find out how many squares of each color there are:

- Red squares: 14
- Blue squares: 14 + 4 = 18
- Green squares: 18 + 6 = 24
- White squares: 24 - 12 = 12

Now, let's add up all the squares to find the total number of squares:

Total squares = Red squares + Blue squares + Green squares + White squares
Total squares = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12

Let's calculate the total number of squares:

Total squares = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is the same as the total number of squares. So, the total area is 68 square feet.

The final numerical answer is:
68"
"First, let's find out how many chairs Mia currently has. We know there are 8 high chairs and the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. So, the number of regular chairs is:

\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

Now, we add the high chairs and the regular chairs to find the total number of chairs Mia currently has:

\[ 40 + 8 = 48 \]

Tomorrow, 42 adults and 15 babies will be attending the function. So, the total number of people attending the function is:

\[ 42 + 15 = 57 \]

To find out how many more chairs Mia needs, we subtract the number of chairs she currently has from the total number of people attending:

\[ 57 - 48 = 9 \]

So, Mia has to get 9 more chairs."
"First, let's find out how many deer are bucks. If 50 percent of the deer are bucks, then:

50% of 50 deer = 0.50 * 50 = 25 bucks

Now, we need to find out how many of these bucks are 8 points. If 20 percent of the bucks are 8 points, then:

20% of 25 bucks = 0.20 * 25 = 5 bucks

So, there are 5 bucks that are 8 points."
"First, let's find out how many points each person has collected.

Adam has 50 points.

Betty collected 30% more than Adam. So, we calculate 30% of 50:
30/100 * 50 = 15
So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. Tom has 30 points, so:
3 * 30 = 90 points for Marta.

Now, let's add up all the points collected by Adam, Betty, and Marta:
50 (Adam) + 65 (Betty) + 90 (Marta) = 205 points.

Tom hasn't collected any points yet, so we add his points to the total:
205 + 30 = 235 points.

The minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points. So, the class is missing:
400 - 235 = 165 points.

The final numerical answer is 165."
"First, let's figure out how many grandchildren Great Grandma Jones has. Since she has three children and each of her children has three grandchildren, we can calculate the number of grandchildren as follows:

3 children * 3 grandchildren each = 9 grandchildren

Now, each of these 9 grandchildren has three great grand-babies. So, we can calculate the number of great grand-babies as follows:

9 grandchildren * 3 great grand-babies each = 27 great grand-babies

So, the final numerical answer is 27."
"First, let's find out how much Greta puts into her retirement account. She puts 50% of her $2400.00 paycheck into her retirement account. 

50% of $2400.00 is calculated as:
\[ \frac{50}{100} \times 2400 = 0.50 \times 2400 = 1200 \]

So, Greta puts $1200.00 into her retirement account.

Next, we calculate how much she uses for her car payment. She uses 20% of her $2400.00 paycheck for her car payment.

20% of $2400.00 is calculated as:
\[ \frac{20}{100} \times 2400 = 0.20 \times 2400 = 480 \]

So, Greta uses $480.00 for her car payment.

Now, we subtract the amounts she put into her retirement account and the amount she used for her car payment from her total paycheck to find out how much money she has left to spend.

Total paycheck: $2400.00
Amount for retirement: $1200.00
Amount for car payment: $480.00

Money left to spend:
\[ 2400 - 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

So, Greta has $720.00 left to spend."
"If there are 4 pencils missing, then there are 20 - 4 = 16 pencils in the box. Since a pair consists of 2 pencils, the number of pairs in the box is 16 / 2 = 8 pairs."
"First, let's calculate the total number of fireworks in the display:

15 boxes of 20 fireworks each:
15 * 20 = 300 fireworks

Next, let's calculate the number of fireworks in the 3 boxes in her backyard:
3 * 5 = 15 fireworks

Now, let's add the fireworks from the display and the backyard:
300 + 15 = 315 fireworks

Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks. To find out how many fireworks that is, we calculate 40% of 315:
40% of 315 = 0.40 * 315 = 126 fireworks

So, the total number of fireworks Hannah will see is 126."
"First, let's find out how many people are in the group. Aiden and his 12 friends are 13 people, and they meet up with 7 more friends. So, the total number of people is 13 + 7 = 20 people.

Each person gets one drink and three snacks. So, for 20 people, the number of drinks needed is 20, and the number of snacks needed is 20 * 3 = 60.

Drinks cost $2 each, so the total cost for drinks is 20 * $2 = $40.

Snacks cost $2 each, so the total cost for snacks is 60 * $2 = $120.

To find the total amount spent on snacks and drinks, we add the cost of drinks and the cost of snacks: $40 + $120 = $160.

So, the group has spent $160 overall on snacks and drinks."
"First, let's find out how much Gordy's truck can haul. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, we can calculate Gordy's truck capacity as follows:

Gordy's truck capacity = Gissela's truck capacity + 800 pounds
Gordy's truck capacity = 4,000 pounds + 800 pounds
Gordy's truck capacity = 4,800 pounds

Now, we know that when all three trucks are combined, they can haul 11,600 pounds of gravel. We already know the capacities of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks, so we can find out how much Gary's truck can haul by subtracting the capacities of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity.

Gary's truck capacity = Total capacity - (Gissela's truck capacity + Gordy's truck capacity)
Gary's truck capacity = 11,600 pounds - (4,000 pounds + 4,800 pounds)
Gary's truck capacity = 11,600 pounds - 8,800 pounds
Gary's truck capacity = 2,800 pounds

So, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel."
"Each female ate 3 dumplings, so 6 females ate a total of 6 times 3, which is 18 dumplings.

Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, each male ate 3 plus 1, which is 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males, so 8 males ate a total of 8 times 4, which is 32 dumplings.

Larry cooked a total of 18 dumplings for the females plus 32 dumplings for the males, which is 18 + 32 = 50 dumplings.

So, the final answer is 50 dumplings."
"First, we need to find out how much money Gerald and Julia each got from the $100.

The total ratio is 3 + 2 = 5 parts.

Gerald's share is 3 parts out of 5, so we calculate:
\[ \text{Gerald's share} = \frac{3}{5} \times 100 = 60 \]

Julia's share is 2 parts out of 5, so we calculate:
\[ \text{Julia's share} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

Now, Gerald spent $10 on a book, so we subtract that from his share:
\[ \text{Gerald's money left} = 60 - 10 = 50 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
50"
"First, we need to find out how fast the turtle is. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, we divide the cat's speed by 5 to find the turtle's speed.

Cat's speed = 15 feet/second
Turtle's speed = Cat's speed / 5 = 15 / 5 = 3 feet/second

Now, we need to find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds.

Turtle's distance in 40 seconds = Turtle's speed * Time
Turtle's distance in 40 seconds = 3 feet/second * 40 seconds = 120 feet

So, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"First, we need to find out how much money the firefighters have raised per hour. They raised $2100 in 3 hours, so we divide $2100 by 3 to find out how much they raise each hour.

$2100 ÷ 3 = $700 per hour

Now, we know their goal is $6300 and they have already raised $2100. So, we need to find out how much more they need to raise:

$6300 - $2100 = $4200

Since they raise $700 per hour, we divide the remaining amount by $700 to find out how many more hours they need to raise the rest of the money:

$4200 ÷ $700 = 6 hours

They have already raised money for 3 hours, so we add those to the 6 hours they need to raise the rest:

3 hours + 6 hours = 9 hours

So, the total number of hours they have to raise money to reach their goal is 9 hours."
"First, we need to find out what percentage of the river's total water is used for industrial purposes by Colorado City. We know that Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River, and 80% of that water is used for industrial purposes.

To find out how much of the total river water is used for industrial purposes by Colorado City, we multiply the percentage of the river's water used by Colorado City by the percentage used for industrial purposes:

\[ 40\% \times 80\% = 0.40 \times 0.80 = 0.32 \]

So, 32% of the river's total water is used for industrial purposes by Colorado City.

To find out what percentage of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from the percentage used by the city:

\[ 40\% - 32\% = 8\% \]

So, 8% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

The final numerical answer is:
8%"

1. Calculate the cost for one week:
   - Alex charges $12 per day.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - So, for one week, the cost is $12/day * 7 days = $84.

2. Now, calculate the cost for two weeks:
   - For two weeks, the cost is $84/week * 2 weeks = $168.

So, the final numerical answer is $168."
"First, let's find out how much ice cream the factory makes in one hour.

For chocolate ice cream:
- 100 quarts in 2 hours means the factory makes 100 / 2 = 50 quarts per hour.

For vanilla ice cream:
- 50 quarts in 4 hours means the factory makes 50 / 4 = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, let's calculate how much ice cream the factory makes in 48 hours.

For chocolate ice cream in 48 hours:
- 50 quarts per hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts.

For vanilla ice cream in 48 hours:
- 12.5 quarts per hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts.

Finally, to find the total quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours:
- 2400 quarts (chocolate) + 600 quarts (vanilla) = 3000 quarts.

So, the final numerical answer is 3000 quarts."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of baked good:

- Croissants: 5 croissants at $3.00 each = 5 * $3.00 = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each = 4 * $2.50 = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches at $4.00 each = 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each = 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the baked goods:

Total cost = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $40.00

Marcus gets a 10% discount on his purchase. To find the discount amount:

Discount amount = 10% of $40.00 = 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final bill:

Final bill = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

So, Marcus' total bill is $36.00."
"First, let's understand the deal: for every 2 scoops you buy, you get 1 scoop for free. So, for every 3 scoops, you only pay for 2.

Each scoop costs $1.50.

Erin has $6.00.

To find out how many scoops she can get, we need to divide her money by the cost of one scoop and then consider the deal.

$6.00 ÷ $1.50 = 4 scoops she can buy.

Now, using the deal, for every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 free. So, if she buys 4 scoops, she gets 2 free scoops (because 4 divided by 2 is 2).

So, in total, she can get 4 (bought) + 2 (free) = 6 scoops of ice cream.

The final numerical answer is:
6"
"First, let's find out how much candy Ginger eats in two weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so in two weeks, there are 14 days. Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats:
4 pieces/day * 14 days = 56 pieces

Now, let's find out how much candy Amy eats in two weeks. Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats:
3 pieces/day * 14 days = 42 pieces

Now, let's see how much candy they have left after two weeks. Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 56 pieces, so she has:
100 pieces - 56 pieces = 44 pieces left

Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 42 pieces, so she has:
100 pieces - 42 pieces = 58 pieces left

To find out how much more candy Amy has than Ginger after two weeks, we subtract the number of pieces Ginger has from the number of pieces Amy has:
58 pieces - 44 pieces = 14 pieces

So, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy after two weeks."
"First, we need to find out how many square feet two thirds of Mr. Boarden's bathroom is. His bathroom is 36 square feet, so we calculate two thirds of 36 square feet.

\[ \text{Two thirds of 36 sq ft} = \frac{2}{3} \times 36 = 24 \text{ sq ft} \]

Now, we know that for every square foot, Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles. So, for 24 square feet, we multiply 24 square feet by 24 mosaic tiles per square foot.

\[ 24 \text{ sq ft} \times 24 \text{ tiles/sq ft} = 576 \text{ tiles} \]

So, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom."
"First, let's calculate how much James spent picking the blueberries.

He paid a flat fee of $20 to go picking.
He also paid $1.5 for each pound of blueberries he picked.
He picked 30 pounds of blueberries.

So, the cost for the blueberries he picked is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.5 \text{ per pound} = \$45 \]

Adding the flat fee, the total cost for James is:
\[ \$20 + \$45 = \$65 \]

Next, let's calculate how much it would cost James to buy the same 30 pounds of blueberries at the store.

The store sells blueberries at $2.5 per pound.
So, the cost at the store would be:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.5 \text{ per pound} = \$75 \]

Now, to find out how much James saved, we subtract the cost he paid from the cost at the store:
\[ \$75 - \$65 = \$10 \]

So, James saved:
\[ \$10 \]"
"First, let's find out the new price of each computer. The original price was $700, and it increased by 10%. To find the new price, we calculate 10% of $700 and add it to the original price.

10% of $700 is calculated as:
\[ \frac{10}{100} \times 700 = 70 \]

So, the new price of each computer is:
\[ 700 + 70 = 770 \]

Now, to find the total amount of money they paid for 500 computers at the new price, we multiply the new price by the number of computers:
\[ 770 \times 500 = 385000 \]

So, the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices is $385,000."
"First, let's calculate the calories from the eggs:
- John uses 6 eggs.
- Each egg has 75 calories.
- So, 6 eggs have 6 * 75 = 450 calories.

Next, let's calculate the calories from the cheese:
- John uses 2 oz of cheese.
- Cheese has 120 calories per ounce.
- So, 2 oz of cheese have 2 * 120 = 240 calories.

Now, let's calculate the calories from the ham:
- John uses 2 oz of ham.
- Ham has 40 calories per ounce.
- So, 2 oz of ham have 2 * 40 = 80 calories.

Finally, let's add up all the calories:
- Calories from eggs: 450
- Calories from cheese: 240
- Calories from ham: 80
- Total calories: 450 + 240 + 80 = 770 calories.

The final numerical answer is 770 calories."
"First, let's calculate the cost of 6 pencils. Since each pencil costs $0.50, we multiply $0.50 by 6:
\[ 0.50 \times 6 = 3.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of 8 erasers. Since each eraser costs $0.25, we multiply $0.25 by 8:
\[ 0.25 \times 8 = 2.00 \]

Now, we add the cost of the pencils and the cost of the erasers to find the total cost:
\[ 3.00 + 2.00 = 5.00 \]

You paid $10 for the items. To find out how much change you would get, we subtract the total cost from $10:
\[ 10.00 - 5.00 = 5.00 \]

So, the change you would get is $5.00."
"First, we need to find out how many people receive interviews. If 30% of 100 people receive interviews, we calculate:

"First, let's find out how many boxes of cereal Castle bought this week. She bought 3 boxes of Coco Crunch and 5 boxes of Fruit Loops, so:

3 + 5 = 8 boxes

Last week, she bought 4 boxes of cereal.

Now, to find out how many more boxes she bought this week than last week, we subtract the number of boxes she bought last week from the number she bought this week:

8 - 4 = 4

So, Castle bought 4 more boxes of cereal this week than last week."
"First, let's calculate the number of taps Helga makes when she is dancing with both hands at her sides.

She taps her right foot at 300 taps per minute and her left foot at 250 taps per minute. So, the total number of taps per minute when both hands are at her sides is:
\[ 300 + 250 = 550 \text{ taps per minute} \]

Since she dances for 5 minutes, the total number of taps when both hands are at her sides is:
\[ 550 \times 5 = 2750 \text{ taps} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of taps she makes when she raises her arms.

When her arms are raised, she taps her right foot at 200 taps per minute and her left foot at 200 taps per minute. So, the total number of taps per minute when her arms are raised is:
\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ taps per minute} \]

Since she raises her arms for 2 minutes, the total number of taps when her arms are raised is:
\[ 400 \times 2 = 800 \text{ taps} \]

Now, we add the taps from both scenarios to get the combined total number of taps:
\[ 2750 + 800 = 3550 \]

So, the combined total number of times that she taps both of her feet is:
\[ 3550 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost if Ron fixes the pothole himself.

The fine for unauthorized road maintenance is $120.
The cost of 3 buckets of asphalt is $25 per bucket.

So, the total cost for the asphalt is:
3 buckets * $25 per bucket = $75

Now, add the fine to the cost of the asphalt:
$120 (fine) + $75 (asphalt) = $195

The damage to his car if the pothole is not fixed is $450.

To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we subtract the total cost of fixing the pothole from the damage to his car:
$450 (damage) - $195 (cost of fixing) = $255

So, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole."
"First, let's find out how many normal chairs are left after some were sent to the carpenter. The restaurant originally had 170 normal chairs, and 20 of them were sent. So, we subtract 20 from 170:

170 - 20 = 150 normal chairs left.

Next, let's find out how many baby chairs are left after some were sent to the carpenter. The restaurant originally had 23 baby chairs, and 13 of them were sent. So, we subtract 13 from 23:

23 - 13 = 10 baby chairs left.

Now, to find out the total number of chairs left, we add the normal chairs left to the baby chairs left:

150 normal chairs + 10 baby chairs = 160 chairs in total.

So, the restaurant has 160 chairs left."
"First, let's figure out how many slices of pizza Bryce and his friends ordered in total.

Each pizza has 12 slices, and there are 5 people (Bryce and his 4 friends), so they ordered 5 pizzas.

Total slices = 5 pizzas * 12 slices/pizza = 60 slices

Now, let's calculate how many slices each group ate.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas:
Slices eaten by Bryce and two friends = 2/3 * 2 pizzas * 12 slices/pizza = 16 slices

The two remaining friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas:
Slices eaten by the two remaining friends = 3/4 * 2 pizzas * 12 slices/pizza = 18 slices

Now, let's add the slices eaten by both groups:
Total slices eaten = 16 slices + 18 slices = 34 slices

Finally, let's find out how many slices are left:
Slices left = Total slices - Total slices eaten = 60 slices - 34 slices = 26 slices

So, the number of slices of pizza left is 26."
"First, we need to find out how long it takes the dog to eat the sausages. The cat takes 30 minutes, and the dog takes 2/3 of that time. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Time for dog} = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find the average time both the cat and the dog take to eat the sausages. To do this, we add the time it takes for the cat and the dog and then divide by 2:

\[ \text{Average time} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes} \]

"First, we need to convert Topher's shoe length to inches. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, Topher's shoe length is 8 feet * 12 inches/foot + 4 inches = 96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches.

Topher's shoe length is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let's denote the length of Bobby's shoe as \( x \) inches. According to the problem, we have:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Now, divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches."
"First, let's find out how many windows are in the students' cars and teachers' cars.

For the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars.
- Each car has 4 windows.
- So, the total number of windows in students' cars is 64 cars * 4 windows/car = 256 windows.

For the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each car has 2 windows.
- So, the total number of windows in teachers' cars is 32 cars * 2 windows/car = 64 windows.

Now, let's calculate how many windows Hannah smashes.

For the students' cars:
- She smashes a quarter of the windows.
- So, she smashes 256 windows * 1/4 = 64 windows.

For the teachers' cars:
- She smashes 3/4ths of the windows.
- So, she smashes 64 windows * 3/4 = 48 windows.

Now, let's add the windows smashed from both types of cars:
- Total windows smashed = 64 (from students' cars) + 48 (from teachers' cars) = 112 windows.

So, the final numerical answer is 112."
"First, we need to find the total number of spools of thread Candy has. We do this by adding up all the spools:

15 light blue spools + 45 dark blue spools + 40 light green spools + 50 dark green spools = 150 spools in total.

Next, we need to find out how many of these spools are blue. We add the light blue spools and the dark blue spools:

15 light blue spools + 45 dark blue spools = 60 blue spools.

Now, to find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:

\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = 0.4 \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = 40\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is 40%."
"First, let's find out how many people had voted by midday. Since 2/5 of the people had voted by midday, we calculate:

\( \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000 \)

So, 2000 people had voted by midday. This means the remaining number of people who had not voted by midday is:

\( 5000 - 2000 = 3000 \)

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. So, we calculate how many of the 3000 people had voted by 16:00:

\( \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000 \)

This means 2000 people had voted by 16:00. To find out how many people had not voted by 16:00, we subtract the number of people who had voted by 16:00 from the remaining people after midday:

\( 3000 - 2000 = 1000 \)

So, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000."
"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need for 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will chew in 30 days.
2. Determine how many packs of gum are needed based on the total number of pieces.

First, let's calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will chew in 30 days:
- Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day.
- In 30 days, he will chew \( 4 \times 30 = 120 \) pieces of gum.

Next, we need to find out how many packs of gum he will need:
- Each pack contains 15 pieces of gum.
- To find out how many packs are needed for 120 pieces, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces per pack: \( \frac{120}{15} = 8 \).

So, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

The final numerical answer is 8."
"First, let's find out how many smores are needed in total.

Each kid wants 2 smores and there are 9 kids, so:
9 kids * 2 smores/kid = 18 smores for kids

Each adult will eat 1 smore and there are 6 adults, so:
6 adults * 1 smore/adult = 6 smores for adults

Now, let's add the smores for kids and adults:
18 smores + 6 smores = 24 smores in total

Each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large smores. So, to find out how many sleeves are needed for 24 smores:
24 smores / 8 smores/sleeve = 3 sleeves

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, they will need:
3 sleeves / 3 sleeves/box = 1 box

So, the final numerical answer is 1 box."
"First, let's find out how old Dora's father is. The problem states that Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. Since Dora is 15 years old, we can calculate her father's age as follows:

Father's age = 2 * Dora's age + 8
Father's age = 2 * 15 + 8
Father's age = 30 + 8
Father's age = 38

Now, we know Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. So, we can calculate her mother's age as:

Mother's age = Father's age - 4
Mother's age = 38 - 4
Mother's age = 34

Now, to find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we add their ages together:

Total age = Dora's age + Father's age + Mother's age
Total age = 15 + 38 + 34
Total age = 87

So, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is 87 years."
"To find out how much money each person gets, we need to divide the total amount of money by the number of people sharing it. Greg and his 3 siblings make a total of 4 people.

Each person, including Greg, gets $5."
"First, let's find out how much all of Cindy's books weigh.

Cindy's math and science books weigh 2 pounds each. Since she has two of each, that's 2 * 2 = 4 pounds for both math and science books.

Her French book weighs 4 pounds.

Her English book weighs 3 pounds.

Her history book weighs twice as much as her English book, so it weighs 2 * 3 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add up all the weights:
4 (math and science) + 4 (French) + 3 (English) + 6 (history) = 17 pounds

So, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is 17 pounds."
"First, let's find out how many votes candidate B got. Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A. Since candidate A got 20% of the votes, we can calculate candidate B's votes as follows:

Candidate B's votes = Candidate A's votes + 50% of Candidate A's votes
Candidate B's votes = 20% + 50% of 20%
Candidate B's votes = 20% + 10%
Candidate B's votes = 30%

Now, we know that 100 voters participated in the election. So, let's calculate the total votes for candidates A and B:

Total votes for A and B = Candidate A's votes + Candidate B's votes
Total votes for A and B = 20% + 30%
Total votes for A and B = 50%

The rest of the votes went to candidate C. So, we can find out how many votes candidate C got by subtracting the votes for A and B from the total votes:

Votes for C = Total votes - Total votes for A and B
Votes for C = 100% - 50%
Votes for C = 50%

So, candidate C got 50 votes."
"Boris has 100 apples.
Beck has 100 - 23 = 77 apples.
If Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Boris will have 100 - 10 = 90 apples.
Beck will have 77 + 10 = 87 apples.
Now, Boris has 90 apples and Beck has 87 apples.
So, Boris has 90 - 87 = 3 fewer apples than Beck.

The final numerical answer is 3."
"First, let's calculate how much water Peter uses for each type of cube:

For giant cubes:
3 giant cubes * 4 ounces per cube = 12 ounces

For medium cubes:
7 medium cubes * 2 ounces per cube = 14 ounces

For small cubes:
8 small cubes * 1/2 ounce per cube = 4 ounces

Now, let's add up the total water used:
12 ounces (giant cubes) + 14 ounces (medium cubes) + 4 ounces (small cubes) = 30 ounces

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. So, the water left is:
32 ounces - 30 ounces = 2 ounces

The final numerical answer is:
2 ounces"
"If Clara has 20 books and Clara has two times as many books as Steven, then Steven has half the number of books Clara has. So Steven has 20 / 2 = 10 books.

Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so Alice has 10 + 6 = 16 books.

To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has. So Clara has 20 - 16 = 4 more books than Alice."
"First, let's find out how much a half-gallon jar costs. If a gallon jar costs $5 and a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar, then a half-gallon jar costs $5 - $2 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the cost for 10 gallon jars. Since each gallon jar costs $5, 10 gallon jars will cost 10 * $5 = $50.

Next, let's calculate the cost for 16 half-gallon jars. Since each half-gallon jar costs $3, 16 half-gallon jars will cost 16 * $3 = $48.

Finally, to find the total amount of money Cecelia spent, we add the cost of the gallon jars and the half-gallon jars together: $50 + $48 = $98.

So, the final numerical answer is $98."
"First, let's find out how many students like to play music. We know that the number that like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number that like to play music is:

\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

Now, let's add the students who like to bake, play basketball, and play music:

\[ 10 \text{ (bake)} + 5 \text{ (basketball)} + 10 \text{ (music)} = 25 \]

The total number of students in the class is 50. So, the number of students who like to play video games is:

\[ 50 - 25 = 25 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 25."
"Jeremy scared away 12 birds * 1/3 = 4 birds.
So, the number of birds that remained = 12 - 4 = 8 birds.
Then, 20 more birds joined the backyard, so the total number of birds now is 8 + 20 = 28 birds.
The final answer is 28 birds."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know there are 80 students in total in two classes.
2. Each class has the same number of students. So, if we divide the total number of students by 2, we get the number of students in each class:
   \[
   \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ students per class}
   \]
3. In each class, 40% of the students are girls. To find out how many girls are in each class, we calculate 40% of 40:
   \[
   40 \times \frac{40}{100} = 16 \text{ girls per class}
   \]
4. Since each class has 40 students and 16 of them are girls, the rest must be boys. So, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class to find the number of boys:
   \[
   40 - 16 = 24 \text{ boys per class}
   \]

So, the number of boys in each class is 24."
"Mara started with 2 slices and added 3 more, so she had 2 + 3 = 5 slices on the plate.

She then tripled the number of slices, so she had 5 x 3 = 15 slices.

She ate 2 slices, leaving her with 15 - 2 = 13 slices.

Her friend stole 5 slices, so she had 13 - 5 = 8 slices remaining on the plate.

The final number of cake slices that remained on the plate is 8."
"First, we need to find out the total number of animals Melissa needs to groom this week. We do this by adding the number of each type of animal:

8 dogs + 5 cats + 3 birds + 12 horses = 28 animals

Melissa has 7 days in a week to do this grooming. To find out how many animals she will groom each day, we divide the total number of animals by the number of days:

28 animals ÷ 7 days = 4 animals per day

So, the final numerical answer is 4."
"First, let's calculate the total cost Mark spent on the packs of magic cards. He bought 3 packs for $1800 each, so the total cost is:
\[ 3 \times 1800 = 5400 \]

Next, let's calculate the total value of the cards Mark got. He got one card worth $4000, another card worth $1000, and 30 cards worth an average of $50 each. So, the total value of these cards is:
\[ 4000 + 1000 + 30 \times 50 = 4000 + 1000 + 1500 = 6500 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value of the cards:
\[ 6500 - 5400 = 1100 \]

So, the profit Mark made is:
\[ 1100 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost for the first amusement park:
- The cost for 2 adults at the first park is 2 adults * $26/adult = $52.
- The cost for 2 children at the first park is 2 children * $12/child = $24.
- So, the total cost for the first park is $52 + $24 = $76.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the second amusement park:
- The cost for 2 adults at the second park is 2 adults * $14/adult = $28.
- The cost for 2 children at the second park is 2 children * $10/child = $20.
- So, the total cost for the second park is $28 + $20 = $48.

To find out how much they can save by choosing the second amusement park, we subtract the total cost of the second park from the total cost of the first park:
- Savings = $76 - $48 = $28.

So, they will be able to save $28 if they choose the second amusement park over the first."
"First, let's find out how much money the vendor used to spend on tomatoes a day. He used to buy them for $.5 each and he sells 500 tomatoes a day. So, the cost per day is:
\[ 500 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times \$0.5/\text{tomato} = \$250/\text{day} \]

Now, let's find out how much money he spends on tomatoes a day with the new vendor. The new vendor sells them for $.4 each. So, the cost per day is:
\[ 500 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times \$0.4/\text{tomato} = \$200/\text{day} \]

To find out how much money he saves a day, we subtract the new cost from the old cost:
\[ \$250/\text{day} - \$200/\text{day} = \$50/\text{day} \]

Now, to find out how much money he saves a week, we multiply the daily savings by the number of days in a week (7 days):
\[ \$50/\text{day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = \$350/\text{week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$350 \]"
"First, we need to find out how many marbles Cal has. Since Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, we can find out how many marbles Cal has by doubling the number of marbles Sean has. Sean has 56 marbles, so:

\[ \text{Cal's marbles} = 56 \times 2 = 112 \]

Next, we need to find out how many marbles Carl has. Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, so:

\[ \text{Carl's marbles} = 56 \times 4 = 224 \]

Now, to find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we add the number of marbles Carl has to the number of marbles Cal has:

\[ \text{Combined marbles} = 224 + 112 = 336 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 336."
"First, we need to find out how many students are in each group if there are 6 groups. We do this by dividing the total number of students by the number of groups:

54 students ÷ 6 groups = 9 students per group

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, calculate the number of chairs rented during a weekday:
   - There are 5 weekdays in a week.
   - Candy rents 60 chairs each weekday.
   - So, in one week, Candy rents \(5 \times 60 = 300\) chairs.

2. Next, calculate the number of chairs rented during the weekend:
   - There are 2 days in a weekend.
   - Candy rents 100 chairs each day during the weekend.
   - So, in one weekend, Candy rents \(2 \times 100 = 200\) chairs.

3. Now, calculate the total number of chairs rented in one week:
   - Total chairs in one week = Chairs rented during weekdays + Chairs rented during weekends
   - Total chairs in one week = \(300 + 200 = 500\) chairs.

4. Since we are looking at two 4-week months, we need to calculate the total for 8 weeks:
   - Total chairs in 8 weeks = \(8 \times 500 = 4000\) chairs.

So, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is 4000 chairs."
"First, Gunther had 48 bananas.
Arnold stole half, so Gunther was left with 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.
Gunther added 25 more, so he had 24 + 25 = 49 bananas.
Arnold stole 12 more, so he was left with 49 - 12 = 37 bananas.
Gunther added 6 more, so he had 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.
Gunther found 43 bananas in the pile."
"To find out how much each roommate will pay per year for electricity, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out how much the electricity bill is per month for all roommates together. Since the bill is $100 each month and there are 4 roommates, we divide $100 by 4:
   \[
   \frac{100}{4} = 25
   \]
   So, each roommate pays $25 per month.

2. Next, we need to find out how much each roommate will pay per year. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the monthly amount by 12:
   \[
   25 \times 12 = 300
   \]

So, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity."
"First, let's find out how many glasses and plates Jeff originally had.

Jeff sent 8 dozen glasses. Since one dozen equals 12, he sent:
8 dozen * 12 glasses/dozen = 96 glasses

Jeff also sent 4 dozen plates. So, he sent:
4 dozen * 12 plates/dozen = 48 plates

When the items were returned, 10 glasses were broken and 6 plates were broken. So, the number of glasses and plates Jeff has now is:

Glasses: 96 - 10 = 86 glasses
Plates: 48 - 6 = 42 plates

Now, let's add the number of glasses and plates Jeff has now:
86 glasses + 42 plates = 128 items

So, the final numerical answer is 128."
"First, let's figure out how many stickers Lorraine trades for buttons.

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. So, she trades:
\[ 30 \times 0.90 = 27 \text{ small stickers} \]

Each small sticker is worth one small button, so she gets 27 small buttons from trading 27 small stickers.

Next, Lorraine has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

Now, Lorraine starts with 40 large stickers. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. So, she trades:
\[ 40 \times 0.50 = 20 \text{ large stickers} \]

Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons. Since each large button is worth three small buttons, each large sticker is worth 1 large button. So, she gets 20 large buttons from trading 20 large stickers.

Now, Lorraine has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

Lorraine trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. Since she has 20 large stickers left and each large sticker is worth 1 small button, she gets 20 small buttons from trading the remaining 20 large stickers.

Now, let's add up all the buttons Lorraine has:
- From trading small stickers: 27 small buttons
- From trading large stickers: 20 large buttons (which are worth 20 small buttons)
- From trading the remaining large stickers: 20 small buttons

So, the total number of buttons Lorraine has is:
\[ 27 + 20 + 20 = 67 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"Joey played 2 matches on Monday, 1 match on Friday, and on Saturday he played double the number of matches he played on Monday. So, on Saturday he played 2 * 2 = 4 matches. In one week, Joey played 2 + 1 + 4 = 7 matches."
"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Let's say the number of votes against the new regulation is \( x \).
2. Then, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x \) (twice as many as against).
3. The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and against, which is \( x + 2x = 3x \).
4. We know the total number of people on the council is 33, so \( 3x = 33 \).
5. To find \( x \), we divide 33 by 3: \( x = 33 / 3 = 11 \).
6. The number of votes in favor is \( 2x \), so it's \( 2 \times 11 = 22 \).

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22."

- Extra-small (XS): 11 students
- Small (S): Twice as many as extra-small, so 11 * 2 = 22 students
- Medium (M): Four less than the number of size small, so 22 - 4 = 18 students
- Large (L): Half as many as size medium, so 18 / 2 = 9 students
- Extra-large (XL): Six more students than large, so 9 + 6 = 15 students

Now, let's add up all the students:

11 (XS) + 22 (S) + 18 (M) + 9 (L) + 15 (XL) = 75 students

So, Krissa ordered 75 shirts."
"To find out how much you will pay after a 5% discount on a $140 item, you first need to calculate the amount of the discount and then subtract it from the original price.

1. Calculate the discount amount:
   - 5% of $140 is found by multiplying $140 by 0.05 (since 5% is the same as 5/100 or 0.05).
   - Discount amount = $140 * 0.05 = $7.

2. Subtract the discount from the original price:
   - Price after discount = $140 - $7 = $133.

So, after the discount, you will pay $133."
"First, we need to find out how many songs are in all the playlists combined. Since each playlist has 300 songs and John has 20 playlists, we multiply 300 by 20:

\[ 300 \times 20 = 6000 \text{ songs} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours these 6000 songs will last if each song is 10 hours long. We do this by multiplying the total number of songs by the length of each song:

\[ 6000 \times 10 = 60000 \text{ hours} \]

"First, let's find out how many people think horse #2 will win. 20% of 50 people is:

\( 20\% \times 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \)

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win.

Now, we subtract the 10 people who think horse #2 will win from the total of 50 people:

\( 50 - 10 = 40 \)

So, 40 people are left.

60% of these 40 people think horse #7 will win. Let's find out how many that is:

\( 60\% \times 40 = 0.60 \times 40 = 24 \)

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win.

Now, we subtract the 24 people who think horse #7 will win from the remaining 40 people:

\( 40 - 24 = 16 \)

So, 16 people think horse #12 will win.

The final numerical answer is 16."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls.
2. This means that 6 is one third of the total number of Pomeranians. So, to find the total number of Pomeranians, we multiply 6 by 3:
   \[
   6 \times 3 = 18
   \]
   So, Jana has 18 Pomeranian puppies.
3. We also know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Since we've found that 18 is two thirds of the total number of puppies, we can find the total number of puppies by dividing 18 by two thirds:
   \[
   \text{Total puppies} = \frac{18}{\frac{2}{3}} = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 27
   \]

So, Jana has 27 puppies in total."
"Jayden originally had $70. His sister gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is $90 / 2 = $45. So, Jayden now has $70 + $45 = $115. The camera costs $200, so the amount Jayden still needs is $200 - $115 = $85."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let's say the second house needs \( x \) cases of shingles.
2. The first house needs half of the second house, so it needs \( \frac{x}{2} \) cases.
3. The third house needs double the first house, so it needs \( 2 \times \frac{x}{2} = x \) cases.

Now, we know the total number of cases for all three houses is 250. So we can write the equation:

\[ \frac{x}{2} + x + x = 250 \]

Combining like terms:

\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2x = 250 \]

\[ \frac{x}{2} + \frac{4x}{2} = 250 \]

\[ \frac{5x}{2} = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we multiply both sides by 2 and then divide by 5:

\[ 5x = 500 \]

\[ x = 100 \]

So, the second house needs 100 cases. Now, we can find out how many cases the third house needs:

\[ \text{Third house} = x = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles."

So, the cost for 20 kilograms of oranges would be 20 * $3 = $60.

The final answer is $60."
"First, let's find out how many books Ahmed read. Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in one hour, and Ezra read 300 books, Ahmed must have read half of that. So, Ahmed read 300 / 2 = 150 books.

Now, we know that Ezra decided to read 150 more books. So, the total number of books Ezra read is 300 + 150 = 450 books.

To find out how many books they read altogether, we add the number of books Ahmed read to the number of books Ezra read. So, 150 (Ahmed's books) + 450 (Ezra's books) = 600 books.

The final numerical answer is 600."
"First, let's calculate how much Tanya earns for each day based on the number of classes and hours she teaches.

For Monday:
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours.
- She earns $15 for each hour.
- So, for 5 hours, she earns 5 * $15 = $75.
- Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she gets an additional $5 per day.
- So, for Monday, she earns $75 + $5 = $80.

For Wednesday:
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours.
- She earns $15 for each hour.
- So, for 2 hours, she earns 2 * $15 = $30.
- Since she teaches less than or equal to 3 classes, she does not get the additional $5 per day.
- So, for Wednesday, she earns $30.

Now, let's add the earnings for both days:
- Monday: $80
- Wednesday: $30
- Total: $80 + $30 = $110

So, Tanya earned $110 for these two days of teaching."
"The vanilla scents sold 5 each, so in total, 4 vanilla scents * 5 = 20 vanilla scents sold.
The fruity scents sold 2 each, so in total, 8 fruity scents * 2 = 16 fruity scents sold.
To find out how many more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents, subtract the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold: 20 - 16 = 4.

The final numerical answer is 4."
"First, let's calculate how much money Bennet makes from selling the eggplants.

He sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so:
20 eggplants * $3/eggplant = $60

Now, Bennet wants to make a total of $135. To find out how much more money he needs, we subtract the money he already has from the total he wants to make:
$135 - $60 = $75

Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for to make the remaining $75, we divide the remaining money by the number of ears of corn:
$75 / 25 ears = $3/ear

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3."
"First, let's calculate the total hours Tatiana has for the weekend:
- Saturday: 7 hours
- Sunday: 5 hours
Total weekend hours = 7 + 5 = 12 hours

Tatiana spends 3 hours reading. So, the remaining time after reading is:
Remaining time = Total weekend hours - Reading time
Remaining time = 12 - 3 = 9 hours

She plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time:
Time playing video games = 1/3 * Remaining time
Time playing video games = 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours

Now, we can find out how much time she spends playing soccer:
Time playing soccer = Remaining time - Time playing video games
Time playing soccer = 9 - 3 = 6 hours

To find out what percentage of her weekend she spends playing soccer, we use the formula:
Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = (Time playing soccer / Total weekend hours) * 100
Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer = (6 / 12) * 100 = 0.5 * 100 = 50%

So, the final numerical answer is 50%."
"First, let's find out how many pencils Anthony gave to Brandon. He gave 1/2 of his 50 pencils to Brandon, so:

\( \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \) pencils

Now, Anthony has:

\( 50 - 25 = 25 \) pencils left

Next, Anthony gave 3/5 of the remaining 25 pencils to Charlie. So:

\( \frac{3}{5} \times 25 = 15 \) pencils

Now, Anthony has:

\( 25 - 15 = 10 \) pencils left

So, Anthony kept 10 pencils."
"First, we need to calculate the time Jack spends driving to the museum and back.

Jack drives 150 miles to the museum and 150 miles back. He drives at a speed of 75 mph.

The time to drive to the museum is calculated by dividing the distance by the speed:
\[ \text{Time to museum} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Since he drives the same distance back, the time to drive back is also 2 hours.

So, the total driving time is:
\[ \text{Total driving time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Jack spends 6 hours at the museum.

Therefore, the total time Jack is gone from home is:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Total driving time} + \text{Time at the museum} = 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of wheels needed for the cars:
- Henry needs 4 wheels for each car.
- He has 57 cars.
- So, the total wheels needed for cars = 4 wheels/car * 57 cars = 228 wheels.

Next, let's calculate the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles:
- Henry needs 2 wheels for each motorcycle.
- He has 73 motorcycles.
- So, the total wheels needed for motorcycles = 2 wheels/motorcycle * 73 motorcycles = 146 wheels.

Now, let's add the wheels needed for cars and motorcycles to find the total number of wheels needed:
- Total wheels needed = wheels needed for cars + wheels needed for motorcycles
- Total wheels needed = 228 wheels + 146 wheels = 374 wheels.

Finally, let's find out how many wheels will be left after Henry uses the wheels:
- Henry has 650 wheels.
- Total wheels needed are 374 wheels.
- Wheels left = total wheels Henry has - total wheels needed
- Wheels left = 650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels.

So, the number of wheels left is 276."
"To find out how much you have to pay after a 20% discount on a $1000 laptop, you first need to calculate the discount amount and then subtract it from the original price.

20% of $1000 is calculated as:
\[ 20\% \times 1000 = \frac{20}{100} \times 1000 = 0.20 \times 1000 = 200 \]

So, the discount amount is $200.

Now, subtract the discount from the original price:
\[ 1000 - 200 = 800 \]

Therefore, you have to pay $800 for the laptop after the discount."
"First, let's find out how many movies are in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \]

So, there are 200 movies in series. This means the remaining number of movies is:

\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Next, we find out how many of the remaining 400 movies are older movies. Since 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, we calculate:

\[ 0.40 \times 400 = 160 \]

So, there are 160 older movies. This means the remaining number of movies are not in series and are not older movies:

\[ 400 - 160 = 240 \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the series movies. Since a third of the movies are in series and he can get them for $6 each, the cost for the series movies is:

\[ 200 \times 6 = 1200 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the older movies. Since 40% of the remaining movies are older movies and each costs $5, the cost for the older movies is:

\[ 160 \times 5 = 800 \]

The cost of the normal movies is calculated by subtracting the cost of the series and older movies from the total cost. The total cost of the normal movies is:

\[ 240 \times 10 = 2400 \]

So, the total cost of replacing the movies is:

\[ 2400 - 1200 - 800 = 400 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 400 \]"
"First, we need to calculate how much Winston spent on each type of fruit.

For peaches:
6 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $12.00

For plums:
8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = $8.00

For apricots:
6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Now, we add up all the amounts:
$12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

So, Winston spent $38.00 on fruit."
"First, let's calculate the distance they drove. They drove for 6 hours at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.

Distance driven = Speed * Time
Distance driven = 50 miles/hour * 6 hours
Distance driven = 300 miles

Next, let's find out how fast they hiked. They hiked at an average speed that was 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.

Half of their driving speed = 50 miles/hour / 2 = 25 miles/hour
Speed of hiking = 25 miles/hour - 5 miles/hour = 20 miles/hour

Now, we know they hiked for 1.5 hours at this speed.

Distance hiked = Speed * Time
Distance hiked = 20 miles/hour * 1.5 hours
Distance hiked = 30 miles

To find the total distance to their vacation spot, we add the distance driven and the distance hiked.

Total distance = Distance driven + Distance hiked
Total distance = 300 miles + 30 miles
Total distance = 330 miles

So, the vacation spot is 330 miles away."
"First, let's break down the points for each player based on the information given.

Ava:
- Jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma. Let's say Emma jumps on 5 enemies, so Ava jumps on 5 + 8 = 13 enemies.
- Collects 3 more berries than Emma. Let's say Emma collects 4 berries, so Ava collects 4 + 3 = 7 berries.
- Finishes 4 seconds slower, so she loses 30 * 4 = 120 points for the time.

Emma:
- Jumps on 5 enemies.
- Collects 4 berries.
- Finishes the level on time, so she gains 30 * 0 = 0 points for the time.

Now, let's calculate the points for each player:

Ava's points:
- From enemies: 13 enemies * 10 points/enemy = 130 points
- From berries: 7 berries * 5 points/berry = 35 points
- From time: -120 points (since she finishes 4 seconds slower)

So, Ava's total points = 130 + 35 - 120 = 45 points.

Emma's points:
- From enemies: 5 enemies * 10 points/enemy = 50 points
- From berries: 4 berries * 5 points/berry = 20 points
- From time: 0 points (since she finishes on time)

So, Emma's total points = 50 + 20 = 70 points.

Now, to find the difference between their scores:
Difference = Emma's points - Ava's points = 70 - 45 = 25 points.

The difference between their two scores is 25 points."
"First, we need to find out how much the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each together cost. We do this by multiplying 30 dollars by 2:

30 * 2 = 60 dollars

The total cost for all four pizzas is 64 dollars. We subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each from the total cost to find out how much the other two pizzas cost together:

64 - 60 = 4 dollars

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the remaining cost by 2 to find the cost of each pizza:

4 / 2 = 2 dollars

So, each of the other two pizzas cost 2 dollars."
"Chase and Rider ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 times.
On two other days, they ride twice as many times as usual, so that's 3 * 2 = 6 times each day.
For these two days, they ride 6 * 2 = 12 times.
In total, they ride 15 + 12 = 27 times a week."
"First, let's figure out how many fish Bob has in total after getting the new ones from the pet store. Initially, Bob had 7 fish. After getting more fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's denote the number of white fish Bob got from the pet store as \( W \) and the number of orange fish as \( O \). We know that \( O + W = 17 \) because he got 17 fish from the pet store.

After adding the new fish to his pond, the total number of fish became \( 7 + 17 = 24 \). According to the problem, the number of orange fish became twice the number of white fish. So, if we let the number of white fish in the pond after adding the new ones be \( W \), then the number of orange fish would be \( 3 + O \) (since he already had 3 orange fish and got \( O \) more). Therefore, we have the equation:

\[ 3 + O = 2W \]

We also know that \( O + W = 17 \). We can substitute \( O \) from the second equation into the first equation. From \( O + W = 17 \), we can express \( O \) as \( O = 17 - W \). Substituting this into the equation \( 3 + O = 2W \):

\[ 3 + (17 - W) = 2W \]
\[ 20 - W = 2W \]
\[ 20 = 3W \]
\[ W = \frac{20}{3} \]
\[ W = 6 \]

So, Bob bought 6 white fish from the pet store. Let's check if this is correct by calculating the number of orange fish he got and the total number of fish after adding them to the pond.

If \( W = 6 \), then \( O = 17 - 6 = 11 \). The total number of fish after adding the new ones is \( 7 + 17 = 24 \). The number of orange fish is \( 3 + 11 = 14 \) and the number of white fish is \( 4 + 6 = 10 \). Since \( 14 = 2 \times 10 \), the condition is satisfied.

Therefore, the number of white fish Bob bought is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"First, let's calculate how many miles Andy drives in a week. He goes to work from Monday to Friday, so that's 5 days. If the one-way distance is 5 miles, then the round trip (home to work and back) is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles. So, in a week, he drives 10 miles/day * 5 days = 50 miles.

Next, we need to find out how many gallons of gas Andy uses for 50 miles. Since his car's fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon, he uses 50 miles / 10 miles/gallon = 5 gallons of gas in a week.

Finally, we need to calculate how much money Andy spends on gas in a week. If the price of gas is $3/gallon, then for 5 gallons, he spends 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15.

So, the final numerical answer is $15."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie has in quarters. Since she has 140 quarters and each quarter is worth $0.25, we can calculate the total amount of money in quarters as follows:

\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie has in twenties. Since she has 10 twenties and each twenty is worth $20, we can calculate the total amount of money in twenties as follows:

\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Carrie spent 3/5 of the twenties. So, we need to calculate 3/5 of $200:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the amount spent in quarters and the amount spent in twenties to find the total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch:

\[ 35 + 120 = 155 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is:

\[ 155 \text{ dollars} \]"
"First, we need to find out how many tomatoes Ricardo gets. Each tomato plant gives 22 tomatoes and he has 5 tomato plants. So, we multiply the number of tomatoes per plant by the number of tomato plants:

\[ 22 \text{ tomatoes/plant} \times 5 \text{ plants} = 110 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Next, we find out how many eggplants Ricardo gets. Each eggplant plant gives 4 eggplants and he has 8 eggplant plants. So, we multiply the number of eggplants per plant by the number of eggplant plants:

\[ 4 \text{ eggplants/plant} \times 8 \text{ plants} = 32 \text{ eggplants} \]

Now, we add the number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits:

\[ 110 \text{ tomatoes} + 32 \text{ eggplants} = 142 \text{ fruits} \]

So, the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his plants is 142."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many smart TVs were sold. Since one-fourth of the sales are smart TVs, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \text{ smart TVs}
   \]

2. Next, we find out how many analog TVs were sold. Since one-eighth of the sales are analog TVs, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5 \text{ analog TVs}
   \]

3. Now, to find out how many OLED TVs were sold, we subtract the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total number of TVs sold:
   \[
   40 - 10 - 5 = 25 \text{ OLED TVs}
   \]

So, the number of OLED TVs sold is 25."
"To find out how much money John is missing, we need to calculate the total cost of the trip and then subtract the amount he already has.

The total cost of the trip is $300.
The school is covering half of the cost, so the school will cover $300 / 2 = $150.

John has $50.

So, the total amount needed is $150 (from the school) + $50 (John has) = $200.

The money John is missing is $300 (total cost) - $200 (what he has) = $100.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to find out how cold it gets at night. If it was 45 degrees during the day and 33 degrees colder at night, we subtract 33 from 45 to find the night temperature.

45 - 33 = 12 degrees

The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. So, we need to find out how much the temperature needs to be raised to 32 degrees from 12 degrees.

32 - 12 = 20 degrees

Each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn to raise the temperature by 20 degrees, we divide 20 by 5.

20 ÷ 5 = 4

So, Carson needs to burn 4 logs of wood to prevent the pipes from freezing."
"First, we need to find out how many groups were formed. Since 90 people were split into 9-person groups, we divide 90 by 9:

90 ÷ 9 = 10 groups

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups brought back seashells. We know that 3/5 of the groups brought back seashells. So we calculate 3/5 of 10:

3/5 × 10 = 6 groups

Each of these 6 groups brought back 2 seashells each. So we multiply the number of groups that brought back seashells by 2 to find the total number of seashells:

6 × 2 = 12 seashells

So, the total number of seashells they brought is 12."
"Starting with 172 people on the train.
47 people get off, so 172 - 47 = 125 people remain.
Then 13 more people get on, so 125 + 13 = 138 people are on the train.
At the next stop, 38 people get off, so 138 - 38 = 100 people are left on the train.

The final number of people on the train is 100."
"First, we need to find out how many bottle caps Damien gets in a day. He gets 10 bottle caps a day.

Next, we need to find out how much money he gets from these bottle caps. Each bottle cap is worth $0.25, so we multiply the number of bottle caps by the value of each bottle cap:
\[ 10 \text{ bottle caps/day} \times \$0.25/\text{bottle cap} = \$2.50/\text{day} \]

Now, we need to find out how much money he makes in a 30 day month. We multiply the daily amount by the number of days in the month:
\[ \$2.50/\text{day} \times 30 \text{ days} = \$75.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$75.00 \]"
"First, we need to find out Jamie's regular hourly rate. She earns $20 per hour for 8 hours of work each day. So, her regular hourly rate is $20.

For the additional hours she worked, she is paid 150% of her regular hourly rate. To find 150% of her regular hourly rate, we calculate:
\[ 150\% \text{ of } \$20 = 1.5 \times \$20 = \$30 \]

Jamie worked 11 hours in total, which means she worked 3 additional hours (since 11 - 8 = 3). For these 3 additional hours, she is paid $30 per hour.

Now, let's calculate her total earnings for the day:
\[ \text{Earnings for regular hours} = 8 \text{ hours} \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$160 \]
\[ \text{Earnings for additional hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \times \$30/\text{hour} = \$90 \]
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \$160 + \$90 = \$250 \]

So, Jamie was paid $250 for her work that day."
"The number of male lions is half the number of female lions, so there are 12 / 2 = 6 male lions.

The final answer is 32."
"First, we need to find out how much the jeans cost after the discount. The original price of the jeans is $40.00 and they are 25% off. To find the discount amount, we calculate 25% of $40.00.

25% of $40.00 is calculated as:
\[ \frac{25}{100} \times 40 = 0.25 \times 40 = 10 \]

So, the discount is $10.00. Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price of the jeans:
\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \]

The sale price of the jeans is $30.00. Mike pays with a $50.00 bill. To find out how much money Mike will have left over, we subtract the sale price of the jeans from the $50.00 bill:
\[ 50 - 30 = 20 \]

So, Mike will have $20.00 left over."

"First, let's find out Billy's starting salary and then his salary after the raises.

Billy's starting salary was $10 per hour.

After 2 months, he got a raise of $0.50 per hour, so his new salary became:
$10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

On his first anniversary, he got another raise of $1.00 per hour, so his salary became:
$10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate how much Billy earns in 20 hours:
$11.50 per hour * 20 hours = $230.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more than Billy's starting salary, so:
$10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate how much Sally earns in 20 hours:
$10.50 per hour * 20 hours = $210.

To find out how much more money Billy earns than Sally, we subtract Sally's total earnings from Billy's total earnings:
$230 - $210 = $20.

So, Billy earns $20 more than Sally in 20 hours."
"First, let's calculate the cost of 3 loaves of bread:
- Each loaf of bread costs $2.
- So, 3 loaves of bread cost 3 * $2 = $6.

Next, let's calculate the cost of 2 bagels:
- Each bagel costs $1.
- So, 2 bagels cost 2 * $1 = $2.

Now, to find out how much more 3 loaves of bread cost than 2 bagels, we subtract the cost of 2 bagels from the cost of 3 loaves of bread:
- $6 (cost of 3 loaves of bread) - $2 (cost of 2 bagels) = $4.

So, 3 loaves of bread cost $4 more than 2 bagels."
"First, we need to find out how many points Nikita scored. We know that Nikita scored 11 more than half as many as Pierson. Pierson scored 278 points.

To find half of Pierson's score, we divide 278 by 2:
\[ 278 \div 2 = 139 \]

Now, we add 11 to this number to find Nikita's score:
\[ 139 + 11 = 150 \]

So, Nikita scored 150 points.

To find the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita, we add Pierson's score to Nikita's score:
\[ 278 + 150 = 428 \]

The total points scored by Pierson and Nikita is 428."
"First, let's find out how many students and teachers there are in total at Ashley's school.

There are 40 classes, and each class has an average of 25 students. So, the total number of students is:
40 classes * 25 students/class = 1000 students

Each class also has an average of 3 teachers. So, the total number of teachers is:
40 classes * 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers

Each child plants 1 tree, so the students will plant:
1000 students * 1 tree/student = 1000 trees

Each teacher plants 2 trees, so the teachers will plant:
120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees

Now, let's add the number of trees planted by students and teachers to find the total number of trees planted:
1000 trees (by students) + 240 trees (by teachers) = 1240 trees

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how many stuffed animals Bubbles already has. She has:
- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

So, the total number of stuffed animals she currently has is:
3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 stuffed animals

Let's say Bubbles buys \( x \) stuffed goats. The total number of stuffed animals after buying the goats will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30%. This means that the number of stuffed goats should be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. So we can set up the equation:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:
\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate how many hours Kris has already played.

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks have 14 days.
So, the total hours played for the first 2 weeks is:
\[ 14 \text{ days} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/day} = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Next, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/day} = 14 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's add the hours played in the first 2 weeks and the hours played in the last week:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} + 14 \text{ hours} = 21 \text{ hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. So, the number of hours she still needs to play is:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} - 21 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate how far the first car travels in 2 hours. The first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour.

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance_first_car = 60 miles/hour × 2 hours = 120 miles

Now, let's calculate how far the second car travels in 2 hours. The second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour.

Distance_second_car = 70 miles/hour × 2 hours = 140 miles

To find out how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we subtract the distance traveled by the first car from the distance traveled by the second car.

Separation_distance = Distance_second_car - Distance_first_car
Separation_distance = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

So, the final numerical answer is 20 miles."
"First, we need to find out how much the ring cost without the premium. The diamond costs $600 and the gold costs $300, so the cost of the ring without the premium is $600 + $300 = $900.

Next, we need to calculate the premium. The premium is 30% of the cost of the ring without the premium. So, we calculate 30% of $900:
\[ 0.30 \times 900 = 270 \]

Now, we add the premium to the cost of the ring without the premium to find the total cost:
\[ 900 + 270 = 1170 \]

So, James paid $1170 for the ring."
"First, let's find the pass rates for each grade.

For third graders:
340 out of 500 passed, so the pass rate is 340/500 = 0.68 or 68%.

For fourth graders:
40 out of 100 passed, so the pass rate is 40/100 = 0.40 or 40%.

For fifth graders:
The pass rate is twice that of fourth graders, so it's 2 * 40% = 80%.

Now, let's add up all the pass rates and divide by the total number of students to find the overall pass rate.

Total number of students = 500 (third graders) + 100 (fourth graders) + 400 (fifth graders) = 1000 students.

Total number of students who passed = 340 (third graders) + 40 (fourth graders) + 400 (fifth graders) = 780 students.

Overall pass rate = (Total number of students who passed / Total number of students) * 100
Overall pass rate = (780 / 1000) * 100 = 78%

So, the school's overall pass rate is 78%."
"First, we need to find out how many glass chips Milo has in total. Since each bag holds 72 chips and he has two bags, we multiply 72 by 2:

72 chips/bag * 2 bags = 144 chips

Now, we know that it takes 12 chips to make every square inch of the mosaic. To find out how many square inches Milo can make with 144 chips, we divide the total number of chips by the number of chips needed per square inch:

144 chips / 12 chips/square inch = 12 square inches

Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. To find out how many inches long he can make his mosaic, we divide the total number of square inches by the height:

12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long."
"First, let's find out how much tea the students drank in total.

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts:
4 students * 1.5 quarts/student = 6 quarts

16 students each drank 2 quarts:
16 students * 2 quarts/student = 32 quarts

Now, let's add the quarts of tea the students drank to the quarts left:
6 quarts + 32 quarts + 10 quarts = 48 quarts

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we need to convert the total quarts to gallons:
48 quarts / 4 quarts/gallon = 12 gallons

So, the number of gallons of tea at the beginning of the party was 12 gallons."
"Dale originally had 100 candies and sold 150, but he ordered 100 more. So, he now has:

100 (original) - 150 (sold) + 100 (new order) = 50 candies.

To find out how many more he needs to sell to have all his candy, we subtract the number of candies he has from the total number of candies he ordered initially:

100 (initial order) - 50 (he has now) = 50 candies.

So, Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy."
"To solve this, let's break it down month by month.

At the beginning of the year, there are 10 students.

By the end of the first month, the number of students doubles, so there are 10 * 2 = 20 students.

By the end of the second month, the number doubles again, so there are 20 * 2 = 40 students.

By the end of the third month, the number doubles again, so there are 40 * 2 = 80 students.

By the end of the fourth month, the number doubles again, so there are 80 * 2 = 160 students.

By the end of the fifth month, the number doubles again, so there are 160 * 2 = 320 students.

Now, to find out how many additional students joined by the end of May, we need to subtract the number of students at the beginning of the year from the number at the end of May.

So, 320 (students at the end of May) - 10 (students at the beginning of the year) = 310 additional students.

The final numerical answer is 310."
"First, we need to find out how many branches Felix climbed in total to make $105. Since each branch costs $.25, we can divide the total money he made by the cost per branch to find the total number of branches.

Total money made = $105
Cost per branch = $0.25

Total branches climbed = Total money made / Cost per branch
Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25

Now, let's do the division:
105 / 0.25 = 420

So, Felix climbed 420 branches in total to make $105.

Next, we need to find out how many branches he climbed per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total branches by 7.

Branches climbed per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days in a week
Branches climbed per day = 420 / 7

Now, let's do the division:
420 / 7 = 60

Therefore, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day."
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose picks:

- For the first 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals
- For the next 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals
- For the next 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals
- For the last 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals

Now, let's add these up to find the total number of petals she picks:
\[15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\]

Next, Rose drops 1 of each type of flower:
- She drops 1 of the 5-petal flowers, so she loses 5 petals.
- She drops 1 of the 6-petal flowers, so she loses 6 petals.
- She drops 1 of the 4-petal flowers, so she loses 4 petals.
- She drops 1 of the 7-petal flowers, so she loses 7 petals.

Now, let's calculate the total number of petals she loses:
\[5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\]

Subtract the petals she loses from the total number of petals she picked:
\[101 - 22 = 79\]

So, the total number of petals in the vase is 79."
"First, let's find out how many marshmallows John and DeSean used to make S'mores.

John makes 9 S'mores, and DeSean makes 9 S'mores. So together they make:
9 + 9 = 18 S'mores.

They started with 35 marshmallows and dropped 3 on the ground. So the number of marshmallows left is:
35 - 3 = 32 marshmallows.

Now, we need to find out how many S'mores they can make with the 32 marshmallows left.

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they can make:
32 S'mores.

Now, we need to divide these 32 S'mores between John and DeSean. Since they made an equal number of S'mores, they can each have:
32 ÷ 2 = 16 S'mores.

So, each kid can have 16 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag."
"First, let's figure out how long each person can play the game.

Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter.
His two friends who are worse can play for half as long, so they can play for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes each with 1 quarter.
His one friend who is better can play for 1.5 times as long, so he can play for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes with 1 quarter.

Now, let's add up the total time they all play:
Jack plays for 20 minutes.
His two worse friends play for 10 minutes each, so together they play for 10 * 2 = 20 minutes.
His better friend plays for 30 minutes.

So, the total time they all play together is 20 + 20 + 30 = 70 minutes.

They play for 4 hours, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how many quarters they used. Since they played for 240 minutes and each quarter gets them 20 minutes, we divide the total minutes by the minutes per quarter:

240 minutes / 20 minutes per quarter = 12 quarters.

So, the final numerical answer is 12 quarters."
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Salt = Sugar
- Oil = 2 * Salt
- Fragrance = Zest
- Zest = Salt

Let's say Salt = S ounces. Then:
- Oil = 2 * S
- Fragrance = Zest = S

Now, we need to add all these together to get the total amount of ingredients used:
- Salt = S
- Sugar = S
- Oil = 2 * S
- Fragrance = S
- Zest = S

So, the total is S + S + 2S + S + S = 6S

We know that the total amount of ingredients is 10 ounces, so:
6S = 10

To find S, we divide both sides by 6:
S = 10 / 6
S = 5 / 3

Now, we need to find out how much oil she uses, which is 2 * S:
Oil = 2 * (5 / 3) = 10 / 3

So, the amount of oil she uses is 10 / 3 ounces.

The final numerical answer is:
10 / 3"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the goats:
John buys 3 goats at $500 each, so the cost for the goats is:
3 goats * $500/goat = $1500

Next, let's calculate the cost of the cows:
John buys 2 cows at $1500 each, so the cost for the cows is:
2 cows * $1500/cow = $3000

Now, let's add the cost of the goats and the cows to find the total amount John spent:
Total cost = Cost of goats + Cost of cows
Total cost = $1500 + $3000 = $4500

So, the final numerical answer is:
4500"
"Paul has a total of 8 chocolate cupcakes + 40 toffee cupcakes = 48 cupcakes.

He needs 63 cupcakes for the party.

So, the number of cupcakes Paul should buy is 63 - 48 = 15 cupcakes."
"First, let's find out how many cars Joe has. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

2 * 20 = 40 cars

Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find out how many cars he sells, we calculate 20% of 40:

20/100 * 40 = 8 cars

Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. So, he gives away:

2 * 8 = 16 cars

Now, let's find out how many cars Joe has left after selling and giving some to his mother. We subtract the cars he sold and gave away from the total he originally had:

40 - 8 - 16 = 16 cars

So, Joe remains with 16 cars after selling and giving some to his mother."
"First, we need to find out how much money the students raised. The total money raised is $175,000, and $50,000 of that came from organizations. So, the students raised:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Now, we need to divide this amount by the number of students to find out how much each student raised. There are 20 students, so:

\[ 125,000 \div 20 = 6,250 \]

So, each student raised $6,250."
"First, let's find out how many hours Sandy walked on the second day. She walked half as many hours on the second day as she walked on the first day. Since she walked 8 hours on the first day, on the second day she walked:

\[ \text{Hours on second day} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's add the hours from both days to find the total hours Sandy walked:

\[ \text{Total hours} = 8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to convert the total hours into minutes:

\[ \text{Total minutes} = 12 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days in minutes is:

\[ 720 \text{ minutes} \]"
"First, let's find out how many cars were in the parking lot during the lunch break.

Hunter initially counted 50 cars. During the first break, he saw 20 more cars. So, the total number of cars before lunch break was:
50 + 20 = 70 cars

During lunch break, half of these cars left the parking lot. So, the number of cars that left is:
70 / 2 = 35 cars

Therefore, the number of cars that remained in the parking lot during lunch break is:
70 - 35 = 35 cars

The final numerical answer is:
35"
"First, let's find out how much John makes in one day. He does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle has 5 tasks. So, the total number of tasks he does in one day is:

30 cycles/day * 5 tasks/cycle = 150 tasks/day

Each task pays $1.20, so the total amount he makes in one day is:

150 tasks/day * $1.20/task = $180/day

Now, to find out how much he makes in a full 7 day week, we multiply the daily earnings by 7:

$180/day * 7 days/week = $1260/week

So, the final numerical answer is $1260."
"First, let's find out how many points Julie scored in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, and Sasha scored 14 points, we can calculate Julie's score as follows:

Julie's score in the first game = Sasha's score in the first game - 4
Julie's score in the first game = 14 - 4
Julie's score in the first game = 10 points

Now, we know that in the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie did in the first game. So, we can calculate Sasha's score in the second game as follows:

Sasha's score in the second game = Julie's score in the first game - 6
Sasha's score in the second game = 10 - 6
Sasha's score in the second game = 4 points

Now, to find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add the points from both games:

Total points Sasha scored = Sasha's score in the first game + Sasha's score in the second game
Total points Sasha scored = 14 + 4
Total points Sasha scored = 18 points

So, the final numerical answer is 18."
"First, we need to find out how many tins of cat food Kimberly bought. She bought 8 packages of cat food, and each package contains 11 tins. So, we multiply 8 by 11:

\[ 8 \times 11 = 88 \]

Next, we need to find out how many tins of dog food Kimberly bought. She bought 6 packages of dog food, and each package contains 6 tins. So, we multiply 6 by 6:

\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

Now, to find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food:

\[ 88 - 36 = 52 \]

So, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food."
"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Let's say PJ has x cards.
2. Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has 3x cards.
3. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.
4. The total number of cards is 341.

Now, we can write an equation to represent the total number of cards:

x (PJ's cards) + 3x (Smendrick's cards) + 3x + 12 (Becca's cards) = 341

Combining like terms:

x + 3x + 3x + 12 = 341
7x + 12 = 341

Now, let's solve for x:

7x = 341 - 12
7x = 329
x = 329 / 7
x = 47

So, PJ has 47 cards, Smendrick has 3 times that, which is 141 cards, and Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, which is 153 cards.

The final numerical answer is 153."
"First, let's find out how many blue eggs Cindy has. Since she has twice as many blue eggs as green ones, and she has 5 green eggs, we can calculate the number of blue eggs as follows:

Number of blue eggs = 2 * Number of green eggs
Number of blue eggs = 2 * 5
Number of blue eggs = 10

Next, we find out how many pink eggs Cindy has. She has one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so:

Number of pink eggs = Number of blue eggs - 1
Number of pink eggs = 10 - 1
Number of pink eggs = 9

Now, we find out how many yellow eggs Cindy has. She has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so:

Number of yellow eggs = 1/3 * Number of pink eggs
Number of yellow eggs = 1/3 * 9
Number of yellow eggs = 3

Finally, we add up all the eggs to find the total number of eggs Cindy has:

Total number of eggs = Number of green eggs + Number of blue eggs + Number of pink eggs + Number of yellow eggs
Total number of eggs = 5 + 10 + 9 + 3
Total number of eggs = 27

So, Cindy had 27 eggs altogether."
"First, let's calculate the cost of shipping the book.

The cost of shipping is $0.35 per pound plus $0.08 per mile. The book weighs 4 pounds and needs to be returned 20 miles away.

The cost for the weight is:
4 pounds * $0.35/pound = $1.40

The cost for the distance is:
20 miles * $0.08/mile = $1.60

So, the total shipping cost is:
$1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

Next, let's calculate the refund Milly will get from Amazon. Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price.

The purchase price of the book is $32, so the refund amount is:
75% of $32 = 0.75 * $32 = $24

Now, let's calculate how much money Milly will lose. She has to pay $3.00 for shipping and she will only get $24 back from the refund.

The total loss is:
$3.00 (shipping cost) + $32 (purchase price) - $24 (refund) = $11.00

So, Milly will lose $11.00."
"Mulan starts with $40 and her father gives her $100. So she has $40 + $100 = $140.

She buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so that's 2 * $30 = $60.

She also buys a bag for $20.

So in total, she spends $60 + $20 = $80.

Now, subtract the total amount spent from the total amount she had: $140 - $80 = $60.

Mulan has $60 left."
"First, let's calculate how much chocolate Boris produces in the second and third weeks.

For the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week. Since he produces 8,000 bars in the first week, in the second week he produces:
\[ \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \text{ bars} \]

For the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week. So, in the third week he produces:
\[ 8,000 \times 3 = 24,000 \text{ bars} \]

Now, let's add up the chocolate produced in the first, second, and third weeks:
\[ 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars} \]

Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. So, to find out how much he produces in the fourth week, we subtract the total produced in the first three weeks from the monthly total:
\[ 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars} \]

So, Boris produces 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week."
"First, let's calculate the time Britany spends on TikTok videos each week.

She records 18 videos each week, and each video is 4 minutes long.
So, the time spent on TikTok videos each week is:
18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time she spends writing songs each week.
She spends 2 hours a week writing songs. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 2 hours is:
2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes

Now, let's calculate the time she spends doing her makeup each week.
She spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup.
So, the time spent on makeup each week is:
15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes

Now, let's add up the time she spends on TikTok videos, writing songs, and doing makeup each week.
Total time each week = Time on TikTok videos + Time writing songs + Time doing makeup
Total time each week = 72 minutes + 120 minutes + 90 minutes
Total time each week = 282 minutes

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly total by 4 to find the monthly total.
Total time each month = Total time each week * 4 weeks
Total time each month = 282 minutes/week * 4 weeks
Total time each month = 1128 minutes

So, the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month with four weeks is 1128 minutes."
"First, let's calculate the cost for Angela's additional items.

Angela needs:
- 6 mirrors
- 2 chandeliers
- 20 pictures

The cost for each additional item is $15.00.

So, the cost for the mirrors is:
6 mirrors * $15.00/mirror = $90.00

The cost for the chandeliers is:
2 chandeliers * $15.00/chandelier = $30.00

The cost for the pictures is:
20 pictures * $15.00/picture = $300.00

Now, let's add up the cost for all the additional items:
$90.00 (mirrors) + $30.00 (chandeliers) + $300.00 (pictures) = $420.00

The original installation cost is $129.00.

So, the total cost for Angela is:
$129.00 (original cost) + $420.00 (additional items) = $549.00

The final numerical answer is:
$549.00"
"First, let's find out how much money Anthony has saved. Since Eva has saved $20.00 and Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, we can calculate Anthony's savings as follows:

Anthony's savings = Eva's savings + $10.00
Anthony's savings = $20.00 + $10.00
Anthony's savings = $30.00

Now, we know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find out how much more Roy has saved, we calculate 40% of Anthony's savings:

40% of Anthony's savings = 0.40 * $30.00
40% of Anthony's savings = $12.00

So, Roy has saved $12.00 more than Anthony. Now we can find out how much Roy has saved in total:

Roy's savings = Anthony's savings + $12.00
Roy's savings = $30.00 + $12.00
Roy's savings = $42.00

The final numerical answer is $42.00."
"First, let's figure out how high each person can lift a mountain step by step.

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain \(12 \times 1 = 12\) inches.
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain \(4 \times 12 = 48\) inches.
4. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain \(10 \times 48 = 480\) inches.

Now, to convert 480 inches to feet, we know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches. So, we divide 480 by 12.

480 inches ÷ 12 inches/foot = 40 feet

So, the final numerical answer is 40 feet."
"Mason travels 8 miles per hour for 4 hours, so he travels 8 * 4 = 32 miles. Then he travels another 8 miles per hour for 6 hours, so he travels 8 * 6 = 48 miles. In total, he has traveled 32 + 48 = 80 miles."
"First, let's understand the information given:
- 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway.
- Each kangaroo travels at the same speed.
- Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo.

To find out how long it will take for 4 turtles to cross the highway, we need to consider the speed relationship between the kangaroos and the turtles.

If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours, we can think of the total distance as being covered by the combined speed of the kangaroos. Since the speed of each kangaroo is the same, the total distance is 3 kangaroos' speed times 18 hours.

Now, if each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, then 4 turtles together would travel at the same speed as 2 kangaroos (since 4 turtles at half speed is the same as 2 kangaroos at full speed).

So, if 3 kangaroos take 18 hours, then 2 kangaroos (which is the speed of 4 turtles) would take half the time to cover the same distance. Therefore, it would take 18 hours / 2 = 9 hours for 4 turtles to cross the highway.

The final numerical answer is:
9"
"Kora made 20 dishes.
Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory makes 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.
Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada makes 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.
Together, they make 20 + 40 + 80 = 140 dishes.

The final numerical answer is 140."
"First, let's find out the final price of the laptop after trading in the old one. The original price is $600, and the price is reduced by $200.

\[ \text{Final price} = \$600 - \$200 = \$400 \]

Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means she has $400 - $50 = $350.

Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job and her mom gives her $80. So, the total amount she has from these sources is:

\[ \$150 + \$80 = \$230 \]

Since the total amount she needs is $350 and she has $230 from her job and mom, the amount she has in her purse is:

\[ \$350 - \$230 = \$120 \]

So, Erika has $120 in her purse."
"First, let's find out how many slices Adam gets from the large apples:
- A large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces.
- Adam slices 3 large apples.
- So, from the large apples, Adam gets 3 * 5 = 15 slices.

Next, let's find out how many slices Adam gets from the small apples:
- A small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces.
- Adam slices 5 small apples.
- So, from the small apples, Adam gets 5 * 3 = 15 slices.

Now, let's add the slices from the large and small apples together:
- From the large apples, Adam gets 15 slices.
- From the small apples, Adam gets 15 slices.
- So, in total, Adam gets 15 + 15 = 30 slices.

Adam eats 15 slices, so let's find out how many slices are left:
- Adam has 30 slices in total.
- Adam eats 15 slices.
- So, the number of slices left is 30 - 15 = 15 slices.

The final numerical answer is 15."
"First, let's find out how much milk 3 cows produce in a day. Since each cow gives 5 liters of milk a day, 3 cows will give:

3 cows * 5 liters/cow = 15 liters/day

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. To find out how many more cows are needed, we need to calculate the difference in milk production needed and how much each additional cow can produce:

25 liters/day (desired) - 15 liters/day (current) = 10 liters/day (needed)

Since each cow produces 5 liters a day, we can find out how many more cows are needed by dividing the needed milk by the milk each cow can produce:

10 liters/day / 5 liters/cow = 2 cows

So, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The final numerical answer is:

2"
"First, let's find out how much of each glue stick is not used.

For the first glue stick, which has 1/6 left:
- If it's 12 millimeters long, then 1/6 of it is 12 * 1/6 = 2 millimeters.
- So, 4/6 (or 2/3) of it is not used, which is 12 * 4/6 = 8 millimeters.

For the second glue stick, which has 2/3 left:
- If it's 12 millimeters long, then 2/3 of it is 12 * 2/3 = 8 millimeters.
- So, 1/3 of it is not used, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 millimeters.

For the third glue stick, which has 1/2 left:
- If it's 12 millimeters long, then 1/2 of it is 12 * 1/2 = 6 millimeters.
- So, 1/2 of it is not used, which is 12 * 1/2 = 6 millimeters.

Now, let's add up the lengths of the glue that is not used:
- The first glue stick has 8 millimeters not used.
- The second glue stick has 4 millimeters not used.
- The third glue stick has 6 millimeters not used.

So, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 8 + 4 + 6 = 18 millimeters.

The final numerical answer is 18."
"First, let's add up all the money Gabriel has:
- Money from working on weekends: $5000
- Money from his brother: $200

Now, let's add these amounts together:
$5000 + $200 = $5200

Next, let's find out the total cost of the car and the phone:
- Cost of the car: $10000
- Cost of the phone: $800

Total cost of the car and the phone:
$10000 + $800 = $10800

Now, let's find out how much more money Gabriel needs by subtracting the total amount he has from the total cost:
$10800 - $5200 = $5600

So, Gabriel still needs $5600."
"Thea gave the craftsman four $20 bills, so she gave a total of 4 * $20 = $80.
The hat cost $70, so the change she got is $80 - $70 = $10.
The final numerical answer is $10."
"Craig has 2 twenty dollar bills, so he has 2 * 20 = 40 dollars.
He buys six squirt guns for 2 dollars each, so he spends 6 * 2 = 12 dollars on squirt guns.
He also buys three packs of water balloons for 3 dollars each, so he spends 3 * 3 = 9 dollars on water balloons.
In total, Craig spends 12 + 9 = 21 dollars.
So, Craig has 40 - 21 = 19 dollars left."
"If Jack collected 60 dishes, and Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, then Jack has 60 / 2 = 30 socks.

Peter has half times as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has 30 * 2 = 60 socks.

Together, Peter and Jack have 30 + 60 = 90 socks and 60 + 30 = 90 dishes.

So, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is 90 + 90 = 180."
"First, let's add the number of students who are good at math only and those who perform well in English only:
5 (good at math only) + 8 (perform well in English only) = 13

There are 20 students in total. So, the number of students who are good at both math and English is:
20 (total students) - 13 (good at math only or English only) = 7

Now, to find out how many students are good at math, we need to consider that all students who are good at both math and English are also good at math. So, we add the students who are good at both to the students who are good at math only:
5 (good at math only) + 7 (good at both) = 12

The final numerical answer is 12."
"First, let's calculate the total time each group takes to perform, including the time to get on stage, perform, and exit the stage. Each group takes:
- 2 minutes to get on stage
- 6 minutes to perform
- 2 minutes to exit the stage

So, the total time for one group is:
2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes

Now, let's add the time for the intermission:
- The intermission is 10 minutes

The total time for the concert is 2 hours, which is:
2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes

Now, we subtract the intermission time from the total time to find out how much time is left for the groups to perform:
120 minutes - 10 minutes = 110 minutes

Now, we divide the remaining time by the time each group takes to find out how many groups can perform:
110 minutes / 10 minutes/group = 11 groups

So, the final answer is 11 groups."
"First, let's find out how much interest Brenda will earn in one year. The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is $300. So, the interest rate per year is:

\[ \text{Interest rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \]

This means that every year, Brenda earns $225 in interest. To find out how much interest she earns in 3 years, we multiply the annual interest by 3:

\[ \text{Total interest in 3 years} = 225 \times 3 = 675 \]

Now, to find out the total amount she will have after 3 years, we add the total interest to the original amount she invested:

\[ \text{Total amount} = \text{Original amount} + \text{Total interest} = 300 + 675 = 975 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 975 \]"
"First, let's find out how many white shirts have collars and how many don't.

There are 40 white shirts in total. Half of them have collars, so:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]
So, 20 white shirts have collars. This means the rest of the white shirts don't have collars:
\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \]
So, 20 white shirts don't have collars.

Next, we know that 20 of the floral shirts have buttons. Since there are 50 floral shirts in total, the number of floral shirts without buttons is:
\[ 50 - 20 = 30 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars. We already know that there are 20 white shirts with no collars and 30 floral shirts with no buttons. So, the difference is:
\[ 30 - 20 = 10 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"First, we need to find out how many trays the farmer needs. Since each tray holds 30 eggs and he has 900 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold:

\[ \text{Number of trays} = \frac{900 \text{ eggs}}{30 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 30 \text{ trays} \]

Now, we know the farmer has 30 trays. If he sells each tray for $2.5, we can calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of trays by the price per tray:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 30 \text{ trays} \times \$2.5/\text{tray} = \$75 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$75 \]"
"First, let's find out how many goats Mr. Smith sold from each farm.

From Farm X, he sold 10 goats.
From Farm Y, he sold twice as many as from Farm X, so he sold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) goats.

Now, let's calculate how many goats are left in each farm.

In Farm X, he originally had 55 goats and sold 10, so he has \(55 - 10 = 45\) goats left.
In Farm Y, he originally had 45 goats and sold 20, so he has \(45 - 20 = 25\) goats left.

Now, let's add the number of goats left in both farms to find the total number of goats left.

So, the total number of goats left is \(45 + 25 = 70\).

The final numerical answer is 70."
"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many pairs of shoes James buys in a year. Since he buys 2 pairs a month, we multiply 2 by 12 (months in a year):
   2 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 24 pairs/year

2. Now we know he spends $2640 on shoes in a year and he buys 24 pairs of shoes. To find out how much he pays on average for each pair, we divide the total amount spent by the number of pairs:
   $2640 / 24 pairs = $110/pair

So, James pays $110 on average for each pair of shoes."
"First, let's calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food:
- Each basket of green food costs $25.
- So, 3 baskets of green food will cost 3 * $25 = $75.

Next, let's calculate the cost of 3 baskets of red food:
- Each basket of red food costs $18.
- So, 3 baskets of red food will cost 3 * $18 = $54.

Now, we need to apply the $2 discount for each basket of red food:
- Since you get $2 off for each basket of red food, for 3 baskets, you get 3 * $2 = $6 off.

So, the total cost for the red food after the discount is $54 - $6 = $48.

Finally, we add the cost of the green food and the cost of the red food after the discount:
- Total cost = Cost of green food + Cost of red food after discount
- Total cost = $75 + $48 = $123.

The final numerical answer is $123."
"First, we need to find out how many rooms are half of 90 rooms. Half of 90 is 45 rooms.

Next, we know it takes 20 minutes to clean each room. So, to clean 45 rooms, it would take 45 rooms * 20 minutes/room = 900 minutes.

To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60 because there are 60 minutes in an hour. So, 900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours.

The final numerical answer is 15 hours."
"To solve this, let's break it down year by year.

In the first year, they build 12 homes.

In the second year, they build three times the number of homes they built in the first year. So, they build 12 * 3 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total from the first two years is 12 + 36 = 48 homes. So, in the third year, they build 48 * 2 = 96 homes.

Now, to find out how many homes they have built over the three years, we add the homes built each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 homes.

So, the town will have built 144 homes over the next three years."
"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Let's say you are X years old.
2. Your brother is three years older than you, so he is X + 3 years old.
3. Your sister is two years younger than you, so she is X - 2 years old.
4. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age, so your mom is 3(X + 3) - 1 years old.
5. The total age of you, your brother, your sister, and your mom is 87.

Now, let's add up all the ages:
X (your age) + (X + 3) (your brother's age) + (X - 2) (your sister's age) + [3(X + 3) - 1] (your mom's age) = 87

Combine like terms:
X + X + 3 + X - 2 + 3X + 9 - 1 = 87
5X + 9 = 87

Subtract 9 from both sides:
5X = 78

Divide by 5:
X = 15.6

Since we are dealing with ages and the question implies whole numbers, it seems there might be a misunderstanding or a need for rounding. However, based on the given information and the steps followed, the numerical answer is:

X = 15.6

But since ages are typically whole numbers, we might need to recheck the problem statement or consider if there's a rounding issue."
"First, we need to find out how many glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs in total. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, we multiply 27 by 2:

27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks

Next, we need to figure out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy. Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks in each pack:

54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks/pack = 6.75 packs

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs and he wants to have some extra glue sticks left over, he needs to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks."
"First, we need to find out how much water passes through the river after the heavy rain. The amount of water doubles after the heavy rain, so we multiply the original amount by 2:

4000 gallons * 2 = 8000 gallons

On the third day, the volume of water increases by 6000 gallons. To find the total amount of water on the third day, we add the increase to the amount after the heavy rain:

8000 gallons + 6000 gallons = 14000 gallons

So, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point on the third day is 14000 gallons."
"To solve this, let's break it down day by day.

Day 1:
- We start with 10 infected people.
- Each of these 10 people infects 6 others.
- So, \(10 \times 6 = 60\) new people are infected.
- Total infected people after Day 1: \(10 + 60 = 70\).

Day 2:
- Now, there are 70 infected people.
- Each of these 70 people infects 6 others.
- So, \(70 \times 6 = 420\) new people are infected.
- Total infected people after Day 2: \(70 + 420 = 490\).

Day 3:
- Now, there are 490 infected people.
- Each of these 490 people infects 6 others.
- So, \(490 \times 6 = 2940\) new people are infected.
- Total infected people after Day 3: \(490 + 2940 = 3430\).

So, the total number of people infected after three days is 3430."
"First, let's find out how much money Rafaela received as tips. Since each of the forty customers gave her $20, we can calculate it as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ customers} \times \$20 \text{ per customer} = \$800 \]

So, Rafaela received $800 in tips.

Now, we need to find out how much money Julieta received. Julieta received 10% less money than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's tips:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$800 = 0.10 \times \$800 = \$80 \]

So, Julieta received $80 less than Rafaela:

\[ \$800 - \$80 = \$720 \]

Now, to find out how much money Julieta and Rafaela received altogether, we add their tips together:

\[ \$800 + \$720 = \$1520 \]

So, Julieta and Rafaela received $1520 as tips altogether."
"Jennifer started with 12 oranges. She gave 2 oranges to each of her 3 daughters, which is a total of 2 * 3 = 6 oranges. Her boy got 3 oranges. So, in total, she gave away 6 + 3 = 9 oranges. Therefore, the number of oranges she remained with is 12 - 9 = 3 oranges."
"Claire earns 1 badge every month. So in a year, which has 12 months, Claire earns 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge, so Amber earns 1/2 badge every month. In a year, Amber earns 12 * 1/2 = 6 badges.

Wendy earns 3 times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. So in a year, Wendy earns 12 * 3 = 36 badges.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number Wendy earns: 36 - 6 = 30.

So, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a year."
"First, let's calculate how many hours Paige bakes banana bread. She starts at 1:00 PM and stops at 6:00 PM, so she bakes for 5 hours.

Since she can bake 2 banana bread loaves every hour, in 5 hours she can bake:
\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so in 10 loaves, she gets:
\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, so the total amount raised in cents is:
\[ 80 \text{ slices} \times 50 \text{ cents/slice} = 4000 \text{ cents} \]

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100:
\[ 4000 \text{ cents} \div 100 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 40 \]"
"If Gretchen has 70 gold coins and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, then she has 70 - 30 = 40 silver coins.

To find the total number of coins, we add the gold coins and the silver coins together: 70 gold coins + 40 silver coins = 110 coins.

So, the final numerical answer is 110."
"First, let's find out how many burritos were given to the students. There were 50 students and each student was given 10 burritos. So, the total number of burritos given to students is:

50 students * 10 burritos/student = 500 burritos

Mr. George ate 20 burritos. So, the total number of burritos eaten by students and Mr. George is:

500 burritos + 20 burritos = 520 burritos

George ordered 600 burritos in total. To find out how many burritos were leftover, we subtract the total number of burritos eaten from the total number of burritos ordered:

600 burritos - 520 burritos = 80 burritos

So, the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is 80."
"First, let's find out how many green cars there are. Since there are 2 fewer green cars than red cars, and there are 12 red cars, we can calculate the number of green cars as follows:

Number of green cars = Number of red cars - 2
Number of green cars = 12 - 2
Number of green cars = 10

Next, we need to find out how many blue cars there are. The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars. So:

Number of blue cars = 3 * Number of green cars
Number of blue cars = 3 * 10
Number of blue cars = 30

Now, let's add up all the red, green, and blue cars:

Total of red, green, and blue cars = Number of red cars + Number of green cars + Number of blue cars
Total of red, green, and blue cars = 12 + 10 + 30
Total of red, green, and blue cars = 52

The rink has 75 cars in total. To find out how many yellow cars there are, we subtract the total of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:

Number of yellow cars = Total number of cars - Total of red, green, and blue cars
Number of yellow cars = 75 - 52
Number of yellow cars = 23

So, the rink has 23 yellow cars."
"To solve this, let's use the information given:

1. Sofie + Anne + Fawn = 85 books
2. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne
3. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn

Let's use Fawn's books as the starting point. We can call the number of books Fawn has as 'F'. Then Anne has 'F - 12' books, and Sofie has 'F - 12 + 25' books.

So, the total number of books can be written as:
\[ F + (F - 12) + (F - 12 + 25) = 85 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ F + F - 12 + F - 12 + 25 = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
\[ 3F = 84 \]
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books."
"First, we need to find out how much the sweet potatoes weigh. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, we can calculate the weight of the sweet potatoes as follows:

\[ \text{Weight of sweet potatoes} = 2 \times 5 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out how much the carrots weigh. The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so we subtract 3 pounds from the weight of the sweet potatoes:

\[ \text{Weight of carrots} = 10 \text{ pounds} - 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Daisy bought 7 pounds of carrots."
"First, we need to find out how many jello cups Greg needs to make. Since there will be 30 kids and each kid should have 4 jello cups, we multiply 30 by 4:

30 kids * 4 jello cups/kid = 120 jello cups

Next, we need to find out how many boxes of jello Greg needs. Since one box makes 10 jello cups, we divide the total number of jello cups needed by the number of jello cups one box makes:

120 jello cups / 10 jello cups/box = 12 boxes

Now, we need to find out how much Greg will spend on the jello. Since each box costs $1.25, we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:

12 boxes * $1.25/box = $15

So, Greg will spend $15 on jello."
"First, we need to find out the total cost of the 5 phones. Each phone costs $700, so:

5 phones * $700/phone = $3500

The seller gave $4000 in dollar bills. To find out the change, we subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount given:

$4000 - $3500 = $500

So, the seller will give back $500 in change."
"First, we need to find out how much Madeline pays in a month. Since Madeline pays 60% of $400, we calculate:

\[ 400 \times 0.60 = 240 \]

So, Madeline pays $240 in a month. This means Keenan pays the rest, which is:

\[ 400 - 240 = 160 \]

Now, we need to find out how much Keenan pays per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we divide Keenan's monthly payment by 4:

\[ 160 \div 4 = 40 \]

So, Keenan spends $40 per week."
"First, let's find out how many pieces Tobias ate on the first day. He ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces.

2/5 of 60 = 24 pieces

So, after the first day, he has eaten 24 pieces and has 60 - 24 = 36 pieces left.

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces, so now he has 36 - 10 = 26 pieces left.

Now, let's find out how many pieces he ate on the third day. He ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces.

7/13 of 26 = 14 pieces

So, on the third day, he ate 14 pieces.

Now, let's add up all the pieces he ate over the three days:

First day: 24 pieces
Second day: 10 pieces
Third day: 14 pieces

Total pieces eaten = 24 + 10 + 14 = 48 pieces

The final numerical answer is 48."
"First, we need to find out how much one bottle of soda costs. If seven bottles of soda cost $21.00, then one bottle of soda costs $21.00 / 7 = $3.00.

Next, we find out how much one bottle of water costs. If four bottles of water cost $8.00, then one bottle of water costs $8.00 / 4 = $2.00.

Now, we calculate the cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water. The cost for 3 bottles of soda is 3 * $3.00 = $9.00. The cost for 2 bottles of water is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

Adding these together, the total cost is $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00.

So, the final numerical answer is $13.00."
"First, we need to find out how much 16 bolts cost. Each bolt costs $0.03, so we multiply the cost of one bolt by the number of bolts:

$0.03 * 16 = $0.48

David has $12.48 and spends $0.48 on the bolts. To find out how much money he has left, we subtract the cost of the bolts from the amount of money David has:

$12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00

So, the final amount of money David has left is $12.00."
"First, we need to find out how much Ella earns per hour. We do this by dividing the amount she earned by the number of hours she worked.

Ella earned $33 for 3 hours, so her hourly rate is:
\[ \text{Hourly rate} = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Now, to find out how much she would earn after 12 hours, we multiply her hourly rate by 12:

"Paul originally had 52 marbles and his friend gave him 28 more, so he had:
52 + 28 = 80 marbles.

Then he lost 1/4 of his marbles, which means he lost:
1/4 * 80 = 20 marbles.

So, the number of marbles Paul has left is:
80 - 20 = 60 marbles.

The final numerical answer is 60."
"First, let's calculate how many questions Amy got right in each type:

For multiple-choice questions:
- There are 10 questions.
- She got 80% right.
- So, she got \(10 \times 0.80 = 8\) questions right.

For true/false questions:
- There are 20 questions.
- She got 90% right.
- So, she got \(20 \times 0.90 = 18\) questions right.

For long-answer questions:
- There are 5 questions.
- She got 60% right.
- So, she got \(5 \times 0.60 = 3\) questions right.

Now, let's calculate the points she scored from each type of question:

For multiple-choice questions:
- Each question is worth 1 point.
- She got 8 questions right.
- So, she scored \(8 \times 1 = 8\) points.

For true/false questions:
- Each question is worth 1 point.
- She got 18 questions right.
- So, she scored \(18 \times 1 = 18\) points.

For long-answer questions:
- Each question is worth 5 points.
- She got 3 questions right.
- So, she scored \(3 \times 5 = 15\) points.

Now, let's add up all the points she scored:
- Multiple-choice: 8 points
- True/false: 18 points
- Long-answer: 15 points

Total points = \(8 + 18 + 15 = 41\)

"First, we need to find out how many chickens Isaias plans to sell. He plans to sell 3/5 of his 300 chickens.

To find 3/5 of 300, we do:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \]

So, Isaias plans to sell 180 chickens.

Next, we need to find out how much money Isaias needs to make to reach his profit goal of $2000. Since he sells each chicken for $50, we calculate the total selling price for 180 chickens:
\[ 180 \times 50 = 9000 \]

This $9000 is the total amount of money Isaias will make from selling the chickens. To find out how much he spent to buy the chickens, we subtract the profit he wants to make from the total selling price:
\[ 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \]

So, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for sale for $7000."
"Micah sold half the number of glasses that Julie sold. Since Julie sold 14 glasses, Micah sold 14 / 2 = 7 glasses. To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number Julie sold: 14 - 7 = 7. So, Julie sold 7 more glasses than Micah.

The final numerical answer is 7."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Iris spent $400 on hair.
2. She spent 1/4 of $400 on a manicure. So, 1/4 * $400 = $100.
3. She spent 3/4 of the manicure cost on a pedicure. So, 3/4 * $100 = $75.
4. Now, to find out how much she spent in total, we add up all the costs: $400 (hair) + $100 (manicure) + $75 (pedicure) = $575.

So, the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa is $575."
"First, we need to find out how much money Sarah will get from selling her rope. Since her rope is 20 meters long and she sells it at $2 a meter, we multiply 20 by 2.

20 meters * $2/meter = $40

Now, Sarah uses this $40 to buy a new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 a meter. To find out how many meters of the new rope she can buy, we divide $40 by $1.5/meter.

$40 / $1.5/meter = 26.6667 meters

Since she can't buy a fraction of a meter, she can buy 26 meters of the new rope. Now, we need to find out how much the 26 meters of the new rope will cost.

26 meters * $1.5/meter = $39

Now, to find out how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the money she got from selling her rope.

$40 - $39 = $1

So, Sarah will have $1 left over after she buys the new rope."
"First, let's find out how old Melanie is now. If in 10 years she will be 18 years old, then now she is 18 - 10 = 8 years old.

We need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Her current age is 8 years, so three times her current age is 8 * 3 = 24 years.

To find out in how many years her age will be 24, we subtract her current age from 24. So, 24 - 8 = 16 years.

The final numerical answer is 16."
"First, let's find out how much each item costs.

A pack of bacon costs $10 / 5 packs = $2 per pack.

A pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so it costs $2 * 2 = $4 per pack.

A pack of strawberries costs $4.

A pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, so it costs $4 / 2 = $2 per pack.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of all the items Kelly is buying.

The total cost of bacon is $2 * 5 = $10.
The total cost of chicken is $4 * 6 = $24.
The total cost of strawberries is $4 * 3 = $12.
The total cost of apples is $2 * 7 = $14.

Now, let's add up all the costs to find the total amount Kelly is spending.

Total cost = $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

Kelly's budget is $65, so the money she has left is $65 - $60 = $5.

So, Kelly has $5 left in her budget."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. The final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts. Let's say her usual concert is \( x \) minutes long.
2. So, the final concert is \( 2x \) minutes long.
3. At the end of the final concert, she performs a 15-minute encore.
4. The total time for the final concert including the encore is \( 2x + 15 \) minutes.
5. We know the total time for the final concert is 65 minutes.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]
\[ x = 25 \]

Therefore, her usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

The final numerical answer is:
25"
"Argo originally had 200 toys.
He gave away 40 + 80 + 30 = 150 toys in total.

So, the number of toys Argo has now is 200 - 150 = 50 toys.

The final numerical answer is 50."
"To find out how many chimichangas they make in three days, we need to add the number of chimichangas made each day.

On Tuesday, they make 125 chimichangas.
On Wednesday, they also make 125 chimichangas.
On Friday, they make twice as many as on Tuesday, which is 125 * 2 = 250 chimichangas.

Now, we add the numbers together:
125 (Tuesday) + 125 (Wednesday) + 250 (Friday) = 500 chimichangas.

So, the final numerical answer is 500."
"First, let's find out how many microphones won't fit. If 20% of the microphones won't fit, then:

20% of 50 microphones = 0.20 * 50 = 10 microphones

This means 10 microphones won't be paired. So, the number of microphones that can be paired is:

50 microphones - 10 microphones = 40 microphones

Now, we need to find out how many pairs of microphones can be arranged with 40 microphones. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones:

40 microphones / 2 microphones per pair = 20 pairs

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage."
"First, let's find out how many birds are flying overhead. Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes. 2/3 of that number is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \]

So, 4 birds are flying overhead.

Next, let's find out how many birds are in the groups feeding. There are 3 groups of 8 birds each:

\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

So, there are 24 birds feeding.

Now, let's add up all the birds Jerry counts:

\[ 6 \text{ (nesting)} + 4 \text{ (flying)} + 24 \text{ (feeding)} = 34 \]

So, the total number of birds Jerry counts is 34."
"Lani had 55 - 5 = 50 cookies left after eating 5.

She then placed these 50 cookies equally into 5 jars, so each jar had 50 ÷ 5 = 10 cookies.

The final answer is 10."
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals on the orchids. Joelle has 5 orchids and each orchid has 5 petals. So, the total number of petals on the orchids is:
5 orchids * 5 petals/orchid = 25 petals

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals on the African daisies. Joelle has 4 African daisies and each daisy has 10 petals. So, the total number of petals on the daisies is:
4 daisies * 10 petals/daisy = 40 petals

Now, to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies:
40 petals (daisies) - 25 petals (orchids) = 15 petals

So, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids."
"First, let's find out how many indoor plants there are. One-fourth of the 100 plants are indoor plants, so:

\[ \text{Indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Now, we subtract the indoor plants from the total to find out how many plants are left:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Next, we find out how many of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. Two-thirds of the remaining 75 plants are outdoor plants:

\[ \text{Outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

Now, to find out how many plants are flowering plants, we subtract the number of indoor and outdoor plants from the total:

\[ \text{Flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25 \]

To find out what percent of the plants are flowering plants, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percent of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percent of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, 25% of the plants are flowering plants."
"First, we need to find out how fast a thingamabob spins. Since a whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob and it spins at 121 meters per second, we can divide 121 by 11 to find the speed of a thingamabob.

121 ÷ 11 = 11 meters per second

Now we know a thingamabob spins at 11 meters per second. Since a whirligig spins five times faster than a thingamabob, we can multiply the speed of a thingamabob by 5 to find the speed of a whirligig.

11 × 5 = 55 meters per second

So, a whirligig spins at 55 meters per second."
"First, let's find out how much Ellen pays for the salad and the yogurt each day.

The salad costs $6.
The yogurt costs half the price of the salad, so it costs $6 / 2 = $3.

Now, let's add the cost of the salad and the yogurt:
$6 (salad) + $3 (yogurt) = $9.

Ellen pays a total of $11 for her goods every day. So, the amount she spends on carrots is:
$11 (total) - $9 (salad and yogurt) = $2.

Ellen eats two carrots every day, so the cost of one carrot is:
$2 / 2 carrots = $1 per carrot.

The final numerical answer is:
1"
"First, let's find out how much Mark makes per hour now. He used to make $10 an hour but they raised his pay by $2 per hour. So now he makes:

$10 + $2 = $12 per hour

Next, we need to find out how many hours he works in a week. He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so:

8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week

Now, to find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply the number of hours he works in a week by his new hourly wage:

40 hours/week * $12/hour = $480/week

So, Mark makes $480 a week."
"First, let's find out how much Tasha made mowing lawns.

If Tasha mowed Joe's lawn 1 time, then she mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times as many times as Joe's lawn, which is 3 * 1 = 3 times.
She also mowed Alba's lawn 5 times as many times as Joe's lawn, which is 5 * 1 = 5 times.

So, the total number of times she mowed lawns is 1 (for Joe) + 3 (for Kamala) + 5 (for Alba) = 9 times.

Since she made $6 for mowing Joe's lawn, and she mowed Joe's lawn once, we can assume she made $6 for each lawn she mowed.

Therefore, for 9 lawns, she made 9 * $6 = $54.

Tasha made $80 in total from selling lemonade and mowing lawns.

To find out how much she made from lemonade sales, we subtract the amount she made from mowing lawns from the total amount.

So, $80 - $54 = $26.

The final numerical answer is $26."
"First, we need to find Carl's weight. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, we add 16 kg to Martin's weight:

55 kg (Martin's weight) + 16 kg = 71 kg (Carl's weight)

Next, we find Christian's weight. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so we add 8 kg to Carl's weight:

71 kg (Carl's weight) + 8 kg = 79 kg (Christian's weight)

Finally, we find Harry's weight. Harry is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so we subtract 5 kg from Christian's weight:

79 kg (Christian's weight) - 5 kg = 74 kg (Harry's weight)

So, the weight of Harry is 74 kg."
"First, let's calculate how many hours John rents his car in a month. He rents it 10 times a month and each time it's for 3 hours. So, we multiply 10 by 3:

10 * 3 = 30 hours

Now, we know he gets $25 for each hour. So, we multiply the total hours by the hourly rate to find out how much he earns in a month:

30 * 25 = $750

John's car payment is $500. To find out his profit, we subtract the car payment from the total earnings:

750 - 500 = $250

So, John makes a profit of $250 on his car."
"Martha originally had 7 - 5 = 2 notebooks.
Joseph had 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks.
Martha now has 7 notebooks.
Joseph has 6 notebooks.
So, Martha has 7 - 6 = 1 more notebook than Joseph."
"First, we need to find out how many miles Anis rowed. Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can calculate the extra miles Anis rowed by finding 1/5 of Dijana's distance and then adding that to Dijana's distance.

Dijana rowed 50 miles.

To find 1/5 of 50 miles:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles} \]

So, Anis rowed:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Now, to find the total distance both of them rowed, we add Dijana's distance to Anis's distance:
\[ 50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles} \]

The total distance the two of them rowed on that day is 110 miles."
"First, we need to find out how many cookies Susan would have if she didn't give any to her husband. She made 100 cookies and her husband took 4, so:

100 - 4 = 96 cookies

Now, Susan wants to divide these 96 cookies equally among her 6 nephews. To find out how many each nephew gets, we divide 96 by 6:

96 ÷ 6 = 16

So, each of Susan’s nephews will get 16 cookies."
"First, let's find out how many pages Denise read today. Since she read 5 more pages than Daniel did yesterday, and Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages today.

Now, let's add up the pages each of them read over the two days.

Denise read 10 pages yesterday and 18 pages today, so in total, Denise read 10 + 18 = 28 pages.

Daniel read 13 pages yesterday and 0 pages today, so in total, Daniel read 13 + 0 = 13 pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total pages Daniel read from the total pages Denise read.

So, Denise read 28 - 13 = 15 more pages than Daniel."
"First, let's figure out how much soup is in the pot. The pot can fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls. Since Calvin is an adult, he will have one bowl of soup. His wife is also an adult, so she will have one bowl of soup too. That's two bowls for adults.

Now, there are two children, and each child will have one bowl of soup. So, the total number of bowls of soup needed is:
- 2 bowls for adults (Calvin and his wife)
- 2 bowls for children (Calvin's two children)

That's a total of 4 bowls of soup.

The pot can fill 8 child's bowls, and we've used 4 bowls for the adults and children. So, the leftover soup can fill:
\[ 8 \text{ bowls} - 4 \text{ bowls} = 4 \text{ bowls} \]

Since each child can have one bowl of soup, and there are 4 bowls left, each child can have:
\[ \frac{4 \text{ bowls}}{2 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ bowls} \]

So, each child will be able to have 2 bowls of soup for lunch from the leftover soup."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the notebooks. William bought five notebooks, and each notebook costs $1.50.

5 notebooks * $1.50 per notebook = $7.50

Now, let's calculate the cost of the ballpen. The ballpen costs $0.50.

To find the total amount William spent, we add the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen together.

$7.50 (notebooks) + $0.50 (ballpen) = $8.00

So, William spent $8.00 in all."
"First, let's find out how much material Jo needs for one small mask and one large mask.

For small masks:
- 2 yards of material make 4 small masks.
- So, 1 yard of material makes 4/2 = 2 small masks.
- Therefore, for 1 small mask, Jo needs 1/2 = 0.5 yards of material.

For large masks:
- 2.25 yards of material make 3 large masks.
- So, 1 yard of material makes 3/2.25 = 1.3333 (repeating) large masks.
- Therefore, for 1 large mask, Jo needs 1/1.3333 = 0.75 yards of material.

Now, let's calculate the material needed for 20 small masks and 8 large masks.

For 20 small masks:
- 20 small masks need 20 * 0.5 = 10 yards of material.

For 8 large masks:
- 8 large masks need 8 * 0.75 = 6 yards of material.

So, for 20 small and 8 large masks, Jo would need:
- 10 yards for small masks + 6 yards for large masks = 16 yards of material.

The final numerical answer is 16 yards."
"First, we need to find out how many times Deepa has seen the movies in total. Since she has seen each of the 9 movies three times, we multiply 9 by 3:

9 movies * 3 times each = 27 times

Deepa has spent $216 in total for these 27 times. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets:

$216 / 27 times = $8 per ticket

So, the average price she paid per ticket is $8."
"Harold sleeps for 10 hours.
He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours.
He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.
So in total, he spends 10 (sleeping) + 8 (working) + 1 (walking dog) = 19 hours on these activities.
There are 24 hours in a day, so the free time he has is 24 - 19 = 5 hours.
The final numerical answer is 5."
"Tim starts with 7 blue shoe boxes and 9 red shoe boxes. He uses 3 blue shoe boxes, so he has:
7 - 3 = 4 blue shoe boxes left.

He uses 1/3 of his red shoe boxes, which means he uses:
9 * 1/3 = 3 red shoe boxes.

So, he has:
9 - 3 = 6 red shoe boxes left.

In total, Tim has 4 blue shoe boxes and 6 red shoe boxes left."
"Sarah has 9 books.
Joseph had twice the number of Sarah’s books, so he had 9 * 2 = 18 books.
But he lost 2 of them, so he currently has 18 - 2 = 16 books.

The final numerical answer is 16."
"First, let's find out how many marbles Dean gives to Jamie. He gives 1/5 of his 30 marbles to Jamie, so:

1/5 * 30 = 6 marbles

Dean gives 6 marbles to Jamie and 10 marbles to Donald. So, in total, Dean gives away:

6 + 10 = 16 marbles

Now, to find out how many marbles Dean has left, we subtract the total number of marbles he gave away from the original number of marbles he had:

30 - 16 = 14 marbles

So, Dean has 14 marbles left."
"First, let's find out how old Adam was four years ago. If Duncan is 60 years old now, then eight years ago he was 60 - 8 = 52 years old.

According to the question, eight years ago Duncan's age was two times Adam's age four years ago. So, if we let Adam's age four years ago be \( A \), then we have:
\[ 52 = 2 \times A \]
\[ A = \frac{52}{2} \]
\[ A = 26 \]

So, Adam was 26 years old four years ago. To find out how old Adam is now, we add 4 years to his age four years ago:
\[ 26 + 4 = 30 \]

Now, to find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 years to his current age:
\[ 30 + 8 = 38 \]

So, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years."
"First, we need to find out how many acres Farmer Smith's farm has. We know that Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

So, twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm is:
200 acres * 2 = 400 acres

Now, we add 100 acres to this amount to find out how many acres Farmer Smith's farm has:
400 acres + 100 acres = 500 acres

Now we add the acres of both farms together:
Farmer Brown's farm: 200 acres
Farmer Smith's farm: 500 acres

200 acres + 500 acres = 700 acres

So, the two farms together have 700 acres."
"First, let's find out how many packages Colby completes in an hour. If he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, we subtract 10 from 50:

50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour

Now, we know he gets paid $0.20 for each package he completes. To find out how much he earns in an hour, we multiply the number of packages he completes by the amount he gets paid per package:

40 packages * $0.20/package = $8.00 per hour

Since he works for an eight-hour workday, we multiply his hourly wage by 8 to find out how much he earns in a day:

$8.00/hour * 8 hours = $64.00

So, the final numerical answer is $64.00."
"First, let's find out how long an extreme sudoku takes. A normal sudoku takes 45 minutes, so an extreme sudoku takes 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how many half hours are in 180 minutes. Since there are 30 minutes in a half hour (60 minutes / 2), we divide 180 by 30 to find the number of half hours.

180 / 30 = 6

So, John drinks 6 bottles of water in that time."
"First, let's figure out how many pieces of bologna Benny used for the red balloons. Since he threw two pieces of bologna at each red balloon and there were twenty red balloons, we can calculate this as:

2 pieces/bologna * 20 red balloons = 40 pieces of bologna

Now, we know Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna. If we subtract the pieces used for the red balloons from the total, we can find out how many pieces were used for the yellow balloons:

58 total pieces - 40 pieces for red balloons = 18 pieces for yellow balloons

Since Benny threw three pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, we can find out how many yellow balloons there were by dividing the total pieces used for yellow balloons by the number of pieces per yellow balloon:

18 pieces for yellow balloons / 3 pieces per yellow balloon = 6 yellow balloons

So, the number of yellow balloons in the bundle is 6."
"First, we need to find out how many miles Jon drives in a month. He drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, so we multiply 100 by 30.

100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles/month

Now we know Jon drives 3000 miles in a month. Since his car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by the number of miles between tune-ups.

3000 miles / 1000 miles = 3

So, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time. The final numerical answer is:

3"
"Bruce works 5 hours on Tuesday.
On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, so he works 5 * 2 = 10 hours.
On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

To find the total hours he works in all three days, we add the hours from Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday together:
5 + 10 + 8 = 23 hours.

The final numerical answer is 23."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items they bought.

The cake costs $11.

The balloons cost $0.5 for 2 balloons. So, for 1 dozen (12 balloons), the cost would be:
\[ \frac{12}{2} \times 0.5 = 6 \times 0.5 = 3 \]

The ice cream costs $7 each, and they bought 2 tubs:
\[ 2 \times 7 = 14 \]

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
\[ 11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \]

This means Julia and Nadine spent a total of $28. Since they combined their allowance, the total amount given by their mother is $28. Because they split the allowance equally, we divide the total amount by 2:
\[ \frac{28}{2} = 14 \]

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14."
"Kira bought 3 apples + 5 bananas + 6 oranges = 14 pieces of fruit.
Lola ate 2 pieces of the fruit.
So, the number of pieces left is 14 - 2 = 12 pieces."
"First, let's find out how many students are playing volleyball. Since there are 6 students playing tennis and twice that number playing volleyball, we calculate:

2 * 6 = 12 students playing volleyball.

Now, let's add the number of students playing tennis and volleyball:

6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) = 18 students.

Next, we add the number of boys and girls playing soccer:

16 (boys) + 22 (girls) = 38 students playing soccer.

Since each student only participates in one group, we add the students from all groups together:

18 (tennis and volleyball) + 38 (soccer) = 56 students in total.

So, the final numerical answer is 56."
"First, let's find out how many lollipops were sold in total by all the students. Since there are 30 students and each sold an average of 10 lollipops, we multiply these numbers:

30 students * 10 lollipops/student = 300 lollipops

Next, we calculate the total money raised by selling these lollipops. Each lollypop was sold for $0.8, so:

300 lollipops * $0.8/lollypop = $240

Now, let's find out the total cost of buying the lollipops. Each lollypop cost $0.5, so:

300 lollipops * $0.5/lollypop = $150

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total money raised:

$240 - $150 = $90

So, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops."
"Larry has 3 cats.
He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.
He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.
He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 * 7 = 21 fish.
He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.
To find the total number of pets, we add all the pets together: 3 cats + 9 dogs + 7 rabbits + 21 fish + 7 gerbils = 47 pets.

The final numerical answer is 47."
"Abby eats 2 slices a day.
Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so Josh eats 2 x 2 = 4 slices a day.
Together, Abby and Josh eat 2 + 4 = 6 slices a day.
The loaf of bread has 24 slices.
To find out how many days the loaf will last, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat together in a day.
So, 24 slices ÷ 6 slices per day = 4 days.
The loaf of bread will last 4 days."
"Martha will have collected 50 shells. She started collecting at age 5 and by her 10th birthday, she has been collecting for 5 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, she has collected shells for 5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months. So, she will have collected 60 shells."
"First, let's figure out how many cups of chamomile and mint tea Lana has in total. She has 27 cups in total and she uses 15 of them for cinnamon tea. So, the remaining cups are for chamomile and mint tea:

27 - 15 = 12 cups

These 12 cups are divided equally between chamomile and mint tea. So, we divide 12 by 2 to find out how many cups of each:

12 ÷ 2 = 6 cups

So, there are 6 cups of chamomile tea and 6 cups of mint tea. Since she divides these into 3 rows with equal amounts in each row, we divide the 6 cups of each tea by 3:

6 ÷ 3 = 2 cups

Therefore, there are 2 cups of mint tea in each row."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how many trips the sloth can make in 8 hours. Since it takes 4 hours for one trip, in 8 hours it can make 8 / 4 = 2 trips.

2. The sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours. Since he can make 2 trips in 8 hours, he needs to pick up 24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries per trip.

So, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip down to the ground is 12 berries."
"First, we need to find out how much water is in the tank. Since the tank has half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons, the tank has:

\[ \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much water will be left in the tank after 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. So, in 6 days, the amount of water emptied from the tank is:

\[ 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we subtract the amount of water emptied from the initial amount of water in the tank:

\[ 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the number of gallons of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[ 2000 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Colby has spent on popcorn and candy.

He bought 2 tubs of popcorn, and each costs $8.
So, the total spent on popcorn is 2 * $8 = $16.

He also bought 4 boxes of candy, and each costs $2.
So, the total spent on candy is 4 * $2 = $8.

Now, let's add the cost of popcorn and candy to the total amount he has spent.
He has $150 to spend, and he has already spent $16 on popcorn and $8 on candy.
So, the remaining amount is $150 - $16 - $8 = $126.

Now, let's see how much he can spend on tickets with the remaining $126.
He wants to buy a popcorn and a box of candy, which cost $8 + $2 = $10.
So, he can spend $126 - $10 = $116 on tickets.

Now, let's see how many tickets he can buy with $116.
Tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10 each.
So, he can buy $116 / $10 = 11 tickets (since he can't buy a fraction of a ticket).

Colby has already seen 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday and 8 movies on other days.
So, the total number of movies he has already seen is 5 + 8 = 13.

Now, let's find out how many more movies he can see with the 11 tickets he can buy.
He can see 11 more movies with the remaining money.

So, the total number of movies he can see is 13 (already seen) + 11 (new tickets) = 24 movies.

The final numerical answer is 24."
"First, let's find out how many calories are in a mini cinnamon roll and a mini blueberry muffin.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, so a mini cinnamon roll has:
\[ \frac{600}{3} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, so a mini blueberry muffin has:
\[ \frac{450}{3} = 150 \text{ calories} \]

Now, let's calculate the total calories for the mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins.

For the mini cinnamon rolls:
\[ 200 \text{ mini cinnamon rolls} \times 200 \text{ calories per mini cinnamon roll} = 40000 \text{ calories} \]

For the mini blueberry muffins:
\[ 300 \text{ mini blueberry muffins} \times 150 \text{ calories per mini blueberry muffin} = 45000 \text{ calories} \]

Now, let's add the calories from both types of pastries:
\[ 40000 \text{ calories} + 45000 \text{ calories} = 85000 \text{ calories} \]

So, the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked is:
\[ 85000 \]"
"First, let's find out how many Junebugs Rita removed each day.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.

On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many as she did on Monday. So, for each of these days, she removed:
\[ 2 \times 39 = 78 \text{ Junebugs} \]

On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.

On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's add up all the Junebugs she removed over the five days:
\[ 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 \]

Let's add these step by step:
\[ 39 + 78 = 117 \]
\[ 117 + 78 = 195 \]
\[ 195 + 48 = 243 \]
\[ 243 + 57 = 299 \]

So, Rita removed a total of 299 Junebugs over the five days.

To find the average number of Junebugs she removed per day, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days:
\[ \frac{299}{5} = 59.8 \]

The average number of Junebugs that she removes per day is 59.8."
"First, we need to calculate how far the bus traveled. The bus travels at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time:

\[ \text{Distance of the bus} = 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate how far the car traveled. The car travels at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time:

\[ \text{Distance of the car} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 240 \text{ miles} \]

Now, to find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance of the bus} - \text{Distance of the car} = 300 \text{ miles} - 240 \text{ miles} = 60 \text{ miles} \]

So, the bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to add up all the toys Sophie has and then subtract that total from the number of toys she has now.

First, let's add up the toys Sophie already has:
- Building blocks: 31
- Stuffed animals: 8
- Stacking rings: 9

Now, let's add these numbers together:
31 + 8 + 9 = 48

Sophie now has 62 toys in total. To find out how many bouncy balls are in the tube, we subtract the total number of toys she already has from the total number of toys she has now:
62 - 48 = 14

So, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is 14."
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, let's say Jean's age is J, Paul's age is P, and Peter's age is T.

We know that:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old. So, T + P + J = 100.
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean. So, P = J + 10.
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age. So, T = P + J.

Now, let's use these equations to find the ages.

From the third equation, we can substitute P in the first equation:
T = (J + 10) + J
T = 2J + 10

Now we substitute T and P in the first equation:
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
2J + J + J + 10 + 10 = 100
4J + 20 = 100
4J = 80
J = 20

Now we know Jean's age is 20. Let's find Paul's age:
P = J + 10
P = 20 + 10
P = 30

And now we can find Peter's age:
T = P + J
T = 30 + 20
T = 50

So, Peter's age is 50 years old."
"Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons, so that's 4 friends * 2 balloons = 8 balloons. Maria also got 2 balloons. So, before her mom gave them more, they had 8 + 2 = 10 balloons.

Her mom then gave each person 3 more balloons. There are 4 friends + 1 Maria = 5 people in total. So, 5 people * 3 balloons = 15 more balloons.

Adding the balloons before and after her mom gave them more, the total number of balloons is 10 + 15 = 25 balloons."
"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes of stuff they have.

10 people donate 5 boxes each, so that's 10 * 5 = 50 boxes.
They also have 10 boxes already.

So, the total number of boxes is 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Now, we need to find out how many tables they need to fit all the boxes.

They can fit 2 boxes per table, so for 60 boxes, they need 60 / 2 = 30 tables.

They already have 15 tables, so they need 30 - 15 = 15 new tables.

The final numerical answer is:
15"
"First, we need to calculate the total distance each person spits the seeds.

For Zoey:
- She has 40 seeds.
- Each seed is spit 10 feet.
- So, the total distance Zoey spits is 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet.

For Sydney:
- She has 35 seeds.
- Each seed is spit 12 feet.
- So, the total distance Sydney spits is 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet.

Now, we add the total distances to find the combined total distance:
- Combined total distance = 400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet.

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the combined total distance by the number of people (which is 2):
- Average total distance = 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet.

So, the average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"First, let's calculate how many widgets each machine can make in a day.

The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour. In a day with 24 hours, it makes:
\[ 60 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 1440 \text{ widgets/day} \]

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour. In a day with 24 hours, it makes:
\[ 45 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 1080 \text{ widgets/day} \]

Next, let's calculate how many widgets each machine can make in a month with 30 days.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
\[ 1440 \text{ widgets/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 43200 \text{ widgets/month} \]

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
\[ 1080 \text{ widgets/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 32400 \text{ widgets/month} \]

Now, let's calculate the total money each machine can make in a month by selling each widget for $6.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
\[ 43200 \text{ widgets} \times 6 \text{ dollars/widget} = 259200 \text{ dollars} \]

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
\[ 32400 \text{ widgets} \times 6 \text{ dollars/widget} = 194400 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, let's find out how much more money the Widgeteer 3000 makes compared to the WidgetMaster 9000.

\[ 259200 \text{ dollars} - 194400 \text{ dollars} = 64800 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Fern will make $64800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000."
"First, let's calculate the cost if Cameron chooses the 24-hour option.

The hotel charges 1600 pesos for a 24-hour stay.

Now, let's calculate the cost if Cameron chooses the option of adding 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark.

Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning. This means he will stay for 11 hours.

The first 12 hours cost 1600 pesos.
For the additional 11 - 12 = -1 hour (which is not possible, so we consider only the first 12 hours), he pays 1600 pesos.

Since he doesn't stay extra, he doesn't pay for the additional hours.

So, the total cost if he chooses the option of adding 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark is 1600 pesos.

Now, let's find out how much Cameron would save.

The cost of the 24-hour option is 1600 pesos.
The cost of the option with additional hours is also 1600 pesos.

So, Cameron would not save any money. The answer is 0 pesos."
"First, let's find out how much hay each sheep needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. So, twice the amount each goat needs is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, each sheep needs 3 pounds less than this amount:
\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we know there are 15 goats and each needs 5 pounds of hay:
\[ 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

And there are 12 sheep and each needs 7 pounds of hay:
\[ 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the total amount of hay Nate needs, we add the hay for the goats and the sheep:
\[ 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 159 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much John earned in the week. He earns 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so:

\[ 50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to subtract the cost of gas from his earnings. He spends 50 dollars on gas, so:

\[ 300 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so we subtract that from his remaining money:

\[ 250 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

John also wants to buy 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each. The total cost for the pencils is:

\[ 5 \times 10 \text{ dollars} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the pencils from his remaining money gives:

\[ 150 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we need to find out how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with the remaining 100 dollars. We divide the remaining money by the cost of one pen:

\[ 100 \text{ dollars} \div 25 \text{ dollars/pen} = 4 \text{ pens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"Craig spelled out 20 words with 15 letters each. So the total number of letters Craig spelled out is:
20 words * 15 letters/word = 300 letters

Craig's brother spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. So the total number of letters Craig's brother spelled out is:
300 letters + 50 letters = 350 letters

The total number of letters they spelled out after the ten rounds is:
300 letters + 350 letters = 650 letters

The final numerical answer is 650."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many children are in one row. According to the question, there are 8 children in each row.

2. Next, we need to find out how many children are in one school. Since there are 7 rows for each school and each row has 8 children, we multiply 7 by 8:
   \[
   7 \times 8 = 56
   \]
   So, there are 56 children in one school.

3. Now, we need to find out how many children are in all 5 schools. Since each school has 56 children, we multiply 56 by 5:
   \[
   56 \times 5 = 280
   \]

So, the total number of children in the drill is 280."
"First, let's find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher can get from the coupons. The teacher has 9 coupons and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles from the coupons is:

9 coupons * 100 bottles/coupon = 900 bottles

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gives to the students. There are 29 pupils in the class and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles given to the students is:

29 students * 2 bottles/student = 58 bottles

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher has to find out how many bottles the teacher has for herself:

900 bottles (from coupons) - 58 bottles (given to students) = 842 bottles

So, the teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice for herself."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. The base charge for visiting the house is $40.
2. Patty charges $35 per hour for labor. Since the job took 2.25 hours, we need to calculate the labor cost. We'll round 2.25 hours to 2.5 hours because the charge is for part or full hour. So, 2.5 hours * $35/hour = $87.50.
3. The parts cost $60.

Now, we add all these costs together:
Base charge: $40
Labor cost: $87.50
Parts cost: $60

Total charge = $40 + $87.50 + $60 = $187.50

So, Patty charged $187.50."
"First, let's find out the total cost of the CDs before the discount. James gets 10 new CDs and each CD costs $15. So, the total cost is:
10 CDs * $15/CD = $150

Now, he gets them for 40% off. To find out how much he actually paid, we need to calculate 40% of $150 and subtract it from $150.
40% of $150 = 0.40 * $150 = $60

So, the amount he actually paid is:
$150 - $60 = $90

James decides he doesn't like 5 of them and sells them for $40. So, the money he got from selling the CDs is $40.

To find out how much money he was out, we subtract the money he got from selling the CDs from the amount he actually paid.
$90 - $40 = $50

So, the final numerical answer is:
$50"
"First, let's calculate the earnings from the yams:
Jen has 6 yams and each yam can be sold for $1.5.
So, the total earnings from yams = 6 yams * $1.5/yam = $9.

Next, let's calculate the earnings from the sweet potatoes:
Jen has 10 sweet potatoes and each sweet potato can be sold for $2.
So, the total earnings from sweet potatoes = 10 sweet potatoes * $2/sweet potato = $20.

Now, let's calculate the earnings from the carrots:
Jen has 4 carrots and each carrot can be sold for $1.25.
So, the total earnings from carrots = 4 carrots * $1.25/carrot = $5.

Finally, let's add up all the earnings:
Total earnings = Earnings from yams + Earnings from sweet potatoes + Earnings from carrots
Total earnings = $9 + $20 + $5 = $34.

So, Jen will earn $34 if she sells everything."
"First, let's break down the problem into smaller parts to understand how long James spends swimming and resting.

1. James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake. So, he swims 20 * 0.60 = 12 miles.
2. He swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour. So, the time he spends swimming the first 12 miles is 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours.
3. He rests for half as long as the swimming time. So, he rests for 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.
4. The remaining distance is 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles. He swims this distance at half the speed, which is 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour. So, the time he spends swimming the remaining 8 miles is 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up all the time he spent swimming and resting:
- Time spent swimming: 6 hours
- Time spent resting: 3 hours
- Time spent swimming the remaining distance: 8 hours

Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours

So, the final numerical answer is 17 hours."
"First, we need to find out what seven times the number of loaves Sam had is. Sam had 70 loaves, so:

7 times 70 = 490 loaves

490 - 40 = 450 loaves

So, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread."
"Jasmine starts with 15 stickers. She loses 7, so she has 15 - 7 = 8 stickers. Then she gets 5 more stickers, so she has 8 + 5 = 13 stickers. 

The final number of stickers Jasmine has is 13."
"First, let's calculate the commission for the New York Times:
- Each New York Times costs $5.
- Cayley gets a 10% commission on each New York Times.
- So, the commission per New York Times is $5 * 10% = $0.50.

Now, let's calculate the commission for the Wall Street Journal:
- Each Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- Cayley gets an 8% commission on each Wall Street Journal.
- So, the commission per Wall Street Journal is $15 * 8% = $1.20.

Next, we calculate the total commission for 6 copies of the New York Times:
- Total commission for New York Times = 6 * $0.50 = $3.

Then, we calculate the total commission for 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal:
- Total commission for Wall Street Journal = 10 * $1.20 = $12.

Finally, we add the two totals to get the overall commission:
- Total commission = $3 + $12 = $15.

So, the final numerical answer is $15."
"First, we need to find out how old Leo is by using the information given.

We know that Deanna is 26 years old and Deanna is five years older than Marcus. So, we can find out Marcus's age by subtracting 5 from Deanna's age:
\[ \text{Marcus's age} = 26 - 5 = 21 \]

Next, we know that Marcus is half of Leo's age. So, if Marcus is 21, then Leo's age is twice Marcus's age:
\[ \text{Leo's age} = 21 \times 2 = 42 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 42 \]"
"First, let's figure out how many points Bahati scored. We know that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo and 10 more points than Dinar. So, if we let the number of points Azibo scored be \( A \), then Bahati scored \( A + 20 \) points. And since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, Dinar scored \( A + 20 - 10 = A + 10 \) points.

The total points scored by all three is 45. So we can write the equation:
\[ A + (A + 20) + (A + 10) = 45 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ A + A + 20 + A + 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]

Now, we solve for \( A \):
\[ 3A = 45 - 30 \]
\[ 3A = 15 \]
\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points. Let's check the answer:
- Azibo scored 5 points.
- Bahati scored \( 5 + 20 = 25 \) points.
- Dinar scored \( 5 + 10 = 15 \) points.
- Total points: \( 5 + 25 + 15 = 45 \) points.

The calculations are correct. The final answer is:

"First, we need to find out how many hours Vince worked stapling reports. He started at 8:00 AM and worked until 11:00 PM. 

From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 13 hours.

Now, we know Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 13 hours, we need to convert 13 hours into minutes and then divide by 15.

13 hours = 13 * 60 = 780 minutes

Now, we divide 780 minutes by 15 minutes to find out how many 15-minute intervals there are in 780 minutes.

780 ÷ 15 = 52

So, Vince stapled 30 reports in each 15-minute interval. To find out the total number of reports he stapled, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports he staples in each interval.

52 * 30 = 1560

Therefore, Vince stapled 1560 reports altogether."
"Kim usually wakes up at 6 a.m. and she woke up 5 minutes earlier, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m.

She sleepwalked from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.

To find out how many minutes she slept on her bed, we need to calculate the time she was not sleepwalking.

From 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., she was sleepwalking for 23 minutes.

From 10:00 p.m. to 5:55 a.m., she was sleeping, which is 9 hours and 55 minutes.

To convert 9 hours and 55 minutes into minutes, we do:
9 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 540 minutes
540 minutes + 55 minutes = 595 minutes

Since she was sleepwalking for 23 minutes out of the 595 minutes she was sleeping, the time she slept on her bed is:
595 minutes - 23 minutes = 572 minutes

So, the final numerical answer is 572 minutes."
"First, let's find out how many measuring spoons Jonathan has. If he has two dozen measuring cups, that means he has 2 * 12 = 24 measuring cups.

Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, he has 2/3 * 24 = 16 measuring spoons.

If he gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, he will have 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons left.

Now, let's add the number of measuring cups and the number of measuring spoons he has left to find the total number of utensils:

24 measuring cups + 10 measuring spoons = 34 utensils.

So, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is 34."
"First, let's find out how many beds are occupied and how many are unoccupied in the hospital.

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds. If 1/5 of the beds are occupied, then:
\[ \text{Occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \text{ beds} \]

So, the number of unoccupied beds is:
\[ \text{Unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 200 = 800 \text{ beds} \]

Now, 50 patients are admitted each day. After 2 weeks (14 days), the number of patients admitted would be:
\[ \text{Patients admitted in 2 weeks} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \text{ patients} \]

Adding these 700 patients to the initially occupied beds:
\[ \text{New total occupied beds} = 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ beds} \]

Therefore, the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks would be:
\[ \text{Unoccupied beds after 2 weeks} = 1000 - 900 = 100 \text{ beds} \]

So, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100."
"First, let's find out how many emails are not work emails. Since Robyn sends sixteen emails a day and seven of them are work emails, we subtract the work emails from the total:

16 - 7 = 9 emails are not work emails.

Out of these 9 emails, two-thirds are to family. To find out how many that is, we calculate:

9 * (2/3) = 6 emails are to family.

Now, we subtract the emails to family from the non-work emails to find out how many emails are left:

9 - 6 = 3 emails are not to family or to family.

One-third of these remaining emails are to her boyfriend. So, we calculate:

3 * (1/3) = 1 email is to her boyfriend.

So, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend."
"First, we need to find out how old Shawna is. We know that Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya. So, we calculate Shawna's age as follows:

\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \]

Now, we know that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. So, we calculate Shawna's father's age as follows:

\[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 45."
"If the audience was reported to be 48 and Courtney made a mistake by overstating the number by 20%, we need to find the actual number of people who attended the concert.

First, let's understand what it means to be overstated by 20%. This means that the reported number (48) is 120% of the actual number of people. We can set up the equation to find the actual number of people:

\[ 120\% \times \text{Actual number} = 48 \]

To find the actual number, we can convert 120% to a decimal, which is 1.20, and then solve for the actual number:

\[ 1.20 \times \text{Actual number} = 48 \]

\[ \text{Actual number} = \frac{48}{1.20} \]

Now, let's calculate the actual number of people who attended the concert:

\[ \text{Actual number} = \frac{48}{1.20} = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"First, let's figure out how many balls each boy carried based on the information given.

Jason carried 2 balls.

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, Jordan carried:
2 balls (Jason) * 2 = 4 balls.

And since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jeffrey carried:
2 balls (Jason) / 2 = 1 ball.

Now, let's add up all the balls they carried:
Jason's balls + Jordan's balls + Jeffrey's balls = 2 + 4 + 1 = 7 balls.

So, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 7."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. On the first day, they dug 10 holes.
2. On the second day, they dug 13 holes.
3. On the third day, they dug 8 holes but also filled in 2 holes, so the net change on the third day is 8 - 2 = 6 holes.

So, by the end of the third day, the total number of holes dug is:
10 (first day) + 13 (second day) + 6 (third day) = 29 holes.

The problem states that by the end of the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, four times that number is:
4 * 10 = 40 holes.

By the end of the third day, there were 29 holes. So, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
40 (total by end of fourth day) - 29 (total by end of third day) = 11 holes.

Therefore, the pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure."
"First, let's figure out how many corn chips Collins got. Since Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips and Collins got 15 more than they did, Collins got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

Now, let's add up all the corn chips:
Amora's chips + Lainey's chips + Collins's chips = Total chips
70 + 70 + 85 = 225

So, the total number of corn chips was 225."
"First, we need to find out how much the travel tickets cost. The problem states that the travel tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. Jen paid $400 for the supplies.

To find 50% of $400, we calculate:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 400 = \frac{50}{100} \times 400 = 0.5 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the travel tickets cost $200 more than the supplies. Therefore, the total cost for the travel tickets is:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

The travel cost is $600."
"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Let's say Adelwolfe has caught x Pokemon.
2. Stan has caught 4x - 13 Pokemon.
3. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so Alex has caught (4x - 13) + 5 = 4x - 8 Pokemon.

Now, we know the total number of Pokemon they have caught together is 339. So we can write the equation:

x + (4x - 13) + (4x - 8) = 339

Let's solve this equation:

1. Combine like terms: x + 4x - 13 + 4x - 8 = 339
2. Simplify: 9x - 21 = 339
3. Add 21 to both sides: 9x = 360
4. Divide by 9: x = 40

Now we know Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokemon. To find out how many Stan has caught:

Stan has caught 4x - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon."
"First, we need to find out how many episodes there are. We know that each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. So, we can calculate the number of episodes by dividing the minutes per episode by 2.

Number of episodes = Minutes per episode / 2
Number of episodes = 20 / 2
Number of episodes = 10

Now, to find out how many minutes John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the minutes per episode.

Total minutes = Number of episodes * Minutes per episode
Total minutes = 10 * 20
Total minutes = 200

So, the final numerical answer is 200."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance the bird flies in each part of her journey and then sum these distances to find the total distance between her northern and southern homes.

1. The bird flies 10 hours in a southerly direction at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 10 hours = 300 miles

2. The bird then flies 2 hours towards the north at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 18 miles/hour × 2 hours = 36 miles

3. Finally, the bird flies 5 hours toward the south at a speed of 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 22 miles/hour × 5 hours = 110 miles

Now, we add up all the distances to find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes.
- Total distance = 300 miles + 36 miles + 110 miles = 446 miles

The distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 446 miles."
"First, let's find out how many brownies Greta made and how many she received.

She made a batch for herself: 1 dozen = 12 brownies.
She got 1/2 a dozen from her office party: 1/2 dozen = 6 brownies.
Her friends gave her 4 dozen: 4 dozen = 4 * 12 = 48 brownies.
During the party, 1 1/2 dozen were eaten: 1 1/2 dozen = 1.5 dozen = 1.5 * 12 = 18 brownies.

Now, let's add up all the brownies she had:
12 (from herself) + 6 (from office) + 48 (from friends) - 18 (eaten during the party) = 48 brownies.

So, the final number of brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is 48."
"First, let's find out how old Nani's brother is. Since his brother is twice Nani's age, we multiply Nani's age by 2:
\[ 8 \times 2 = 16 \]
So, Nani's brother is 16 years old.

Next, let's find out how old Nani's sister is. Since Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani, we need to find 25% of Nani's age and subtract it from Nani's age:
\[ 8 \times 0.25 = 2 \]
So, Nani's sister is 2 years younger than Nani, which means:
\[ 8 - 2 = 6 \]
Therefore, Nani's sister is 6 years old.

Now, let's add up the ages of all three family members:
\[ 8 + 16 + 6 = 20 \]
So, the total age of all three family members is 20."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes to string each type of racquet:

- Synthetic gut: 3 racquets * 15 minutes each = 45 minutes
- Polyester string: 5 racquets * 22 minutes each = 110 minutes
- Hybrid sets: 4 racquets * 18 minutes each = 72 minutes

Now, let's add up all the time:

45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes

So, it will take Andy 227 minutes to string all of those racquets."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. John buys 1 phone at full price.
2. He buys 2 phones at half price.

First, let's calculate the cost of the full price phone:
- Full price of one phone = $600

Next, let's calculate the cost of the half price phones:
- Half price of one phone = $600 / 2 = $300
- Cost for 2 half price phones = $300 * 2 = $600

Now, let's add the cost of the full price phone and the half price phones:
- Total cost = Cost of full price phone + Cost of half price phones
- Total cost = $600 + $600 = $1200

So, the total amount John paid for the phones is $1200."
"Carlton's team has 13 players.
Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, so Zeke's team has 13 + 7 = 20 players.
To find the total number of players in both teams, we add the number of players in Carlton's team to the number of players in Zeke's team: 13 + 20 = 33 players.
The final numerical answer is 33."
"First, we need to find out how many feet of fencing Robert needs to build. Since his fence is rectangular and 15 feet long and 10 feet wide, we can find the total length of the fence by adding the lengths of all four sides. 

So, the total length of the fence is:
\[ 15 \text{ feet} + 15 \text{ feet} + 10 \text{ feet} + 10 \text{ feet} = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know that Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing. So, to find out how many wood slats he needs, we multiply the total length of the fence by 2:
\[ 50 \text{ feet} \times 2 = 100 \text{ wood slats} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 100 \]"
"Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges.
She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, so she gave away 2 + 2 = 4 boxes.
She kept 1/4 of the oranges, so she gave away 1 - 1/4 = 3/4 of the oranges.
The total number of boxes she gave away is 4, and the total number of boxes she had initially is 12.
So, the number of boxes she gave away is 3/4 of 12, which is (3/4) * 12 = 9 boxes.
Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she gave away is 9 * 20 = 180 oranges.
Therefore, Mrs. Harrington sold 180 oranges."
"First, we need to find out how many states are in the USA. Let's assume the USA has 50 states.

India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. So, half of the USA's states is 50 / 2 = 25. India has 4 more than this, so India has 25 + 4 = 29 states.

Now, to find the total number of states in both countries, we add the number of states in the USA and India together: 50 + 29 = 79.

The final numerical answer is 79."
"First, let's add up the cost of the books Tyler wants to buy:
- Dictionary: $18
- Dinosaur book: $13
- Children's cookbook: $8

$18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Now, let's see how much more money Tyler needs to buy the books:
- Money Tyler has saved: $14
- Total cost of the books: $39

$39 - $14 = $25

Tyler needs $25 more to buy the books. Since he earns $5 per hour, we need to find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $25:
- Amount needed: $25
- Earnings per hour: $5

$25 ÷ $5 = 5

Tyler needs to work 5 hours to earn the extra money he needs."
"First, let's find out how many cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 30 cherries and 10 more than Richard, we can subtract 10 from 30 to find out how many cherries Richard has.

30 cherries (Robert) - 10 cherries = 20 cherries (Richard)

Now we know Richard has 20 cherries and Robert has 30 cherries. To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we need to subtract the number of cherries Richard and Robert have from the total number of cherries.

60 cherries (total) - 20 cherries (Richard) - 30 cherries (Robert) = 10 cherries (Jerry)

Now we know Jerry has 10 cherries. To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has.

30 cherries (Robert) - 10 cherries (Jerry) = 20 cherries

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry."
"First, let's find out how many boxes of each type of baked good Sunny sold on each day.

On Saturday:
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes
- Apple pie: 10 - 4 = 6 boxes

On Sunday:
- Gingerbread: 10 + 5 = 15 boxes
- Apple pie: 15 boxes

Now, let's calculate the total number of boxes sold for two days:
- Total gingerbread: 10 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 25 boxes
- Total apple pie: 6 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 21 boxes

Next, let's calculate the total earnings:
- Earnings from gingerbread: 25 boxes * $6/box = $150
- Earnings from apple pie: 21 boxes * $15/box = $315

Total earnings for two days:
$150 (gingerbread) + $315 (apple pie) = $465

So, Sunny earned $465 for two days."
"First, we need to find out how much sunscreen Pamela will use in total.

She uses 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour she's outside. She will be outside 4 hours a day for 8 days.

So, the total hours she will be outside is:
4 hours/day * 8 days = 32 hours

Since she uses 1 ounce of sunscreen per hour, she will use:
32 ounces of sunscreen

Now, we know her sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles. To find out how many bottles she needs, we divide the total ounces she will use by the ounces each bottle contains:

32 ounces / 8 ounces/bottle = 4 bottles

So, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen."
"First, we need to find out how much cheaper the red car is compared to the blue car. The red car is 40% cheaper, so we calculate 40% of $100.

40% of $100 = 0.40 * $100 = $40

So, the red car costs $40 less than the blue car. Now we subtract $40 from the price of the blue car to find out how much the red car costs.

Price of the red car = Price of the blue car - $40
Price of the red car = $100 - $40 = $60

Now we add the prices of both cars to find out how much both cars cost in total.

Total cost = Price of the blue car + Price of the red car
Total cost = $100 + $60 = $160

The final numerical answer is $160."
"First, let's figure out how old Emil's dad and brother will be when Emil is 24 years old.

Emil is 19 years old now, so when he turns 24, he will be 24 - 19 = 5 years older.

If Emil is 24 years old, his dad will be twice as old as Emil, so his dad will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old.

Also, Emil's dad will be half the age of Emil at that time, so Emil's dad will be 24 / 2 = 12 years younger than Emil, which confirms his age will be 48.

Now, Emil's age will be 24, and he is 5 years younger than his dad, so his dad is 24 + 5 = 29 years old now.

Emil's brother will be half the age of Emil when Emil is 24, so his brother will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old when Emil is 24.

Since Emil is 19 years old now, his brother is 19 - 5 = 14 years old now.

Now, let's find the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now.

Emil's dad is 29 years old, and his brother is 14 years old, so the sum of their ages is 29 + 14 = 43.

The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is 43."
"First, let's find out how many beads Adrianne's sister gave her. Her sister gave her ten more beads than her mother, so that's 20 + 10 = 30 beads.

Next, let's find out how many beads Adrianne's friend gave her. Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, so that's 20 * 2 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add up all the beads Adrianne has. She has 20 beads from her mother, 30 beads from her sister, and 40 beads from her friend. So, 20 + 30 + 40 = 90 beads.

The final numerical answer is 90."
"Joe caught 3 * 4 = 12 pounds of crawfish on Friday.
On Saturday, he caught 12 / 2 = 6 pounds of crawfish.
So, in total, he caught 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds of crawfish.
If 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, then he has 21 / 3 = 7 servings.

The final numerical answer is 7."
"First, let's find out how many students are football players. If 20% of the class are football players, then:

20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students

So, 6 students are football players. This means the remaining students are:

30 students - 6 football players = 24 students

Out of these 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. So:

25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students

These 6 students are either cheerleaders or part of the band. So, the total number of students leaving early is:

6 football players + 6 cheerleaders/band members = 12 students

The final numerical answer is 12."
"First, we need to find out the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size five boots, Charlie wears size 5 * 5 = 25 boots.

Now, to find the average size of the two, we add the sizes together and divide by 2. So, the average size is (5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15.

The final numerical answer is 15."
"First, let's convert everything to the same unit. Since the flower bed is measured in feet and the growth of the flowers is in inches, we'll convert everything to feet.

12 inches = 1 foot

So, Pat's flowers grow 1 foot wide.

Pat wants to leave 1.5 feet between every plant. This means that for every 1.5 feet of space, there is 1 plant.

Now, let's find out how many plants Pat can fit in her 111 feet flower bed.

111 feet / 1.5 feet per plant = 74 plants

Pat already has 17 flowers, so she needs to buy:

74 plants - 17 plants = 57 plants

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost will be:

57 plants * $6 per plant = $342

So, Pat will spend $342 at the store to fill up her flower bed."
"First, we need to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day. Since Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, we calculate:

\[ \text{Edgar's brother's pretzels per day} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

Next, to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we multiply the number of pretzels he eats in a day by the number of days in a week:

\[ \text{Edgar's brother's pretzels in a week} = 9 \times 7 = 63 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 63."
"First, let's calculate the cost for one basket:

- Cost of petunias in one basket: 3 petunias * $3.00/petunia = $9.00
- Cost of sweet potato vines in one basket: 2 vines * $2.50/vine = $5.00

So, the total cost for one basket is $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for 5 baskets:

- Total cost for 5 baskets: 5 baskets * $14.00/basket = $70.00

So, Katherine will spend $70.00 filling all 5 hanging baskets."
"First, let's calculate how much soil the sunflowers and carnations will use.

Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil. If they plant 4 sunflowers, they will use:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil. If they plant 10 carnations, they will use:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add the soil used by the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

They have a 30-pound bag of soil. So, the remaining soil for roses is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. So, the number of roses they can plant with the remaining 3 pounds of soil is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

The final numerical answer is:
3"
"First, let's find out how much money Jessica sets aside each month for fancy shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 paycheck.

25% of $2,000.00 is calculated as:
\[ 25\% \times 2000 = 0.25 \times 2000 = 500 \]

So, Jessica sets aside $500.00 each month for fancy shoes.

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. To find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy with her monthly savings, we divide her monthly savings by the cost of one pair of shoes:
\[ \frac{500}{1000} = 0.5 \]

This means Jessica can buy 0.5 pairs of shoes each month. Since she can't buy half a pair, we consider she can buy 0 pairs of shoes each month.

Now, to find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year, we multiply the number of pairs she can buy each month by 12 (months in a year):
\[ 0 \times 12 = 0 \]

So, Jessica can buy 0 pairs of shoes in a year."
"First, let's find out how long it takes Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, we divide the total number of shrimp by the number of shrimp she can peel in a minute:

90 shrimp ÷ 6 shrimp/minute = 15 minutes

Next, let's find out how long it takes her to saute 90 shrimp. Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we divide the total number of shrimp by the number of shrimp she can saute in a minute and then multiply by the time it takes to saute that number:

90 shrimp ÷ 30 shrimp/10 minutes = 3 * 10 minutes = 30 minutes

Now, we add the time it takes to peel the shrimp and the time it takes to saute the shrimp:

15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (sauteing) = 45 minutes

So, it will take her 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp."
"First, let's calculate how much the temperature changed while the air conditioner was on low. The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low. It ran on low for 3 hours.

\[ 2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the room temperature dropped by 6 degrees while the air conditioner was on low.

Next, let's calculate how much the temperature changed while the air conditioner was on high. The air conditioner cools the room 3 degrees an hour on high. It was on high for 4 hours.

\[ 3 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the room temperature dropped by 12 degrees while the air conditioner was on high.

Now, let's calculate how much the temperature changed while the air conditioner was off. The room warms up at 2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running. It was off for 2 hours.

\[ 2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the room temperature increased by 4 degrees while the air conditioner was off.

Now, let's add up all the changes in temperature:

\[ 6 \text{ degrees} - 12 \text{ degrees} + 4 \text{ degrees} = -2 \text{ degrees} \]

The final temperature is 2 degrees lower than the starting temperature. So, the final numerical answer is:

2"
"First, let's find out how old Bill's father was when he saw the comet. We know Bill's father saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

Bill saw the comet when he was three times the age his father was when he saw it. So, we calculate Bill's age as follows:
\[ 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

This means Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time. Now, we need to find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time. Since the comet appears every 75 years, we can calculate Bill's age when he saw it for the first time by subtracting 75 years from 90 years:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

So, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time."
"Buford writes 1 check for the electric bill every month.
He writes 1 check for the gas bill every month.
He writes 2 checks to the church twice a month, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 checks per month.
He writes 1 check to the pest and lawn service quarterly, which is 4 times a year.

Now let's add them all up:
1 (electric) + 1 (gas) + 4 (church) + 1 (pest and lawn) = 7 checks per year.

So, the final numerical answer is 7."
"First, let's find out how many flights the first plane makes in a day. We know that the second plane makes 44 trips, and this is half the number of trips the first plane makes. So, the first plane makes twice as many trips as the second plane.

Number of flights for the first plane = 44 trips * 2 = 88 trips

Now, we know that the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. So, we calculate the number of flights to Greece:

Flights to Greece = 88 trips * 3/4 = 66 trips

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. Since the total number of flights is 88, and 66 of those are to Greece, the remaining flights are:

Remaining flights = 88 trips - 66 trips = 22 trips

Since the remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany:

Flights to France = Flights to Germany = 22 trips / 2 = 11 trips

So, the first plane takes 11 flights to France in one day."
"First, let's find out how long each wolf howls.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so:
Chikote = 2 * 20 seconds = 40 seconds.

Igneous howls for as long as Tobias and Chikote combined, so:
Igneous = Tobias + Chikote = 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add up the total time for all three wolves:
Total time = Tobias + Chikote + Igneous = 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.

To convert seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since 1 minute = 60 seconds):
120 seconds ÷ 60 = 2 minutes.

So, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes."
"Adam's mother gave him $6.
His father gave him twice as much as his mother, so his father gave him 2 * $6 = $12.
Adam's mother and father together gave him $6 + $12 = $18.

"First, let's find the average age of the group. The total age of the children is 20, and there are 4 children, so the average age is:

\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Total age of the children}}{\text{Number of children}} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Helene is twice as old as the average age, so Helene's age is:

\[ \text{Helene's age} = 2 \times \text{Average age} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, we know the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene. Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old. Let's add their ages together:

\[ \text{Akbar's age} + \text{Alessandro's age} + \text{Helene's age} = 3 + 4 + 10 = 17 \]

The total age of all four children is 20, so Wilfred's age can be found by subtracting the sum of the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene from the total age:

\[ \text{Wilfred's age} = \text{Total age} - (\text{Akbar's age} + \text{Alessandro's age} + \text{Helene's age}) = 20 - 17 = 3 \]

So, Wilfred is 3 years old."
"First, let's add up the money Walter has collected from his neighbors and the online fund:
$500 (from neighbors) + $1500 (from online) = $2000

Now, Walter's friend is going to give him $200, so we add that to the total:
$2000 + $200 = $2200

The lawyer is going to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. So, we need to find out how much everyone else donates first, which is $2200. Then we multiply that by 3 to find out how much the lawyer will donate:
$2200 * 3 = $6600

So, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6600."
"First, we need to find out how many cookies were given to the church next door. Since each of the 100 guests brought a plate of 15 cookies, the total number of cookies is:

100 guests * 15 cookies/guest = 1500 cookies

The bride gave half of these cookies to the church next door:

1500 cookies / 2 = 750 cookies

If each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, we can find out how many people were in the church next door by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got:

750 cookies / 15 cookies/person = 50 people

So, the number of people in the church next door is 50."
"To solve this, let's assume each kid gets a slice of 1 unit of the watermelon. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big, each adult gets 2 units of the watermelon.

So, the total watermelon is divided into 6 units (2 for each adult and 4 for the kids).

Each adult gets 2 units out of the total 6 units. To find the percentage, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Whole}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2}{6} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \times 100 \approx 33.33\% \]

So, each adult gets approximately 33.33% of the watermelon."
"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on inpatients and appointments.

He spends 20 minutes per inpatient and has 9 inpatients, so:
20 minutes * 9 = 180 minutes

He has 10 appointments, each taking 30 minutes, so:
30 minutes * 10 = 300 minutes

Now, let's add the time spent on inpatients and appointments:
180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 480 minutes to hours:
480 minutes ÷ 60 = 8 hours

Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic in total. So, the time left for updating his records is:
9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

The final numerical answer is 1 hour."
"First, let's add up all the time Jordan needs to make the cake:

- Making the cake batter: 20 minutes
- Baking the cake: 30 minutes
- Cooling the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
- Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

Now, let's add these times together:

20 minutes + 30 minutes + 120 minutes + 10 minutes = 180 minutes

180 minutes is the same as 3 hours.

Jordan wants the cake to be ready by 5:00 pm. To find out the latest time she can start making the cake, we need to subtract the total time (3 hours) from 5:00 pm.

5:00 pm minus 3 hours is 2:00 pm.

So, the latest time of day that Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

The final numerical answer is 2:00 pm."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we first need to add up the total number of boxes they sold together.

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. So together they sold:
3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes

They sold a total of 64 chocolate bars. To find out how many are in a box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes:
64 ÷ 8 = 8

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost to rent the studio per session**: $25
2. **Cost per student per session**: $1.50
3. **Number of students**: 10
4. **Number of days the studio is rented per week**: 3
5. **Number of weeks in a month**: We'll assume 4 weeks for simplicity.

First, calculate the cost per session for 10 students:
\[ 10 \text{ students} \times \$1.50 \text{ per student} = \$15 \text{ per session} \]

Now, add the rental cost to the cost for the students to find the total cost per session:
\[ \$25 \text{ (rental cost)} + \$15 \text{ (student cost)} = \$40 \text{ per session} \]

Next, calculate the total cost for the studio to be rented 3 days a week:
\[ \$40 \text{ per session} \times 3 \text{ days} = \$120 \text{ per week} \]

Finally, calculate the total earnings for the month:
\[ \$120 \text{ per week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = \$480 \text{ per month} \]

So, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are:
\[ \$480 \]"
"First, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's boxes. Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars. To find out how many are in each box, we divide the total by the number of boxes:

\[ \text{Chocolate bars per box for Peter} = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]

Next, we find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Martha's boxes. Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars. To find out how many are in each box, we divide the total by the number of boxes:

\[ \text{Chocolate bars per box for Martha} = \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha. We subtract the number of chocolate bars per box for Martha from the number of chocolate bars per box for Peter:

\[ \text{Difference} = 16 - 8 = 8 \]

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha."
"First, we need to find out how many female porcupines there are. We know that the number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. So, the number of babies born each month is:

\[ \text{Number of babies born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120 \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[ \text{Total number of babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440 \]

The total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be the original number of porcupines plus the number of babies born in a year:

\[ \text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1490 \]"
"First, we need to find the volume of the pool. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (which is what the pool is) is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the measurements:
- Width = 14 feet
- Length = 25 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

So, the volume of the pool is:
\[ \text{Volume} = 14 \times 25 \times 4 \]

Let's calculate the volume:
\[ \text{Volume} = 14 \times 25 \times 4 = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how many gallons of water are needed. The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9:

\[ \text{Gallons needed} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]

Let's calculate the gallons needed:
\[ \text{Gallons needed} = 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to find the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:

\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]

Let's calculate the cost:
\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 = 826 \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is:
\[ \text{Cost} = 826 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 826 \]"
"First, let's find out how many blue sticks there are. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red, and there are 9 red sticks, we add 5 to 9 to find the number of blue sticks:

9 (red sticks) + 5 = 14 (blue sticks)

Next, we find out how many yellow sticks there are. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. Since there are 14 blue sticks, we subtract 3 from 14 to find the number of yellow sticks:

14 (blue sticks) - 3 = 11 (yellow sticks)

Now, to find the total number of sticks, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together:

9 (red sticks) + 14 (blue sticks) + 11 (yellow sticks) = 34 sticks

So, the total number of sticks they have is 34."
"First, we need to calculate how far Matteo traveled. Matteo traveled at 55 miles per hour for 4 hours. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 55 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate how far Shandy traveled. Shandy traveled at 45 miles per hour for 10 hours. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} = 45 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the distance Matteo traveled from the distance Shandy traveled:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."
"First, let's find out how many students are over 16 years old. Since half of the students are over 16 years old, we divide the total number of students by 2:

3000 / 2 = 1500 students are over 16 years old.

Now, let's find out how many of these students over 16 are male. One-fourth of the students over 16 are male:

1500 / 4 = 375 students are male and over 16 years old.

So, the number of female students over 16 years old is:

1500 - 375 = 1125 female students over 16 years old.

Next, let's find out how many students are under 16 years old. Since the remaining half of the students are under 16 years old:

3000 / 2 = 1500 students are under 16 years old.

Now, let's find out how many of these students under 16 are male. One-half of the students under 16 are male:

1500 / 2 = 750 students are male and under 16 years old.

So, the number of female students under 16 years old is:

1500 - 750 = 750 female students under 16 years old.

Finally, to find the total number of female students enrolled at the school, we add the number of female students over 16 years old to the number of female students under 16 years old:

1125 + 750 = 1875 female students.

The final numerical answer is 1875."
"First, let's find out how many laps each person can run:

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

Now, to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn:

Bethany can run 10 laps, and Quinn can run 5 laps.
So, Bethany can run 10 - 5 = 5 more laps than Quinn."
"First, let's break down the information given and calculate the amount of water pumped each day.

On the first day:
- Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity.
- Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda.

The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons.

So, Wanda filled:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons} \]

Ms. B pumped:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons} \]

Total water filled on the first day:
\[ 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons} \]

On the second day:
- Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day.
- Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day.

Wanda pumped on the second day:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Ms. B pumped on the second day:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons} \]

Total water filled on the second day:
\[ 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \text{ gallons} \]

Total water filled in two days:
\[ 7875 + 4125 = 12000 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, to find out how many gallons are remaining to fill the tank:
\[ 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the number of gallons remaining for the tank to be full is 6000 gallons."
"Let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we need to understand how much charge was lost each hour. Initially, the power bank lost 9% of its charge each hour. After 5 hours, it started losing 7% each hour for 3 more hours.

2. If the power bank lost 9% each hour for 5 hours, it would have lost 9% * 5 = 45% of its charge. So, 100% - 45% = 55% of the charge was left after 5 hours.

3. For the next 3 hours, the power bank lost 7% of its charge each hour. So, it lost 7% * 3 = 21% of its charge in these 3 hours. This means 55% - 21% = 34% of the charge was left after 8 hours.

4. We know that after 8 hours, the power bank had 28% of its charge left.

5. To find out the original charge, we can set up the equation: 28% = 34% * (1 - x), where x is the percentage of charge lost in the last 2 hours. But since we know the final charge and the charge after 8 hours, we can directly calculate the original charge.

6. If 28% is 34% of the original charge, we can find the original charge by dividing 28% by 34% and then multiplying by 100% to get the original charge.

7. So, the original charge = 28% / 34% * 100% = 82.35%.

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 82.35%."
"First, let's find out how much Janet makes in a week. She makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips. So, her total weekly earnings are:

$10/hour * 40 hours + $15/hour * 40 hours = $400 + $600 = $1000

Now, Janet wants to save 20% of $10000 for the car. So, we calculate 20% of $10000:

20% of $10000 = 0.20 * $10000 = $2000

Now, to find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000, we divide the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:

$2000 / $1000 = 2 weeks

So, Janet will need to work 2 weeks to save the down payment for the car."
"First, let's calculate how much Jamaar has spent on the fruits he already bought.

- Peaches: 3 peaches at $0.5 each = 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- Pears: 4 pears at $0.5 each = 4 * $0.5 = $2.0
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis at $1.0 each = 2 * $1.0 = $2.0
- Apples: 5 apples at $0.75 each = 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Now, let's add up the total amount spent on these fruits:
$1.5 (peaches) + $2.0 (pears) + $2.0 (kiwis) + $3.75 (apples) = $9.25

Jamaar has $10 to spend. So, the amount left for plums is:
$10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Plums cost $0.25 each. To find out how many plums he can buy with $0.75, we divide:
$0.75 ÷ $0.25 = 3

So, Jamaar can buy 3 plums."
"First, we need to find out how many packs of sweets Anne gave to her friends. She originally had 15 packs and kept 2 packs, so:

15 packs - 2 packs = 13 packs

These 13 packs were given to her 10 friends equally. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we need to calculate how many pieces are in 13 packs and then divide that by 10.

Each pack has 60 pieces, so 13 packs have:

13 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 780 pieces

Now, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of friends:

780 pieces / 10 friends = 78 pieces per friend

So, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the price increase year by year. The price increases by 5% each year, so we multiply the current price by 1.05 to get the new price.

Starting price: $120

After the first year:
\[ 120 \times 1.05 = 126 \]

After the second year:
\[ 126 \times 1.05 = 132.3 \]

After the third year:
\[ 132.3 \times 1.05 = 138.165 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years would be $138."
"To solve this, let's first figure out how many pictures went into each album. Olivia has 72 pictures and she put them into 8 albums, so we divide 72 by 8.

72 ÷ 8 = 9

So, each album has 9 pictures.

Now, we know that 3 of the albums are selfies only and 2 of the albums are portraits. That means 3 + 2 = 5 albums are either selfies or portraits.

Since each of these 5 albums has 9 pictures, we can find out the total number of selfies and portraits by multiplying 9 by 5.

9 × 5 = 45

So, Olivia has 45 selfies and 45 portraits."
"James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes.
So, to read 18 pages, he would spend:
\[ \frac{18 \text{ pages}}{3 \text{ pages/10 minutes}} = 6 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final answer is:
60 minutes"
"First, let's calculate the number of guests who checked out. 24 guests checked out early and 15 guests checked out late, so the total number of guests who checked out is 24 + 15 = 39 guests.

The hotel started with 100 guests. After 39 guests checked out, the number of guests remaining is 100 - 39 = 61 guests.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, twice that number is 15 * 2 = 30 guests checked in.

After the guests checked in in the afternoon, the number of guests became 61 + 30 = 91 guests.

Then, 7 more people checked in after dinner was served, so the total number of guests now is 91 + 7 = 98 guests.

The final number of guests in the hotel is 98."
"John picks 4 bananas on Wednesday.
On Thursday, he picks 6 bananas.
On Friday, he picks triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 bananas.

To find out how many bananas John has in total, we add the bananas from each day:
4 (Wednesday) + 6 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) = 22 bananas.

So, the final numerical answer is 22."
"First, let's find out how many easy questions there are in the quiz. Since 40% of the questions are easy, we calculate:

\( 60 \times 0.40 = 24 \) easy questions.

Next, we find out how many questions are average and difficult. Since the rest are equally divided between average and difficult questions, we subtract the easy questions from the total and then divide by 2:

\( 60 - 24 = 36 \) questions left.
\( 36 \div 2 = 18 \) average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct. So, we calculate how many easy questions she is sure to get:

\( 24 \times 0.75 = 18 \) easy questions correct.

She is sure to get half of the average and difficult questions correct. So, we calculate how many of these she is sure to get:

\( 18 \times 0.50 = 9 \) average and difficult questions correct.

Now, we add the number of questions she is sure to get correct:

\( 18 + 9 = 27 \)

So, the final numerical answer is 27."
"First, let's find out how much Teresa sold each small stuffed animal for. We know that each small stuffed animal costs $4.

Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, let's say she sold \( x \) large stuffed animals. Then she sold \( 2x \) small stuffed animals.

The price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal. So, the price of a large stuffed animal is \( 3 \times 4 = $12 \).

Today, Teresa earned $120 from the sales. The total earnings can be calculated by adding the earnings from both small and large stuffed animals. The earnings from small stuffed animals are \( 4 \times 2x = 8x \) and the earnings from large stuffed animals are \( 12 \times x = 12x \).

So, the total earnings are \( 8x + 12x = 20x \).

We know that the total earnings are $120, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 20x = 120 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 20:
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

So, Teresa sold \( 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \) small stuffed animals.

The final numerical answer is:
12"
"To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we first need to calculate how many sandwiches they eat in one day and then multiply that by 7 (the number of days in a week).

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, the wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and the son eats 2 sandwiches per day. So, in one day, the family eats:

5 (man) + 4 (wife) + 2 (son) = 11 sandwiches per day.

In one week, which is 7 days, they would eat:

11 sandwiches/day * 7 days/week = 77 sandwiches/week.

So, the final numerical answer is 77."
"First, let's calculate how much money Suzanne made from selling cookies and cupcakes.

She sold 80 cookies at $1 each, so she made:
80 cookies * $1/cookie = $80

She sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each, so she made:
60 cupcakes * $4/cupcake = $240

Now, let's add the money she made from cookies and cupcakes:
$80 + $240 = $320

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave away:
$10/sister * 2 sisters = $20

Now, let's subtract the money she gave away from her total earnings:
$320 - $20 = $300

So, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings."
"The Smith twins found 30 eggs each, so together they found 30 + 30 = 60 eggs. If there were 100 eggs hidden and 10 were not found, then 100 - 10 = 90 eggs were found. Since the Smith twins found 60 eggs, the friends found 90 - 60 = 30 eggs."
"First, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. If one dwarf can mine 12 pounds with his bare hands, and with a steel pickaxe he can mine 50% more, then:

50% of 12 pounds = 0.50 * 12 = 6 pounds

So, with a steel pickaxe, one dwarf can mine:

12 pounds + 6 pounds = 18 pounds

Now, if one dwarf can mine 18 pounds with a steel pickaxe in a day, then 40 dwarves can mine:

18 pounds * 40 dwarves = 720 pounds

In a month with 30 days, 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine:

720 pounds/day * 30 days = 21600 pounds

So, the final numerical answer is 21600 pounds."
"To solve this, let's first understand the prices of the packages we know:

- The first package with 2 sandwiches costs $3.
- The second package with 4 sandwiches costs $6.

We can see that the second package is twice the size of the first package and costs twice as much. This suggests that the price is proportional to the number of sandwiches.

Now, let's look at the third package with 8 sandwiches. Since the price is proportional to the number of sandwiches, we can assume that the third package will cost twice as much as the second package because it has twice the number of sandwiches of the second package.

So, if the second package with 4 sandwiches costs $6, the third package with 8 sandwiches will cost $6 * 2 = $12.

The final numerical answer is $12."
"First, let's see how much Tom has left to pay after selling his old bedroom and using the money to buy part of the new set.

Tom sold his old bedroom for $1000 and used that money to buy part of the new set. The new set costs $3000, so after using $1000, he has to pay $3000 - $1000 = $2000.

Now, Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining $2000 each month. To find out how much he has to pay per month, we calculate 10% of $2000.

10% of $2000 is $2000 * 0.10 = $200.

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month."
"First, let's calculate how many red balloons burst. Sally had 25 red balloons and 40% of them burst. So, we calculate 40% of 25:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } 25 = \frac{40}{100} \times 25 = 0.4 \times 25 = 10 \]

So, 10 red balloons burst. This means Sally was left with:

\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \text{ red balloons} \]

Next, Sally accidentally released half of the yellow balloons. She had 12 yellow balloons, so half of them would be:

\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]

This means she was left with:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \text{ yellow balloons} \]

Now, Sally found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her remaining balloons. So, we calculate 75% of 8:

\[ 75\% \text{ of } 8 = \frac{75}{100} \times 8 = 0.75 \times 8 = 6 \]

This means she added 6 blue balloons to her collection. So, the total number of balloons she carried into the school is the sum of the remaining red, yellow, and blue balloons:

\[ 15 \text{ (red)} + 6 \text{ (yellow)} + 8 \text{ (blue)} + 6 \text{ (blue added)} = 35 \]

So, the final number of balloons Sally carried into the school is:

\[ 35 \]"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. There's a 50% chance the normal teacher will come in.
2. If the normal teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension.
3. If the normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension.

First, let's find the chance that Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework if the normal teacher comes in:
- The chance the normal teacher gives an extension is 40%, so the chance she doesn't give an extension is 100% - 40% = 60%.
- If the normal teacher doesn't give an extension, Marcus can get a personal extension 20% of the time. So, the chance he gets a personal extension is 60% * 20% = 12%.

So, the total chance Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework if the normal teacher comes in is 60% (no extension) + 12% (personal extension) = 72%.

Now, we add the chance that the substitute teacher will come in, which is 50%. If the substitute teacher comes in, Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework 100% of the time because the substitute teacher won't collect it.

So, the total chance Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework is:
- 50% (substitute teacher) + 72% (normal teacher) = 122%.

Since the chance can't be more than 100%, we know that the chance he has to turn in his homework is 100% - 100% = 0%.

The final numerical answer is 0%."
"First, we need to find out how many seats are left after accounting for the seats for graduates and faculty.

Seats for graduates: 950
Seats for faculty: 300

Total seats accounted for: 950 + 300 = 1250

Total seats available: 6000

Seats left for graduates and their guests: 6000 - 1250 = 4750

Now, we need to split these 4750 seats equally among the 950 graduates.

Tickets per graduate: 4750 ÷ 950 = 5

So, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family."
"First, let's find out how many medium-sized jelly beans Grandpa can eat. Since he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, and he can eat 75 large beans, we calculate:

\[ 75 \times 2 = 150 \text{ medium-sized beans} \]

Next, we need to find out how many small beans he can eat. We know that 3 small beans are the same as 1 medium-sized bean. So, to find out how many small beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans, we multiply:

\[ 150 \times 3 = 450 \text{ small beans} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 450 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time Melissa spends on jury duty:
- She spends 6 hours a day for 3 days.
- So, 6 hours/day * 3 days = 18 hours.

Next, let's calculate her total pay:
- She is paid $15 per day.
- So, $15/day * 3 days = $45.

Now, let's calculate her total expenses:
- She has to pay $3 for parking each day.
- So, $3/day * 3 days = $9.

Now, let's find out her net pay after expenses:
- Her total pay is $45.
- Her total expenses are $9.
- So, $45 - $9 = $36.

Finally, let's find out how much she makes per hour after expenses:
- Her net pay is $36.
- She spent 18 hours on jury duty.
- So, $36 / 18 hours = $2 per hour.

The final numerical answer is $2 per hour."
"First, let's calculate how much Ted spent on the books. He bought 3 books for 16 dollars each, so:
3 books * 16 dollars/book = 48 dollars

Next, let's calculate how much he spent on the pencils. He bought 3 pencils for 6 dollars each, so:
3 pencils * 6 dollars/pencil = 18 dollars

Now, let's add the cost of the books and the pencils to find the total amount spent:
48 dollars (books) + 18 dollars (pencils) = 66 dollars

So, Ted spent a total of 66 dollars."
"First, we need to find out how many bottles of soda Richard will need. Since his driveway is 24 feet wide and he wants to put a bottle every 3 feet, we divide the width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:

24 feet / 3 feet = 8 bottles

Richard will need to go from one bottle to the next, so he will need to go between 7 spaces to drop the candy in all 8 bottles. It takes him 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next. So, we multiply the number of spaces by the time it takes to go between each space:

7 spaces * 5 seconds/space = 35 seconds

So, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is 35 seconds."
"First, we need to find out how many apples are in two boxes. Since one box has forty apples, two boxes will have:

40 apples/box * 2 boxes = 80 apples

Now, Uncle Franky plans to pack the apples with eight apples in one pack. To find out how many packs he can make, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack:

80 apples / 8 apples/pack = 10 packs

So, the final numerical answer is 10."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the Parmesan cheese:
- The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound.
- Mo buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese.
- So, the cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese is 2 * $11 = $22.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mozzarella cheese:
- The price of mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound.
- Mo buys 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese.
- So, the cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is 3 * $6 = $18.

Now, let's add the cost of both cheeses to find the total cost:
- Total cost = Cost of Parmesan cheese + Cost of mozzarella cheese
- Total cost = $22 + $18 = $40.

Mo starts with $50. To find out how much money she has left after buying the cheese, we subtract the total cost from the amount she started with:
- Money left = Starting amount - Total cost
- Money left = $50 - $40 = $10.

So, Mo will have $10 left to buy meat."
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Jim takes 4 years to finish college.
- He gets $50,000 in loans per year.
- Before college, he had a $25,000 a year job.
- His college degree triples his income, so after college, his income is $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 a year.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim borrowed during college:
- He borrowed $50,000 per year for 4 years, so the total amount borrowed is $50,000 * 4 = $200,000.

Next, let's calculate the total income Jim would have earned if he had not gone to college:
- Before college, he earned $25,000 a year.
- After college, he would earn $75,000 a year.

Now, let's calculate the total income Jim would have earned if he had stayed in his job before college:
- Without going to college, he would have earned $25,000 a year for 4 years, so the total income would be $25,000 * 4 = $100,000.

Now, let's calculate the total income Jim would have earned if he had gone to college:
- With college, he would have earned $75,000 a year for 4 years, so the total income would be $75,000 * 4 = $300,000.

The money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school is the difference between the total income with college and the total income without college:
- The difference is $300,000 - $100,000 = $200,000.

So, it would take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"First, we need to find the size of the fabric Jim needs for one piece. The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. So, one piece of fabric needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

The length of the fabric for one piece is:
\[ 6 + 2 = 8 \text{ feet} \]

The width of the fabric for one piece is:
\[ 8 + 2 = 10 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 8 \times 10 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[ \text{Total area} = 80 \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

So, Jim needs to buy:
\[ 160 \text{ square feet of fabric} \]"
"First, let's find out how many letters were delivered on Tuesday. We know that on Monday, they delivered 425 letters. On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. So, we calculate one-fifth of Monday's delivery:

\[ \frac{425}{5} = 85 \]

Then we add 17 to this number to find Tuesday's delivery:

\[ 85 + 17 = 102 \]

So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

Next, we need to find out how many letters were delivered on Wednesday. We know that on Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. So, we first calculate twice Tuesday's delivery:

\[ 2 \times 102 = 204 \]

Then we add 5 to this number to find Wednesday's delivery:

\[ 204 + 5 = 209 \]

So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

Now, to find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we add the number of letters delivered each day:

\[ 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 \]

So, the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is 736."
"First, let's calculate the cost for the chicken salad:
10 people * $6.50 per person = $65.00

Now, let's calculate the cost for the pasta salad:
6 people * $6 per person = $36.00

Now, let's add the two costs together to get the total amount Molly will pay:
$65.00 + $36.00 = $101.00

So, the final numerical answer is:
101"
"First, let's calculate how much Johnny's dad won or lost in each race.

1. In the first race, he lost $5.
2. In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. So, he won $1 + (2 * $5) = $1 + $10 = $11.
3. In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.5.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost or won over the three races:
- First race: -5
- Second race: +11
- Third race: -16.5

Total = -5 + 11 - 16.5 = -10.5

To find the average loss, we divide the total loss by the number of races:
Average loss = -10.5 / 3 = -3.5

So, Johnny's dad lost on average $3.50 that day."
"To find the total number of people in South America, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country and then by the number of people living in each city.

Number of countries in South America = 26
Number of cities in each country = 5
Number of people in each city = 1000

Total number of people = Number of countries × Number of cities in each country × Number of people in each city
Total number of people = 26 × 5 × 1000

Now let's do the multiplication:
26 × 5 = 130
130 × 1000 = 130,000

So, the total number of people in South America is 130,000."
"First, we need to convert all measurements to the same unit. Let's use inches for this problem.

Xavier was 4 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert Xavier's height to inches:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Xavier grew 3 inches, so his new height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches, so his new height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's height:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is 1 inch."
"Let's call the amount the first person took as X.
The second person took $80 more than the first, so the second person took X + $80.
The third person took twice what the second took, so the third person took 2(X + $80) = 2X + $160.
The total amount they took together is $1920.
So, X + (X + $80) + (2X + $160) = $1920.
Combining like terms, we get 4X + $240 = $1920.
Subtracting $240 from both sides, we get 4X = $1680.
Dividing both sides by 4, we get X = $420.
Therefore, the first person took $420.
The final numerical answer is $420."
"First, we need to find out how many days the painters worked in total. They worked for 3 weeks, and each week has 7 days. So, 3 weeks is 3 * 7 = 21 days. They worked 3/8ths of a day each day. So, the total work in days is 21 * 3/8 = 63/8 = 7.875 days.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total work by the number of painters to find out how many days each painter worked. So, each painter worked 7.875 / 4 = 1.96875 days.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we multiply the number of days each painter worked by 24 to find out how many hours each painter worked. So, each painter worked 1.96875 * 24 = 47.25 hours.

The final numerical answer is 47.25."
"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Let's say Rory retrieved \( x \) balls in the second set.
2. In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
3. In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
4. The total number of balls retrieved is 19.

So, we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 4) + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:

First, combine like terms:
\[ x + x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = 19 \]

To combine \( 2x \) and \( \frac{x}{2} \), we need a common denominator:
\[ \frac{4x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = 19 \]
\[ \frac{5x}{2} + 4 = 19 \]

Subtract 4 from both sides:
\[ \frac{5x}{2} = 15 \]

Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. Now, we can find out how many balls he retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, Rory retrieved 10 balls in the first set.

The final numerical answer is:
10"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation year by year.

First, let's find the price of the car in 2008:
- The car depreciates by 21% each year.
- So, the remaining value after depreciation is 79% (100% - 21% = 79%).

The price in 2008 = $20000 * 0.79 = $15800.

Next, let's find the price of the car in 2009:
- The price in 2009 = $15800 * 0.79 = $12522.

Finally, let's find the price of the car in 2010:
- The price in 2010 = $12522 * 0.79 = $9830.18.

So, the price of the car in the year 2010 is $9830.18."
"First, let's find out how many books are written in English. Since half of the books are in English, we have:

50 books / 2 = 25 books in English.

Next, we find out how many books are in German. 10% of the books are in German, so:

50 books * 10% = 5 books in German.

Now, to find out how many books are in Spanish, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:

50 books - 25 books (English) - 5 books (German) = 20 books in Spanish.

So, the number of Spanish books is 20."
"First, we need to find out how many kilometers Bernice has already driven. She drove for 4 days and 325 kilometers in total.

Now, we need to subtract the kilometers she has already driven from the total distance to find out how many kilometers she still needs to drive.

Total distance = 1955 kilometers
Distance already driven = 325 kilometers

Distance still needed = Total distance - Distance already driven
Distance still needed = 1955 - 325
Distance still needed = 1630 kilometers

So, the final numerical answer is 1630 kilometers."
"First, we need to find out how many cups of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days. If she drinks 8 cups every day, then in 30 days she drinks:

\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to convert the total cups of water into gallons. Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we divide the total cups by 16:

\[ 240 \text{ cups} \div 16 \text{ cups/gallon} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

15"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Romeo boards the train with 120 people.
2. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   120 + 20 = 140 people.
3. At the second stop, 50 people get off the train, and twice that number (which is 2 * 50 = 100) get on the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190 people.
4. At the third stop, 80 more people get off the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   190 - 80 = 110 people.

Therefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110."
"First, let's find out how much Alison spent on each item:

1. Tank top: $10
2. Running shorts: $5 more than the tank top, so $10 + $5 = $15
3. Tennis shoes: The original price was $48, but they were on sale for half price, so $48 / 2 = $24
4. Athletic socks: The original price was $8, but with a $2 off coupon, so $8 - $2 = $6

Now, let's add up all the costs:

$10 (tank top) + $15 (running shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (athletic socks) = $55

So, Alison spent $55 on athletic gear."
"Each tile covers 1 square foot because it is 1ft by 1ft. Since the kitchen floor is 200 square feet, you will need 200 tiles. If each tile costs $12, then the total cost will be 200 tiles times $12 per tile. 

200 tiles * $12/tile = $2400

The final cost to renovate your kitchen floor will be $2400."
"First, we need to find out how much more the insurance cost because of the accident. The normal cost is $120 a month, and it increased by 60%. To find 60% of $120, we calculate:

\[ 60\% \text{ of } $120 = \frac{60}{100} \times 120 = 0.60 \times 120 = $72 \]

So, the cost increased by $72. Now, we add this to the normal cost to find the total cost per month:

\[ $120 + $72 = $192 \]

Now, to find out how much he pays in a year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):

\[ $192 \times 12 = $2304 \]

So, the final numerical answer is $2304."
"First, let's figure out how many sets of sheets Greg needs to wash each week. A twin set of sheets consists of 2 sheets (one for the top and one for the bottom), and a king set of sheets consists of 3 sheets. So, for 4 twin beds, he needs 4 * 2 = 8 sheets. For the king size bed, he needs 3 sheets. Therefore, in total, he needs 8 + 3 = 11 sheets each week.

His laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets (which is 4 sheets) at a time and 1 king set (which is 3 sheets) at a time. So, in one load, he can wash 4 + 3 = 7 sheets.

Now, to find out how many loads he needs to do each week, we divide the total number of sheets by the number of sheets he can wash in one load. So, 11 sheets / 7 sheets per load = 1.5714 loads. Since he can't do a fraction of a load, he will need to do 2 loads each week to have enough sheets.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so to find out how many loads he does in a year, we multiply the number of loads per week by the number of weeks in a year: 2 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 104 loads/year.

So, the final numerical answer is 104."
"First, let's find out how many movies they watch on Sunday. They watch half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday. Since they watch 4 movies on Saturday, on Sunday they watch:

4 / 2 = 2 movies

Now, let's find out how many movies they watch in one weekend. They watch 4 movies on Saturday and 2 movies on Sunday, so in one weekend they watch:

4 + 2 = 6 movies

Since they watch movies every weekend, in 4 weeks they will watch:

6 movies/weekend * 4 weekends = 24 movies

So, the final numerical answer is 24."
"Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.
Last year, he collected 50 stickers, so before collecting those, he had 100 - 50 = 50 stickers.
This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, so he collected 50 * 2 = 100 stickers.
So, in total, Leo has 50 (from last year) + 100 (this year) = 150 stickers in his collection now.

The final numerical answer is 150."
"First, we need to find out how much cat food Imma's cats eat in total each day. Since she feeds her 3 cats 60 grams of cat food each time and she feeds them twice a day, we can calculate the total amount of food they eat in one day as follows:

\[ \text{Total food per day} = 3 \text{ cats} \times 60 \text{ grams/cat} \times 2 \text{ feedings/day} \]

\[ \text{Total food per day} = 3 \times 60 \times 2 \]

\[ \text{Total food per day} = 360 \text{ grams/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. We can do this by dividing the total amount of food by the amount of food consumed per day:

\[ \text{Number of days} = \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams/day}} \]

\[ \text{Number of days} = 2 \]

So, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days."
"First, let's find out how many slices Jake ate. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake and Becky ate 10 slices, Jake ate 10 - 3 = 7 slices.

Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate 7 * 2 = 14 slices.

Now, let's add up all the slices they ate:
Becky ate 10 slices,
Jake ate 7 slices,
Silvia ate 14 slices.

So, the total number of slices they ate is 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 slices."
"Let's call the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we can say Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time for the meal is the sum of Betsy's and Donovan's parts, which is given as 98 minutes. So we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side gives:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Now, divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we add 18 to 40:

\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

The final numerical answer is 58."
"First, let's break down the costs:

- The doctor charges $200 for the cast.
- The visit is 30 minutes long, and the doctor charges $300 per hour. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the cost for the visit is $300 / 2 = $150.
- The painkillers cost $4 each, and Hannah needs 30 pills. So, the cost for the painkillers is $4 * 30 = $120.
- The parking cost is $6 per hour, and it's a mandatory minimum of 2 hours. So, the cost for parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add up all these costs:
- Cost of the cast: $200
- Cost of the visit: $150
- Cost of the painkillers: $120
- Cost of parking: $12

Total cost = $200 + $150 + $120 + $12 = $482

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"First, we need to find out how many emails James gets that require a response. If he gets 80 emails a day and 20% of those don't require a response, then 80 - (20% of 80) emails do require a response.

20% of 80 is calculated as:
\[ 80 \times \frac{20}{100} = 80 \times 0.20 = 16 \]

So, 80 - 16 = 64 emails require a response each day.

Now, to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5 day work week, we multiply the number of emails he responds to each day by 5:
\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 320."
"To solve this, let's break it down day by day:

- Monday: 32 classes
- Tuesday: Twice as many as Monday, so 32 * 2 = 64 classes
- Wednesday: Three times as many as Monday, so 32 * 3 = 96 classes
- Thursday: 30 classes
- Friday: 25 classes

Now, let's add them all up:

32 (Monday) + 64 (Tuesday) + 96 (Wednesday) + 30 (Thursday) + 25 (Friday) = 247

So, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is 247."
"To find the average score, we need to add up all the scores and then divide by the number of tests.

John's scores are: 100, 100, 100, and 80.

First, we add them up: 100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380

So, the average score across the 4 tests is 95."
"First, let's find out how many pizzas the glee club ate. They ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. To find out how many pizzas they ate, we calculate:

\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \text{ pizzas} \]

So, the glee club has:

\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \text{ pizzas left} \]

Next, let's find out how many pizzas the football team ate. They ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ pizzas} \]

They ate 80% of these pizzas, so:

\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \text{ pizzas} \]

So, the football team has:

\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \text{ pizzas left} \]

Now, let's find out how many pizzas are left in total. We add the pizzas left from both the glee club and the football team:

\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \text{ pizzas left} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

14"
"First, let's find out how many big coupons Anthony wants to send. He wants twice as many big coupons as small ones. So, if he wants 700 small coupons, he will want:

700 * 2 = 1400 big coupons

Now, let's calculate the cost for the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so for 700 small coupons, the cost will be:

700 * 5 = 3500 cents

Next, let's calculate the cost for the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so for 1400 big coupons, the cost will be:

1400 * 15 = 21000 cents

Now, let's add the cost of the small coupons and the big coupons to find the total cost:

3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100 (since 100 cents = 1 dollar):

24500 cents / 100 = 245 dollars

So, Anthony spends a total of 245 dollars on postage."
"First, let's find out how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney ordered. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. So, Sidney ordered 10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches.

Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, so Sidney had 7 - 4 = 3 meatball sub sandwiches left.

Then, Sidney ordered another three sub sandwiches, so Sidney now has 3 + 3 = 6 meatball sub sandwiches in total.

Since each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is 6 * 4 = 24 meatballs."
"First, let's find out how many trucks had mechanical failures. Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks, and a quarter of them had problems. So we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of trucks with problems} = \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \]

This means 5 trucks could not deliver. So, the number of trucks that successfully delivered is:

\[ \text{Number of trucks that delivered} = 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. So, the total tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:

\[ \text{Total tons of fertiliser} = 15 \times 20 = 300 \]

The final numerical answer is 300 tons."
"First, we need to find out how much butter Dennis needs. Since he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants and he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he needs 6 pounds of butter.

Now, the store has a promotion where you buy one pound of butter and get one half off. This means for every two pounds of butter, Dennis only pays for one pound.

To find out how much it will cost him, we can calculate it as follows:

- For the first pound, he pays the full price of $4.00.
- For the second pound, he pays half the price, which is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.

So, the total cost for 2 pounds is $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

Since Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter, we can calculate the cost for 6 pounds by multiplying the cost for 2 pounds by 3 (because 6 pounds is three times 2 pounds):

$6.00 * 3 = $18.00.

So, the final numerical answer is $18.00."
"First, let's calculate the total number of people invited:
- Kayla invited her 25 classmates.
- She invited 7 girls in her dance class.
- She invited 13 family members.
- Total invited = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 people.

Now, let's find out how many people will actually come to the party:
- Total invited = 45 people.
- 4 people said they could not come.
- People coming to the party = 45 - 4 = 41 people.

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for the first 20 guests, and then $6 for each additional guest. So, we need to calculate the cost for the additional guests:
- Additional guests = 41 - 20 = 21 guests.
- Cost for additional guests = 21 * $6 = $126.

Now, let's add the base rental fee to the cost for the additional guests to find the total cost:
- Total cost = $125 (base fee) + $126 (additional guests) = $251.

The final numerical answer is:
251"
"Maggie had $60 and spent a quarter of it, so she spent $60 * 1/4 = $15. This means Maggie has $60 - $15 = $45 left.

Riza also had $60 and spent one-third of it, so she spent $60 * 1/3 = $20. This means Riza has $60 - $20 = $40 left.

Together, they have $45 + $40 = $85 left."
"First, let's find out how many bananas all the monkeys eat together in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
The second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

So, the first and second monkeys together eat 10 + 14 = 24 bananas each day.

Mr. Robles has 315 bananas for the week, which is enough to feed the monkeys for a week. So, the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day is 315 bananas / 7 days = 45 bananas per day.

Now, to find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we subtract the number of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys from the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day.

So, the third monkey eats 45 - 24 = 21 bananas each day.

The final numerical answer is 21."
"Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, so he placed 500 / 2 = 250 pieces in the first puzzle.
Teddy also finished another 500 piece puzzle, so he placed 500 pieces in the second puzzle.
In total, Teddy placed 250 + 500 = 750 puzzle pieces during that hour."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the roses Jenny bought.

Jenny bought 15 roses. Since roses cost $2 each, the cost for 15 roses is:
\[ 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much money Jenny has. She arrived with five 5 dollar bills, so:
\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much money Jenny has left after buying the roses. She spent $30, but she only had $25, so:
\[ 25 - 30 = -5 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Jenny does not have enough money to buy the roses, she would need to get more money. However, the question asks how many quarters she would leave with if she had enough money. Since she doesn't have enough money, she wouldn't leave any quarters.

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 0 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total money Terry makes from selling milkshakes:
6 milkshakes * $5.50 each = $33.00

Next, let's calculate the total money Terry makes from selling burger platters:
9 burger platters * $11 each = $99.00

Now, let's calculate the total money Terry makes from selling sodas:
20 sodas * $1.50 each = $30.00

Finally, let's add up all the money Terry makes:
$33.00 (milkshakes) + $99.00 (burger platters) + $30.00 (sodas) = $162.00

So, the total money Terry makes is $162.00."
"To solve this, let's break down the schedule step by step:

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes.
2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 10 + 30 = 40 minutes after the first train arrives. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes.
3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 40 + 60 = 100 minutes after the first train arrives. The third train leaves immediately after it arrives.
4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 100 + 20 = 120 minutes after the first train arrives.

Now, let's calculate how long Paul will wait:

- The first train arrives in 10 minutes, and Paul will wait 10 minutes for it.
- The second train arrives in 40 minutes, and Paul will wait 40 minutes for it.
- The third train arrives in 100 minutes, and Paul will wait 100 minutes for it.
- The fourth train arrives in 120 minutes, and Paul will wait 120 minutes for it.

So, the total time Paul will wait is 10 + 40 + 100 + 120 = 270 minutes.

The final numerical answer is 270."
"Melanie has saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks, so she has saved:
10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

She needs 200 toothpicks in total and has 120, so she needs:
200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

If she continues saving 10 toothpicks each week, the number of weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks is:
80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

So, it will take her 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks."
"First, let's find out how much Mr. Rogers bought the watch for. The original price of the watch was $2000, and he bought it at 75% of its original price.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers bought it for} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers sold it for} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

Now, to find the percentage discount Mr. Rogers's friend obtained from the original price, we need to calculate how much less the friend paid compared to the original price.

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

To find the percentage discount, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage Discount} = \left( \frac{\text{Discount Amount}}{\text{Original Price}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage Discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers's friend from the original price is 10%."
"First, we need to find out how many seconds are in 4 hours. There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 4 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} \times 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 14400 \text{ seconds} \]

Since every second, one jellyfish is created, in 14400 seconds, 14400 jellyfish would be created by one spring. Since there are 5 springs working at the same rate, we multiply the number of jellyfish created by one spring by 5:

\[ 14400 \text{ jellyfish/spring} \times 5 \text{ springs} = 72000 \text{ jellyfish} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 72000 jellyfish."
"Binkie's score was 90.
Twice Binkie's score is 90 * 2 = 180.
Frankie's score was 15 more than twice Binkie's score, so Frankie's score is 180 + 15 = 195.

The final numerical answer is 195."
"First, let's break down the journey James made:

1. James walks halfway to the store. Since the store is 4 miles away, halfway is 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles.
2. He realizes he forgot something and has to walk back home. So, he walks another 2 miles back.
3. In total, he walks 2 miles + 2 miles = 4 miles.

Now, we know James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour. To find out how long it took him to walk 4 miles, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, it took James 1 hour to reach the store."
"First, let's find out how many bananas Jenny bought in total. She bought 10 bunches, and each bunch has 4 bananas. So, the total number of bananas is:
10 bunches * 4 bananas/bunch = 40 bananas

Now, let's calculate the cost if she bought the bananas individually. Since each banana costs $0.80, the total cost for 40 bananas would be:
40 bananas * $0.80/banana = $32.00

Next, let's calculate the cost if she bought the bananas in bunches. Since each bunch costs $3.00 and she bought 10 bunches, the total cost would be:
10 bunches * $3.00/bunch = $30.00

Now, to find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost when buying in bunches from the cost when buying individually:
$32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00

So, Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually."
"First, let's figure out how much fence each person gets. We know that Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam. Let's say Sam gets 'x' feet. Then Harry gets 'x + 60' feet. Together they have 100 feet of fence.

So, we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2x + 60 = 100 \]

Subtract 60 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 40 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet and Harry gets 20 + 60 = 80 feet.

To find out how much is left over for Sam, we subtract the amount Harry gets from the total:
\[ 100 - 80 = 20 \]

So, Sam has 20 feet left over."
"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to find out how much it grows in one year.

If the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, then in one year it grows:
\[ \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \]

Now, to find out how much it grows in 13 years, we multiply the growth per year by 13:
\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

So, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"First, let's find out how many of each type of bike Marcel sold.

Half of the 300 bikes sold were Trekking bikes:
\[ \frac{300}{2} = 150 \text{ Trekking bikes} \]

15% of the 300 bikes sold were BMX bikes:
\[ 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \text{ BMX bikes} \]

The rest of the bikes sold were MTB type. So, we subtract the number of Trekking and BMX bikes from the total number of bikes sold to find the number of MTB bikes:
\[ 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \text{ MTB bikes} \]

Now, let's calculate the total earnings from each type of bike sold.

The price of one MTB is $500, so the total earnings from MTB bikes are:
\[ 105 \times 500 = 52500 \text{ dollars} \]

The price of one BMX bike is half the price of an MTB, which is:
\[ \frac{500}{2} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]
So, the total earnings from BMX bikes are:
\[ 45 \times 250 = 11250 \text{ dollars} \]

The price of one Trekking bike is $450, so the total earnings from Trekking bikes are:
\[ 150 \times 450 = 67500 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find the total earnings from selling all the bikes, we add the earnings from each type of bike:
\[ 52500 + 11250 + 67500 = 131250 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Marcel earned $131250 from selling bicycles during that month."
"First, let's find out how many bales the farmer makes in a day. The farmer makes 5 bales each hour and works for 6 hours, so:
5 bales/hour * 6 hours = 30 bales

Next, let's find out how many bales the truck picks up in a day. The truck picks up 3 bales each hour and works for 6 hours, so:
3 bales/hour * 6 hours = 18 bales

Now, to find out how many bales are left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer:
30 bales - 18 bales = 12 bales

So, the final numerical answer is 12."
"First, let's find out how many periods John has to take each day. Normally, there are 6 periods, but John has to take 2 extra classes. So, he has to take 6 + 2 = 8 periods each day.

Each period is 40 minutes long, so each day he spends 8 * 40 = 320 minutes in class.

He goes to class for 5 days a week, so in a week, he spends 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes in class.

On Saturday and Sunday, he spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes each on extra learning time. So, he spends 1/16 * 1600 = 100 minutes on Saturday and 100 minutes on Sunday, which totals 200 minutes.

So, in a week, he spends 1600 + 200 = 1800 minutes learning.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 because there are 60 minutes in an hour. So, 1800 minutes is 1800 / 60 = 30 hours.

The final numerical answer is 30 hours."
"First, we need to find out how high the ball bounces after the first bounce. The ball starts from the third-floor balcony, and each story is 24 feet high. So, the height of the third-floor balcony is:

24 feet/story * 3 stories = 72 feet

After the first bounce, the ball bounces to 2/3 of its starting height. So, the height after the first bounce is:

72 feet * 2/3 = 48 feet

Now, we need to find out how high the ball goes on its second bounce. The ball will again bounce to 2/3 of its height after the first bounce. So, the height after the second bounce is:

48 feet * 2/3 = 32 feet

The final numerical answer is 32 feet."
"First, we need to convert the height of the first child to inches because the other heights are given in inches. The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

The final numerical answer is 72 inches."
"First, we need to find out how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we divide the total number of apples sold by the number of apples per bag:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total number of apples}}{\text{Number of apples per bag}} = \frac{2000}{10} = 200 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total earnings. The orchard sells each bag for $5, so we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of bags} \times \text{Price per bag} = 200 \times 5 = 1000 \]

So, the orchard earned $1000 for selling the apples."
"Let's break this down step by step:

1. The lazy Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms. Before the Allosaurus ate, there were 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms of meat left.

2. The velociraptors scavenged half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. So, before the velociraptors ate, there were 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms of meat left.

3. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops. So, before the T-Rex ate, there were 1080 * 2 = 2160 kilograms of meat on the triceratops.

The final numerical answer is 2160 kilograms."
"First, we need to calculate the total area of the walls that Tony needs to paint. The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet each, so the total area for these two walls is:
\[ 2 \times (10 \times 8) = 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet each, so the total area for these two walls is:
\[ 2 \times (5 \times 8) = 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Now, we add the areas of all four walls to get the total area to be painted:
\[ 160 + 80 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, we divide the total area by the coverage of one gallon:
\[ \frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost of the paint. Since each gallon costs $12, the total cost is:
\[ 12 \times 12 = 144 \]

So, the cost to paint the room is:
\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"First, let's understand the situation step by step:

1. Ellen starts with 12 sodas.
2. She shakes 3 sodas, so now there are 3 shaken sodas and 9 unshaken sodas.
3. Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 8 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.
4. Ellen's brother takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas.
5. Ellen's friend comes along and takes 1 unshaken soda.

Now, we need to find the probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda. Initially, there were 2 shaken sodas out of a total of 8 sodas (2 shaken and 6 unshaken). After Ellen's friend takes 1 unshaken soda, there are 1 shaken soda and 5 unshaken sodas left, making a total of 6 sodas.

The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas left divided by the total number of sodas left:

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas left}}{\text{Total number of sodas left}} = \frac{1}{6} \]

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \frac{1}{6} \times 100 \approx 16.67\% \]

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is approximately 16.67%."
"First, let's find out how fast each train is traveling. The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, so it's traveling at 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour.

Now, we need to find out how far each train travels in 3 hours. For the first train:
60 miles/hour * 3 hours = 180 miles

For the second train:
30 miles/hour * 3 hours = 90 miles

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, we add the distances they've traveled to find out how far apart they are:
180 miles + 90 miles = 270 miles

So, after 3 hours, the two trains are 270 miles apart."
"First, let's find out how many days Billy works. There are 31 days in March and 19 days in April, so that's 31 + 19 = 50 days in total. If he takes 20% off, that means he takes 20/100 * 50 = 10 days off. So, he works 50 - 10 = 40 days.

Billy helps 2 people per hour and works 3 hours a day, so he helps 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

If he works 40 days, then he helps 40 * 6 = 240 people.

So, the final numerical answer is 240."
"First, let's calculate how many people were in the buses:
12 buses * 35 people per bus = 420 people

Now, let's calculate how many people were in the cars:
20 cars * 3 people per car = 60 people

Now, let's add the number of people in the buses and cars to find the total number of people inside the church:
420 people + 60 people = 480 people

So, the final numerical answer is 480."
"First, we need to find out how old Martha is. Since Mike is 24 years old and Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, we can calculate Martha's age as follows:

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20 years old

Now, we know that Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. So, we can calculate Jeff's age as follows:

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30 years old

So, the final numerical answer is 30."
"First, we need to calculate how long it takes to slide down each waterslide.

For the biggest slide:
- Length = 300 feet
- Speed = 60 feet/minute
- Time = Length / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
- Length = 240 feet
- Speed = 80 feet/minute
- Time = Length / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

Now, we need to find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide.
- Difference in time = Time for biggest slide - Time for second biggest slide
- Difference in time = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

So, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide."
"First, let's find out how many minutes Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to in one day.

He takes a 30 minute lunch and 2 breaks, each 15 minutes long.

So, the total break time per day is:
2 breaks * 15 minutes/break = 30 minutes

Now, add the lunch time to the break time:
30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes

Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 60 minutes in one day.

Now, let's find out how many minutes they add up to in 5 days:
60 minutes/day * 5 days = 300 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes):
300 minutes ÷ 60 = 5 hours

So, the final numerical answer is:
5 hours"
"First, let's find out how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's miles as follows:

Micah's miles = 3.5 * Amber's miles
Micah's miles = 3.5 * 8
Micah's miles = 28

Now, we know the total miles run by all three is 52. To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total miles:

Ahito's miles = Total miles - (Amber's miles + Micah's miles)
Ahito's miles = 52 - (8 + 28)
Ahito's miles = 52 - 36
Ahito's miles = 16

So, Ahito ran 16 miles."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the items after the returns and purchases.

Sheila originally charged $85.00 but returned an item that cost $15.00. So, the new balance after the return is:
\[ 85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the frying pan after the 20% discount. The original price of the frying pan is $20.00. A 20% discount means she pays 80% of the original price:
\[ 20.00 \times 0.80 = 16.00 \]

Then, let's calculate the cost of the set of towels after the 10% discount. The original price of the set of towels is $30.00. A 10% discount means she pays 90% of the original price:
\[ 30.00 \times 0.90 = 27.00 \]

Now, let's add the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels to the new balance on her credit card:
\[ 70.00 + 16.00 + 27.00 = 113.00 \]

So, the new balance on her credit card is:
\[ 113.00 \]"
"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that a fifth of the jellyfish are large. Let's call the total number of jellyfish in the tank ""T"".
2. A third of the large jellyfish change color under UV light. So, if we take the total number of jellyfish (T), a fifth of them are large, which is \( \frac{T}{5} \). And a third of these large jellyfish change color, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{T}{5} = \frac{T}{15} \).
3. We are told that when the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color. So, \( \frac{T}{15} = 6 \).
4. To find T, we solve the equation: \( T = 6 \times 15 = 90 \).

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90."
"First, we need to find out how old Ben is. Since Ben is two times older than Chris and Chris is 4 years old, we can calculate Ben's age as follows:

Ben's age = 2 * Chris's age
Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now, we know that Caroline is three times older than Ben. So, we can calculate Caroline's age as follows:

Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

So, the final numerical answer is 24."
"First, let's calculate how much Lauren saves each year. She saves 20% of her $100,000 salary each year. 

So, her yearly savings are:
\[ 100,000 \times 0.20 = 20,000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much she needs to save for her retirement. She plans to live with 40% of her current annual salary, which is:
\[ 100,000 \times 0.40 = 40,000 \]

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take her to save $40,000 if she saves $20,000 each year. We do this by dividing the total amount she needs to save by her yearly savings:
\[ \frac{40,000}{20,000} = 2 \]

So, Lauren needs to work for 2 more years to save enough for her retirement. 

The final numerical answer is:
2"
"First, we need to find out how long each of the 4 equal parts of the ribbon will be. Since Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon and he wants to cut it into 4 equal parts, we divide 100 by 4:

\[ 100 \div 4 = 25 \]

So, each of the 4 equal parts is 25 centimeters long.

Next, we need to divide each of these 25 centimeter parts into 5 equal parts. To find the length of each of these smaller parts, we divide 25 by 5:

\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

Therefore, each final cut will be 5 centimeters long."
"To find out how many girls are in the school, we first need to find out the total number of students in the school. If 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys, we can set up a simple equation to find the total number of students.

Let's call the total number of students in the school ""T"". According to the information given, 40% of T is equal to 240 boys. We can write this as:

0.40 * T = 240

To find T, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:

T = 240 / 0.40
T = 600

So, the total number of students in the school is 600.

Now, to find out how many girls are in the school, we need to subtract the number of boys from the total number of students. Since we know there are 240 boys, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys
Number of girls = 600 - 240
Number of girls = 360

So, the number of girls in the school is 360."
"First, we need to add the cost of the pots and the sack of garden soil:
$19 + $26 = $45

Then, we subtract the amount she got from the coupon:
$45 - $7 = $38

So, the final amount of money my mom spent at the gardening shop is $38."
"First, we need to find the total height of all the heels and then divide by the number of heels.

There are 3 women wearing 4 inch heels, so the total height for these heels is:
3 * 4 = 12 inches

There are 3 women wearing 2 inch heels, so the total height for these heels is:
3 * 2 = 6 inches

Now we add the total heights of all the heels together:
12 inches + 6 inches = 18 inches

There are a total of 3 + 3 = 6 heels.

To find the average height of the heels, we divide the total height by the number of heels:
18 inches / 6 = 3 inches

So, the average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches."
"First, we need to find out how many miles Soledad plans to hike in total. She wants to hike 9,300 miles.

Next, we need to find out how many miles she plans to hike each day if she walks twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. Soledad will hike 125 miles in the morning and 125 miles in the afternoon, which totals to 250 miles per day.

To find out how many days she will need to hike 250 miles, we divide the total miles by the miles she hikes per day:
\[ \text{Number of days} = \frac{9,300 \text{ miles}}{250 \text{ miles/day}} = 37.2 \text{ days} \]

Since June has 30 days, Soledad cannot complete her hike in June if she hikes 250 miles per day. She needs to hike more miles per day to finish in June.

To find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike, we first calculate the total miles she needs to hike in June:
\[ \text{Total miles in June} = 9,300 \text{ miles} \]

Since June has 30 days, we divide the total miles by the number of days in June to find out how many miles she needs to hike per day:
\[ \text{Miles per day in June} = \frac{9,300 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 310 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad needs to hike 310 miles per day to complete her journey in June. Since she was planning to hike 250 miles per day, the additional miles she needs to hike per day is:
\[ \text{Additional miles per day} = 310 \text{ miles/day} - 250 \text{ miles/day} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 60 \]"
"First, we need to find out how many balls there are in total:
- Red balls: 3
- Blue balls: 11
- Green balls: 25

Total balls = 3 + 11 + 25 = 39 balls

Next, we need to find out how much money the store will receive from selling all the balls. We do this by multiplying the number of each color of ball by its cost and then adding all the amounts together:
- Red balls cost $9 each, so 3 red balls cost 3 * $9 = $27
- Blue balls cost $5 each, so 11 blue balls cost 11 * $5 = $55
- Green balls cost $3 each, so 25 green balls cost 25 * $3 = $75

Total money received = $27 + $55 + $75 = $157

So, the store will have received $157 after all the balls are sold."
"First, let's find out how much apples each person wants.

Peter wants a quarter of 12 kg:
1/4 * 12 = 3 kg

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg:
1/3 * 12 = 4 kg

Now, let's add up how much apples Peter and Paul want:
3 kg + 4 kg = 7 kg

They bought 12 kg in total, so to find out how much James will have left, we subtract the amount Peter and Paul want from the total:
12 kg - 7 kg = 5 kg

So, James will have 5 kg of apples left."
"The temperature dropped 8 degrees, so we subtract 8 from 2:
2 - 8 = -6 degrees.

Then it increased by 3 degrees in the morning, so we add 3 to -6:
-6 + 3 = -3 degrees.

The temperature in the morning was -3 degrees Celsius."
"Raymond originally had $21.
He saved $11, so he had $21 + $11 = $32.
He spent $5 on a comic book and $19 on a puzzle, so he spent a total of $5 + $19 = $24.
Therefore, Raymond has $32 - $24 = $8 left.

The final numerical answer is 8."
"Anna's initial budget was $16 and she has $2 left after her purchases. So, the total amount she has spent is $16 - $2 = $14.

She had already spent $4 before buying the books today. So, the amount she spent on the books today is $14 - $4 = $10.

Since she bought 2 books today and both cost the same amount, the cost of each book is $10 ÷ 2 = $5.

So, the final numerical answer is:
5"
"To find out how many students are enrolled this year, we need to calculate a 20% increase on last year's 50 students.

First, let's find out what 20% of 50 is:
- 20% of 50 = (20/100) * 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10

So, there are 10 more students this year than last year. Now, let's add this to last year's number of students:
- 50 (last year's students) + 10 (increase) = 60

Therefore, the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class is 60."
"To solve this, we first need to find out how many times the light blinks in one minute. If it blinks 255 times in 5 minutes, then in one minute it blinks:

\[ \frac{255 \text{ times}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ times per minute} \]

Now, to find out how many minutes it takes for the light to blink 459 times, we divide 459 by the number of blinks per minute:

\[ \frac{459 \text{ times}}{51 \text{ times per minute}} = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take 9 minutes for the light to blink 459 times."
"First, let's count the total number of male and female fishes Tate has before he buys more.

Male guppies: 4
Female guppies: 7
Male goldfishes: 3
Female goldfishes: 5

Total male fishes = 4 (male guppies) + 3 (male goldfishes) = 7
Total female fishes = 7 (female guppies) + 5 (female goldfishes) = 12

Now, Tate buys more fishes:

2 more male guppies
1 more female guppy
2 more male goldfishes
3 more female goldfishes

Adding these to the total:

New total male fishes = 7 (original) + 2 (new) = 9
New total female fishes = 12 (original) + 1 (new) + 3 (new) = 16

Now, to find out how many more female fishes than male fishes Tate has:

More female fishes than male fishes = 16 (female fishes) - 9 (male fishes) = 7

So, the final numerical answer is 7."
"First, let's find out how long each person took to do their chores.

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so:
Megan's time = Amalia's time + 2 hours
Megan's time = 4 hours + 2 hours
Megan's time = 6 hours

Dior took well over 4 hours longer than Amalia, so:
Dior's time > 4 hours + 4 hours
Dior's time > 8 hours

Now, let's add up the time they all took:
Total time = Amalia's time + Megan's time + Dior's time
Total time = 4 hours + 6 hours + Dior's time

Since Dior's time is more than 8 hours, let's assume the minimum time Dior could have taken, which is 9 hours (since it's ""well over 4 hours longer"" and 8 hours is the minimum):
Total time = 4 hours + 6 hours + 9 hours
Total time = 19 hours

So, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 19 hours."
"First, we need to find out how many hours John spends driving to his parents each time he visits. Since it takes him 2 hours to drive one way, the round trip will take:

2 hours (to) + 2 hours (back) = 4 hours

Now, we know that John drives at a speed of 70 mph. To find out how many miles he drives in 4 hours, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

So,

\[ \text{Distance} = 70 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 280 \text{ miles} \]

Since John visits his parents twice a month, we need to multiply the distance he drives each time by 2:

\[ 280 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 560 \text{ miles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 560 miles a month."
"Sofie walks 10 miles every day for 7 days, so she will walk a total of 10 * 7 = 70 miles in 7 days.

If Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, then Brian will walk half the distance Sofie walks. So, Brian will walk 70 / 2 = 35 miles in 7 days.

The final numerical answer is 35."
"First, let's calculate how many toys the first 4 workers can make in an hour.

2 workers produce 6 toys an hour, so together they produce:
2 workers * 6 toys/worker/hour = 12 toys/hour

Another 2 workers produce 4 toys an hour, so together they produce:
2 workers * 4 toys/worker/hour = 8 toys/hour

Now, let's add the production rates of all 4 workers:
12 toys/hour + 8 toys/hour = 20 toys/hour

Next, let's calculate how many toys all 4 workers can make in a 10-hour shift:
20 toys/hour * 10 hours = 200 toys

The toy manufacturer received an order for 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, they had 200 toys. So, they still need:
400 toys - 200 toys = 200 toys

The manufacturer still needs 20 toys to ship the order, so the fifth worker must produce:
200 toys - 20 toys = 180 toys

The fifth worker works for a 10-hour shift, so to find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys the fifth worker needs to produce by the number of hours in the shift:
180 toys / 10 hours = 18 toys/hour

So, the fifth worker produces 18 toys per hour."
"First, we need to find out the weight of Elijah's dogs.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah's dog that is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog would be:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's dog that is half the weight of Kory's dog would be:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add the weights of Elijah's dogs to find the total weight:
\[ 15 + 30 = 45 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs is 45 pounds."
"First, let's figure out how many stickers Kris got from Luis. Kris got 9 stickers and 7 stickers from Rob, so in total, Kris got 9 + 7 = 16 stickers.

Since Luis used half of the stickers he got from Seth and gave the rest to Kris, the 16 stickers Kris got must be the other half of what Luis got from Seth. This means Luis got 16 * 2 = 32 stickers from Seth.

Since Luis got half of the stickers Seth gave him, Seth must have given Luis 32 * 2 = 64 stickers.

So, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning."
"First, we need to find out how many ounces of M&M John has in total. He has 3 large bags, each weighing 10 ounces. So, we multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag:

3 bags * 10 ounces/bag = 30 ounces

Next, we need to find out how many M&M's are in 30 ounces. We know that 1 ounce of M&M has 30 M&M's. So, we multiply the total ounces by the number of M&M's per ounce:

30 ounces * 30 M&M/ounce = 900 M&M

Now, John wants to put 10 M&M's in each small bag. To find out how many small bags he can make, we divide the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's per small bag:

900 M&M / 10 M&M/small bag = 90 small bags

So, the final numerical answer is 90."
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find half of the circumference of the earth.
2. Divide that distance by the distance Alfie flies each day.

First, half of the circumference of the earth is:
\[ \frac{40,000}{2} = 20,000 \text{ kilometers} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day, so the number of days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers is:
\[ \frac{20,000}{400} = 50 \text{ days} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
50"
"First, we need to find out how fast the 2nd fastest car is. The problem states that the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. The average car can go 120 miles per hour.

So, the 2nd fastest car is:
5 * 120 = 600 miles per hour

Now, the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. So, we multiply the speed of the 2nd fastest car by 1.25 to find the speed of the faster car.

The faster car is:
1.25 * 600 = 750 miles per hour

So, the final numerical answer is 750 miles per hour."
"Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.
If Liam's age was twice the age of Vince two years ago, then Vince was 14 / 2 = 7 years old two years ago.
So, Vince's current age is 7 + 2 = 9 years old.

The final numerical answer is 9."
"First, let's figure out how many eggs each person painted.

We know that:
- Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs.
- Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs.
- Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah.

Let's say Sarah painted \( S \) eggs. Then Camden painted \( S + 12 \) eggs.

Since Camden and Sarah together painted 30 eggs, we can write:
\[ S + (S + 12) = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sarah painted 9 eggs. This means Camden painted \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs and together with Camden and Sarah they painted 56 eggs, we can write:
\[ \text{Arnold's eggs} + \text{Madeline's eggs} + \text{Camden's eggs} + \text{Sarah's eggs} = 56 \]
\[ \text{Arnold's eggs} + \text{Arnold's eggs} + 21 + 9 = 56 \]
\[ 2 \times \text{Arnold's eggs} + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2 \times \text{Arnold's eggs} = 26 \]
\[ \text{Arnold's eggs} = 13 \]

So, Arnold painted 13 eggs. Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, Madeline also painted 13 eggs.

Now, to find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ \text{Camden's eggs} - \text{Arnold's eggs} = 21 - 13 = 8 \]

So, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold."
"First, we need to find out how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons. We do this by dividing 200 by 8:

\[ 200 \div 8 = 25 \]

So, Nik can make 25 groups of 8 crayons each.

Next, we need to find out how many boxes he will need. Since each group of 8 crayons goes into one box, he will need 25 boxes.

Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is:

\[ 25 \times 8 = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, and he has 200 crayons, so the total weight of the crayons is:

\[ 200 \times 1 = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we add the weight of the crayons and the weight of the boxes to find the total weight:

\[ 200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds:

\[ 400 \div 16 = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[ 25 \text{ pounds} \]"
"First, we need to find out how many 4-foot logs John can make from the 80-foot tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we calculate:

\[ 80 \text{ feet} \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet of logs} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 4-foot logs he can get from 64 feet of logs:

\[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet per log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

Now, we need to find out how many planks he can get from these 16 logs. Since he cuts 5 planks from each log:

\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks per log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

Finally, we need to find out how much he makes if he sells each plank for $1.2:

\[ 80 \text{ planks} \times 1.2 \text{ dollars per plank} = 96 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 96 \]"
"First, we need to find out how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns half of what her brother earns, we can calculate her brother's salary by doubling Valerie's salary.

Valerie's salary = $5000
Brother's salary = 2 * Valerie's salary = 2 * $5000 = $10000

Now, we add Valerie's and her brother's salaries to find their combined salary.

Combined salary = Valerie's salary + Brother's salary = $5000 + $10000 = $15000

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so we calculate her salary as follows:

Mother's salary = 2 * Combined salary = 2 * $15000 = $30000

Finally, to find the total amount of money they all have together, we add Valerie's, her brother's, and their mother's salaries.

Total amount = Valerie's salary + Brother's salary + Mother's salary = $5000 + $10000 + $30000 = $45000

So, the final numerical answer is $45000."
"Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. If 40 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, and she walks 2 miles on the beach, then to find out how long it takes her to walk 1 mile on the beach, we divide 40 minutes by 2 miles, which gives us 20 minutes per mile on the beach.

Since she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk at twice the rate of speed, it will take her half the time to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk compared to the beach. So, it takes her 20 minutes / 2 = 10 minutes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk.

Now, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk to find the total time for the 3-mile walk:
- Time on the beach: 40 minutes
- Time on the sidewalk: 10 minutes

Total time = 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes

So, the final numerical answer is 50 minutes."
"Jane has saved $4 every week for 8 weeks, so she has saved:
$4/week * 8 weeks = $32

She wants to save a total of $60, so she needs to save:
$60 - $32 = $28 more

If she saves $4 each week, the number of weeks it will take her to save $28 more is:
$28 / $4/week = 7 weeks

So, it will take her 7 more weeks to save a total of $60."
"First, let's calculate the total number of blue birds in the trees.

For the 3 trees with 7 blue birds each:
3 trees * 7 blue birds/tree = 21 blue birds

For the 2 trees with 4 blue birds each:
2 trees * 4 blue birds/tree = 8 blue birds

For the final tree with 3 blue birds:
1 tree * 3 blue birds/tree = 3 blue birds

Now, let's add them all up:
21 blue birds + 8 blue birds + 3 blue birds = 32 blue birds

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"First, let's find out how many marbles Bob has now. If he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 24. So, if he gets 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. This means he has 60 - 24 = 36 marbles now.

If he loses 10 of the marbles he has, he will have 36 - 10 = 26 marbles.

So, the final number of marbles Bob will have is 26."
"First, let's understand the problem. Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees. He has two mugs of water. One mug is 33 degrees. The other mug is an unknown temperature, let's call it X degrees. Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle and 1 ounce from the other mug. After this, he can drink the water.

To find out the minimum temperature of the second mug, we need to ensure that after pouring, the water in the second mug is at least 40 degrees.

Let's assume the second mug has X degrees. After pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug, the temperature of the water in the second mug will be reduced by 1 degree (since 1 ounce is taken from it).

So, the temperature of the water left in the second mug will be X - 1 degrees. For Donny to be able to drink the water, this temperature must be at least 40 degrees. Therefore, we need to solve the inequality:

\[ X - 1 \geq 40 \]

Now, let's solve for X:

\[ X \geq 40 + 1 \]
\[ X \geq 41 \]

So, the second mug must be at least 41 degrees to allow Donny to drink the water. Let's confirm this by stating the final numerical answer:

The second bottle must be at least 41 degrees."
"First, let's calculate how many days are in three weeks:
- Three weeks = 3 * 7 = 21 days

Now, let's calculate how many cows Melanie's father gets from Milkie Cows Limited in 21 days:
- 20 cows per day * 21 days = 420 cows

Next, let's calculate how many chickens Melanie's father gets from Broilers Limited in 21 days:
- 10 chickens per day * 21 days = 210 chickens

Now, let's add the initial number of animals to the new animals brought in:
- Initial cows: 50
- Initial chickens: 20
- New cows: 420
- New chickens: 210

Total number of animals:
- Total cows = 50 + 420 = 470 cows
- Total chickens = 20 + 210 = 230 chickens

Total number of animals on the farm after three weeks:
- 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals

The final numerical answer is:
700"
"First, let's find out the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount. Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs will cost:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Since he gets a 10% discount on the 4 packs, the discount amount is:
\[ 40 \times 0.10 = 4 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \]

Now, let's find out how many bagels he gets in total. Each pack has 9 bagels, so 4 packs will have:
\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \]

To find out the cost per bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels:
\[ \frac{36}{36} = 1 \]

So, each single bagel will cost $1.00."
"First, let's find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. The question says Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops. So we calculate:

23 - 5 = 18 scoops

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are needed to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 1 less than 3 is:

3 - 1 = 2 scoops

The question also says it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 2 scoops. So we calculate:

6 - 3 = 3 potatoes

To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we need to know how many potatoes are needed for 1 scoop. Since 3 potatoes make 2 scoops, we can find out how many potatoes are needed for 1 scoop by dividing 3 by 2:

3 ÷ 2 = 1.5 potatoes per scoop

Now, to find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we multiply 1.5 by 18:

1.5 × 18 = 27 potatoes

So, Gomer ate 27 potatoes."
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days:
- Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days.
- So, the total eggs for the first 30 days = 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs.

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the next 30 days:
- Chester eats 5 eggs a day for 30 days.
- So, the total eggs for the next 30 days = 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.

Now, let's add the total eggs from both periods:
- Total eggs for 60 days = 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.

To find out how many dozens of eggs Chester needs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs):
- Total dozens of eggs = 240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens.

So, the final numerical answer is 20 dozens."
"First, let's find out how many red jelly beans there are. Since there are twice as many red jelly beans as green jelly beans, and there are 17 green jelly beans, we can calculate the number of red jelly beans as follows:

Number of red jelly beans = 2 * Number of green jelly beans
Number of red jelly beans = 2 * 17
Number of red jelly beans = 34

Now, we know there are 17 green jelly beans and 34 red jelly beans. To find out how many blue jelly beans there are, we subtract the number of green and red jelly beans from the total number of jelly beans:

Number of blue jelly beans = Total number of jelly beans - (Number of green jelly beans + Number of red jelly beans)
Number of blue jelly beans = 60 - (17 + 34)
Number of blue jelly beans = 60 - 51
Number of blue jelly beans = 9

So, there are 9 blue jelly beans."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Tim grows 5 trees.
2. Each year, he gets 6 lemons from each tree.
3. So, in one year, he gets \(5 \text{ trees} \times 6 \text{ lemons/tree} = 30 \text{ lemons}\).
4. A decade is 10 years.
5. So, in 10 years, he gets \(30 \text{ lemons/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 300 \text{ lemons}\).

The final numerical answer is 300."
"First, let's find out how many men and women are on the bus before any alight.

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, which means for every 5 men, there are 9 women. The total parts of the ratio are 5 + 9 = 14 parts.

If the total number of passengers is 84, we can divide this number by the total parts of the ratio to find out how many passengers each part represents:
\[ \text{Passengers per part} = \frac{84}{14} = 6 \]

Now, we can find out how many men and women are on the bus:
- Number of men = 5 parts = 5 * 6 = 30
- Number of women = 9 parts = 9 * 6 = 54

If 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:
\[ \text{Remaining women} = 54 - 20 = 34 \]

So, the number of women remaining on the bus is 34."
"First, let's find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold in one day from selling sunflowers individually. Since each sunflower costs $2, and he earned $26 from selling sunflowers, we can calculate the number of sunflowers sold in one day as follows:

\[ \text{Number of sunflowers sold in one day} = \frac{\text{Total earnings from sunflowers}}{\text{Price per sunflower}} = \frac{26}{2} = 13 \]

Next, let's find out how many sunflowers he sold in one day from selling bouquets. Since each bouquet costs $8 and he earned $56 from selling bouquets, we can calculate the number of bouquets sold in one day as follows:

\[ \text{Number of bouquets sold in one day} = \frac{\text{Total earnings from bouquets}}{\text{Price per bouquet}} = \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold from selling bouquets in one day is:

\[ \text{Number of sunflowers sold from bouquets in one day} = \text{Number of bouquets sold in one day} \times 12 = 7 \times 12 = 84 \]

Now, we add the number of sunflowers sold from selling individual sunflowers and from selling bouquets in one day to find the total number of sunflowers sold in one day:

\[ \text{Total number of sunflowers sold in one day} = \text{Number of sunflowers sold in one day} + \text{Number of sunflowers sold from bouquets in one day} = 13 + 84 = 97 \]

Finally, to find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we multiply the total number of sunflowers sold in one day by 3:

\[ \text{Total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days} = \text{Total number of sunflowers sold in one day} \times 3 = 97 \times 3 = 291 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 291."
"First, let's find out how many rocks Adam can buy with $100. Each rock costs $5.

So, Adam can buy $100 ÷ $5 = 20 rocks.

Now, if Adam sells 60% of his inventory, he sells 20 rocks × 60% = 12 rocks.

He sells each rock for $7, so from selling 12 rocks, he gets 12 × $7 = $84.

Adam initially had $100, and after selling the rocks, he has $84 left.

So, the money he loses is $100 - $84 = $16.

The final numerical answer is $16."
"To solve this, we need to calculate how many days it will take Lauren to draw all the scenes based on her daily drawing rates.

For large-sized scenes:
Lauren can draw 5 large-sized scenes per day.
She needs to draw 45 large-sized scenes.
So, the number of days to draw 45 large-sized scenes is \( \frac{45}{5} = 9 \) days.

For medium-sized scenes:
Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized scenes per day.
She needs to draw 36 medium-sized scenes.
So, the number of days to draw 36 medium-sized scenes is \( \frac{36}{6} = 6 \) days.

For small-sized scenes:
Lauren can draw 7 small-sized scenes per day.
She needs to draw 49 small-sized scenes.
So, the number of days to draw 49 small-sized scenes is \( \frac{49}{7} = 7 \) days.

Now, we add up the days for all the scenes:
9 days (large-sized) + 6 days (medium-sized) + 7 days (small-sized) = 22 days.

So, it will take Lauren 22 days to create all of the picture scenes."
"Chatty has prepared 3 dozen eggs. Since one dozen equals 12, three dozen eggs equal 3 x 12 = 36 eggs. She has four children, so each child will get 36 eggs divided by 4 children, which equals 9 eggs per child."
"May has 31 days.
Each fish needs $1 worth of food a day.
So, for 3 fish, it would be 3 * $1 = $3 a day.
For 31 days, it would be $3 * 31 = $93.
So, Jen spends $93 on food in the month of May."
"Patricia originally had 30 roses. She gave 24 roses to her mother, so she had:
30 - 24 = 6 roses left.
Then she bought 15 more roses, so now she has:
6 + 15 = 21 roses.

The final numerical answer is 21."
"To find the average speed, we need to add the distances together and divide by the total time.

Sid traveled 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles in total.

Sid traveled for 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours in total.

Now, we divide the total distance by the total time to find the average speed:

250 miles ÷ 5 hours = 50 miles per hour.

So, the average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour."
"First, let's understand the probabilities of each ticket winning.

For the first ticket, the probability of winning is 20%, which can be written as 0.20.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. So, if the first ticket has a 20% chance, the second ticket has a 60% chance of winning, which can be written as 0.60.

To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning:

0.20 * 0.60 = 0.12

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

0.12 * 100 = 12%

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"First, let's find out how many seashells each person collected.

Jim collected 27 seashells.

Carlos collected 5 less than Jim, so:
Carlos = Jim - 5
Carlos = 27 - 5
Carlos = 22 seashells.

Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, so:
Carrey = Carlos / 2
Carrey = 22 / 2
Carrey = 11 seashells.

Now, let's add up all the seashells they collected:
Total seashells = Jim + Carlos + Carrey
Total seashells = 27 + 22 + 11
Total seashells = 59

They divided the seashells equally, so each person gets:
Each person = Total seashells / 3
Each person = 59 / 3
Each person = 19.67

Since they can't split seashells into decimals, each person gets 19 seashells, and there will be 2 seashells left over."
"To find out how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to add up the carrots he eats on weekdays and the carrots he eats on Saturday and Sunday.

First, let's calculate the number of carrots he eats on weekdays. There are 5 weekdays in a week, and he eats 4 carrots each day on weekdays. So, we multiply 4 carrots by 5 days:
\[ 4 \text{ carrots/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ carrots} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of carrots he eats on Saturday and Sunday. He eats 5 carrots each day on these days, and there are 2 days in the weekend. So, we multiply 5 carrots by 2 days:
\[ 5 \text{ carrots/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ carrots} \]

Now, we add the carrots he eats on weekdays and the carrots he eats on the weekend to find the total number of carrots he eats in a week:
\[ 20 \text{ carrots} + 10 \text{ carrots} = 30 \text{ carrots} \]

So, the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week is 30."
"The first song is 5 minutes long.
The second song is 60% longer than the first song, so it's 5 * 0.60 = 3 minutes longer.
So the second song is 5 + 3 = 8 minutes long.
The total time for the cassette is 5 + 8 = 13 minutes.
The final numerical answer is 13."
"First, let's find out how much Linus sold each mobile device for. He sold it for twice the amount of the original price, which was $20. So, the selling price is:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the profit from selling one mobile device. The profit is the selling price minus the buying price:
\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many mobile devices Linus bought in total. He bought 2 devices last Monday and 4 devices last Tuesday, so the total number of devices is:
\[ 2 + 4 = 6 \text{ devices} \]

Since each device gives a profit of $20, the total profit from selling all 6 devices is:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 120 \]"
"First, let's find out how tall Ned is. Since Isabel is 7 feet tall and Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel, we subtract 2 from 7 to find Ned's height:
7 - 2 = 5 feet

Now we know Ned is 5 feet tall. Since Carl is one foot taller than Ned, we add 1 to Ned's height to find Carl's height:
5 + 1 = 6 feet

Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. So, we divide Carl's height by 2 to find the length of his cane:
6 / 2 = 3 feet

The final numerical answer is:
3"
"First, we need to find out how many bottles of juice are needed to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

Each person needs 20% of their daily energy demand covered by a bottle of juice. So, for 100% of the daily energy demand, we need 5 bottles per person (since 100% / 20% = 5).

For 2300 people, we need:
2300 people * 5 bottles/person = 11500 bottles

Now, we know that the company can produce 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles are needed, we subtract the daily production from the total bottles needed:

11500 bottles needed - 4200 bottles produced = 7300 bottles

So, Hortex would have to produce 7300 more bottles of juices to be able to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people."
"First, let's find out how many babies are dressed in purple and how many are dressed in blue.

Carla has 8 babies in total. She dresses 3/4 of them in purple:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \]
So, 6 babies are dressed in purple.

The remaining 1/4 of them are dressed in blue:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \]
So, 2 babies are dressed in blue.

Next, we need to find out how many of the babies wear bows. All the babies dressed in blue wear bows, so that's 2 babies. Also, 1/3 of the babies dressed in purple wear bows:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]
So, 2 more babies wear bows.

Now, we have a total of 2 babies wearing bows. Out of these, 2 are dressed in purple and 2 are dressed in blue. So, the total number of babies wearing bows is 4.

To find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of babies wearing bows and purple}}{\text{Total number of babies wearing bows}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2}{4} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is 50%."
"To find out how many reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and on Thursday and Friday, from the total reports received last week.

Total reports received last week = 5168
Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

So, the reports received on Wednesday = Total reports - (Reports on Monday and Tuesday + Reports on Thursday and Friday)

Let's do the math:

Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - (1907 + 2136)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043
Reports received on Wednesday = 1125

So, the final numerical answer is 1125."
"First, let's find out how much land Abraham sold in total. He owns 80 square meters of land.

1. He sold half of the land for $50. Half of 80 square meters is 40 square meters. So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.
2. After a month, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. 1/4 of 80 square meters is 20 square meters. So, he sold 20 square meters for $30.
3. The remaining land is the total land minus the land he has already sold. So, 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters are left.

Now, let's calculate the total money he earned from selling the land.

- From the first sale: $50
- From the second sale: $30
- From the remaining land: 20 square meters * $3 per square meter = $60

Now, let's add up all the money he earned:
$50 + $30 + $60 = $140

So, the total money Abraham will be able to earn after selling all his unused land is $140."
"First, we need to find half the age of Haley. Since Haley is 26 years old, half of that would be:

26 / 2 = 13

Now, we need to find 10 less than this number. So we subtract 10 from 13:

13 - 10 = 3

Therefore, Geb is 3 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
3"
Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days.
"First, let's find out how many eggs Cole hid. Since a dozen is 12, 3 dozen eggs is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Lamar found 5 eggs.

Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy found 5 * 2 = 10 eggs.

Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie found 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.

Mei found half as many as Charlie, so Mei found 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs that were found: 5 (Lamar) + 10 (Stacy) + 8 (Charlie) + 4 (Mei) = 27 eggs.

To find out how many eggs are still hidden, we subtract the total found eggs from the total hidden eggs: 36 (total hidden) - 27 (total found) = 9 eggs.

So, the final numerical answer is 9."
"First, let's find out how many apartments are in the third apartment complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so together they have:
200 + 200 = 400 apartments

The third complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined. To find out how many apartments that is, we calculate 60% of 400 and add it to 400:
60% of 400 = 0.60 * 400 = 240
So, the third complex has:
400 + 240 = 640 apartments

Now, let's find out the total number of apartments John collects garbage from in a week. He collects garbage from 3 complexes, and each complex has 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 apartments. He collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so:
1040 apartments * 3 collections/week = 3120 collections/week

John gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are:
3120 collections/week * $0.40/collection = $1248/week

The final numerical answer is $1248."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. A 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits.
2. A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the 5-year-old tree, so it produces 50 * 3 = 150 fruits.
3. A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the 5-year-old tree, so it produces 50 * 7 = 350 fruits.
4. An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the 5-year-old tree, so it produces 50 * 20 = 1000 fruits. Therefore, an 8-year-old tree produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.
5. A 9-year-old tree doesn't produce any fruit.
6. A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the 5-year-old tree, so it produces 50 * 20 = 1000 fruits.

Now, let's add up all the fruits produced by the tree over its 10 years:

50 (5-year-old) + 150 (6-year-old) + 350 (7-year-old) + 800 (8-year-old) + 0 (9-year-old) + 1000 (10-year-old) = 2350 fruits

So, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is 2350."
"Sophia gave Jack 1/5 of $100, which is $100 * 1/5 = $20.
So, Jack now has $100 + $20 = $120.
The final numerical answer is 120."
"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Let's say the length of the yellow rope is Y centimeters.
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the blue rope is Y - 7 centimeters.
3. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the red rope is 4 * (Y - 7) centimeters.
4. The total length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters.

Now, we can write an equation for the total length:

\[ Y + (Y - 7) + 4 \times (Y - 7) = 37 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]
\[ 6Y = 72 \]
\[ Y = 12 \]

So, the yellow rope is 12 centimeters long.

Now, we can find the length of the blue rope:

\[ \text{Blue rope} = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \text{ centimeters} \]

And the length of the red rope:

\[ \text{Red rope} = 4 \times (\text{Blue rope}) = 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ centimeters} \]

So, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters."
"First, let's find out how much money Rissa and Ronnie were given initially.

Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie. So if Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Next, let's say each of them gave the same amount of money, say \( x \), to their little sister. After giving \( x \) dollars each, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her money. So, we can write the equation for Rissa's remaining money as:
\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Let's solve for \( x \):
\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]
\[ 15 - x = 12 \]
\[ x = 15 - 12 \]
\[ x = 3 \]

So, each of them gave $3 to their little sister. Now, let's find out how much money Ronnie has left. Initially, Ronnie had $5, and he gave $3 to his little sister:
\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

Therefore, the amount left in Ronnie's money is:
\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's figure out how much of the mural is each color. We know that the mural is divided into four parts: red, white, purple, and yellow. Half the mural is yellow, so that means the other half is divided into three equal parts for red, white, and purple.

Since the mural is 12 pints in total, half of it is:
12 pints / 2 = 6 pints

This 6 pints is divided equally among red, white, and purple. So, each of these colors takes up:
6 pints / 3 = 2 pints

Therefore, the amount of red paint used is 2 pints."
"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. The area of one bedroom is 20 feet by 12 feet, so:

\[ 20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

\[ 4 \times 240 = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so:

\[ 5 \times 240 = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, to find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

\[ 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

So, the total area of the house is 3160 square feet."
"To solve this, let's count the puffs of clouds Alice sees each day and then add them up.

- Monday: 3 puffs
- Tuesday: Double of Monday, so 3 * 2 = 6 puffs
- Wednesday: Double of Tuesday, so 6 * 2 = 12 puffs
- Thursday: Double of Wednesday, so 12 * 2 = 24 puffs
- Friday: Double of Thursday, so 24 * 2 = 48 puffs

Now, let's add them all up:
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93

So, at the end of the week, Alice will have counted 93 clouds in the sky at lunch across all five days."
"First, we need to find out how many pods are in the new box. The new box has 20% more pods than the regular box. So, we calculate 20% of 100 pods:

20% of 100 = 0.20 * 100 = 20 pods

So, the new box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

The new box costs the same as the regular box, which is $12. We need to find out how many cycles we can run with $1 if we use 1 pod per cycle. To do this, we divide the cost of the new box by the cost per pod:

$12 / $1 per pod = 12 cycles

So, the final numerical answer is 12."
"First, let's find out how many 20 dollar bills Thomas originally had. Since he withdrew $1000 and each bill is $20, we divide $1000 by $20.

$1000 / $20 = 50 bills

Thomas loses 10 bills, so we subtract those from the original amount:

50 bills - 10 bills = 40 bills

Now, Thomas uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 bills is:

40 bills / 2 = 20 bills

So, he has 20 bills left.

After tripling his money, he has:

20 bills * $20 = $400

Now, he converts all his money to 5 dollar bills. To find out how many 5 dollar bills he has, we divide $400 by $5:

$400 / $5 = 80 bills

So, Thomas has 80 five dollar bills."
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. In the first half, team A scores 4 goals.
2. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A in the first half, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.
3. In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so team B scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals.
4. In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, so team A scores 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Now, let's calculate the total goals scored by each team:

- Team A scores 4 goals in the first half and 2 goals in the second half, so team A scores a total of 4 + 2 = 6 goals.
- Team B scores 2 goals in the first half and 8 goals in the second half, so team B scores a total of 2 + 8 = 10 goals.

Finally, to find the total number of goals scored in the match, we add the goals scored by both teams:

Total goals = Goals scored by team A + Goals scored by team B
Total goals = 6 + 10 = 16

So, the total number of goals scored in the match is 16."
"First, let's figure out how much chalk the teacher used on Monday. He used 45% of the chalk, and the chalk was 5 inches long at the start. So, we calculate 45% of 5 inches:

\[ 45\% \times 5 = 0.45 \times 5 = 2.25 \text{ inches} \]

This means the teacher used 2.25 inches of chalk on Monday. So, the chalk left is:

\[ 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \text{ inches} \]

The teacher likes to use only 20% of the chalk each day. So, we need to find out how many days the 2.75 inches of chalk will last if he uses 20% each day. We can find this by dividing the remaining chalk by the amount used each day:

\[ \frac{2.75}{0.20} = 13.75 \]

Since the teacher can't use a fraction of a day, we round up to the next whole number. So, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk after 14 days. 

The final numerical answer is:
14"
"First, let's find out how many girls are on varsity. One-third of the girls are on varsity, so:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ girls on varsity} \]

Next, let's find out how many boys are on varsity. One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ boys on varsity} \]

Now, let's find out how many girls are not on varsity. Since there are 12 girls in total and 4 are on varsity, the number of girls not on varsity is:
\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ girls not on varsity} \]

And the number of boys not on varsity is:
\[ 12 - 3 = 9 \text{ boys not on varsity} \]

To find the total number of students not on varsity, we add the number of girls not on varsity to the number of boys not on varsity:
\[ 8 + 9 = 17 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 17 \]"
"First, let's find out how many face masks Mike bought. Mike bought 5 face masks.

Now, let's calculate how many face masks Johnny bought. Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike. So we need to multiply the number of face masks Mike bought by 3 and then add 2.

Thrice as many as Mike bought is \(3 \times 5 = 15\).

Adding 2 more to that gives \(15 + 2 = 17\).

So, Johnny bought 17 face masks.

The final numerical answer is 17."
"First, let's find out how many teeth the dentist caps. The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, so if he drills 4 teeth, he caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.

Now, let's find out the total number of teeth the dentist fixes. He drills 4 teeth and caps 11 teeth, so he fixes 4 + 11 = 15 teeth.

To find out what percentage of James' teeth the dentist fixes, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the dentist fixes 50% of James' teeth."
"First, we need to find out how much milk Mr. Marcellus originally bought. He bought 4000 gallons at $3.5 per gallon.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 4000 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5/\text{gallon} \]

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$14000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much milk had passed the expiry date. He returned 2/5 of the milk.

\[ \text{Milk returned} = 4000 \text{ gallons} \times \frac{2}{5} \]

\[ \text{Milk returned} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we calculate the refund amount by multiplying the number of gallons returned by the cost per gallon.

\[ \text{Refund amount} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5/\text{gallon} \]

\[ \text{Refund amount} = \$5600 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$5600 \]"
"Let's break this down step by step.

First, let's say Colin's current age is \( C \) and Wendy's current age is \( W \).

From the first part of the question, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. So, we can write this as:
\[ W = 5 \times (C + 7) \]

From the second part of the question, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. So, we can write this as:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} W \]

Now, we have two equations:
1. \( W = 5 \times (C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} W \)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( C \). First, let's express \( W \) from the first equation:
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Now, substitute \( W = 5C + 35 \) into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} (5C + 35) \]

To clear the fraction, multiply every term by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Now, let's solve for \( C \):
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old. Let's check the answer by finding Wendy's current age:
\[ W = 5 \times (20 + 7) = 5 \times 27 = 135 \]

Now, let's check the second condition:
In 25 years, Colin will be \( 20 + 25 = 45 \) years old.
Wendy is currently 135 years old, so in 25 years, Wendy will be \( 135 + 25 = 160 \) years old.
\[ 45 = \frac{1}{3} \times 135 \]
\[ 45 = 45 \]

Both conditions are satisfied, so Colin's current age is indeed 20 years old."
"First, we need to find out how many books Bob can buy with $27000. If he can buy 100 books for $500, then we can calculate how many sets of 100 books he can buy with $27000.

To find out how many sets of 100 books he can buy:
\[ \frac{27000}{500} = 54 \]

So, he can buy 54 sets of 100 books. Now, to find out how many books he can buy in total:
\[ 54 \times 100 = 5400 \]

Bob has $27000 to buy books, and he can buy 5400 books in total. Since he wants to distribute this amount between 3 schools, we need to divide the total number of books by 3:
\[ \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \]

So, Bob can buy 1800 books per school."
"First, let's count the apples Newton had at each step:

1. Two apples fell out of the tree and one landed on his head. So, he had 1 apple on his head.
2. He picked up the two apples and put one in his pocket. Now he has 1 apple on his head and 1 apple in his pocket.
3. He threw the other apple at the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall. Now he has 1 apple on his head, 1 apple in his pocket, and 5 more apples that fell.
4. He picked up these 5 apples and put all but one in his pocket. So, he put 4 apples in his pocket and has 1 apple left.
5. He threw the remaining apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall. Now he has 1 apple on his head, 4 apples in his pocket, and 6 more apples that fell.

So, in total, Newton brought home 1 (on his head) + 4 (in his pocket) + 6 (that fell) = 11 apples."
"First, we need to find out how many bags of coal Ali ordered. Since each bag is 50 kg and he ordered 850 kg, we divide 850 by 50 to find the number of bags.

850 kg ÷ 50 kg/bag = 17 bags

Now, we know each bag costs $18. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag.

17 bags × $18/bag = $306

So, the total cost of Ali's order is $306."
"First, let's find out how many cheese pizza slices all of Kate's friends eat together. Since each of her 6 friends eats 6 slices, we multiply 6 by 6:

6 friends * 6 slices per friend = 36 slices

Now, let's find out how many pepperoni pizza slices all of Kate's friends eat together. Since each of her 6 friends eats 4 slices, we multiply 6 by 4:

6 friends * 4 slices per friend = 24 slices

Now we need to find out how many whole cheese pizzas Kate needs to buy. Since each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, we divide the total number of cheese slices by the number of slices per pizza:

36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas

Next, we need to find out how many whole pepperoni pizzas Kate needs to buy. Since each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we divide the total number of pepperoni slices by the number of slices per pizza:

24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas

So, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas. The total number of pizzas she needs to buy is:

3 cheese pizzas + 3 pepperoni pizzas = 6 pizzas

The final numerical answer is 6."
"Sam ran 3 miles on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. That's 3 * 3 = 9 miles.
On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles. That's 5 * 2 = 10 miles.
So, the total miles Sam ran this week is 9 + 10 = 19 miles."
"First, we need to figure out how many snowballs Jay can make before some melt. He can make 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 melt every 15 minutes. So, in 15 minutes, 2 snowballs melt. This means in 1 hour (which is 4 times 15 minutes), 8 snowballs melt (because 4 times 2 is 8).

So, in an hour, Jay actually makes 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs.

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take for Jay to make 60 snowballs. If he makes 12 snowballs in an hour, then to make 60 snowballs, he needs 60 / 12 = 5 hours.

So, the final answer is 5 hours."
"If John is 28 years old now and he is twice as old as Jim, then Jim is half the age of John.

So, Jim's age = John's age / 2
Jim's age = 28 / 2
Jim's age = 14

The final numerical answer is 14."
"Doxa ate 1 slice.
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

To find out how many slices they all ate together, we add up the slices each person ate:
1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

So, the final numerical answer is 6."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, at the end of the first day, they had:
   38 (used) + 50 (ordered) = 88 bandages.

2. On the second day, they used ten fewer bandages than the first day, so they used:
   38 - 10 = 28 bandages.
   At the end of the second day, they had:
   88 (from the first day) - 28 (used) = 60 bandages.

3. On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered:
   2 * 50 = 100 bandages.
   They used half a pack, which is:
   50 / 2 = 25 bandages.
   At the end of the third day, they had:
   60 (from the end of the second day) + 100 (ordered) - 25 (used) = 135 bandages.

4. They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, but we calculated 135 bandages. This means they must have had 78 + 57 = 135 bandages at the start of the third day.

5. To find out how many bandages they started with on the first day, we need to go back to the end of the second day. They had 60 bandages at the end of the second day, and they ordered 100 bandages on the third day but only used 25, so they must have had:
   60 (from the end of the second day) + 100 (ordered) - 25 (used) = 135 bandages at the start of the third day.

6. Since they had 135 bandages at the start of the third day, and they ordered 50 bandages on the first day, they must have started with:
   135 - 50 = 85 bandages on the first day.

So, the final numerical answer is 85."
"First, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut. May's hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches, so her hair was cut by 2 inches. The cost for the haircut is $30 per inch, so the cost for the haircut is 2 * $30 = $60.

Next, we add the cost of the color, which is $40.

So, the total cost is $60 (for the haircut) + $40 (for the color) = $100.

The final numerical answer is 100."
"First, let's calculate how many hours Jen works in a week:
Jen works 7.5 hours a day and she works 6 days a week.
So, 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week = 45 hours/week

Now, let's calculate how many hours Jen works in April:
There are 4 weeks in April, so 45 hours/week * 4 weeks = 180 hours in April

Jen's hourly rate is $1.5, so her pay for the hours worked in April is:
180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270

Since Jen did not have any absences for April, she gets an additional $10 for complete attendance.
So, her total pay for April is:
$270 + $10 = $280

The final numerical answer is:
280"
"First, let's calculate how much Jason earned for each task:

- For doing laundry: $3.00
- For cleaning his room: $1.50
- For taking the trash out: $0.75
- For emptying the dishwasher: $0.50

Now, let's calculate how much he earned in a two week period:

- Jason emptied the dishwasher 6 times, so he earned 6 * $0.50 = $3.00
- He did his laundry once, so he earned 1 * $3.00 = $3.00
- He took the trash out twice, so he earned 2 * $0.75 = $1.50
- He cleaned his room once, so he earned 1 * $1.50 = $1.50

Now, let's add all the earnings together:

$3.00 (laundry) + $1.50 (room) + $1.50 (trash) + $3.00 (dishwasher) + $1.50 (room) = $9.50

So, Jason earned $9.50 in a two week period."
"First, we need to find out how much blood one shark has. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons of blood, we can calculate the blood volume of one shark as follows:

\[ \text{Blood volume of one shark} = 3 \times 40 \text{ gallons} = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have together. We do this by multiplying the blood volume of one shark by ten:

\[ \text{Total blood volume of ten sharks} = 120 \text{ gallons/shark} \times 10 \text{ sharks} = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks have is:

\[ 1200 \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

- In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
- At 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant.
- After that, twice the number of people who came at 10:00 came in.
- By evening, 3 times as many people as the first group (morning group) came in.

Let's calculate the number of people who came in at 10:00, which is 40.

Twice the number of people who came at 10:00 is:
\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

By evening, 3 times as many people as the first group (morning group) came in. The first group is 50 people, so:
\[ 3 \times 50 = 150 \]

Now, let's add up all the people who entered the restaurant:
- Morning: 50 people
- At 10:00: 40 people
- Twice the number at 10:00: 80 people
- By evening: 150 people

Total number of people:
\[ 50 + 40 + 80 + 150 = 320 \]

So, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 320."
"Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, so that's 5 * 5 = 25 red pens.
She bought twice the amount of black pens, so she bought 5 * 2 = 10 packs of black pens.
Each pack has 5 pens, so she bought 10 * 5 = 50 black pens.
Alain has 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens in total.
The final numerical answer is 75."
"First, let's find out how much each bottle of scotch costs. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for $600, so each bottle of scotch costs:
\[ \text{Cost per scotch bottle} = \frac{\$600}{10 \text{ bottles}} = \$60 \text{ per bottle} \]

Now, let's find out how much each bottle of cognac costs. The cognac costs 50% more per bottle than the scotch, so:
\[ \text{Cost per cognac bottle} = \$60 + (\$60 \times 0.50) = \$60 + \$30 = \$90 \text{ per bottle} \]

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the cognac:
\[ \text{Total cost for cognac} = 20 \text{ bottles} \times \$90 \text{ per bottle} = \$1800 \]

Finally, let's add the cost of the scotch and the cognac to find the total amount John spends:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$600 + \$1800 = \$2400 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$2400 \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees on the first day.
- He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees on the first day. So, he planted \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees on the first day.
- On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees than he did on the first day. So, he planted \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees on the second day.
- On the second day, he planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he planted on the first day. So, he planted \(40 + \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees planted over the two days:

- Total White Oak trees planted: \(20 + 30 = 50\)
- Total Lodgepole Pine trees planted: \(40 + 50 = 90\)

So, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is \(50 + 90 = 140\).

The final numerical answer is 140."
"First, let's calculate how much root beer Fred had at the start:

Fred made 24 gallons on the first day.

Then his children drank 4 gallons, so:
24 gallons - 4 gallons = 20 gallons left.

Fred's wife spilled 7 gallons, so:
20 gallons - 7 gallons = 13 gallons left.

Fred's friend Ronnie drank 5 gallons, so:
13 gallons - 5 gallons = 8 gallons left.

On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party, and the remaining root beer was shared equally among them. So, we divide the 8 gallons by 3:

8 gallons ÷ 3 = 2 gallons and 2/3 gallons.

So, the final numerical answer is 2 and 2/3 gallons."
"Let's break this down step by step:

Four times the number of coffee mugs is 40 - 8.
So, four times the number of coffee mugs is 32.

32 divided by 4 is 8.

So, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge.

The final numerical answer is 8."
"First, let's find out how many fish have red stripes. One-third of the fish have red stripes, so:

\( \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \) fish have red stripes.

Now, we need to find out how many fish are left after the red-striped fish are taken out. That would be:

\( 66 - 22 = 44 \) fish are left.

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining fish have blue stripes. 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes, so:

\( \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20 \) fish have blue stripes.

To find out how many fish have both red and blue stripes, we need to know if any fish have both colors. However, the question does not provide information about fish having both red and blue stripes. Assuming no fish have both, the total number of fish with red or blue stripes is the sum of the red-striped and blue-striped fish:

\( 22 + 20 = 42 \) fish have either red or blue stripes.

So, the final numerical answer is 42."
"Amy originally had:
- Two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each, so 2 * 4 = 8 colors.
- Three makeup sets with six colors each, so 3 * 6 = 18 colors.

Her sister steals one of the palettes, so now Amy has:
- 1 palette with 4 colors.
- 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so 3 * 6 = 18 colors.

Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, so she uses up 6 / 2 = 3 colors from one set.

Now, the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is:
- From the palette: 4 colors.
- From the makeup sets: 18 colors - 3 colors used = 15 colors.

So, the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is 4 + 15 = 19 colors."
"First, let's find out how tall Mattison's house is. Since his house is 7 times as high as he is, and he is 60 inches tall, we multiply 60 by 7:

\[ 60 \times 7 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to find out how high the first floor is. Since the first floor is 3 times as high as Mattison himself, we multiply 60 by 3:

\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Now, to find out how high the second floor is from the ground, we subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the house:

\[ 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

So, the roof of the second floor is 240 inches from the ground."
"First, let's find out how many shells team Alphas found. They found 40% of 700 shells.

40% of 700 is calculated as:
\[ 0.40 \times 700 = 280 \]

So, team Alphas found 280 shells. Now, let's find out how many shells are left after team Alphas found theirs.

\[ 700 - 280 = 420 \]

Team The finders found 60% of the remaining shells. So, we calculate 60% of 420.

60% of 420 is calculated as:
\[ 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \]

So, team The finders found 252 shells. Now, we can find out how many shells team Gogetters found by subtracting the shells found by Alphas and The finders from the total.

\[ 700 - 280 - 252 = 168 \]

Therefore, team Gogetters found 168 shells."
"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we first need to add up the miles the other dogs need to walk and then subtract that from the total average miles per day.

The first dog needs to walk 1 mile.
The second dog needs to walk 4 miles.
The third dog needs to walk 3 miles.

So, the total miles for the first three dogs is:
1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles

The average miles per day for all four dogs is 3 miles.

If we add up the miles for all four dogs, it should equal 4 dogs * 3 miles/dog = 12 miles.

So, the last dog needs to walk:
12 miles (total for all dogs) - 8 miles (total for the first three dogs) = 4 miles

The last dog needs to walk 4 miles."
"First, let's find out how much loan John got. His house is worth $250,000 and he got a loan worth 40% of that.

40% of $250,000 = 0.40 * $250,000 = $100,000

So, John got a loan of $100,000.

Next, let's find out how much he used to pay off his debts. He used 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts.

60% of $100,000 = 0.60 * $100,000 = $60,000

So, John used $60,000 to pay off his debts.

To find out how much money he had leftover, we subtract the amount he used to pay off his debts from the loan amount.

$100,000 (loan amount) - $60,000 (amount used to pay off debts) = $40,000

So, the final numerical answer is $40,000."
"First, we need to find the total weight of the tunas Deandre caught. We do this by adding the weights of the tunas together:

56 kg + 46 kg + 26 kg = 128 kg

Now, we know that a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50. To find out how much Deandre will earn, we multiply the total weight of the tunas by the cost per kilogram:

128 kg * $0.50/kg = $64

So, the final numerical answer is $64."
"First, let's find out how much Trinity sold each magazine for. She sold them at 11/8 of the price she bought them. So, we calculate:

\( \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72 \)

Now, let's do the multiplication:

\( \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11 \times 72}{8} \)

\( \text{Selling Price} = \frac{792}{8} \)

\( \text{Selling Price} = 99 \)

So, she sold each magazine for $99.

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the cost price from the selling price:

\( \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price} \)

\( \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 \)

\( \text{Profit} = 27 \)

So, Trinity's profit is $27."
"First, let's calculate how much water the dehumidifier removes each day at each speed:

- Low setting: 1 liter per day
- Medium setting: 2 times the low setting = 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day
- High setting: 2 times the medium setting = 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water removed for each setting:

- For the low setting, Brian ran it for 3 days: 3 days * 1 liter/day = 3 liters
- For the medium setting, Brian ran it for 3 days: 3 days * 2 liters/day = 6 liters
- For the high setting, Brian ran it for 5 days: 5 days * 4 liters/day = 20 liters

Now, let's add up all the liters of water removed:

3 liters (low setting) + 6 liters (medium setting) + 20 liters (high setting) = 29 liters

So, the total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in his basement is 29 liters."
"First, we need to find out how many balloons Jolene and her friends started with. They filled 10 packs of balloons, and each pack had 30 balloons. So, we multiply the number of packs by the number of balloons per pack:

10 packs * 30 balloons/pack = 300 balloons

By the end of the afternoon, 12 balloons were left. To find out how many balloons they threw, we subtract the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons they started with:

300 balloons - 12 balloons = 288 balloons

So, the final numerical answer is 288."
"First, we need to find out how much medicine is in one dose. For one dose, Saanvi combined 14 mL of the first medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine. So, the amount of the second medicine is:

\[ 3 \times 14 = 42 \text{ mL} \]

Now, we add the amounts of both medicines to find the total amount in one dose:

\[ 14 \text{ mL} + 42 \text{ mL} = 56 \text{ mL} \]

Next, we need to find out how much medicine is in 8 doses. We multiply the amount of medicine in one dose by 8:

\[ 56 \text{ mL} \times 8 = 448 \text{ mL} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 448 \]"
"First, we need to find out how many students are in each of Ali's and John's classes.

Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students.

John's class has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class. So, we calculate:
\[ \text{John's class capacity} = \frac{120}{8} = 15 \text{ students} \]

John has two classes, so the total capacity for John's school is:
\[ \text{John's school capacity} = 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ students} \]

Now, we add the capacities of both schools to find the combined capacity:
\[ \text{Combined capacity} = \text{Ali's school capacity} + \text{John's school capacity} = 120 + 30 = 150 \]

So, the combined capacity of both schools is 150 students."
"First, let's find out how much Stephen will pay back to his sister including the 2% interest.

The interest is 2% of $300, which is:
\[ 2\% \times 300 = \frac{2}{100} \times 300 = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen will pay back is:
\[ 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Now, Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months. The total amount he will pay in 11 months is:
\[ 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we subtract the amount he has already paid in 11 months from the total amount he owes:
\[ 306 - 275 = 31 \]

So, Stephen will pay $31 in the twelfth month."
"Each child needs 5 diaper changes per day, so for 2 children, it would be:
5 diaper changes/child/day * 2 children = 10 diaper changes per day.

Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, so she changes:
10 diaper changes per day / 2 = 5 diaper changes per day.

Therefore, Jordan changes the other half, which is:
10 diaper changes per day - 5 diaper changes per day = 5 diaper changes per day.

So, the final numerical answer is 5."
"First, let's find out how many jelly beans can fit in the jar. The jar is a square base and is 6 inches by 6 inches and 15 inches tall. So, the volume of the jar is:

\[ 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, the effective volume of jelly beans that can fit is:

\[ 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Each jelly bean takes up 0.15 cubic inches, so the number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar is:

\[ \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880 \text{ jelly beans} \]

Now, we know that 30% of these jelly beans are red. So, the number of red jelly beans is:

\[ 2880 \times 0.30 = 864 \text{ red jelly beans} \]

The true number of red jelly beans is given as 900. So, the difference between Tim's guess and the true number of red jelly beans is:

\[ 900 - 864 = 36 \]

Tim was 36 jelly beans off his guess."
"First, let's calculate the number of people on the bus after each stop.

1. Initially, the bus had 20 people.
2. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the number of people on the bus is:
   \[
   20 + 40 = 60
   \]
3. At the second stop, 3/4 of the 40 people who entered at the first stop entered the bus. So, the number of people who entered at the second stop is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30
   \]
   Adding these to the bus, the number of people on the bus is:
   \[
   60 + 30 = 90
   \]
4. At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the number of people on the bus is:
   \[
   90 \times 2 = 180
   \]

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. The number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is:
\[
200 - 180 = 20
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
20
\]"
"First, let's find out how much Pauline spent in the first 5 years.

Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, so in one year she spends:
\[ 3 \text{ visits/year} \times \$2/\text{visit} = \$6/\text{year} \]

For 5 years, she spends:
\[ 5 \text{ years} \times \$6/\text{year} = \$30 \]

Next, we need to find out the new cost of one visit after 5 years. The cost increased by 150%, so the new cost is:
\[ \$2 + (150\% \times \$2) = \$2 + \$3 = \$5/\text{visit} \]

For the next 3 years, Pauline continues to visit the museum 3 times a year, so she spends:
\[ 3 \text{ visits/year} \times \$5/\text{visit} = \$15/\text{year} \]

For 3 years, she spends:
\[ 3 \text{ years} \times \$15/\text{year} = \$45 \]

Now, we add the total amount spent over the 8 years:
\[ \$30 + \$45 = \$75 \]

So, the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is:
\[ \$75 \]"
"First, we need to find out how many students are in Cedar Falls Middle School. There are 10 students in each of the 3 grades (4th, 5th, and 7th), so we add them up:

10 students in grade 4 + 10 students in grade 5 + 10 students in grade 7 = 30 students

Now, we know that only 8 students can try the escape room at a time. To find out how many groups of 8 students we can make from 30 students, we divide:

30 students ÷ 8 students per group = 3.75 groups

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we can only have 3 full groups of 8 students each. This means 24 students will get to try the escape room.

Now, we need to find out how long it will take for these 3 groups to try the escape room. Since each group takes 45 minutes, we multiply the number of groups by the time each group takes:

3 groups × 45 minutes per group = 135 minutes

So, it will take 135 minutes for everyone to try the escape room."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the wooden tables. John made 4 wooden tables and each table costs $20. So, the cost for the tables is:
4 tables * $20/table = $80

Next, let's calculate the cost of the roof frames. John made 2 roof frames and each frame costs $10. So, the cost for the frames is:
2 frames * $10/frame = $20

Now, let's add the cost of the tables and the frames to find out the total amount Ali has to pay:
$80 (tables) + $20 (frames) = $100

So, Ali has to pay John $100."
"Let's call the length of the shorter piece x feet. Then the longer piece is 4x feet. The total length of the board is the sum of the shorter and longer pieces, which is x + 4x = 5x. We know the total length is 40 feet, so:

5x = 40

To find x, we divide both sides by 5:

x = 40 / 5
x = 8

So the shorter piece is 8 feet long. The longer piece is 4 times the shorter piece, so:

4 * 8 = 32

The longer piece is 32 feet long."
"First, we need to find out how many pounds of meat Aiden needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound:

80 meatballs ÷ 16 meatballs/pound = 5 pounds of meat

Now, we know that for every pound of meat, Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of his secret seasoning. So, for 5 pounds of meat, he will need:

5 pounds × 2 tablespoons/pound = 10 tablespoons of seasoning

So, the final numerical answer is 10 tablespoons."
"First, we need to find the total width of all the windows. Since there are five windows and each window is 35 inches wide, we multiply 35 by 5.

35 inches/window * 5 windows = 175 inches

Now, Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows. So we multiply the total width by 2.

175 inches * 2 = 350 inches

So, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."
"To solve this, we need to break the call into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining minutes after that.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute. So, the cost for the first 16 minutes is:
16 minutes * $0.25/minute = $4.00

After 16 minutes, the price drops to $0.2 per minute. We need to calculate the cost for the remaining minutes, which is 36 minutes - 16 minutes = 20 minutes. So, the cost for the remaining 20 minutes is:
20 minutes * $0.2/minute = $4.00

Now, we add the cost of the first 16 minutes and the cost of the remaining 20 minutes to get the total cost:
$4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00

So, the total cost for a 36-minute call is $8.00."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Monday's rain is 2 inches.
2. Twice of Monday's rain is 2 * 2 = 4 inches.
3. On Tuesday, it is expected to rain 1 more inch than twice of Monday's total, so it will rain 4 + 1 = 5 inches.

Therefore, the number of inches of rain on Tuesday is 5 inches."
"First, let's find out how many treats in total Carly needs to make. Since there are 5 people in her class and each person gets 2 treats, we multiply 5 by 2:

5 * 2 = 10 treats

Now, let's assume Carly made x cupcakes. According to the problem, she makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. So, the number of brownies she makes is 3x - 2.

The total number of treats (cupcakes and brownies) is the sum of cupcakes and brownies:

x + (3x - 2) = 10

Now, let's solve this equation to find x:

x + 3x - 2 = 10
4x - 2 = 10
4x = 10 + 2
4x = 12
x = 12 / 4
x = 3

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"First, let's find out the cost of a basic manicure and a pedicure without any discount:
- Basic manicure: $35
- Pedicure: $40

Now, let's add these two costs together:
- Total cost without discount = $35 + $40 = $75

Next, we need to calculate the discount. The salon offers 20% off for getting both services:
- Discount amount = 20% of $75 = 0.20 * $75 = $15

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost:
- Total cost with discount = $75 - $15 = $60

Karen also wants to add nail art on each of her fingers. There are 10 fingers in total (2 fingers per hand and 5 hands):
- Cost of nail art = $3 per nail * 10 nails = $30

Finally, let's add the cost of the nail art to the total cost with the discount:
- Total cost including nail art = $60 + $30 = $90

So, Karen would pay $90 in all."
"First, let's calculate the total number of magazines Susan gets from each source:

1. For the 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year:
   \(3 \times 12 = 36\) issues

2. For the 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year:
   \(1 \times 6 = 6\) issues

3. For the last magazine that sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine:
   \(4 \times 6 = 24\) issues

Now, let's add up all the magazines:
\(36 + 6 + 24 = 66\)

So, the total number of magazines Susan gets every year is 66."
"First, we need to find out how many paintings Shelley has. Since Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, we can find out how many paintings Shelley has by adding 12 to the number of paintings Samantha has.

Samantha has 27 paintings.
So, Shelley has 27 + 12 = 39 paintings.

Next, we need to find out how many paintings Kim has. We know that Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. So, we can find out how many paintings Kim has by subtracting 8 from the number of paintings Shelley has.

Shelley has 39 paintings.
So, Kim has 39 - 8 = 31 paintings.

The final answer is 31."
"First, let's find out how much the price increased in December. If the price increased by 80%, we calculate 80% of $40:

\( 80\% \times 40 = 0.80 \times 40 = 32 \)

So, the price in December became:

\( 40 + 32 = 72 \)

Now, in January, the price decreased by 50%. To find out the price after a 50% decrease, we calculate 50% of $72:

\( 50\% \times 72 = 0.50 \times 72 = 36 \)

So, the price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"First, let's calculate the standard fee for a lesson:
- Standard fee per hour = $80

Now, let's calculate the reduced fee for a lesson to a veteran:
- Reduced fee = Standard fee * (1 - 25%)
- Reduced fee = $80 * (1 - 0.25)
- Reduced fee = $80 * 0.75
- Reduced fee = $60

Now, let's calculate the total money made from the standard lessons:
- Number of standard lessons = 4
- Total money from standard lessons = Number of standard lessons * Standard fee
- Total money from standard lessons = 4 * $80
- Total money from standard lessons = $320

Next, let's calculate the total money made from the veteran lessons:
- Number of veteran lessons = 2
- Total money from veteran lessons = Number of veteran lessons * Reduced fee
- Total money from veteran lessons = 2 * $60
- Total money from veteran lessons = $120

Finally, let's calculate the total money made for the day:
- Total money for the day = Total money from standard lessons + Total money from veteran lessons
- Total money for the day = $320 + $120
- Total money for the day = $440

So, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is $440."
"To find Sally's mean score, we need to add all her scores together and then divide by the number of quizzes she took.

First, let's add all the scores:
50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 = 650

Now, we count the number of quizzes, which is 9.

To find the mean, we divide the total score by the number of quizzes:
650 ÷ 9 = 72.22222222222222

Rounded to two decimal places, the mean score is 72.22."
"Eve originally had 20 pomelos. After giving some away, she was left with 1/4 of 20 pomelos.

To find out how many pomelos Eve has left:
1/4 of 20 = 20 * (1/4) = 5 pomelos

Eve originally had 20 pomelos and now has 5 pomelos left. To find out how many she gave away, subtract the number she has left from the original number:
20 - 5 = 15 pomelos

So, Eve gave away 15 pomelos."
"First, let's find out how many apples Walter ate. He ate 2/5 of 60 apples, so:

\( \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \) apples

Now, let's find out how many apples are left after he ate 24:

\( 60 - 24 = 36 \) apples

Next, Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. So, we calculate 25% of 36:

\( 25\% \times 36 = \frac{25}{100} \times 36 = 0.25 \times 36 = 9 \) apples

Now, let's find out how many apples are left after giving 9 to his sister:

\( 36 - 9 = 27 \) apples

Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. So, the total money he received is:

\( 27 \times 3 = 81 \) dollars

So, the final numerical answer is 81 dollars."
"If 9 novels is 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year, then one quarter of the number of novels she has written this year is 9 / 3 = 3 novels.

Since one quarter is 3 novels, the whole year (which is four quarters) would be 3 * 4 = 12 novels.

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year."
"First, we need to find out how many hours Michael travels in 3 days. There are 24 hours in a day, so in 3 days, he travels for 3 * 24 = 72 hours.

Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr, so in 72 hours, he travels 50 * 72 = 3600 km.

The distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. To find out what percentage of this distance Michael has covered, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{\text{Distance covered}}{\text{Total distance}} \right) \times 100 \]

So, Michael has covered:

\[ \left( \frac{3600}{6000} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

The final numerical answer is 60."
"First, let's find out how many grapes Madeline's brother used. Since he used up 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, and Madeline ate 6 grapes, we calculate:
\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ grapes} \]

Now, let's add the grapes Madeline ate to the grapes her brother used:
\[ 6 + 30 = 36 \text{ grapes} \]

Their mother then used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. Since each pie recipe calls for 12 grapes, we calculate the total number of grapes used for the pies:
\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ grapes} \]

However, we only have 36 grapes left after Madeline and her brother used theirs. This means there were not enough grapes for the pies as per the recipe. But if we assume the question is asking based on the grapes they had initially, we can conclude that the initial number of grapes was:
\[ 36 \text{ grapes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 36 \]"
"First, we need to find out how many teachers were not sick. If 13 out of 82 teachers were sick, then the number of teachers who were not sick is:

82 - 13 = 69

Now, we add the substitute teachers to the number of teachers who were not sick to find out the total number of teachers at school that day:

69 + 9 = 78

So, the final numerical answer is 78."
"First, let's find out how much Bud spends on cheese each time he makes macaroni and cheese.

He spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese and twice that amount on gruyere cheese. So, he spends:
\[ 2 \times 3.00 = 6.00 \text{ dollars on gruyere cheese} \]

Adding the cost of cheddar cheese and gruyere cheese together:
\[ 3.00 + 6.00 = 9.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we know that Bud spends $9.00 each time he makes macaroni and cheese. Since he makes it once a week, we need to find out how much he spends in a year.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so:
\[ 9.00 \times 52 = 468.00 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 468.00 \]"
"First, we need to find out how many minutes the custodian spends cleaning all the classrooms. Since there are 80 classrooms and it takes 15 minutes per classroom, we multiply 80 by 15:

80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes

Next, we need to find out how many minutes are in an 8 hour day. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 8 by 60:

8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes

Now, we need to find out what percentage of the 480 minutes is spent cleaning. We do this by dividing the total cleaning time (1200 minutes) by the total minutes in an 8 hour day (480 minutes) and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage:

(1200 minutes / 480 minutes) * 100 = 2500%

This means the custodian spends 2500% of their day cleaning classrooms. However, this percentage is not possible in reality because a day only has 100% of its time. This indicates that the custodian is spending more than one day cleaning the classrooms, which is not realistic in this context."
"First, let's find out how many books each shelf can hold:

- Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 10 * 2 = 20 books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's add up the total number of books each shelf can hold:

- Middle shelves: 10 books + 10 books = 20 books
- Bottom shelf: 20 books
- Top shelf: 15 books

Total books the shelves can hold = 20 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the total number of books the shelves can hold:

110 books ÷ 55 books per bookcase = 2 bookcases.

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books."
"First, let's find out how many eggs Rose bought. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens will be:

5 dozens * 12 eggs/dozen = 60 eggs

Now, let's calculate how much Rose spent on the eggs. Since the eggs cost $2.40 per dozen and she bought five dozens:

5 dozens * $2.40/dozen = $12.00

Next, we need to find out how much Rose will sell the eggs for. She sells them at $1 for 3 eggs. So, for 60 eggs:

60 eggs / 3 eggs per dollar = 20 dollars

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the cost from the selling price:

$20.00 (selling price) - $12.00 (cost) = $8.00

So, Rose's profit will be $8.00."
"First, we need to find out how many red hats Skyler has. Since half of the hats are red, we can calculate this as:

\[ \text{Number of red hats} = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50 \]

Now, we subtract the number of red hats from the total number of hats to find out how many hats are left:

\[ \text{Remaining hats} = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining hats are blue. Since 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue, we calculate this as:

\[ \text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Now, we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats to find out how many hats are white:

\[ \text{Number of white hats} = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

So, the number of white hats Skyler has is 20."
"First, let's find out how many sticks of beef jerky are in one bag. Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we have 30 sticks.

Next, we need to find out the price of one stick of beef jerky. Normally, a bag costs $18.00, but it's $3.00 off, so Archie will pay $15.00 for the bag.

Now, we need to convert the total cost from dollars to cents. Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, $15.00 is equal to 1500 cents.

To find out how much each stick costs, we divide the total cost in cents by the number of sticks:
1500 cents ÷ 30 sticks = 50 cents per stick.

So, the final numerical answer in cents is:
50"
"First, let's find out how many questions Audrey got right on the first test.

The first test has 70 questions and she got 60% of them correct. So, we calculate:
\[ 70 \times \frac{60}{100} = 70 \times 0.60 = 42 \]
So, Audrey got 42 questions right on the first test.

To pass to 7th grade, she needs to get 70% of the total questions right. The total number of questions in both tests is:
\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]
So, she needs to get 70% of 110 questions right:
\[ 110 \times \frac{70}{100} = 110 \times 0.70 = 77 \]
Therefore, she needs to get 77 questions right in total to pass.

Since she already got 42 questions right on the first test, the number of questions she needs to get right on the second test is:
\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]
So, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade."
"First, let's break down the problem into simpler steps:

1. Let's say the number of strawberry cubes Mary makes is \( S \).
2. The number of blueberry cubes she makes is \( 5S - 4 \).
3. The total number of ice cubes is the sum of strawberry and blueberry cubes, which is \( S + (5S - 4) \).
4. We know the total number of ice cubes is 116.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:

1. Combine like terms:
\[ S + 5S - 4 = 116 \]
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

2. Add 4 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( S \):
\[ 6S - 4 + 4 = 116 + 4 \]
\[ 6S = 120 \]

3. Divide both sides by 6 to solve for \( S \):
\[ S = \frac{120}{6} \]
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes. Now, we need to find out how many blueberry cubes she makes:

\[ 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 \]
\[ 100 - 4 = 96 \]

Therefore, Mary makes 96 blueberry cubes.

The final numerical answer is:
96"
"To find the total number of points Ara has scored, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of games Ara has played in four years.
2. Multiply the total number of games by her average score per game.

First, let's find the total number of games:
- Ara plays 40 games every year.
- She has been playing for 4 years.

So, the total number of games is:
\[ 40 \text{ games/year} \times 4 \text{ years} = 160 \text{ games} \]

Next, we calculate the total points:
- Her score per game is 21 points.
- She has played 160 games.

So, the total points is:
\[ 21 \text{ points/game} \times 160 \text{ games} = 3360 \text{ points} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 3360 \]"
"Brendan started with 10 marbles. When he dropped half of them, he dropped 10 / 2 = 5 marbles. So he had 10 - 5 = 5 marbles left. When he came up with 3 marbles, he got rid of 1 bead, so he added 3 - 1 = 2 marbles to his collection. Therefore, Brendan ended up with 5 + 2 = 7 marbles."
"To solve this, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. First, we need to find out how many customers Jason needs to get to sell 15 cars. Since 1 out of every 2 customers buys a car, we can calculate the number of customers needed as follows:
   - If 1 customer buys a car, then 2 customers need to come in to get 1 customer to buy a car.
   - To get 15 customers to buy cars, we need 15 * 2 = 30 customers.

2. Next, we need to find out how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to get 30 customers. Since 1 out of every 25 telephone calls results in a customer coming in, we can calculate the number of telephone calls needed as follows:
   - If 1 out of 25 calls results in a customer, then to get 30 customers, we need 30 * 25 = 750 telephone calls.

So, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus."
"First, let's figure out how many flashlights they have. There are 4 people, so they have 4 flashlights. There are also 2 flashlights for each room, and there are 8 rooms, so that's 8 rooms * 2 flashlights/room = 16 flashlights. Adding the flashlights for the people, they have 4 + 16 = 20 flashlights.

Now, let's find out how many candles they have. Half of the rooms have small candles, and half have medium candles. Half of 8 rooms is 4 rooms. So, they have 4 rooms * 4 small candles/room = 16 small candles. And the other half, 4 rooms, have 5 medium candles/room, so they have 4 rooms * 5 medium candles/room = 20 medium candles.

Adding the flashlights and candles together, they have 20 flashlights + 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 56 candles and flashlights combined.

The final numerical answer is 56."
"First, we need to find out how many chips Mitchell has in total. He bought two bags of chips, and each bag has 55 chips. So, we multiply the number of bags by the number of chips in each bag:

2 bags * 55 chips/bag = 110 chips

Now, we need to divide the total number of chips by the number of family members to find out how many chips each person gets:

110 chips / 5 family members = 22 chips/person

So, each person gets 22 chips."
"First, let's break down the time it takes John to solve each side of the Rubik's cube:

- The first side takes 5 minutes.
- The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so each takes \(5 \times 2 = 10\) minutes.
- The fourth and fifth sides each take half as long as the first side, so each takes \(5 \div 2 = 2.5\) minutes.

Now, let's add up the time for all sides:

- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes

Total time = 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes

So, the Rubik's cube takes 30 minutes to solve."
"If there were 20 helmets, and Dominick saw half as many robots as helmets, then there were 20 / 2 = 10 robots.

Also, Dominick saw half as many helmets as footballs, so there were 20 * 2 = 40 footballs.

To find the total number of items Dominick saw, we add the helmets, robots, and footballs together: 20 helmets + 10 robots + 40 footballs = 70 items.

So, the final numerical answer is 70."
"First, we need to find out how many minutes are in a day that Tim works. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 60 minutes by 6 hours:

60 minutes/hour * 6 hours = 360 minutes/day

Now, we know it takes Tim 15 minutes to deal with one call. To find out how many calls he can handle in a day, we divide the total minutes in a day by the time it takes to handle one call:

360 minutes/day ÷ 15 minutes/call = 24 calls/day

Tim works 5 days a week, so to find out how many calls he deals with in a week, we multiply the number of calls he handles in a day by 5:

24 calls/day * 5 days/week = 120 calls/week

So, the final numerical answer is 120 calls."
"First, we need to find out how long it takes for one painting with the new varnish to dry. According to the question, it takes 12 minutes for one painting with the new varnish to dry.

Now, we need to find out how long it takes for 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry. We do this by multiplying the drying time for one painting by 6:
12 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 72 minutes

Next, we need to find out how long it takes for one painting with the old varnish to dry. According to the question, it takes 7 minutes for one painting with the old varnish to dry.

Now, we need to find out how long it takes for 6 paintings with the old varnish to dry. We do this by multiplying the drying time for one painting by 6:
7 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 42 minutes

To find out how much longer it will take for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry as compared to the old varnish, we subtract the total drying time for the old varnish from the total drying time for the new varnish:
72 minutes - 42 minutes = 30 minutes

So, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry as compared to the old varnish."
"First, let's find out how much water Crista needs for the plants that need half a cup each. She has 4 plants that need half a cup of water each. So, we calculate:

4 plants * 0.5 cup/plant = 2 cups

Next, we calculate the water needed for the plants that need 1 cup each. She has 8 plants that need 1 cup of water each. So, we calculate:

8 plants * 1 cup/plant = 8 cups

Now, we need to find out how many plants need a quarter of a cup of water. She has 20 plants in total, and we've already accounted for 4 + 8 = 12 plants. So, the number of plants that need a quarter of a cup is:

20 plants - 12 plants = 8 plants

Each of these 8 plants needs 0.25 cup of water. So, we calculate:

8 plants * 0.25 cup/plant = 2 cups

Now, we add up all the cups of water needed:

2 cups (for half a cup plants) + 8 cups (for 1 cup plants) + 2 cups (for quarter cup plants) = 12 cups

So, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller parts and calculate the time for each part separately.

Phineas needs to travel 200 yards in total. Half of the distance is on land, and the other half is in water. So, he will hop 100 yards on land and swim 100 yards in water.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Phineas to hop 100 yards on land. He hops at a speed of 20 yards per minute. So, the time to hop 100 yards is:
\[ \text{Time on land} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Phineas to swim 100 yards in water. He swims at a speed of 10 yards per minute. So, the time to swim 100 yards is:
\[ \text{Time in water} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time for both parts to get the total time:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time on land} + \text{Time in water} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it will take Phineas to return home is 15 minutes."
"First, we need to find out how many boxes of popsicle sticks Bob needs. Since each box has 8 sticks and he needs 56 sticks, we divide 56 by 8 to find the number of boxes.

56 ÷ 8 = 7

So, Bob needs 7 boxes of popsicle sticks.

Next, we need to calculate the cost. Each box costs $2.00, and he needs 7 boxes.

7 × $2.00 = $14.00

Therefore, it will cost Bob $14.00 to build his project."
"The main phone costs $20.
Each additional phone costs half of the main phone, so each additional phone costs $20 / 2 = $10.
There are five phones in total, so the cost of the additional four phones is 4 * $10 = $40.
Therefore, the whole phone plan costs $20 (main phone) + $40 (additional phones) = $60.
The final numerical answer is:
60"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many doughnuts Derrick makes in a day. Since he makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day and one dozen equals 12 doughnuts, we calculate:
   \[
   10 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ doughnuts/dozen} = 120 \text{ doughnuts/day}
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how much money he makes in a day. Since he sells each doughnut for $2, we calculate:
   \[
   120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \times $2/\text{doughnut} = $240/\text{day}
   \]

3. Now, we need to find out how many days are in June. June has 30 days.

4. Finally, to find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in June:
   \[
   $240/\text{day} \times 30 \text{ days} = $7200
   \]

So, Derrick makes $7200 in June if he sells all the doughnuts."
"First, let's find out how many photos Jade can upload in one day. She uploads 7 photos in one batch and does 6 batches each day. So, we multiply 7 by 6 to find out the total number of photos uploaded in one day.

7 photos/batch * 6 batches/day = 42 photos/day

Now, we know she has 210 photos in total. To find out how many days she needs to upload all her photos, we divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she can upload in one day.

210 photos / 42 photos/day = 5 days

So, Jade will need 5 days to upload all of her photos."
"First, let's calculate the cost for one week:

- Cost for 5 blouses: 5 blouses * $5.00/blouse = $25.00
- Cost for 1 skirt: 1 skirt * $6.00/skirt = $6.00
- Cost for 2 pairs of pants: 2 pairs * $8.00/pair = $16.00

Now, let's add these up to get the total cost for one week:

Total cost for one week = $25.00 + $6.00 + $16.00 = $47.00

Now, to find out how much she spends in 5 weeks, we multiply the weekly cost by 5:

Total cost for 5 weeks = $47.00 * 5 = $235.00

So, the final numerical answer is $235.00."
"First, let's find out John's new speaking speed after training. If his normal speed is 150 WPM (words per minute) and his new speed is 2.5 times faster, we calculate his new speed as follows:

\[ 150 \times 2.5 = 375 \text{ WPM} \]

Next, we need to find out how many words are in 10 pages. Since each page has 450 words, 10 pages will have:

\[ 10 \times 450 = 4500 \text{ words} \]

Now, to find out how long it takes him to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM, we divide the total number of words by his speaking speed:

\[ \frac{4500 \text{ words}}{375 \text{ WPM}} = 12 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

12"
"First, let's calculate the number of people Conor saw each day.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.

On the second day, he saw 20 more people than the first day, so:
50 people + 20 people = 70 people

On the third day, the total number of people was twice the number on the second day, so:
2 * 70 people = 140 people

Now, we know that Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the rest of the week. There are 3 days left in the week (Thursday, Friday, and Saturday), so:
60 people/day * 3 days = 180 people

Now, let's add up all the people Conor saw over the week:
50 people (first day) + 70 people (second day) + 140 people (third day) + 180 people (rest of the week) = 440 people

So, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 440."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times the amount that popped in the first 30 seconds pop. So, \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. In the next 30 seconds, four times the amount that popped in the first 30 seconds pop. So, \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. In the final 30 seconds, half the amount that popped in the previous 30 seconds pop. So, \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) kernels pop.

Now, let's add up the total number of kernels that popped in the first 30 seconds, the next 30 seconds, and the final 30 seconds:
\[20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200\]

After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds pop from the residual heat. So, a quarter of 40 kernels pop:
\[\frac{40}{4} = 10\]

Adding these to the total number of kernels that popped initially:
\[200 + 10 = 210\]

So, the final number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat is:
\[\boxed{210}\]"
"Tim needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade, and his recipe calls for 1 cup of fresh lemon juice per gallon. So, he needs 4 cups of lemon juice for 4 gallons.

Allen wants an extra gallon that is twice as tart, which means it will also need 1 cup of lemon juice.

So, Tim needs a total of 4 cups + 1 cup = 5 cups of lemon juice.

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, to get 5 cups of lemon juice, Tim will need 6 lemons * 5 = 30 lemons.

The final numerical answer is:
30"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of dog food the German Shepherds need in a week.

There are 3 German Shepherds and each consumes 5 kilograms of dog food per day.
So, the total amount of dog food for the German Shepherds per day is:
3 German Shepherds * 5 kg = 15 kg

To find out how much they need in a week, we multiply by 7 (days in a week):
15 kg * 7 = 105 kg

Next, let's calculate the total amount of dog food the Bulldogs need in a week.

There are 2 Bulldogs and each consumes 3 kilograms of dog food per day.
So, the total amount of dog food for the Bulldogs per day is:
2 Bulldogs * 3 kg = 6 kg

To find out how much they need in a week, we multiply by 7 (days in a week):
6 kg * 7 = 42 kg

Now, we add the total amount of dog food needed for the German Shepherds and the Bulldogs in a week:
105 kg + 42 kg = 147 kg

So, the Kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week."
"First, let's find out how many legs all the animals have in total.

The 10 2-legged animals have:
10 animals * 2 legs/animal = 20 legs

The 15 4-legged animals have:
15 animals * 4 legs/animal = 60 legs

Now, let's add the legs together:
20 legs + 60 legs = 80 legs

Since we need to find out how many pairs of legs there are, we divide the total number of legs by 2:
80 legs / 2 = 40 pairs

So, the final numerical answer is 40."
"First, let's find out how many yellow blocks there are. Since there are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, and there are 4 blue blocks, we can calculate the number of yellow blocks as follows:

Number of yellow blocks = 2 * Number of blue blocks
Number of yellow blocks = 2 * 4
Number of yellow blocks = 8

Now, we know there are 4 blue blocks and 8 yellow blocks, which makes a total of:

Total blue and yellow blocks = 4 + 8
Total blue and yellow blocks = 12

Since the total number of blocks in the tower is 32, we can find the number of red blocks by subtracting the number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks:

Number of red blocks = Total blocks - (Blue blocks + Yellow blocks)
Number of red blocks = 32 - 12
Number of red blocks = 20

So, the number of red blocks is 20."
"First, let's calculate how far Elvis traveled west.

He drove west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18 mph. To find the distance, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

So, the distance he traveled west is:
\[ 18 \, \text{mph} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, let's calculate how far Elvis traveled east.

He drove east for 8 hours at the same average speed of 18 mph. Using the same formula:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

So, the distance he traveled east is:
\[ 18 \, \text{mph} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 144 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find out how far Elvis is from his house, we need to consider the total distance he traveled west and east. Since he traveled west first and then east, we subtract the distance he traveled west from the distance he traveled east to find the net distance from his house.

The net distance is:
\[ 144 \, \text{miles} - 90 \, \text{miles} = 54 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Elvis is 54 miles from his house now."
"To solve this, let's break it down year by year.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   - The boat originally costs $9000.
   - It depreciates 30% in the first year.
   - To find 30% of $9000, we calculate: \(9000 \times 0.30 = 2700\).
   - So, after the first year, the boat is worth: \(9000 - 2700 = 6300\).

2. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   - The boat is now worth $6300.
   - It depreciates another 30% in the second year.
   - To find 30% of $6300, we calculate: \(6300 \times 0.30 = 1890\).
   - So, after the second year, the boat is worth: \(6300 - 1890 = 4410\).

3. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   - The boat is now worth $4410.
   - It depreciates 20% in the third year.
   - To find 20% of $4410, we calculate: \(4410 \times 0.20 = 882\).
   - So, after the third year, the boat is worth: \(4410 - 882 = 3528\).

Therefore, the boat is worth $3528 after the three years."
"First, let's find out how many orange candies there are. Since there are twice as many orange candies as red candies, and there are 54 red candies, we can calculate the number of orange candies as follows:

Number of orange candies = 2 * Number of red candies
Number of orange candies = 2 * 54
Number of orange candies = 108

Next, let's find out how many yellow candies there are. Since there are half as many yellow candies as red candies, and there are 54 red candies, we can calculate the number of yellow candies as follows:

Number of yellow candies = 1/2 * Number of red candies
Number of yellow candies = 1/2 * 54
Number of yellow candies = 27

Now, let's add up all the candies we know the number of:

Total known candies = Number of red candies + Number of orange candies + Number of yellow candies
Total known candies = 54 + 108 + 27
Total known candies = 189

We know there are 232 pieces of Starbursts candy in total. To find out how many are pink, we subtract the total known candies from the total number of candies:

Number of pink candies = Total number of candies - Total known candies
Number of pink candies = 232 - 189
Number of pink candies = 43

So, the final numerical answer is 43."
"First, let's calculate the cost of one night at the hotel. It's given as $80.

Next, we need to find out the cost of one bus trip. The problem states that one bus trip costs 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. So, we calculate 10% of $80:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$80 = \frac{10}{100} \times 80 = \$8 \]

Now, we know Helen rode the bus 7 times. So, the total cost for the bus trips is:
\[ 7 \times \$8 = \$56 \]

Helen stayed in the hotel for 3 nights, so the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 3 \times \$80 = \$240 \]

To find the total cost for both the hotel and the bus trips, we add the two amounts together:
\[ \$240 + \$56 = \$296 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$296 \]"
"First, let's find out how many marbles Dallas had before dropping any. If Dallas ended up with 21 marbles after dropping 4, then before dropping the marbles, Dallas had 21 + 4 = 25 marbles.

Mazie originally had 52 marbles. After giving some to Dallas and Darla, Dallas ended up with 25 marbles. So, the total number of marbles given to Dallas and Darla is 52 - 25 = 27 marbles.

Since Dallas got 25 marbles, the rest must have been given to Darla. So, the number of marbles given to Darla is 27 - 25 = 2 marbles.

The final numerical answer is:
2"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the tickets:
- The cost of 1 adult ticket is $12.
- The cost of 1 child ticket is $8.
- So, the cost for 2 adult tickets is 2 * $12 = $24.
- And the cost for 1 child ticket is $8.

Now, let's add the cost of the tickets:
- Total cost of tickets = $24 (for adults) + $8 (for the child) = $32.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the popcorns:
- The cost of 1 popcorn is $3.
- They buy 2 popcorns, so the cost for popcorns is 2 * $3 = $6.

Now, let's add the cost of the tickets and the popcorns to find the total cost:
- Total cost = $32 (for tickets) + $6 (for popcorns) = $38.

So, the family pays a total of $38."
"First, we need to find the total weight of the car and the luggage and the children together.

The car weighs 1200 pounds.
The luggage weighs 250 pounds.
Each child weighs 75 pounds, and there are two children, so the total weight of the children is 75 * 2 = 150 pounds.

Now, we add all these weights together:
1200 (car) + 250 (luggage) + 150 (children) = 1600 pounds.

The force to move the car is 1% of the total weight. To find 1% of 1600 pounds, we calculate:
1% of 1600 = 1600 * 0.01 = 16 pounds.

So, the force John needs to push the car is 16 pounds."
"To find out how many feet of crepe paper James needs, we need to calculate the perimeter of his backyard fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up all its sides. 

The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given:
- Length = 20 feet
- Width = 15 feet

Now, let's calculate the perimeter:
\[ P = 2 \times (20 + 15) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 35 \]
\[ P = 70 \]

So, James needs to buy 70 feet of crepe paper."
"To find the average age of Mia and Emma, we first need to determine Emma's age. Since Mia is 40 years old and they are 16 years apart in age, we can find Emma's age by adding 16 years to Mia's age.

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16 years
Emma's age = 40 years + 16 years
Emma's age = 56 years

Now that we know both of their ages, we can calculate the average age. The formula for the average of two numbers is:

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2

Substituting the ages we have:

Average age = (40 years + 56 years) / 2
Average age = 96 years / 2
Average age = 48 years

So, the average of their ages is 48 years."
"Tom found 214 seashells.
Nancy found 432 seashells.
Benny found 86 seashells.
Total seashells they found = 214 + 432 + 86 = 732 seashells.

So, Avery will spend $540.00 on place settings."
"First, we need to find out how long it took Steve to finish the puzzle. According to the question, Steve took 10 hours.

Next, we need to find out how long Anna took. The question states that Anna took 2 hours more than half of Steve's time. So, we first find half of Steve's time:
\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Then, we add 2 hours to this time to find out how long Anna took:
\[ 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ hours} \]

So, Anna took 7 hours to finish the puzzle."
"Each pig eats 4 pounds twice a day, so each pig eats 4 * 2 = 8 pounds a day.
With five pigs, they eat 8 * 5 = 40 pounds a day.
In a week, which is 7 days, they eat 40 * 7 = 280 pounds.
If Dexter ordered 300 pounds and they ate 280 pounds, then 300 - 280 = 20 pounds of feed is left after a week."
"First, we need to find out how many hot dogs John needs in total. He invited 20 people and each person will eat 2 hot dogs, so:
20 people * 2 hot dogs/person = 40 hot dogs

He already has 4 hot dogs, so he needs to buy:
40 hot dogs - 4 hot dogs = 36 hot dogs

A pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs and costs $2, so to find out how many packs he needs to buy, we divide the number of hot dogs he needs by the number of hot dogs in a pack:
36 hot dogs / 6 hot dogs/pack = 6 packs

Now, to find out how much he needs to spend, we multiply the number of packs by the cost of each pack:
6 packs * $2/pack = $12

So, John needs to spend $12 on hot dogs."
"First, let's calculate how much money Frances makes from selling cupcakes and cookies.

She sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each, so:
20 cupcakes * $2/cupcake = $40

She sells 40 cookies at $1 each, so:
40 cookies * $1/cookie = $40

Now, let's add the money she makes from cupcakes and cookies:
$40 (from cupcakes) + $40 (from cookies) = $80

Next, let's calculate how much money Frances spends on buying trays.

She buys five trays at $4 each, so:
5 trays * $4/tray = $20

Now, let's subtract the money she spends from the money she makes to find out how much money she has left:
$80 (money made) - $20 (money spent) = $60

So, the final numerical answer is:
60"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On the first street, there are 5 children.
2. On the second street, each of the 5 children is joined by another child. So, the number of children becomes 5 + 5 = 10.
3. On the third street, each of the 10 children is joined by another 2 children. So, the number of children becomes 10 + (10 * 2) = 10 + 20 = 30.

Now, the original 5 children give up and leave the group, so we subtract those 5 children from the 30 children.

So, the number of children now following the truck is 30 - 5 = 25.

The final numerical answer is 25."
"To find out how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to add up the meals she has already given out and then subtract that number from the total number of meals she was supposed to give out.

First, let's add the meals given out on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday:
- Meals given on Friday: 64
- Meals given on Saturday: 30
- Meals given on Sunday: 48

Total meals given out = 64 + 30 + 48

Now, let's calculate the total:
64 + 30 = 94
94 + 48 = 142

So, Mamou has given out 142 meals in total.

Now, we subtract the total meals given out from the total meals she was supposed to give out:
Total meals to distribute: 1,360
Meals already given out: 142

Meals left to distribute = 1,360 - 142

Let's calculate this:
1,360 - 142 = 1,218

So, the number of meals Mamou has left to distribute is 1,218."
"A quarter is worth 25 cents.
Two nickels are worth 5 cents each, so together they are worth 2 * 5 = 10 cents.
Seven dimes are worth 10 cents each, so together they are worth 7 * 10 = 70 cents.

To find the total amount of money James has, we add the value of the quarter, the two nickels, and the seven dimes:
25 cents (quarter) + 10 cents (two nickels) + 70 cents (seven dimes) = 105 cents.

So, the final numerical answer is 105."

- Each of the 3 sisters is 16 years old, so the total age for the sisters is \(3 \times 16 = 48\) years.
- One of the brothers is 12 years old.
- The older brother is twice the age of the 12-year-old brother, so the older brother is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) years old.

Now, let's add up all the ages:
- Ages of the sisters: 48 years
- Age of the 12-year-old brother: 12 years
- Age of the older brother: 24 years

Total age = \(48 + 12 + 24 = 84\) years.

So, the total age of all the siblings is 84 years."
"Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, so that's 15 * 2 = 30 minutes of meditation per day.
She meditates for 30 minutes * 5 days a week = 150 minutes per week.
Since there are 7 days in a week, she meditates for 150 minutes / 7 days = approximately 21.43 minutes per day.

Now, let's calculate the time spent on yoga. She practices yoga for 1 hour (60 minutes) 5 days a week, so that's 60 * 5 = 300 minutes per week.

So, the total time spent on meditation and yoga per week is 150 minutes (meditation) + 300 minutes (yoga) = 450 minutes per week.

In 4 weeks, the total time spent on meditation and yoga is 450 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1800 minutes.

To convert 1800 minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes), so 1800 minutes / 60 = 30 hours.

The final numerical answer is 30 hours."
"First, we need to calculate the total square feet for each type of t-shirt:

For small t-shirts:
11 small t-shirts * 3 square feet each = 33 square feet

For medium t-shirts:
8 medium t-shirts * 4 square feet each = 32 square feet

For large t-shirts:
6 large t-shirts * 6 square feet each = 36 square feet

Now, we add up all the square feet:
33 square feet (small) + 32 square feet (medium) + 36 square feet (large) = 101 square feet

So, the quilt is 101 square feet."
"First, let's find out how many seeds a large sunflower has. A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since a dozen is 12, a small sunflower has 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we calculate 36 * 0.50 = 18.

So, a large sunflower has 36 + 18 = 54 seeds.

Now, to find the total number of seeds in both a small and a large sunflower, we add the seeds of a small sunflower and a large sunflower together: 36 + 54 = 90.

The final numerical answer is 90."
"First, we need to find out how many pens Timothy has. Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, and George has 18 pens, we can calculate the number of pens Timothy has by multiplying 18 by 3.

\[ \text{Timothy's pens} = 18 \times 3 = 54 \]

Next, we need to find out how many pens Sarah has. Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, so we can calculate the number of pens Sarah has by dividing the number of pens Timothy has by 2.

\[ \text{Sarah's pens} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

So, Sarah has 27 pens."
"First, let's find out how tall Anne is. Since Anne is twice the size of Albert and Albert is 36"" tall, Anne is:
2 * 36"" = 72""

Jackie is now 2"" shorter than Anne, so Jackie is:
72"" - 2"" = 70""

Jackie grew 3"" over the summer, so before summer she was:
70"" - 3"" = 67""

The final numerical answer is 67."
"First, we need to find out how many bars the company produces in two weeks. Since the company produces 5000 bars in one day, we multiply this number by 14 (the number of days in two weeks):

5000 bars/day * 14 days = 70000 bars

Next, we need to find out how much money the company will receive for selling these 70000 bars. Since each bar is sold for $2, we multiply the number of bars by the price per bar:

70000 bars * $2/bar = $140000

So, the company will receive $140000 for selling the produced chocolate bars during two weeks."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts.

The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts and the deal is buy one get one 50% off, the first T-shirt costs $8 and the second T-shirt is 50% off, which is $8 * 0.5 = $4. So, the total cost for the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes.

The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off. So, the discount is $40 * 0.4 = $16. Therefore, the price Jake pays for the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, let's add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends.

Total amount = Cost of T-shirts + Cost of shoes = $12 + $24 = $36.

So, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is $36."
"First, let's calculate how much money Ryan has after doing his chores for 3 weeks. Since he gets $6 for each week he does his chores, we multiply $6 by 3:

\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \]

So, Ryan has $18.

Next, let's calculate how much money Ryan spent on ice cream cones. He bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends, so that's 4 ice cream cones. Each ice cream cone costs $1.25, so we multiply $1.25 by 4:

\[ 1.25 \times 4 = 5 \]

So, Ryan spent $5 on ice cream cones.

Now, let's find out how much money Ryan has left after buying the ice cream cones. We subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from the money he had:

\[ 18 - 5 = 13 \]

Ryan has $13 left.

Now, let's calculate how many movie tickets Ryan can buy with the remaining $13. Each movie ticket costs $6.50, so we divide $13 by $6.50:

\[ 13 \div 6.50 = 2 \]

So, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets."
"First, let's add up what Ellen spent:
- Leggings: $100
- Photo frame: $5
Total for Ellen = $100 + $5 = $105

Now, let's add up what Lani spent:
- Sunglasses: $30
- Bathrobes: $100 each, and she bought 2, so 2 * $100 = $200
Total for Lani = $30 + $200 = $230

Now, let's add what Ellen and Lani spent in total:
Total spent = $105 (Ellen) + $230 (Lani) = $335

So, the final numerical answer is:
335"
"First, let's calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar of the mixture.

For 1 jar:
- Passion fruit: 2 pounds at $6 per pound
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds at $8 per pound
- Honey: 2 pounds at $10 per pound

Cost of passion fruit for 1 jar = 2 * $6 = $12
Cost of jackfruit for 1 jar = 1.5 * $8 = $12
Cost of honey for 1 jar = 2 * $10 = $20

Total cost for 1 jar = $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

Now, Tim sells each jar for $50.

Profit for 1 jar = Selling price - Cost price
Profit for 1 jar = $50 - $44 = $6

To find the profit for 10 jars:
Profit for 10 jars = 10 * $6 = $60

So, the final numerical answer is $60."
"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and then add them all together.

1. Quarters: 32 quarters * $0.25 = $8.00
2. Dimes: 95 dimes * $0.10 = $9.50
3. Nickels: 120 nickels * $0.05 = $6.00
4. Pennies: 750 pennies * $0.01 = $7.50

Now, we add all these amounts together:

$8.00 + $9.50 + $6.00 + $7.50 = $31.00

So, the total dollar amount in the jar is $31.00."
"First, let's add up all the money Janet spent:
- Ice cream: $3.50
- Movie tickets: $7.50 each, so for two tickets it's $7.50 * 2 = $15.00
- Bracelet: $8.50

Now, let's add these amounts together:
$3.50 + $15.00 + $8.50 = $27.00

Janet's parents gave her $40.00. To find out how much she has left, we subtract the total amount she spent from the $40.00 her parents gave her:
$40.00 - $27.00 = $13.00

So, Janet has $13.00 left."
"First, let's figure out how many days Josh works in a week. He works every day except Sunday and Wednesday. So, he works 7 days - 2 days = 5 days a week.

Next, we calculate how many cars he services in a week. Since he services 3 cars a day and works 5 days a week, he services 3 cars/day * 5 days/week = 15 cars/week.

Now, we calculate how much he makes in a week. Since he gets paid $4 per car, he makes 15 cars/week * $4/car = $60/week.

Finally, to find out how much he makes in 2 weeks, we multiply his weekly earnings by 2. So, $60/week * 2 weeks = $120.

The final numerical answer is $120."
"Randy started with:
- 9 oatmeal cookies
- 4 chocolate chip cookies
- 5 sugar cookies

He ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor:
- 1 oatmeal cookie
- 1 chocolate chip cookie
- 1 sugar cookie

So, he has:
- 9 - 1 = 8 oatmeal cookies
- 4 - 1 = 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 5 - 1 = 4 sugar cookies

For lunch, he ate 2 oatmeal cookies:
- 8 - 2 = 6 oatmeal cookies

He gave 2 sugar cookies to his friends:
- 4 - 2 = 2 sugar cookies

Now, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner:
- 6 + 4 = 10 oatmeal cookies
- 3 + 4 = 7 chocolate chip cookies
- 2 + 4 = 6 sugar cookies

So, the total number of cookies he has now is:
- 10 oatmeal cookies
- 7 chocolate chip cookies
- 6 sugar cookies

Adding them all together:
10 + 7 + 6 = 23

Randy has 23 cookies now."
"Matthew has 12 toy soldiers. Half of his collection is 12 / 2 = 6 toy soldiers. The buyer is willing to pay $5 per toy for the first 6 toy soldiers and $7 per toy for the other 6 toy soldiers.

For the first 6 toy soldiers, the buyer pays $5 each, so the total for these is 6 * $5 = $30.
For the other 6 toy soldiers, the buyer pays $7 each, so the total for these is 6 * $7 = $42.

Adding these amounts together, Matthew would earn $30 + $42 = $72.

So, the final numerical answer is 72."
"First, let's calculate how many holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so:
\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate is not there, the dog digs 6 holes a day, and Nate's dog keeps digging 6 holes every night. So, the dog digs 6 holes every day. Nate starts filling in 9 holes a day, but the dog still digs 6 holes a day. So, the net number of holes being filled each day is:
\[ 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/day} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take to fill in all 84 holes. Since the dog digs 3 holes a day when Nate is filling them in, we can calculate the number of days it takes to fill in all the holes:
\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

To find out how many weeks it takes, we divide the number of days by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):
\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes."
"First, we need to find out how many students Butler High School enrolls on average each year. Since Butler High School enrolls an average of 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can calculate this by multiplying the number of students at Norman High School by 3/4.

Number of students at Butler High School = 3/4 * 4000

Let's calculate that:
3/4 * 4000 = 3000

Butler High School enrolls 3000 students on average each year.

Now, to find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we subtract the number of students at Butler High School from the number of students at Norman High School.

Difference = Number of students at Norman High School - Number of students at Butler High School
Difference = 4000 - 3000

Let's calculate that:
4000 - 3000 = 1000

So, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School.

The final numerical answer is:
1000"
"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies they've made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.

Total cookies made = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies - Rainbow cookies - Oatmeal cookies
Chocolate chip cookies = 7995 - 2595 - 3075

Now let's do the math:
7995 - 2595 = 5400
5400 - 3075 = 2325

So, the number of chocolate chip cookies they've made is 2325."
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Dr. Grumpus asked for 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes.
- Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, which is 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.
- Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, which is 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.
- Igor picked up the correct number of beakers, which is 7 beakers.
- The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench was 29.

Now, let's calculate the total number of items Igor should have placed on the lab bench:

- Test tubes: 8
- Beakers: 7
- Petri dishes: 16

Adding these up: 8 + 7 + 16 = 31

Igor actually placed 29 items on the lab bench. To find out how many beakers he lost, we need to see how many beakers were missing from the total:

- Total items Igor should have: 31
- Total items Igor actually placed: 29

The difference is the number of beakers lost: 31 - 29 = 2

So, Igor lost 2 beakers."
"First, we need to find out how many screws James needs in total. Each table has 4 legs and each leg needs 2 screws. So, for one table, the number of screws needed is:

4 legs/table * 2 screws/leg = 8 screws/table

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is:

4 tables * 8 screws/table = 32 screws

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the number of screws he has:

40 screws - 32 screws = 8 screws

So, the number of screws James will have left over is 8."
"If there are 10 eggs in the first basket, then the second basket has 10 eggs times 2, which is 20 eggs.

So, the total number of eggs in both baskets is 10 + 20 = 30 eggs.

The final numerical answer is 30."
"First, let's find out how much money each person raised.

Alexandra raised $430.

Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so:
Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.

Sarah raised $300.

Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so:
Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, let's add up all the money they raised:
Alexandra + Kim + Sarah + Maryam = $430 + $750 + $300 + $700 = $2180.

So, the total amount of money they all raised is $2180."
"First, we need to find out how fast Aaron ran each mile. If Aaron ran each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, and Vanessa ran 4 miles, then Aaron ran 2 miles.

Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes for 2 miles. So, to find out how fast Aaron ran per mile, we divide the total time by the number of miles he ran:
\[ \text{Time per mile for Aaron} = \frac{16 \text{ minutes}}{2 \text{ miles}} = 8 \text{ minutes per mile} \]

Since Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, she ran 4 miles. If Aaron ran each mile in 8 minutes, then Vanessa, running twice as far, would take twice as long per mile:
\[ \text{Time per mile for Vanessa} = 8 \text{ minutes per mile} \times 2 = 16 \text{ minutes per mile} \]

Now, to find out how long Vanessa took to run 4 miles, we multiply the time per mile by the number of miles she ran:
\[ \text{Total time for Vanessa} = 4 \text{ miles} \times 16 \text{ minutes per mile} = 64 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race."
"First, we need to find out how much line is needed for the dock. Since the caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we multiply the length of the dock by 3:

200 feet of dock * 3 = 600 feet of line needed

He already has 6 feet of new line, so we subtract that from the total line needed:

600 feet needed - 6 feet he has = 594 feet of line to buy

So, the final answer is 594 feet of line he needs to buy."
"First, let's calculate how much they make in one night:

- They order 2 meals that cost $5 each, so that's 2 * $5 = $10.
- They also order a $5 bottle of wine.
- So in one night, they spend $10 + $5 = $15.

Now, they get 6 reservations a night, but they are only open 2 days a week. So in one week, they get 6 reservations * 2 days = 12 reservations.

If they make $15 in one night, then in one week they make $15 * 12 = $180.

So the final numerical answer is:
180"
"First, we need to find out the total selling price of all the watermelons. The fruit vendor made a profit of 25% on the cost price. The cost price for 50 watermelons is $80.

To find the profit, we calculate 25% of $80:
\[ \text{Profit} = 25\% \times 80 = \frac{25}{100} \times 80 = 20 \]

So, the total selling price is the cost price plus the profit:
\[ \text{Total Selling Price} = 80 + 20 = 100 \]

Now, to find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:
\[ \text{Price per watermelon} = \frac{100}{50} = 2 \]

So, each watermelon was sold for $2."
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. James is now twice as old as Dora.
2. Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so Dora is currently 9 years old.
3. James is twice as old as Dora, so James is 2 * 9 = 18 years old now.
4. James is currently 18 years old, and he is 19 years older than his father John, so John is 18 - 19 = -1 years old, which doesn't make sense. This means we need to correct the information.

"First, we need to find out how many minutes are in an hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour.

Next, we calculate how many oranges Ana can peel in 60 minutes. Since Ana spends 3 minutes peeling an orange, we divide 60 minutes by 3 minutes per orange:
\[ 60 \div 3 = 20 \]
So, Ana can peel 20 oranges in an hour.

Now, we calculate how many oranges Jane can peel in 60 minutes. Since Jane spends 4 minutes peeling an orange, we divide 60 minutes by 4 minutes per orange:
\[ 60 \div 4 = 15 \]
So, Jane can peel 15 oranges in an hour.

To find out how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we subtract the number of oranges Jane peeled from the number of oranges Ana peeled:
\[ 20 - 15 = 5 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
5"
"First, let's find out how much Mark paid for the radiator. The original cost is $400, and he gets it at 80% off. So, he pays 20% of $400.

20% of $400 is calculated as:
\[ \frac{20}{100} \times 400 = 0.20 \times 400 = 80 \]

So, Mark paid $80 for the radiator.

Next, he hires a mechanic to install it, which takes 3 hours at $50 an hour. So, the cost for the mechanic is:
\[ 3 \times 50 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic to find the total amount Mark paid:
\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, the total amount Mark paid is $230."
"To solve this, let's think about the animals and their legs.

Chickens have 2 legs each.
Cows have 4 legs each.

Let's say Farmer Brown has 'x' chickens. Then he has '20 - x' cows because the total number of animals is 20.

Now, if we count the legs:
- Each chicken has 2 legs, so 'x' chickens have 2x legs.
- Each cow has 4 legs, so '20 - x' cows have 4 * (20 - x) legs.

The total number of legs is 70, so we can write the equation:
\[2x + 4(20 - x) = 70\]

Let's solve this equation step by step:
\[2x + 80 - 4x = 70\]
\[-2x + 80 = 70\]
\[-2x = 70 - 80\]
\[-2x = -10\]
\[x = 5\]

So, there are 5 chickens. To find out how many cows there are, we subtract the number of chickens from the total number of animals:
\[20 - 5 = 15\]

Therefore, there are 5 chickens and 15 cows. The question asks for the number of chickens, which is 5."
"First, we need to find out how many slices of pizza there are in total. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, we multiply 7 by 8 to get the total number of slices.

7 pizzas * 8 slices per pizza = 56 slices

Now, Henry and his 3 friends make a total of 4 people. To find out how many slices each person can have, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people.

56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices per person

So, each of them can have 14 slices."
