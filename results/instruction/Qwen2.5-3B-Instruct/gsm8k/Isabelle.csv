"First, let's determine how many eggs Janet has left after eating and using some for baking.

Janet starts with 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 eggs for baking muffins. So, the number of eggs she has left is:

\[ 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 \]

Janet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg. Therefore, the amount she makes every day is:

\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 18 \]"
"To solve this, we first need to determine the amount of white fiber required. The problem states that the robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Since the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, the amount of white fiber needed is:

\[ \text{White fiber} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Blue fiber} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 = 1 \text{ bolt} \]

Now, we add the blue fiber and the white fiber to find the total number of bolts required:

\[ \text{Total bolts} = \text{Blue fiber} + \text{White fiber} = 2 + 1 = 3 \text{ bolts} \]

So, the total number of bolts required is 3."
"First, let's calculate the increase in the value of the house due to the repairs. The original value of the house is $80,000. The repairs increased the value by 150%. To find the increase in value, we calculate 150% of $80,000:

\[ \text{Increase in value} = 80,000 \times \frac{150}{100} = 80,000 \times 1.5 = 120,000 \]

So, the total value of the house after the repairs is:

\[ \text{Total value after repairs} = 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Josh spent $50,000 on repairs, and the house was originally worth $80,000. Therefore, the total cost for Josh to buy and repair the house is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value of the house after repairs:

\[ \text{Profit} = 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 70,000 \]"
"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the total meters James runs in one sprint.
2. Calculate the total meters James runs in one day (3 sprints).
3. Calculate the total meters James runs in a week (3 days).

Step 1: James runs 60 meters in one sprint.
Step 2: James runs 3 sprints a day, so in one day he runs:
\[ 60 \, \text{meters/sprint} \times 3 \, \text{sprints/day} = 180 \, \text{meters/day} \]
Step 3: James runs 180 meters in one day, and he runs 3 days a week, so in a week he runs:
\[ 180 \, \text{meters/day} \times 3 \, \text{days/week} = 540 \, \text{meters/week} \]

Therefore, the total meters James runs in a week is 540 meters."
"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she gives her flock in the morning and afternoon.

Wendi gives her flock 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. Therefore, the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Since Wendi has a flock of 20 chickens, and she feeds each chicken 3 cups of feed per day, the total amount of feed needed for the entire flock is:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed in the final meal, we subtract the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total amount of feed needed for the day:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:
\[ 20 \text{ cups} \]"
"To calculate the total cost for Kylar, we need to consider the pricing structure and the number of glasses he wants to buy.

1. The first glass costs $5.
2. Every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $5 * 0.60 = $3.

So, for every two glasses, the cost is $5 + $3 = $8.

Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. We can divide the 16 glasses into 8 pairs of glasses (since 16 divided by 2 equals 8).

The cost for 8 pairs of glasses is 8 * $8 = $64.

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Seattle's Sheep**: We are given that Seattle has 20 sheep.
   \[
   \text{Sheep in Seattle} = 20
   \]

2. **Charleston's Sheep**: Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   \[
   \text{Sheep in Charleston} = 4 \times \text{Sheep in Seattle} = 4 \times 20 = 80
   \]

3. **Toulouse's Sheep**: Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   \[
   \text{Sheep in Toulouse} = 2 \times \text{Sheep in Charleston} = 2 \times 80 = 160
   \]

4. **Total Sheep**: To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we add the number of sheep in each city.
   \[
   \text{Total Sheep} = \text{Sheep in Seattle} + \text{Sheep in Charleston} + \text{Sheep in Toulouse} = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260
   \]

Therefore, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is 260."
"To determine the total time Carla needs to download the 200 GB file, we need to break down the process into parts and calculate the time for each part.

1. **First 40% of the download:**
   - 40% of 200 GB is \(0.40 \times 200 = 80\) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \(80 \div 2 = 40\) minutes.

2. **Windows update installation:**
   - This takes 20 minutes.

3. **Restarting the download:**
   - After the update, Carla has to start the download from the beginning, which means she has to download the first 80 GB again.
   - The time to download the first 80 GB again is the same as the time to download the first 80 GB, which is 40 minutes.

4. **Remaining 60% of the download:**
   - 60% of 200 GB is \(0.60 \times 200 = 120\) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 120 GB is \(120 \div 2 = 60\) minutes.

Now, we sum up all the times:
- Time for the first 40%: 40 minutes
- Time for the Windows update: 20 minutes
- Time to download the first 40% again: 40 minutes
- Time for the remaining 60%: 60 minutes

Total time = \(40 + 20 + 40 + 60 = 160\) minutes.

The final numerical answer is 160 minutes."
"To determine how far John is from home at the end of 4 hours, we need to break down his journey into segments and calculate the distance for each segment.

1. **First Segment:**
   - Time: 3 hours
   - Speed: 60 mph
   - Distance: \(3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ mph} = 180 \text{ miles}\)

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Time: 2 hours (in traffic)
   - Speed: 0 mph
   - Distance: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 0 \text{ mph} = 0 \text{ miles}\)

3. **Third Segment:**
   - Time: 0.5 hours
   - Speed: 30 mph
   - Distance: \(0.5 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ miles}\)

4. **Fourth Segment:**
   - Time: 3.5 hours (remaining time out of 4 hours)
   - Speed: 80 mph
   - Distance: \(3.5 \text{ hours} \times 80 \text{ mph} = 280 \text{ miles}\)

Now, we sum up the distances from all segments to find the total distance traveled:
\[180 \text{ miles} + 0 \text{ miles} + 15 \text{ miles} + 280 \text{ miles} = 475 \text{ miles}\]

Therefore, at the end of those 4 hours, John is 475 miles from home."
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break it down into regular hours and overtime hours.

First, we calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours at her regular rate:
\[ \text{Regular earnings} = 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \]

Next, we calculate her earnings for the 5 overtime hours at her overtime rate. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate:
\[ \text{Overtime rate} = 1.2 \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$12/\text{hour} \]
\[ \text{Overtime earnings} = 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

Now, we add the regular earnings and the overtime earnings to find her total earnings for the week:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \]

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are:
\[ \$460 \]"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, let's calculate the number of downloads for each month:

1. **First Month:** The program had 60 downloads.
2. **Second Month:** The number of downloads was three times as many as the first month. Therefore, the downloads in the second month were \( 60 \times 3 = 180 \).
3. **Third Month:** The downloads in the third month were reduced by 30% from the second month. To find 30% of 180, we calculate \( 180 \times 0.30 = 54 \). Therefore, the downloads in the third month were \( 180 - 54 = 126 \).

Now, to find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month:

\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

So, the total number of downloads over the three months is 366."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of pastry:

- Donuts: 3 dozen at $68 per dozen

  \]
- Mini cupcakes: 2 dozen at $80 per dozen
  \[
  2 \times 80 = 160
  \]
- Mini cheesecakes: 6 dozen at $55 per dozen
  \[
  6 \times 55 = 330
  \]

Now, let's add up the total cost:
\[
204 + 160 + 330 = 694
\]

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point at which the profit becomes positive.

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:
- Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons.
- Each lemon is sold for $1.5.

Annual revenue from lemons = 7 lemons/year * $1.5/lemon = $10.5/year

Next, let's calculate the annual cost of watering and feeding the tree:
- The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.

Now, we can determine the net profit each year by subtracting the annual cost from the annual revenue:
- Net profit per year = Annual revenue - Annual cost
- Net profit per year = $10.5 - $3 = $7.5

Carlos needs to cover the initial cost of planting the tree before he starts earning money. The initial cost is $90.

To find out how many years it will take to earn back the initial cost, we divide the initial cost by the net profit per year:
- Number of years to earn back the initial cost = Initial cost / Net profit per year
- Number of years to earn back the initial cost = $90 / $7.5 = 12 years

Therefore, it will take 12 years before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree.

The final numerical answer is 12."
"Let's denote the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \).

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \).

3. She then sold half of what was left at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \). The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \).

We know that after these sales, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

Let's solve this equation step by step.

First, simplify the expression inside the parentheses:

\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2x}{3} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 \]
\[ = \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{x}{3} + 1 \]
\[ = \frac{2x - x}{3} - 1 \]
\[ = \frac{x}{3} - 1 \]

So the equation becomes:

\[ \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5 \]

Add 1 to both sides:

\[ \frac{x}{3} = 6 \]

Multiply both sides by 3:

\[ x = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners. Let's verify this by checking the steps:

1. She sold \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) vacuum cleaners at the green house, leaving her with \( 18 - 6 = 12 \) vacuum cleaners.
2. She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, leaving her with \( 12 - 2 = 10 \) vacuum cleaners.
3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \cdot 10 = 5 \) vacuum cleaners, leaving her with \( 10 - 5 = 5 \) vacuum cleaners.

Since the final number of vacuum cleaners left is 5, the solution is correct. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance.
2. Calculate the number of students remaining after those who enrolled in contemporary dance.
3. Calculate the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance from the remaining students.
4. Calculate the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance.
5. Calculate the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance.

Let's start with step 1:

1. Number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance = 20% of 20 = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students.

Now, let's move to step 2:

2. Remaining students after those who enrolled in contemporary dance = 20 - 4 = 16 students.

Next, step 3:

3. Number of students who enrolled in jazz dance = 25% of the remaining 16 students = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students.

Now, step 4:

4. Number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance = Remaining students after those who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance = 16 - 4 = 12 students.

Finally, step 5:

5. Percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance = (Number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance / Total number of students) * 100 = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%.

The final numerical answer is 60%."
"To determine which purchase plan will maximize the profit, we need to calculate the future value of each item based on the expected market growth and then compare the profit from each plan.

For the jewelry:
- Current value: $5,000
- Expected growth: 2.5%

The future value of the jewelry can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Future Value of Jewelry} = \text{Current Value} \times (1 + \text{Growth Rate}) \]
\[ \text{Future Value of Jewelry} = 5000 \times (1 + 0.025) \]
\[ \text{Future Value of Jewelry} = 5000 \times 1.025 \]
\[ \text{Future Value of Jewelry} = 5125 \]

For the electronic gadgets:
- Current value: $8,000
- Expected growth: 1.2%

The future value of the electronic gadgets can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Future Value of Electronic Gadgets} = \text{Current Value} \times (1 + \text{Growth Rate}) \]
\[ \text{Future Value of Electronic Gadgets} = 8000 \times (1 + 0.012) \]
\[ \text{Future Value of Electronic Gadgets} = 8000 \times 1.012 \]
\[ \text{Future Value of Electronic Gadgets} = 8096 \]

Now, we calculate the profit for each plan:
- Profit from jewelry: \( \text{Future Value of Jewelry} - \text{Current Value} \)
\[ \text{Profit from Jewelry} = 5125 - 5000 = 125 \]

- Profit from electronic gadgets: \( \text{Future Value of Electronic Gadgets} - \text{Current Value} \)
\[ \text{Profit from Electronic Gadgets} = 8096 - 8000 = 96 \]

Comparing the profits:
- Profit from jewelry: $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets: $96

The merchant would maximize profit by choosing to purchase the jewelry, which would result in a profit of $125."
"To determine the total distance covered by each train over the two days, we need to add the distances traveled in both directions.

First, the distance traveled westward is 80 miles.
Second, the distance traveled northward is 150 miles.

The total distance covered by each train is the sum of these two distances:
\[ 80 \text{ miles} + 150 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles} \]

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles."
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from both teaching and coaching separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her annual earnings from teaching:
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual teaching earnings = 35 hours/week * $20/hour * 50 weeks/year

Next, let's calculate her annual earnings from coaching:
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She gets paid $30 per coaching session.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual coaching earnings = 15 hours/week * $30/session * 50 weeks/year

Now, let's calculate the total annual salary by summing up the annual teaching earnings and the annual coaching earnings.

Let's do the calculations:

Annual teaching earnings = 35 * 20 * 50 = $35,000
Annual coaching earnings = 15 * 30 * 50 = $22,500

Total annual salary = Annual teaching earnings + Annual coaching earnings
Total annual salary = $35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500

So, Jill's annual salary is $57,500."
"To determine how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs Claire uses per day.
2. Calculate the number of eggs Claire uses per week.
3. Calculate the number of eggs Claire uses in 4 weeks.
4. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.

Step 1: Claire uses 3 eggs per day.

Step 2: There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Step 3: Over 4 weeks, Claire will use:
\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Step 4: Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, we convert 84 eggs into dozens:
\[ \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozen} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 7 \]"
"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time Marissa wants to spend hiking.
2. Determine the total distance she needs to cover.
3. Calculate the remaining distance.
4. Determine the required speed for the remaining distance.

First, let's calculate the total time Marissa wants to spend hiking. She wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour over the entire 12-mile trail. Therefore, the total time she wants to spend hiking is:

\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that Marissa has already spent 1 hour walking the first 4 miles and another 1 hour walking the next 2 miles. So, the time she has already spent hiking is:

\[ 1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

This means she has:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

left to hike the remaining distance. The remaining distance is:

\[ 12 \text{ miles} - (4 \text{ miles} + 2 \text{ miles}) = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the required speed for the remaining distance, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

Substituting the remaining distance and the time left:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles at a speed of 6 miles per hour."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink and the 15 liters of pineapple drink.

For the orange drink:
- It is two-thirds water, so the amount of water in the orange drink is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \) liters.

For the pineapple drink:
- It is three-fifths water, so the amount of water in the pineapple drink is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \) liters.

After adding the orange drink and the pineapple drink, we have a total of \( 10 + 15 = 25 \) liters of liquid. However, we spill one liter of the orange drink, so we have \( 25 - 1 = 24 \) liters of liquid left.

The total amount of water in the 24 liters of liquid is the sum of the water from the orange drink and the pineapple drink:
- Water from the orange drink: \( \frac{20}{3} \) liters.
- Water from the pineapple drink: \( 9 \) liters.

Adding these together:
\[ \frac{20}{3} + 9 = \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3} \]

So, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is \( \frac{47}{3} \) liters. Converting this to a decimal for clarity, it is approximately \( 15.67 \) liters. However, the final numerical answer in fraction form is:

\[ \frac{47}{3} \]"
"To determine how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Raymond's current age.
2. Calculate the age of Raymond when his son was born.
3. Determine how many years ago Raymond's son was born.

First, we know that Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. Since Samantha is now 31 years old, Raymond is currently:
\[ 31 - 6 = 25 \text{ years old} \]

Raymond had a son when he was 23 years old. Therefore, the age of Raymond's son at the time of his birth was:
\[ 23 - 23 = 0 \text{ years old} \]

This means Raymond's son was born 23 years ago. Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 23 \]"
"To determine the total number of DVDs Billy sold on Tuesday, we can break down the sales by customer group:

8"
"To find the original price of the book, we can set up an equation based on the information given. If the book was bought for $19.50 with a 25% discount, this means Kyle paid 75% of the original price (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \). According to the problem, 75% of \( P \) is $19.50. We can write this as:

\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we need to solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's calculate the value of \( P \).
```python
# Calculation
original_price = 19.50 / 0.75
original_price
```
```output
RuntimeError
```
It seems there was an error in the execution environment. Let me perform the calculation manually:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was \( \$26 \).

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered except for the boxes of pizza.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
The cost of 4 apples is \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Adding these together gives:
\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\] dollars.

Marie paid a total of $50. If we subtract the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples from the total amount paid, we can find out how much she spent on the boxes of pizza:
\[50 - 33 = 17\] dollars.

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, we can determine the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered by dividing the amount spent on pizza by the cost per box:
\[17 \div 8.50 = 2\] boxes.

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza. The final numerical answer is:
\[2\]"
"To find out how much Mishka spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of each type of clothing item and then sum them up.

For the shorts:
3 pairs * $16.50 per pair = $59.50

For the pants:
3 pairs * $22.50 per pair = $67.50

For the shoes:
3 pairs * $42 per pair = $126.00

Now, we add the costs together:
$59.50 + $67.50 + $126.00 = $253.00

So, Mishka spent $253.00 on all the clothing items."
"To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of servings she will consume and then find out the total cost based on the price per carton.

First, calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will eat in 60 days:
\[ \text{Total servings} = 60 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ serving/day} = 60 \text{ servings} \]

Next, determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need. Since each carton contains 15 servings:

"To determine how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to calculate the distance from his first stop to his second stop.

Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, so the distance from the start to his first stop is 20 miles.

His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip is 60 miles, the distance to his second stop is:
\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \text{ miles} \]

Now, to find the distance between his first and second stops, we subtract the distance of his first stop from the distance of his second stop:
\[ 45 - 20 = 25 \text{ miles} \]

So, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops."
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

The cost of the first pair of high heels is $33. The cost of the second pair of high heels is twice the cost of the first pair, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ B = 99 + 5 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = 104 \]

So, the cost of the boots is 104 dollars."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen based on the given ratio and total age.

Given:
- The ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11.
- The total age of Darrell and Allen is 162.

Let's denote Darrell's age as \(7x\) and Allen's age as \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The sum of their ages is:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]
\[18x = 162\]
\[x = \frac{162}{18}\]
\[x = 9\]

Now, we can find their current ages:
- Darrell's age: \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\)
- Allen's age: \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\)

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109."
"To find the average guess, we first need to determine each friend's guess and then calculate the average.

1. The first friend's guess is 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60. So, the second friend's guess is 60 jelly beans.
3. The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, and adding that to 80 gives us 100. So, the third friend's guess is 100 jelly beans.

Now, we add up all the guesses and divide by the number of guesses to find the average:

\[ \text{Average guess} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} \]

\[ \text{Average guess} = \frac{240}{3} \]

\[ \text{Average guess} = 80 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 80."
"To determine the total number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs each week, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total hours John spends on one dog per day.
2. Multiply the daily hours for one dog by the number of dogs.

Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business. John takes care of 10 dogs.

First, calculate the total hours for one day:
\[ 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} \times 10 \text{ dogs} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Next, calculate the total hours for one week:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

So, the total number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs each week is:

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these as equations:
\[ G + S = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins \( S \) is 40, we can find the number of gold coins \( G \) using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins."
"First, let's determine how many jewels Aaron has. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Since Raymond has 40 jewels, we can calculate half of Raymond's jewels as follows:

\[ \text{Half of Raymond's jewels} = \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

Now, we add 5 to this number to find out how many jewels Aaron has:

\[ \text{Jewels Aaron has} = 20 + 5 = 25 \]

Next, we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. The problem states that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Therefore, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:

\[ \text{Jewels Siobhan has} = 25 - 2 = 23 \]

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John makes from selling his lego sets. He has 13 lego sets and sells each for $15.

\[ \text{Total money from lego sets} = 13 \times 15 = 195 \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money John spends on the video games. He buys 8 video games for $20 each.

\[ \text{Total money spent on video games} = 8 \times 20 = 160 \]

Now, we can determine how much money John has left after buying the video games. We know he has $5 left after these purchases.

\[ \text{Money left} = 195 - 160 = 35 \]

Since the problem states that John has $5 left, we can verify that the calculation is consistent with the given information.

Finally, since John did not sell any lego sets after the initial sale, he still has all 13 lego sets.

\[ \text{Number of lego sets John still has} = 13 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To find John's speed, we need to determine the total distance he runs and the total time he spends running.

John runs 60 miles a week over 3 days. He runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. So, on the second and third days, he runs 3/2 = 1.5 hours each day.

The total time he spends running in a week is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours (first day)} + 1.5 \text{ hours (second day)} + 1.5 \text{ hours (third day)} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

The total distance he runs in a week is 60 miles. To find his speed, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour.
   - The skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed.
   - Therefore, her running speed is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) miles per hour.

2. **Determine the time spent running and walking:**
   - Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking.
   - The total time is 6 hours.
   - Time spent running = \(\frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2\) hours.
   - Time spent walking = \(\frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4\) hours.

3. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Running speed = 6 miles per hour.
   - Time spent running = 2 hours.
   - Distance traveled while running = \(6 \times 2 = 12\) miles.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Walking speed = 4 times her skipping speed.
   - Since skipping speed is 3 miles per hour, walking speed = \(4 \times 3 = 12\) miles per hour.
   - Time spent walking = 4 hours.
   - Distance traveled while walking = \(12 \times 4 = 48\) miles.

5. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = Distance traveled while running + Distance traveled while walking.
   - Total distance = \(12 + 48 = 60\) miles.

"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to calculate how many calories are left in your daily calorie target.

Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories. Therefore, the remaining calories you can consume are:
\[ 2000 - 1800 = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories are in one serving of chips. According to the nutritional info, one serving of chips has 250 calories.

To find out how many servings of chips you can consume with the remaining 200 calories, we divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories/serving}} = 0.8 \text{ servings} \]

Since one serving is 300 grams, we can calculate the grams of chips you can eat by multiplying the number of servings by the grams per serving:
\[ 0.8 \text{ servings} \times 300 \text{ grams/serving} = 240 \text{ grams} \]

\[ x = 243 - 80 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

Therefore, the number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is 163."
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Given that each blue tie costs $40 and he spent a total of $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of each red tie. Since red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, we calculate the cost of a red tie as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of red tie} = \text{Cost of blue tie} + 0.5 \times \text{Cost of blue tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60 \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost of red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the blue ties and the total cost of the red ties to find the total amount John spent:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost of blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800 \]

Next, we need to find out how many units are occupied. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is:

\[ 120 \text{ units} \times \frac{3}{4} = 90 \text{ units} \]

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

\[ 120 \text{ units} - 90 \text{ units} = 30 \text{ units} \]

So, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"First, we need to determine how many dozens of eggs Lloyd gets from his chickens per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs produced per day by 12:

\[ \text{Total weight of comic books} = 30 \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pounds} \]

\[ \text{Total weight of comic books} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we know that Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds in comic books, the remaining weight that needs to be removed is:

\[ \text{Remaining weight to be removed} = 15 - 7.5 \]

\[ \text{Remaining weight to be removed} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound, so we need to find out how many toys he needs to remove to make up the remaining 7.5 pounds.

\[ \text{Number of toys to be removed} = \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} \]

\[ \text{Number of toys to be removed} = 7.5 \times 2 \]

\[ \text{Number of toys to be removed} = 15 \]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys."

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the brooch before insurance:

Cost of material = $500
Cost of construction = $800

Total cost before insurance = Cost of material + Cost of construction
Total cost before insurance = $500 + $800
Total cost before insurance = $1300

Next, we calculate the cost of insurance, which is 10% of the total cost before insurance:

Cost of insurance = 10% of Total cost before insurance
Cost of insurance = 0.10 * $1300
Cost of insurance = $130

Finally, we add the cost of insurance to the total cost before insurance to find the final amount Janet paid:

"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of work, we need to consider the two different phases of her pension calculation:

1. For the first 20 years, her pension is a flat $50,000 per year.
2. After 20 years, her pension increases by 5% of the value of the pension each year.

Let's calculate her pension at the end of 20 years:
- Initial pension at year 0: $50,000
- Pension at year 20: $50,000 * (1 + 0.05) = $50,000 * 1.05 = $52,500

Now, we need to calculate her pension at the end of 30 years, which is 10 years after the 20-year mark. Each year, her pension increases by 5% of the value at the start of that year.

Let's denote the pension at the start of year \( n \) as \( P_n \). The pension at the start of year 21 is:

"To calculate the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payment into two halves of the year and then sum them up.

First, let's determine the monthly payment for the first half of the year. Since the streaming service charges $140 per month, the total for the first half of the year (6 months) is:
\[ 140 \times 6 = 840 \]

Next, we need to calculate the monthly payment for the second half of the year. The company charges 10% less than the initial amount, so the new monthly rate is:
\[ 140 - (140 \times 0.10) = 140 - 14 = 126 \]
The total for the second half of the year (6 months) is:
\[ 126 \times 6 = 756 \]

Now, we sum the payments from both halves of the year to get the total amount paid by the end of the year:
\[ 840 + 756 = 1596 \]

Therefore, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is:
\[ 1596 \]"
"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to calculate how much gas she has used and how much gas is left in the tank.

Sophia has traveled 100 miles and has put in 4 gallons of gas to refill her tank. This means that the 4 gallons of gas she put in her tank is enough to cover 100 miles. Therefore, the car's fuel efficiency is 100 miles per 4 gallons, which simplifies to 25 miles per gallon.

Since her tank holds 12 gallons of gas, we can calculate the total distance she can drive on a full tank by multiplying the tank capacity by the fuel efficiency:

\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Tank capacity} \times \text{Fuel efficiency} = 12 \text{ gallons} \times 25 \text{ miles per gallon} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 300 miles."
"First, let's determine how many hours Jim spends on TV and reading in one session.

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV. He then reads for half as long as he watches TV, which is:
\[ \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, in one session, he spends:
\[ 2 \text{ hours (TV)} + 1 \text{ hour (reading)} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total time spent in one week is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week} \]

Now, to find out how many hours he spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly total by 4:
\[ 9 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 36 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total amount Shiela will pay each month for 3 months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the cell phones before interest.
2. Calculate the interest on the total cost.
3. Add the interest to the total cost to get the total amount to be paid.
4. Divide the total amount by 3 to find out how much Shiela will pay each month.

Let's start with step 1:

The cost of one cell phone is $150, and Shiela bought five cell phones.
\[ \text{Total cost before interest} = 5 \times 150 = 750 \]

Next, step 2:

The interest rate is 2% per unit. So, for five cell phones, the interest is:
\[ \text{Interest} = 750 \times 0.02 = 15 \]

Now, step 3:

The total amount to be paid is the total cost before interest plus the interest:
\[ \text{Total amount to be paid} = 750 + 15 = 765 \]

Finally, step 4:

To find out how much Shiela will pay each month, we divide the total amount by 3:
\[ \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{765}{3} = 255 \]

"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4 leveled sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level.

Given:
- The top level (level 4) has a square footage of 16.
- Each level below has half the square footage of the level above it.

Let's calculate the square footage for each level:

- Level 4 (top level): 16 square feet.
- Level 3: \(16 \div 2 = 8\) square feet.
- Level 2: \(8 \div 2 = 4\) square feet.
- Level 1: \(4 \div 2 = 2\) square feet.

Now, we have the square footage for each level:
- Level 1: 2 square feet.
- Level 2: 4 square feet.
- Level 3: 8 square feet.
- Level 4: 16 square feet.

To find the average square footage of a level, we sum the square footage of all levels and divide by the number of levels:

"Let's denote the number of games they lost as \( L \) and the number of games they won as \( W \).

According to the problem, the team won 8 more games than they lost, so we can write:
\[ W = L + 8 \]

Also, the total number of games played is 22, so:
\[ W + L = 22 \]

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 2L = 14 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ L = 7 \]

Now, we can find the number of games they won by substituting \( L \) back into the first equation:
\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the number of games they won is 15."
"Gene is 34 years old now and he has been vacationing since he was 23. This means he has been vacationing for 34 - 23 = 11 years. Since he has one shirt from each vacation and each shirt is a quilt block, he has 11 quilt blocks from his first 11 years of vacations. Since he goes on four vacations a year, each row in his quilt will have 4 quilt blocks. To find the total number of quilt blocks, we need to calculate the number of rows, which is the number of years he has been vacationing, and then multiply by the number of quilt blocks per row.

"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Sylvie's initial salary, which is $600.
2. Calculate the 10% increase for the first year of the 10% annual increase policy.
3. Apply the 10% increase for each of the next three years.

First, let's calculate the salary after the first year of the 10% increase:

\[ \text{Salary after 1 year} = \text{Initial Salary} + (\text{Initial Salary} \times 10\%) \]
\[ \text{Salary after 1 year} = 600 + (600 \times 0.10) \]
\[ \text{Salary after 1 year} = 600 + 60 \]
\[ \text{Salary after 1 year} = 660 \]

Next, we apply the 10% increase for the second year:

\[ \text{Salary after 2 years} = \text{Salary after 1 year} + (\text{Salary after 1 year} \times 10\%) \]
\[ \text{Salary after 2 years} = 660 + (660 \times 0.10) \]
\[ \text{Salary after 2 years} = 660 + 66 \]
\[ \text{Salary after 2 years} = 726 \]

Then, we apply the 10% increase for the third year:

\[ \text{Salary after 3 years} = \text{Salary after 2 years} + (\text{Salary after 2 years} \times 10\%) \]
\[ \text{Salary after 3 years} = 726 + (726 \times 0.10) \]
\[ \text{Salary after 3 years} = 726 + 72.6 \]
\[ \text{Salary after 3 years} = 798.6 \]

Finally, we apply the 10% increase for the fourth year:

\[ \text{Salary after 4 years} = \text{Salary after 3 years} + (\text{Salary after 3 years} \times 10\%) \]
\[ \text{Salary after 4 years} = 798.6 + (798.6 \times 0.10) \]
\[ \text{Salary after 4 years} = 798.6 + 79.86 \]
\[ \text{Salary after 4 years} = 878.46 \]

Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is $878.46."
"Let's denote the number of copies Harald's record sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn's record sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both records combined is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies."
"First, let's determine the number of guests who will attend the party. Since 1/4 of the invited friends don't show up, 3/4 of the invited friends will attend.

Christina invited 16 friends, so the number of guests who will attend is:
\[ \text{Number of guests attending} = 16 \times \frac{3}{4} = 12 \]

Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per attending guest. Therefore, the total number of gift bags needed is:
\[ \text{Total gift bags needed} = 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \]

Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost for the gift bags is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

Therefore, Christina will spend $18 on gift bags."
"To determine the total amount of potato salad Ted needs to bring, we first calculate the amount of potato salad consumed by the adults and then by the children.

Each adult dinosaur eats 10 lbs of potato salad. With 20 adults, the total amount of potato salad for adults is:
\[ 20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ lbs/adult} = 200 \text{ lbs} \]

Each child eats half as much as an adult, which is:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ lbs}}{2} = 5 \text{ lbs/child} \]

With 5 children, the total amount of potato salad for children is:
\[ 5 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ lbs/child} = 25 \text{ lbs} \]

Adding the amounts for adults and children together gives the total amount of potato salad needed:
\[ 200 \text{ lbs} + 25 \text{ lbs} = 225 \text{ lbs} \]

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic."
"To find the total number of pets that Jan, Marcia, and Cindy have, we can start by determining the number of pets each person has based on the information provided.

1. Cindy has 4 pets.
2. Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy. Therefore, Marcia has \(4 + 2 = 6\) pets.
3. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia. Therefore, Jan has \(3 \times 6 = 18\) pets.

Now, we can calculate the total number of pets by adding the number of pets each person has:
\[ \text{Total pets} = \text{Cindy's pets} + \text{Marcia's pets} + \text{Jan's pets} = 4 + 6 + 18 = 28 \]

The final numerical answer is 28."
"To solve this, let's set up the relationships given in the problem with variables:

- Let \( J \) be Jackson's age.
- Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Amy's age is \( J + 5 \).
- Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Corey's age is \( J + 5 + 2 = J + 7 \).
- James is 10 years old and 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey's age is \( 10 + 1 = 11 \).

Since Corey's age is 11, we can set up the equation:
\[ J + 7 = 11 \]

Now, solve for \( J \):
\[ J = 11 - 7 \]
\[ J = 4 \]

So, Jackson is 4 years old.

The final numerical answer is:

2. **Number of Cats**: Since there are two cats for every dog, the number of cats is \(2 \times 60 = 120\).
3. **Number of Rabbits**: The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. The combined number of dogs and cats is \(60 + 120 = 180\). Therefore, the number of rabbits is \(180 - 12 = 168\).

Now, to find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits together:
\[ 60 \text{ (dogs)} + 120 \text{ (cats)} + 168 \text{ (rabbits)} = 348 \]

So, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348."
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in Grade 5.

The total number of students is 200. The fraction of students that are boys is \( \frac{2}{5} \).

So, the number of boys is:
\[ \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

The number of girls is the total number of students minus the number of boys:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. The fraction of girls that are in the girl scout is \( \frac{2}{3} \).

So, the number of girls in the girl scout is:
\[ \text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[ \text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 40 \]"
"To find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we first need to calculate how many hours James slept. Since James slept only 2/3 of what Harry slept, we can calculate the hours James slept as follows:

\[ \text{Hours James slept} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 \]

Let's calculate that:
\[ \text{Hours James slept} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

Now, to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we subtract the hours James slept from the hours Harry slept:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Harry's sleep} - \text{James's sleep} = 9 - 6 = 3 \]

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the volume of tomatoes before cooking:**
   - Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces.
   - The tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked.
   - Therefore, before cooking, the volume of tomatoes was twice the volume of the sauce.
   - Volume of tomatoes before cooking = 32 ounces * 2 = 64 ounces.

2. **Determine the number of tomatoes:**
   - Each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes.
   - To find out how many 16-ounce cans are needed to make 64 ounces of tomatoes, we divide the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of one can.
   - Number of 16-ounce cans = 64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans.
   - Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes is:
   - Total number of tomatoes = 4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes.

Therefore, Freda used 12 tomatoes.

The final numerical answer is:
12"
"Let's break down the information given:

- There were originally 30 cars on the motorway.
- 20 more cars drove through the traffic jam in the remaining 15 minutes.
- 5 cars took an exit before the traffic jam ended.
- We need to find out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

From the information given, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 20 - 5 = 30 \]

This equation accounts for the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes (\( x \)), the additional 20 cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes, and the 5 cars that exited before the traffic jam ended, which are subtracted from the total number of cars.

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ x + 15 = 30 \]
\[ x = 30 - 15 \]
\[ x = 15 \]

So, 15 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

The final numerical answer is 15."
"Mary initially has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, which means she has a total of \(2 \times 40 = 80\) potted plants. She is giving away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges, which totals to \(1 \times 40 = 40\) potted plants. Therefore, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is \(80 - 40 = 40\).

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. So, the second friend pressed the doorbell \(20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25\) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. So, the third friend pressed the doorbell \(60 + 10 = 70\) times.

Now, we can calculate the total number of doorbell rings by summing up the rings from all friends:

\[ \text{Total doorbell rings} = 20 + 25 + 60 + 70 \]

Let's calculate the sum:

\[ 20 + 25 = 45 \]
\[ 45 + 60 = 105 \]
\[ 105 + 70 = 175 \]

So, the total number of doorbell rings is 175."
"To find out how many pages Solo needs to read in total, we first calculate the sum of the pages from all his textbooks:

- Science: 4 pages
- Social Studies: 20 pages
- History: 7 pages
- Geography: 8 pages

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday. Therefore, the remaining pages he needs to read are:

Remaining pages = Total pages - Pages read on Monday
Remaining pages = 39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read, on average, in one day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days left:

Pages per day = Remaining pages / Number of days left
Pages per day = 24 / 4 = 6 pages

So, Solo needs to read, on average, 6 pages per day."
"To determine how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to break down his water consumption by weekdays and weekends.

John drinks water with each meal on weekdays (Monday through Friday):
- Breakfast
- Lunch
- Dinner
- Before bed

That's 4 glasses of water per day on weekdays.

So, for 5 weekdays:
\[ 4 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ glasses} \]

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), John drinks a soda with dinner instead of water:
- Dinner

That's 1 glass of water per day on weekends.

So, for 2 weekend days:
\[ 1 \text{ glass/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 2 \text{ glasses} \]

Now, we add the total glasses of water John drinks in a week:
\[ 20 \text{ glasses (weekdays)} + 2 \text{ glasses (weekends)} = 22 \text{ glasses} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many minutes it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance the fog bank needs to cover.
2. Determine the rate at which the fog bank covers the city.
3. Calculate the total time required to cover the entire city.

First, the total distance the fog bank needs to cover is the length of the city, which is 42 miles.

Next, we know that the fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. Therefore, the rate of coverage is 3 miles per 10 minutes.

To find out how many 3-mile segments are in the 42-mile city, we divide the total distance by the distance covered per unit time:
\[ \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/10 minutes}} = 14 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 140 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner volume of one box and then multiply it by 3.

The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. The walls are 1 inch thick, so the inner dimensions of each box are:
- Length: 5 inches - 2 * 1 inch = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - 2 * 1 inch = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - 1 inch = 3 inches

The inner volume of one box is:
\[ \text{Inner Volume} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} = 3 \times 4 \times 3 = 36 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume is:
\[ \text{Total Inner Volume} = 3 \times 36 = 108 \text{ cubic inches} \]

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, let's break down the hours he spent watching TV each day:

- Monday and Tuesday: 1 hour each day, so 2 hours in total.
- Thursday: 1 hour for a 1-hour episode and 0.5 hours (30 minutes) for a 30-minute show, so 1.5 hours in total.
- Friday: 2 hours for two 1-hour episodes.

Now, let's add up the hours for Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 5.5 \text{ hours} \]

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. So, the hours he spent watching TV on Wednesday can be calculated as:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} - 5.5 \text{ hours} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \]

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is:
\[ \frac{1.5 \text{ hours}}{0.5 \text{ hours/episode}} = 3 \text{ episodes} \]

Therefore, the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday is 3."
"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry meant to bake as \( x \). According to the problem, he actually baked twice as many as he meant to, which is \( 2x \). He then realized he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so he actually baked \( 2x = x + 15 \). This means \( x = 15 \).

After baking, he drops 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x - 5 \). We know that after dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2x - 5 = 110 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ 2x - 5 = 110 \]
\[ 2x = 115 \]
\[ x = 57.5 \]

Since \( x \) represents the number of cookies Henry meant to bake, and we know he actually baked twice that amount, the number of cookies he baked last year is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 57.5 = 115 \]

So, Henry baked 115 cookies last year. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the speed at which Julia rows the boat. It takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Therefore, her speed is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet per second} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes her to row the entire 64 seconds distance to the shore:

\[ \text{Time to row 64 seconds} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds per 20 feet}} = 4 \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. To find out how much water the boat took on during the 80 feet row, we can set up a proportion:

\[ \text{Water taken on} = \left( \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 80 \text{ feet} = \frac{2 \times 80}{10} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

   \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is **880 dollars**."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours the hospital sees patients in a day. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can divide the total minutes by 60 to get the hours.

Total minutes seen per day = 500 people * 24 minutes/person = 12000 minutes

Total hours seen per day = 12000 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 200 hours

Next, we calculate the revenue generated by the hospital from the doctors' fees and the patients' fees.

Revenue from doctors' fees = 200 hours * $150/hour = $30000

Revenue from patients' fees = 500 people * $200/person = $100000

Total revenue = Revenue from doctors' fees + Revenue from patients' fees
Total revenue = $30000 + $100000 = $130000

Now, we need to calculate the total cost incurred by the hospital. Since the problem does not specify any other costs, we assume the only cost is the doctors' fees.

Total cost = $30000

Finally, we calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $130000 - $30000 = $100000

The hospital makes a profit of $100000 from these visits."
"Initially, Nissa hires 60 seasonal workers. A third of them quit after children vomit on them, which means \( \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \) elves quit. So, the number of elves remaining is \( 60 - 20 = 40 \).

Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. Therefore, the number of elves left is \( 40 - 10 = 30 \).

The final numerical answer is 30."
"In June, Joseph's expenditure was $500 - $60 = $440.

"First, let's calculate the number of tickets Pam used:

- Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times.
- Each ride costs 6 tickets.
- Therefore, the tickets used for the roller coaster by Pam = 2 rides * 6 tickets/ride = 12 tickets.

Next, let's calculate the number of tickets Fred used:

- Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times.
- Each ride costs 6 tickets.
- Therefore, the tickets used for the roller coaster by Fred = 4 rides * 6 tickets/ride = 24 tickets.

Now, let's calculate the number of tickets they used for the luge:

- Each of them rode the luge 2 times.
- Each ride costs 6 tickets.
- Therefore, the tickets used for the luge by Pam = 2 rides * 6 tickets/ride = 12 tickets.
- Similarly, the tickets used for the luge by Fred = 2 rides * 6 tickets/ride = 12 tickets.

Now, let's add up all the tickets used:

- Tickets used by Pam = 12 tickets (roller coaster) + 12 tickets (lugue) = 24 tickets.
- Tickets used by Fred = 24 tickets (roller coaster) + 12 tickets (lugue) = 36 tickets.

Finally, the total number of tickets used by both Pam and Fred is:

- Total tickets used = 24 tickets (Pam) + 36 tickets (Fred) = 60 tickets.

The final numerical answer is 60."
"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, let's break down the information given:

- On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.
- On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he did on Monday, which is \(6 \times 4 = 24\) miles.
- The total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles.

To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we can subtract the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage:

\[ \text{Miles walked on Wednesday} = \text{Total mileage} - (\text{Miles on Monday} + \text{Miles on Tuesday}) \]

\[ \text{Miles walked on Wednesday} = 41 - (4 + 24) \]

\[ \text{Miles walked on Wednesday} = 41 - 28 \]

\[ \text{Miles walked on Wednesday} = 13 \]

So, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday."
"To calculate the total cost Tom pays in a year for car washes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of car washes Tom gets in a year. Since he gets 4 car washes a month, in a year (which has 12 months), he gets:
   \[
   4 \text{ car washes/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 48 \text{ car washes/year}
   \]

2. Calculate the total cost for 48 car washes at $15 each:
   \[
   48 \text{ car washes} \times \$15/\text{car wash} = \$720
   \]

So, the total amount Tom pays in a year for car washes is $720."
"First, let's determine how many video games Brian has after losing 5 of them. Brian originally has 20 video games, but he lost 5, so:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Now, we know that Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian has. Since Brian now has 15 video games, we calculate 3 times that number:

\[ 3 \times 15 = 45 \]

Then, we subtract 5 from this number to find out how many video games Bobby has:

\[ 45 - 5 = 40 \]

So, Bobby has 40 video games. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 40 \]"

Next, we need to find out how many of these Scottish unicorns are female. Since two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Number of female Scottish unicorns} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

So, the number of female Scottish unicorns is 6."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the subs:
2 subs * $7.50/sub = $15.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of the chips:
2 bags * $1.50/bag = $3.00

Then, let's calculate the cost of the cookies:
2 cookies * $1.00/cookie = $2.00

Now, let's add up the cost of the subs, chips, and cookies:
$15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

The delivery fee is 20% of the subtotal:
20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00

Adding the delivery fee to the subtotal:
$20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

For the first test:
- Total questions: 75
- Rate: 5 questions per hour
- Time available: 8 hours

First, calculate the number of questions Mark completed on the first test:
\[ \text{Questions completed} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time available} = 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

Next, calculate the number of questions left incomplete on the first test:
\[ \text{Incomplete questions} = \text{Total questions} - \text{Questions completed} = 75 - 40 = 35 \]

For the second test:
- Total questions: 100

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine how many semi-automatic cars there are. We know there are 20 cars in total, 12 of which are automatic and 4 are manual. The rest are semi-automatic.

Let's calculate the number of semi-automatic cars:
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = \text{Total cars} - (\text{Automatic cars} + \text{Manual cars}) \]
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 20 - (12 + 4) \]
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 20 - 16 \]
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 4 \]

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total cars}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = 0.2 \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = 20\% \]

"Let's denote the number of queens as \( Q \), the number of baby bees as \( B \), and the number of worker bees as \( W \).

According to the problem:
1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so \( W = 2B \).
2. There are twice as many baby bees as queens, so \( B = 2Q \).

The total number of bees is 700, so:
\[ W + B + Q = 700 \]

Substituting \( W = 2B \) and \( B = 2Q \) into the total number of bees equation:
\[ 2B + B + Q = 700 \]
\[ 3B + Q = 700 \]

Since \( B = 2Q \), we can substitute \( B \) with \( 2Q \) in the equation:
\[ 3(2Q) + Q = 700 \]
\[ 6Q + Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now, we can find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]
\[ W = 2B = 2 \times 200 = 400 \]

Therefore, the number of worker bees is 400."

"First, let's calculate the total cost of nonfood items before tax:

- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

Total cost of nonfood items = $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $15

Next, we calculate the tax on the nonfood items. The tax rate is 10%, so the tax amount is:

Tax amount = 10% of $15 = 0.10 * $15 = $1.50

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of nonfood items to get the final cost:

Final cost of nonfood items = $15 + $1.50 = $16.50

The cost of food items (milk, eggs, light bulbs, cups, and roach traps) does not include tax, so we do not add tax to these items. The cost of food items is:

Cost of food items = $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $15

Finally, we add the cost of food items to the final cost of nonfood items to get the total cost:

Total cost = Cost of food items + Final cost of nonfood items = $15 + $16.50 = $31.50

The final numerical answer is $31.50."

- Profit: $92 - $72 = $20

Therefore, the profit, in dollars, that Kim will make each week is $20."
"To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of harvests John can have in a year.
2. Determine the total number of pineapples harvested based on the number of harvests.

First, since John harvests his pineapples every 3 months, we need to find out how many 3-month periods there are in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so:

\[ \text{Number of harvests in a year} = \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests} \]

Next, we know that John has 100 pineapples per hectare and he has 10 hectares of pineapple field. Therefore, the total number of pineapples per harvest is:

\[ \text{Total pineapples per harvest} = 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} \times 10 \text{ hectares} = 1000 \text{ pineapples} \]

Since John can harvest 4 times in a year, the total number of pineapples he can harvest in a year is:

\[ \text{Total pineapples in a year} = 4 \text{ harvests} \times 1000 \text{ pineapples/harvest} = 4000 \text{ pineapples} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Bees leaving the hive in the first 6 hours:**
   Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.

2. **Bees returning in the next 6 hours:**
   Debra sees \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the 30 bees return, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \) bees.

3. **Bees leaving the hive in the next 6 hours:**
   Debra sees twice as many bees leave as those that left in the first 6 hours. Since 30 bees left in the first 6 hours, twice that number is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees.

4. **Bee returns in the last 6 hours:**
   In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left in the first two 6-hour periods return to the hive. The total number of bees that left in the first two 6-hour periods is \( 30 + 60 = 90 \) bees. Therefore, in the last 6 hours, all 90 bees that left return to the hive.

So, the number of bees that Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours is 90.

"To find out how many Facebook friends James has, we first need to determine how many friends Dorothy has. We know that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends.

Let's denote the number of Dorothy's friends as \( D \). According to the information given:

\[ 3D = 12 \]

To find \( D \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ D = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

So, Dorothy has 4 friends. Now, we know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Therefore, we can calculate the number of James's friends as follows:

\[ \text{Number of James's friends} = 4D = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

Thus, James has 16 Facebook friends. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

First, let's convert the distance from miles to feet since the speeds are given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for each of them to travel the distance.

Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

The winner is Steve, who takes 36 minutes to get home. The loser is Tim, who takes 40 minutes to get home. The difference in their times is:

40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

So, the winner (Steve) will be waiting at their house 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race."
"To calculate the total amount Shawnda made, we need to determine the cost of inflating the tires for each type of vehicle and then sum these costs.

1. For the bicycles: Each bicycle has 2 tires, and each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. Since 5 people came with bicycles, the total cost for the bicycles is:
   \[
   5 \text{ bicycles} \times 2 \text{ tires/bicycle} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 5 \times 2 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 250 \text{ cents}
   \]
   Converting cents to dollars:
   \[
   250 \text{ cents} = 2.50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. For the tricycles: Each tricycle has 3 tires, and each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. Since 3 people came with tricycles, the total cost for the tricycles is:
   \[
   3 \text{ tricycles} \times 3 \text{ tires/tricycle} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 3 \times 3 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 225 \text{ cents}

"Let's work backwards from the final number of fries to find out how many were in the pack initially.

1. After the raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries, five fries were left. This means that the five fries represent one third of the fries that were left before the raccoon stole them. Therefore, before the raccoon, there were \(5 \times 3 = 15\) fries.
2. The three pigeons each ate three fries, so they ate a total of \(3 \times 3 = 9\) fries. This means that before the pigeons ate, there were \(15 + 9 = 24\) fries.
3. Dave ate 14 fries, and the seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \(14 / 2 = 7\) fries. This means that before the seagull ate, there were \(24 + 14 + 7 = 45\) fries.
4. The seagull stole the pack, and Dave ate 14 fries before the seagull came. Therefore, the total number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it was \(45 + 14 = 59\).

"To calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly class schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has three 1-hour classes each day. So, the total number of hours he spends on these days is:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ classes/day} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes each day. So, the total number of hours he spends on these days is:
\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ classes/day} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Adding the hours from both sets of days gives the total number of hours he spends on classes each week:
\[ 9 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours/week} \]

Since there are 16 weeks in the semester, the total number of hours he spends attending classes in one semester is:

"First, let's convert all the lengths to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll use inches for this problem.

Each roll is 4 inches long, and Bill bakes 300 rolls every day. So, the total length of the rolls in inches is:
\[ 300 \text{ rolls} \times 4 \text{ inches/roll} = 1200 \text{ inches} \]

Each croissant is 6 inches long, and Bill bakes 120 croissants every day. So, the total length of the croissants in inches is:
\[ 120 \text{ croissants} \times 6 \text{ inches/croissant} = 720 \text{ inches} \]

Each baguette is 2 feet long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is:
\[ 2 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 24 \text{ inches} \]
Bill bakes 60 baguettes every day. So, the total length of the baguettes in inches is:
\[ 60 \text{ baguettes} \times 24 \text{ inches/baguette} = 1440 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we add the lengths of all the baked goods together to get the total length in inches:
\[ 1200 \text{ inches} + 720 \text{ inches} + 1440 \text{ inches} = 3360 \text{ inches} \]

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[ 3360 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 280 \text{ feet} \]

So, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is 280 feet."
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order to last for 2 months, we need to calculate the monthly requirement for each type of ape and then multiply by 2.

For the monkeys:
- Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
- For 2 months, the monkeys need \(200 \times 2 = 400\) bananas.

For the gorillas:
- Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
- For 2 months, the gorillas need \(400 \times 2 = 800\) bananas.

For the baboons:
- Baboons need 100 bananas per month.
- For 2 months, the baboons need \(100 \times 2 = 200\) bananas.

Now, we sum up the total number of bananas needed for all the apes over 2 months:
- Total bananas for monkeys: 400
- Total bananas for gorillas: 800
- Total bananas for baboons: 200

Adding these together:
\[ 400 + 800 + 200 = 1400 \]

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"To determine how far Blake and Kelly each run, we need to calculate the total distance each of them covers.

First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs:
- Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field.
- Each round trip is 2 * 100 yards.
- Therefore, the total distance Blake runs is 15 * (2 * 100) = 15 * 200 = 3000 yards.

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs:
- Kelly runs back and forth once to the 40-yard line and back, which is 2 * 40 yards = 80 yards.
- Kelly does this 34 times.
- Therefore, the total distance Kelly runs is 34 * 80 = 2720 yards.

Now, we compare the distances:
- Blake runs 3000 yards.
- Kelly runs 2720 yards.

The difference in the distance they run is:
3000 - 2720 = 280 yards.

The winner, Blake, runs 280 yards farther than the loser, Kelly."

"First, let's calculate the number of each type of fish caught by Locsin:

- Starfish: Anakin caught 10 starfish, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.
- Sea horses: Anakin caught 6 sea horses, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
- Clownfish: Anakin caught 3 clownfish, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's add up the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin:

- Starfish: 10 (Anakin) + 5 (Locsin) = 15 starfish.
- Sea horses: 6 (Anakin) + 3 (Locsin) = 9 sea horses.
- Clownfish: 3 (Anakin) + 5 (Locsin) = 8 clownfish.

Finally, let's add up all the fish caught:

15 (starfish) + 9 (sea horses) + 8 (clownfish) = 32 fish.

So, the final numerical answer is 32."
"To find the final cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase step by step.

The original price of a bag of marbles is $20. The price increases by 20% every two months. Since 36 months is equivalent to 18 periods of two months, we will calculate the price after each two-month period.

Let's denote the original price as \( P_0 = 20 \).

After the first two months, the price \( P_1 \) will be:
\[ P_1 = P_0 + 0.20 \times P_0 = 20 + 0.20 \times 20 = 20 + 4 = 24 \]

After the next two months (4 months total), the price \( P_2 \) will be:
\[ P_2 = P_1 + 0.20 \times P_1 = 24 + 0.20 \times 24 = 24 + 4.8 = 28.8 \]

We can see that the price after each two-month period can be calculated using the formula:
\[ P_n = P_{n-1} \times 1.20 \]

Since 36 months is 18 periods of two months, the price after 36 months will be:
\[ P_{18} = P_0 \times (1.20)^{18} \]

Now, let's calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \):
\[ (1.20)^{18} \approx 10.4277 \]

Therefore, the price after 36 months will be:
\[ P_{18} = 20 \times 10.4277 \approx 208.554 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the final cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is:
\[ \boxed{208.55} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of one red car. According to the information given, one red car costs $4.

Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and an action figure costs $5, the cost of 3 action figures is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]
Therefore, the doll costs $15.

Now, we know the cost of one red car is $4, and the doll costs $15. We need to find the total cost of all the toys:
- Red cars: 5 cars at $4 each = \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \)
- Action figures: 3 figures at $5 each = \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \)
- Doll: $15

Adding these together gives the total cost of all the toys:
\[ 20 + 15 + 15 = 50 \]

So, the total value of all the toys is $50."
"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the missed income from doing her taxes herself and then compare it to the cost of hiring the accountant.

Jackie loses $35/hour from doing her taxes herself. If we assume she works for a certain number of hours, let's denote the number of hours she would work if she hires the accountant as \( H \). The missed income from doing her taxes herself would be \( 35H \).

The cost of hiring the accountant is $90. To find out how much more money she will have if she hires the accountant, we need to compare the missed income to the cost of hiring the accountant. However, since the number of hours \( H \) is not provided, we can only express the difference in terms of \( H \).

The missed income from doing her taxes herself is \( 35H \). The cost of hiring the accountant is $90. Therefore, the additional money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant is:

\[ 35H - 90 \]

Without the specific number of hours \( H \), we cannot provide a numerical answer. However, if we assume \( H \) is given or can be determined, the formula above will give the exact additional money Jackie will have."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the computer accessories Elvira bought:

- Screen: €157
- Keyboard and mouse: €74
- Scanner: €102
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Total cost of accessories = €157 + €74 + €102 + €74 + €102 = €509

Elvira's total budget is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost of the accessories from her budget:

Money left for clothing = €1500 - €509 = €991

So, the final numerical answer is €991."
"To determine how many times Sandra has to babysit to make 15 Spanish flans, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs needed to make 15 flans.
2. Determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit to collect the required number of eggs.

First, Sandra needs 3 eggs to make one flan. Therefore, for 15 flans, she needs:
\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, Sandra receives 9 eggs every time she babysits. To find out how many times she needs to babysit to get 45 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session:
\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysittings} \]

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit 5 times to make 15 Spanish flans."
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write:
\[ S = 2B \]

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write:
\[ (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \]

Substituting \( S = 2B \) into the equation, we get:
\[ (B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28 \]
\[ 3B + 4 = 28 \]

Now, we solve for \( B \):
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Since \( S = 2B \), we substitute \( B = 8 \) into the equation:
\[ S = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 16 \]"
"If Ethel has $8, then twice the money Ethel has is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars. Jimmy has $2 more than this amount, so Jimmy has \(16 + 2 = 18\) dollars.

"To calculate the total miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to consider his daily walking distance and the fact that he walks 10 miles on weekends.

From Monday to Friday, he walks 20 miles each day. So, for 5 days, he walks:
\[ 20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles} \]

On Saturday and Sunday, he walks 10 miles each day. So, for 2 days, he walks:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Adding the miles from the weekdays and the weekend days together:
\[ 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total number of miles Pancho walks in a week is 120 miles."
"First, let's determine the cost of each item:

- The cost of the hat is $25.
- The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat, so it is \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.
- The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket. The average is calculated as \(\frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50\) dollars.

Now, to find the total cost of each uniform, we add the cost of the hat, the jacket, and the pants:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \]

So, the total cost of each uniform is $150."
"To find the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to calculate the legs from each group of creatures and then sum them up.

For the spiders:
80 spiders * 8 legs each = 640 legs

For the insects:
90 insects * 6 legs each = 540 legs

For the rare mutant invertebrates:
3 invertebrates * 10 legs each = 30 legs

Now, we add the legs from each group:
640 legs (spiders) + 540 legs (insects) + 30 legs (rare invertebrates) = 1210 legs

So, the total number of legs Jake sees is 1210."
"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

1. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, we need to find the total age of the four birds. Since the question mentions ""four birds at the Caboose,"" and we have the ages of Sally Two, Granny Red, Sally Four, and Sally Thirtytwo, we can sum these ages:

\[ \text{Total age} = 19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 51 \]

So, the total age of the four birds is 51."
"To determine how much Jessica pays in a year if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we first need to calculate the total minimum monthly payments for all her debts.

The minimum monthly payments are:
- Student loans: $300
- Credit card: $200
- Mortgage: $500

Total minimum monthly payments = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. To find 50% more, we calculate 50% of $1000 and add it to the original minimum.

50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500

So, the total monthly payment Jessica wants to make is:
$1000 + $500 = $1500

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12 (the number of months in a year).

Total annual payment = $1500 * 12 = $18000

The final numerical answer is $18000."
"To determine how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel and cut each potato and then multiply by the total number of potatoes.

First, let's calculate the time to peel and cut one potato:
- Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
- Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

Convert the time to peel one potato to seconds for easier calculation:
- 1.5 minutes = 1.5 * 60 seconds = 90 seconds

Now, add the time to peel and cut one potato:
- Time to peel and cut one potato = 90 seconds (peeling) + 5 seconds (cutting) = 95 seconds

Next, calculate the total time for 60 potatoes:
- Total time = 95 seconds/potato * 60 potatoes = 5700 seconds

Finally, convert the total time from seconds to minutes:
- 5700 seconds = 5700 / 60 minutes = 95 minutes

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes."
"First, let's determine the total revenue from selling lemonade. They sell 20 glasses per gallon at $0.50 per glass. Therefore, the revenue from selling one gallon of lemonade is:

\[ 20 \text{ glasses/gallon} \times \$0.50/\text{glass} = \$10/\text{gallon} \]

Given that their profit is $25, we can use the profit formula to find the total cost. The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. Let's denote the total cost as \( C \). The total revenue is \( \$10 \) per gallon. If they made one gallon of lemonade, the profit equation is:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} \]
\[ \$25 = \$10 - C \]

Solving for \( C \):

\[ C = \$10 - \$25 \]
\[ C = -\$15 \]

This negative value indicates an error in the interpretation. Since they made a profit, the total cost must be less than the total revenue. Let's assume they made more than one gallon of lemonade. Let \( n \) be the number of gallons they made. The total revenue from selling \( n \) gallons is:

\[ \text{Total Revenue} = \$10n \]

The total cost for \( n \) gallons is:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 3n + 2n = 5n \]

The profit equation is:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} \]
\[ \$25 = \$10n - 5n \]
\[ \$25 = 5n \]
\[ n = \frac{\$25}{5} \]
\[ n = 5 \]

So, they made 5 gallons of lemonade. The total cost for 5 gallons is:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 5n = 5 \times 5 = \$25 \]

The cost for lemons is $3 per gallon, so for 5 gallons, the cost for lemons is:

\[ \text{Cost for Lemons} = 3 \times 5 = \$15 \]

Therefore, the amount they spent on lemons is:

\[ \$15 \]"
"To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we first need to determine the total number of Chinese participants. Given that there are 240 Asians in total and 80 of them are Japanese, the rest must be Chinese. 

So, the number of Chinese participants is:
\[ 240 - 80 = 160 \]

We know that the total number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. Therefore, the number of girls on the Chinese team can be found by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Thus, the number of girls on the Chinese team is:
\[ 160 - 60 = 100 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 100 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the amount spent on rent:**
   Zaid spends \( \frac{1}{4} \) of his salary on rent.
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount spent on car fuel:**
   Zaid spends \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his salary on car fuel.
   \[
   \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining amount after rent and car fuel:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the amount donated to charity:**
   Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
   \[
   \text{Charity donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the remaining amount after the charity donation:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Calculate the total expenses for his daughter and wife:**
   Zaid gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$.
   \[
   \text{Total expenses} = 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ dollars}
   \]

7. **Calculate the final remaining amount:**

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of crabs Bo has:**
   - Bo has 40 crabs.

2. **Determine the number of crabs Monic has:**
   - Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo.
   - Therefore, Monic has \( 40 - 4 = 36 \) crabs.

3. **Determine the number of crabs Rani has:**
   - Rani has ten more crabs than Monic.
   - Therefore, Rani has \( 36 + 10 = 46 \) crabs.

4. **Calculate the total number of crabs the three have together:**
   - Total crabs = Crabs by Bo + Crabs by Monic + Crabs by Rani
   - Total crabs = \( 40 + 36 + 46 \)

Now, let's add these numbers together:

\[
40 + 36 + 46 = 122
\]

So, the total number of crabs the three have together is 122."
"To calculate Lloyd's earnings for the first two weeks, we need to multiply the number of hours he tutored each week by his hourly rate and then add the totals together.

For the first week:
5 hours * $10/hour = $50

8 hours * $10/hour = $80

Now, we add the earnings from both weeks:
$50 + $80 = $130

Therefore, Lloyd earned $130 for the first two weeks."
"If the winner got \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the votes, then the loser must have gotten the remaining \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the votes. 

Given that the total number of students who voted was 80, the number of votes the loser got can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = \frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20
\]

So, the number of votes the loser got is 20."
"Let's denote the number of white carnations Sandra ordered as \( w \).

From the information given:
1. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, so the number of red roses is \( 4w \).
2. Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which are five times the number of white carnations, so \( 200 = 5w \).

First, we need to find the value of \( w \) from the equation \( 200 = 5w \):
\[ w = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Now, we can find the number of red roses Sandra ordered:
\[ \text{Number of red roses} = 4w = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find Jean's age, let's break down the information given:

1. Jan's current age is 30.
2. Two years ago, Mark's age was 5 years less than half of Jan's age at that time.

First, let's calculate Jan's age two years ago:
\[ \text{Jan's age two years ago} = 30 - 2 = 28 \]

Next, we calculate half of Jan's age two years ago:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 28 = 14 \]

According to the information given, two years ago Mark's age was 5 years less than this value:
\[ \text{Mark's age two years ago} = 14 - 5 = 9 \]

Now, we need to find Mark's current age:
\[ \text{Mark's current age} = 9 + 2 = 11 \]

Jean is two years older than Mark:
\[ \text{Jean's current age} = 11 + 2 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jean is 13 years old."
"To determine the winner and the margin of victory, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay.

For the first team, each member runs their leg in 55 seconds. Since there are four members, the total time for the first team is:
\[ 55 \text{ seconds/member} \times 4 \text{ members} = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

For the second team, the first runner takes 60 seconds, the second runner takes 57 seconds (3 seconds faster than the first), the third runner takes 54 seconds (3 seconds faster than the second), and the fourth runner takes 51 seconds (3 seconds faster than the third). The total time for the second team is:
\[ 60 \text{ seconds} + 57 \text{ seconds} + 54 \text{ seconds} + 51 \text{ seconds} = 222 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, we find the difference in the total times of the two teams:

Therefore, the faster team (the first team) will win by:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then compare them.

First, let's determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

\[ P(\text{number greater than 3}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Next, let's determine the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:

\[ P(\text{even on first roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll, given that the first roll was even, is also:

\[ P(\text{even on second roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of both events happening (rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll) is:

\[ P(\text{even on first and second roll}) = P(\text{even on first roll}) \times P(\text{even on second roll}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25 \]

Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. This is the difference in the probabilities divided by the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, then expressed as a percentage.

\[ \text{Difference in probabilities} = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 \]

\[ \text{Percentage more likely} = \left( \frac{0.25}{0.25} \right) \times 100\% = 100\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 100 \]"

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
2. There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
3. There are 20 pieces of straw distributed among the rabbits.
4. The total number of pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents is 160.

First, we calculate the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters:
\[ 10 \text{ cages} \times 5 \text{ pieces per hamster} = 50 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we subtract the number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters and the rabbits from the total number of pieces of straw to find out how many pieces of straw were given to the rats:
\[ 160 \text{ pieces} - 50 \text{ pieces} - 20 \text{ pieces} = 90 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we know that the 90 pieces of straw were given to the rats, and each rat received 6 pieces. To find out how many rats there are, we divide the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats by the number of pieces each rat received:
\[ \frac{90 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per rat}} = 15 \text{ rats} \]

Since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, we divide the total number of rats by the number of cages:
\[ \frac{15 \text{ rats}}{3 \text{ cages}} = 5 \text{ rats per cage} \]

Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is 5. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"To calculate the amount Mandy should give Benedict after 3 months, we need to consider the initial amount and the monthly interest.

The initial amount Mandy owes is $100. The monthly interest rate is 2%, which can be expressed as a decimal: 0.02.

The interest for the first month is:
\[ 100 \times 0.02 = 2 \]

So, after the first month, the total amount Mandy owes is:
\[ 100 + 2 = 102 \]

For the second month, the interest is:
\[ 102 \times 0.02 = 2.04 \]

So, after the second month, the total amount Mandy owes is:
\[ 102 + 2.04 = 104.04 \]

For the third month, the interest is:
\[ 104.04 \times 0.02 = 2.0808 \]

So, after the third month, the total amount Mandy owes is:
\[ 104.04 + 2.0808 = 106.1208 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent (since currency is typically expressed to two decimal places), Mandy should give Benedict $106.12.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 106.12 \]"
"Let's denote the number of bags of wheat as \( n \).

The cost per bag includes the purchase price and the transportation cost:
\[ \text{Cost per bag} = \$20 + \$2 = \$22 \]

The selling price per bag is:
\[ \text{Selling price per bag} = \$30 \]

The profit per bag is:
\[ \text{Profit per bag} = \text{Selling price per bag} - \text{Cost per bag} = \$30 - \$22 = \$8 \]

The total profit is given as $400. Therefore, the total profit can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Total profit} = \text{Profit per bag} \times n = \$8 \times n \]

Given that the total profit is $400, we can set up the equation:
\[ 8n = 400 \]

To find \( n \), we solve for \( n \):
\[ n = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food:

The cost of the tickets is $20.25.

The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, so:
\[ \text{Cost of food} = \$20.25 - \$4.50 = \$15.75 \]

Next, we add the cost of the tickets and the cost of the food to find the total cost of the tickets and food:
\[ \text{Total cost of tickets and food} = \$20.25 + \$15.75 = \$36.00 \]

Now, we add the cost of the rides. They went on 2 different rides, each costing $33:
\[ \text{Total cost of rides} = 2 \times \$33 = \$66.00 \]

The total cost for all expenses is the sum of the cost of tickets and food and the cost of the rides:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$36.00 + \$66.00 = \$102.00 \]

Since they agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:
\[ \text{Cost per person} = \frac{\$102.00}{3} = \$34.00 \]

So, each of them paid:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"To determine the total number of peaches John collects, we need to calculate the product of the number of minutes he spends collecting peaches and the number of peaches he collects per minute.

"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ten ducks need per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of insects needed per day for one duck.
2. Multiply the daily amount needed for one duck by the number of ducks in the flock.

First, we know that the total amount of insects needed per week for one duck is 3.5 pounds. There are 7 days in a week, so the amount of insects needed per day for one duck is:

\[ \text{Daily amount for one duck} = \frac{3.5 \text{ pounds}}{7 \text{ days}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Now, for a flock of ten ducks, the total amount of insects needed per day is:

\[ \text{Total daily amount for ten ducks} = 0.5 \text{ pounds/day} \times 10 = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

5"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.

2. **Trees planted each year**: Tom plants 10 trees each year.
3. **Trees chopped down each year**: Tom chops down 2 trees each year.
4. **Net increase in trees each year**: The net increase in trees each year is \(10 - 2 = 8\) trees.
5. **Number of years**: We are considering 10 years.

First, calculate the total number of trees after 10 years without considering the trees that die:

\[ \text{Total trees after 10 years} = \text{Initial trees} + (\text{Net increase per year} \times \text{Number of years}) \]
\[ \text{Total trees after 10 years} = 50 + (8 \times 10) \]
\[ \text{Total trees after 10 years} = 50 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total trees after 10 years} = 130 \]

Next, 30% of the trees die after 10 years:

\[ \text{Number of trees that die} = 0.30 \times 130 \]
\[ \text{Number of trees that die} = 39 \]

Finally, calculate the number of trees left after the trees die:

\[ \text{Number of trees left} = \text{Total trees after 10 years} - \text{Number of trees that die} \]
\[ \text{Number of trees left} = 130 - 39 \]
\[ \text{Number of trees left} = 91 \]

So, the final number of trees Tom has left after 10 years is 91."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of pink flamingos:** 18

2. **On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos and painted them white:**
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \)
   - So, 6 pink flamingos were taken back and painted white.

3. **After the neighbors took back and painted 6 flamingos:**
   - The number of pink flamingos left is \( 18 - 6 = 12 \)
   - The number of white flamingos added is 6

4. **On Sunday morning, they added another 18 pink flamingos:**
   - The total number of pink flamingos now is \( 12 + 18 = 30 \)

5. **At noon on Sunday, the number of white flamingos remains 6.**

6. **To find how many more pink flamingos there are than white flamingos:**
   - The difference is \( 30 - 6 = 24 \)

Therefore, at noon on Sunday, there are 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos."
"Violetta needs crayons in 5 different colors, and each crayon costs $2. Therefore, the total cost for the crayons is:

\[ 5 \text{ crayons} \times \$2 \text{ per crayon} = \$10 \]

"First, let's determine the cost of a pen. Since a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined, we add the cost of a pencil and an eraser:

Cost of a pencil = $1.20
Cost of an eraser = $0.30

Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser
Cost of a pen = $1.20 + $0.30
Cost of a pen = $1.50

Now, to find out how much 8 pens will cost, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8:

Cost of 8 pens = Cost of one pen × 8
Cost of 8 pens = $1.50 × 8
Cost of 8 pens = $12.00

Therefore, the final numerical answer is $12.00."
"To determine how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we first need to calculate the total amount of carrots that will be distributed to the 40 restaurants.

Each restaurant receives 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. Therefore, the total amount of carrots distributed is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds/restaurant} \times 40 \text{ restaurants} = 80 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of carrots available is 200 pounds. To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we subtract the total amount distributed from the total amount available:
\[ 200 \text{ pounds} - 80 \text{ pounds} = 120 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used is:
\[ 120 \]"
"To find the number of children in the city of Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

Total population = 23786
Number of men = 8417
Number of women = 9092

Number of children = Total population - (Number of men + Number of women)

Let's calculate the number of children:
Number of children = 23786 - (8417 + 9092)

First, add the number of men and women:
8417 + 9092 = 17509

Now, subtract this sum from the total population:
23786 - 17509 = 6277

Therefore, the number of children in Soda is 6277."
"To find the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now, we need to calculate the number of cards she collected each month and then sum them up.

1. **First Month:**
   Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards. After a month, she collected three times that number.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ cards}
   \]
   So, after the first month, she has:
   \[
   20 + 60 = 80 \text{ cards}
   \]

2. **Second Month:**
   In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40 \text{ cards}
   \]
   So, after the second month, she has:
   \[
   80 + 40 = 120 \text{ cards}
   \]

3. **Third Month:**
   In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months.
   \[
   2 \times (60 + 40) = 2 \times 100 = 200 \text{ cards}
   \]
   So, after the third month, she has:
   \[
   120 + 200 = 320 \text{ cards}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now is:
\[
\boxed{320}

"First, let's determine how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher each week. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers and a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B.

Next, we know that Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, the amount Mark earns from Publisher A each week is:
\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays Mark:
\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10 \text{ cents/sentence} \]

Therefore, the amount Mark earns from Publisher B each week is:
\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

To find out how much Mark makes in a week in total, we add the earnings from both publishers:
\[ 2500 \text{ cents} + 5000 \text{ cents} = 7500 \text{ cents} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 7500 \]"

"To calculate how much money John made that year after winning the award, we need to consider both the monetary reward and the raise in his salary.

First, let's calculate the raise in his salary:
- John's current weekly salary is $2000.
- The raise is 5% of his current salary.

\[ \text{Raise} = 2000 \times 0.05 = 100 \]

So, his new weekly salary after the raise is:
\[ \text{New Weekly Salary} = 2000 + 100 = 2100 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money he makes in a year from his new weekly salary:
- There are 52 weeks in a year.

\[ \text{Total Yearly Salary} = 2100 \times 52 = 109200 \]

Now, we add the one-time monetary reward of $5000 to his total yearly salary:

\[ \text{Total Yearly Income} = 109200 + 5000 = 114200 \]

So, the total amount of money John made that year is:

"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to break down the problem into parts and sum them up.

1. **Sandwiches for lunch:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 5 days.
   - He used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich.
   - Total slices of cheese for sandwiches = 5 days * 2 slices/day = 10 slices.

2. **Omelets for breakfast:**
   - Carl ate omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week.
   - He used 1 more slice of cheese per omelet than he did per sandwich, which is 2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet.
   - Total slices of cheese for omelets = 3 days * 3 slices/day = 9 slices.

3. **Macaroni and cheese dish:**
   - Carl used 8 slices of cheese for the big dish.

Now, we sum up all the slices of cheese used:
- Total slices of cheese = slices for sandwiches + slices for omelets + slices for macaroni and cheese
- Total slices of cheese = 10 slices + 9 slices + 8 slices = 27 slices.

The final numerical answer is 27."
"First, let's calculate the total number of blue pens Janet bought. She bought 6 bags of blue pens, and each bag contains 9 pens. So, the total number of blue pens is:
\[ 6 \text{ bags} \times 9 \text{ pens per bag} = 54 \text{ blue pens} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of red pens Janet bought. She bought 2 bags of red pens, and each bag contains 6 pens. So, the total number of red pens is:
\[ 2 \text{ bags} \times 6 \text{ pens per bag} = 12 \text{ red pens} \]

Now, let's add up all the pens Janet has now. She originally had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens. Adding the blue and red pens, we get:

"To find the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the sum of the first five test scores.
2. Determine the total sum of the six test scores needed to achieve an average of 93.
3. Find the score required on the sixth test by subtracting the sum of the first five test scores from the total sum needed.

First, let's calculate the sum of the first five test scores:
\[ 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 440 \]

Next, we need to find the total sum of the six test scores that would give an average of 93:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total Sum of Six Tests}}{6} = 93 \]
\[ \text{Total Sum of Six Tests} = 93 \times 6 = 558 \]

Now, we can find the score required on the sixth test:
\[ \text{Score on Sixth Test} = \text{Total Sum of Six Tests} - \text{Sum of First Five Tests} = 558 - 440 = 118 \]

Therefore, Brinley needs a score of 118 on her sixth test to get an average of 93.

"To calculate the total kilometers Micheal rode, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first four weeks and the next three weeks.

**First four weeks:**
- Micheal rode at least 5 times a week.
- Each time he rode, he covered 25 kilometers.
- Therefore, in one week, he rode \(5 \times 25 = 125\) kilometers.
- Over four weeks, he rode \(4 \times 125 = 500\) kilometers.

**Next three weeks:**
- Micheal decided to ride 2 times a week.
- Each time he rode, he covered 60 kilometers.
- Therefore, in one week, he rode \(2 \times 60 = 120\) kilometers.
- Over three weeks, he rode \(3 \times 120 = 360\) kilometers.

**Total kilometers:**
- Adding the kilometers from both periods, we get \(500 + 360 = 860\) kilometers.

The total number of kilometers Micheal rode is 860 kilometers."
"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we first need to determine the weight of each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple and each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams, each candied apple weighs:

\[ \text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{40 \text{ grams}}{2} = 20 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then sum them up.

\[ \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 \text{ grams} = 1000 \text{ grams} \]
\[ \text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20 \text{ grams} = 1600 \text{ grams} \]

Now, we add the total weights of the chocolate bars and the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:

\[ \text{Total weight of Joe's bag of candy} = 1000 \text{ grams} + 1600 \text{ grams} = 2600 \text{ grams} \]

2. On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. So, she bought \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes.
3. On Wednesday, she bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. So, she bought \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

Now, we add the number of cakes bought each day to find the total:

\[4 \text{ (Monday)} + 12 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 60 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 76\]

So, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is 76."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates:

Half a dozen plates = 6 plates
Cost per plate = $6000
Total cost for half a dozen plates = 6 * $6000 = $36000

Now, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates, which is $36000. So, the cost of twenty dozen cups is:

Cost of twenty dozen cups = $36000 - $1200 = $34800

Now, we need to find the cost of each cup. Since there are twenty dozen cups, we need to convert this into the number of cups:

Twenty dozen cups = 20 * 12 = 240 cups

Finally, to find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of twenty dozen cups by the number of cups:

Cost per cup = $34800 / 240 = $145

So, the total cost of buying each cup is $145."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the cost for the shoes is $20 * 2 = $40.
- The total cost is $30 + $40 = $70.

Next, let's calculate how much money Sara earns from babysitting:
- She earns $5 each time she babysits, and she babysits 4 times, so she earns $5 * 4 = $20 from babysitting.

Now, let's calculate how much money Sara earns from mowing the lawn:
- She earns $4 each time she mows the lawn.

Sara already has $10 saved. To find out how much more money she needs to earn, we subtract the money she already has from the total cost:
- The total cost is $70, and she already has $10, so she needs $70 - $10 = $60 more.

Now, we need to determine how many times she must mow the lawn to earn the remaining $60. Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we divide the remaining amount by the amount she earns per mowing:
- $60 / $4 = 15.

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 15 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \). According to the problem, the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day. Additionally, it is given that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which can be expressed as:

\[ w = r + 2 \]

The total number of eggs collected each day can be expressed as:

\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Now, substitute \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation:

\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 8r = 32 \]

Divide both sides by 8:

\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens. To verify, we can calculate the number of white chickens and the total eggs collected:

\[ w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \]

The total number of eggs collected per day:

\[ 3r + 5w = 3(4) + 5(6) = 12 + 30 = 42 \]

The calculations confirm that the total number of eggs collected per day is indeed 42. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park, as that's the distance he walks. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park are 1.5 miles by 6 miles, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (1.5 + 6) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we divide the total distance by his walking speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park."
"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of customers on the second day.
2. Calculate the total number of customers over the three days.
3. Find the number of customers on the third day by subtracting the total number of customers on the first and second days from the total number of customers over the three days.

First, we know that on the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than on the first day. Therefore, the number of customers on the second day is:
\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \]

Next, we know the total number of customers over the three days is 500. To find the number of customers on the third day, we subtract the number of customers on the first and second days from the total number of customers over the three days:
\[ 500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250 \]

So, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is:
\[ 250 \]"
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons.

From the information given, we know that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Since each pool loses 4 gallons per minute due to the leak, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons. According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:

\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Simplifying this equation:

\[ B + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ B = 2S + 16 \]

Now, we know that the current amount of water in the big pool is four times the current amount of water in the small pool:

\[ B = 4S \]

We now have two equations:
1. \( B = 2S + 16 \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

We can set these two equations equal to each other to solve for \( S \):

\[ 2S + 16 = 4S \]
\[ 16 = 2S \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool currently has 8 gallons of water."
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to make her purchase, I'll first calculate the total cost of the pair of shoes and the belt, and then divide that total by her hourly wage.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00.
The cost of the belt is $32.00.

Total cost = Cost of shoes + Cost of belt
Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00
Total cost = $352.00

Lori earns $8.00 per hour.

To find out how many hours she needs to work, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

Hours needed = Total cost / Hourly wage
Hours needed = $352.00 / $8.00
Hours needed = 44

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She promised to return the original amount plus an additional 10% of that amount. The original amount is $2000.

The additional 10% of $2000 is calculated as:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she promised to return is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Janeth is paying $165 per month for 12 months. The total amount she will pay over 12 months is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, to find out the remaining balance, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she promised to return:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance by the end of 12 months will be $220."
"There are 4 roses in the vase. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, there are 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias. The total number of flowers in the vase is the sum of the roses and dahlias, which is 4 + 11 = 15.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Harriet's current age:**
   Harriet is currently 21 years old.

2. **Determine Adrian's current age:**
   Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age.
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. **Determine Zack's current age:**
   Harriet is half the age of Zack.
   \[
   \text{Harriet's age} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Zack's age} \implies 21 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Zack's age} \implies \text{Zack's age} = 21 \times 2 = 42 \text{ years old}

"Initially, the tank has 120 liters of water. Celine used 90 liters, so the amount of water left in the tank is:

\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters} \]

Celine then collected rainwater that is twice the amount left in the tank. Since there are 30 liters left, the amount of rainwater collected is:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters} \]

"To find the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years, we need to calculate the amount spent in the second year and then add it to the amount spent in the first year.

The amount spent on advertising in the first year is $15000.

The amount spent on advertising in the second year is a third of the first year's amount, which is:
\[ \frac{15000}{3} = 5000 \]

Now, we add the amounts spent in the two years:
\[ 15000 + 5000 = 20000 \]

So, the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20000."
"To calculate the total cost of their rentals, we need to multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours each person rents the equipment for and then add the two amounts together.

For Carlos:
- Hourly rate: $30

- Total cost = $90 (Carlos) + $90 (Benji) = $180

Therefore, the total amount they will pay for their rentals is $180."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Travel by Bus:**
   - Andrew takes 6 days to travel by bus from New Jersey to Rochester.

2. **Travel by Car:**
   - It takes half as many days to travel by car from New Jersey to Rochester.
   - Therefore, the number of days to travel by car is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) days.

3. **Return Trip:**
   - Andrew plans to return from Rochester by car.
   - The return trip by car will also take 3 days.

4. **Total Travel Days:**
   - The total number of days Andrew will travel is the sum of the days for the trip to Rochester and the return trip.
   - Total days = 6 days (to Rochester by bus) + 3 days (return by car) = 9 days.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of cards James has after the changes:

- Initial fire type cards: 30
- Initial grass type cards: 20
- Initial water type cards: 40

After losing 8 water type cards:
- Water type cards left: 40 - 8 = 32

After buying 14 new grass type cards:
- Grass type cards now: 20 + 14 = 34

Now, the total number of cards James has is:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 34
- Water type: 32

Total number of cards = 30 + 34 + 32 = 96

To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 = 0.3333 \times 100 = 33.33\% \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33%.

The final numerical answer is 33."

"First, let's determine how many pieces Kalinda and her mom can place together per minute.

Kalinda places 4 pieces per minute.
Her mom places half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

Together, they can place \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces per minute.

The puzzle has 360 pieces. To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can place together per minute:

\[ \text{Time in minutes} = \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \text{Time in hours} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 1 hour."
"First, let's determine how many watermelons were ready for harvest after the first two months. Since 30% of the 120 watermelons were ready, we calculate:

\[ 120 \times 0.30 = 36 \]

So, Ashlyn took home 36 watermelons. This means the number of watermelons remaining after she took home the first batch is:

\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest two weeks later. Since 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready, we calculate:

\[ 84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 63 \]

This means 63 watermelons were ready for harvest two weeks later. Therefore, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:

\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 21 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the cars before tax and registration fees. Each car costs $20,000, and Mark buys 12 cars.

\[ \text{Total cost of cars} = 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000 \]

Next, we calculate the tax on the cars. The tax rate is 10%.

\[ \text{Tax on cars} = 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000 \]

Now, we add the tax to the cost of the cars to get the total cost before registration fees.

\[ \text{Total cost before registration} = 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000 \]

Then, we calculate the registration fees. Each car has a registration fee of $1,000, and Mark has 12 cars.

\[ \text{Total registration fees} = 12 \times 1,000 = 12,000 \]

Finally, we add the total cost before registration to the total registration fees to get the final amount Mark pays.

\[ \text{Total amount paid} = 264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

The final numerical answer is 50."
"If there were 50 ants and Dax found half as many bugs as ants, then the number of bugs is:

\[ \text{Number of bugs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of ants} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \]

To find the total number of insects in the garden, we add the number of ants and the number of bugs:

\[ \text{Total number of insects} = \text{Number of ants} + \text{Number of bugs} = 50 + 25 = 75 \]

The total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total number of penguins**: 36
2. **Penguins that jump in the ocean**: One-third of 36 is calculated as \( \frac{36}{3} = 12 \)
3. **Penguins that go into the cave**: Another one-third of 36 is also \( \frac{36}{3} = 12 \)

Now, let's find out how many penguins are left:

- Penguins that jump in the ocean: 12
- Penguins that go into the cave: 12
- Total penguins that leave: 12 + 12 = 24

Finally, subtract the number of penguins that left from the total number of penguins:

- Penguins left: 36 - 24 = 12

So, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is 12."
"To determine how many vines Steve needs, we first need to calculate how many cherry tomatoes he eats per week.

Steve eats 6 cherry tomatoes per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the number of tomatoes he eats in a week is:
\[ 6 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ tomatoes/week} \]

Steve's girlfriend eats half as much as he does, so she eats:
\[ \frac{6 \text{ tomatoes/day}}{2} = 3 \text{ tomatoes/day} \]
And in a week, she eats:
\[ 3 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ tomatoes/week} \]

Together, Steve and his girlfriend eat:
\[ 42 \text{ tomatoes/week} + 21 \text{ tomatoes/week} = 63 \text{ tomatoes/week} \]

Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, the number of vines needed is:
\[ \frac{63 \text{ tomatoes/week}}{3 \text{ tomatoes/vine/week}} = 21 \text{ vines} \]

So, Steve needs 21 vines."
"To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we first need to calculate the total number of pizza slices required.

John has 20 friends, and each friend will have 4 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices needed is:
\[ 20 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many pizzas are required to provide these 80 slices. Each pizza is sliced into 8 portions.

To find the number of pizzas needed, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 10 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the process Ram uses to make new pens from the empty ones.

1. Ram starts with 25 pens.
2. He can make one new pen by mixing the ink from five empty pens.

Let's break down the process step by step:

- Initially, Ram has 25 pens.
- After using 5 pens to make one new pen, he will have 24 pens left (25 - 1 = 24).
- He can now use another 5 pens to make another new pen, leaving him with 19 pens (24 - 1 = 19).
- He can continue this process until he no longer has enough pens to make a new one.

To find out how many new pens he can make, we need to divide the number of pens he has by 5:

\[ \text{Number of new pens} = \left\lfloor \frac{25}{5} \right\rfloor = 5 \]

So, Ram can make 5 new pens from the 25 pens he initially bought.

Now, we add the new pens to the original pens to find the total number of pens:

\[ \text{Total pens} = 25 + 5 = 30 \]

Therefore, the total number of pens Ram gets is 30."

"To find the number of students who went out through exit C, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit A.
2. Calculate the number of students remaining after exit A.
3. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B from the remaining students.
4. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit C from the remaining students after exit B.

Let's start with the first step:

1. The number of students who went out through exit A is 30% of 1000 students.
\[ \text{Students through exit A} = 0.30 \times 1000 = 300 \]

2. The number of students remaining after exit A is:
\[ \text{Remaining students} = 1000 - 300 = 700 \]

3. The number of students who went out through exit B is \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining students.
\[ \text{Students through exit B} = \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420 \]

4. The number of students who went out through exit C is the remaining students after exit B.
\[ \text{Students through exit C} = 700 - 420 = 280 \]

So, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
"To solve this problem, let's start by determining how many candies Robert has. We know that John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find out how many candies Robert has:

\[ \text{John's candies} = 2 \times \text{Robert's candies} \]
\[ 54 = 2 \times \text{Robert's candies} \]

Solving for Robert's candies:

\[ \text{Robert's candies} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Now that we know Robert has 27 candies, we can determine how many candies James has. We know that James has 6 more candies than Robert:

\[ \text{James's candies} = \text{Robert's candies} + 6 \]
\[ \text{James's candies} = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Next, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's candies} - \text{James's candies} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

So, John has 21 more candies than James. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many pen pals Mike has left after stopping being pen pals with 2 of them. Initially, he had 5 pen pals, so after stopping being pen pals with 2, he has:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals} \]

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each pen pal sends:

\[ 2 \text{ letters/week} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 10 \text{ pages/week} \]

Since there are 3 pen pals, the total number of pages sent by all pen pals in a week is:

\[ 3 \text{ pen pals} \times 10 \text{ pages/pen pal/week} = 30 \text{ pages/week} \]

Mike responds in kind, so he also writes 30 pages a week. Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. Therefore, the time he spends writing 30 pages is:

\[ 30 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \]"

4. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, so Colby took \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. Now Griffin has \(9 - 2 = 7\) fries left.
5. After receiving fries from Ginger, Griffin had 27 fries. So, the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin is \(27 - 7 = 20\).

Therefore, the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin is 20."
"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( F \).

Given:
- There are 4 snails in the first aquarium.
- There are 32 snails in the second aquarium.
- The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in both aquariums.
- Both aquariums have the same number of fish.

First, calculate the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums:
\[ \text{Difference in snails} = 32 - 4 = 28 \]

According to the problem, this difference is twice the number of fish in both aquariums:
\[ 28 = 2 \times (2F) \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]

Now, solve for \( F \):
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ F = 7 \]

Therefore, the number of fish in each aquarium is 7.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this, let's break down the information given:

1. Each class has 20 students.
2. There are 3 classes.
3. The school is 50% boys and 50% girls.
4. The first class has 15 girls, so it has 5 boys.
5. The second class has 12 girls, so it has 8 boys.

Now, let's calculate the total number of boys and girls in the school:

- Total number of boys in the school = 5 (from the first class) + 8 (from the second class) = 13 boys.
- Total number of girls in the school = 15 (from the first class) + 12 (from the second class) = 27 girls.

Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the total number of students in the school is:
\[ \text{Total students} = \frac{13 + 27}{0.5} = 80 \]

Now, let's find out how many students are in the third class:
\[ \text{Students in the third class} = 20 \]

Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the number of boys in the third class is:

1. **Previous Night's Kill:**
   - Wolves: 10
   - Cougars: 15

2. **Today's Kill:**
   - Let the number of cougars killed today be \( c \).
   - According to the problem, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, so the number of wolves killed today is \( 3c \).
   - Also, Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, so the number of cougars killed today is \( 15 - 3 = 12 \).

3. **Calculating Today's Wolves:**
   - Since today's cougars are 12, the number of wolves killed today is \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \).

4. **Total Animals Killed:**
   - Wolves killed in total: \( 10 \text{ (previous night)} + 36 \text{ (today)} = 46 \)
   - Cougars killed in total: \( 15 \text{ (previous night)} + 12 \text{ (today)} = 27 \)

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many times Anne went down the water slide.
2. Use the number of times Anne went down the water slide to find out how many times Robert went down the water slide.

First, we know that Mitchel went down the water slide 30 times. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. To find out how many times Anne went down the slide, we calculate 30% of 30 and subtract that from 30:

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.30 \times 30 = 9 \]

So, Anne went down the slide:

\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \text{ times} \]

Next, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. Therefore, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4:

\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

So, Robert went down the water slide 84 times. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 84 \]"
"Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, which totals to:
\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows/stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows, so the total number of cows becomes:
\[ 200 \text{ cows} + 40 \text{ cows} = 240 \text{ cows} \]

These 40 new cows are then divided equally into the 20 stalls, so each stall gets:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows/stall} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. Since each stall has 2 cows, 8 stalls will have:

Next, we calculate the total weight of the entire redwood tree before any damage. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can find the total weight by dividing the total length of the tree by the length of each section and then multiplying by the weight of each section.

\[
\text{Total weight of the tree} = \left(\frac{\text{Total length of the tree}}{\text{Length of each section}}\right) \times \text{Weight of each section}
\]

\[
\text{Total weight of the tree} = \left(\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}}\right) \times 400 \text{ pounds/section}
\]

\[
\text{Total weight of the tree} = 20 \times 400 = 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to account for the fact that termites ate 30% of the tree's wood. This means that 70% of the tree's weight remains.

\[
\text{Weight after termites ate} = \text{Total weight of the tree} \times (1 - \text{Percentage eaten})
\]

\[
\text{Weight after termites ate} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \times (1 - 0.30)
\]

\[
\text{Weight after termites ate} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70
\]

\[
\text{Weight after termites ate} = 5600 \text{ pounds}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

5600 pounds"
"To calculate the total amount Nancy has to pay, we need to consider both the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee.

First, let's calculate the cost of the overdue books:
- Nancy has 8 books overdue.
- Each book costs $0.50.
- Therefore, the total cost for the books is \( 8 \times 0.50 = 4.00 \) dollars.

Next, we add the flat fee for having at least one book overdue:
- The flat fee is $2.00.

Now, we add the cost of the books to the flat fee:
- Total cost = Cost of books + Flat fee
- Total cost = $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00

So, Nancy has to pay a total of $6.00."
"Let's denote the number of apples Jamal has as \( J_a \) and the number of bananas Jamal has as \( J_b \).

From the information given:
1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, so if Andrea has 52 apples, then Jamal has \( 52 - 8 = 44 \) apples.
2. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so \( J_b = J_a + 4 \).
3. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so if Jamal has \( J_b \) bananas, then Andrea has \( \frac{J_b}{2} \) bananas. Since Andrea has 52 apples, we can use this to find the number of bananas Jamal has.

First, let's find the number of bananas Jamal has:
\[ J_b = J_a + 4 \]
Since \( J_a = 44 \):
\[ J_b = 44 + 4 = 48 \]

Now, let's find the number of bananas Andrea has:
\[ \text{Andrea's bananas} = \frac{J_b}{2} = \frac{48}{2} = 24 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits:
- Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas.
- Jamal has 44 apples and 48 bananas.

Total number of fruits:
\[ 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 = 168 \]

So, the total number of fruits is 168."
"To determine the number of cups of flour Carla will need, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she is making and then determine the total amount of flour required based on the given ratio.

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, which totals to:
\[ 36 + 30 = 66 \text{ cookies} \]

We know that 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies. To find out how many cups of flour are needed for 66 cookies, we can set up a proportion based on the given ratio:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{66 \text{ cookies}} \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 66 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} \]
\[ x = \frac{132}{12} \]
\[ x = 11 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow."
"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we first need to calculate how many pennies are in the stack.

Given that there are 9,300 pennies in the cup, we calculate two thirds of this amount:

\[
\text{Pennies in the stack} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9300
\]

Let's perform the multiplication:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9300 = 2 \times \frac{9300}{3} = 2 \times 3100 = 6200
\]

So, there are 6,200 pennies in the stack.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, the total dollar amount in the stack is:

\[
\text{Total dollar amount} = 6200 \times 0.01 = 62
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
62

"First, let's determine the number of trees Ferdinand has. Since Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, and Chris has 6 trees:

\[ \text{Number of trees Ferdinand has} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we need to find out how many trees Harry has. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has:

\[ \text{Number of trees Harry has} = 2 \times 3 + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11 \]

Now, to find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Number of trees Harry has} - \text{Number of trees Ferdinand has} = 11 - 3 = 8 \]

So, Harry has 8 more trees than Ferdinand. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 8 \]"
"First, let's determine how much money each girl has:

- Carmen has $100.
- Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125.
- Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has $125 + $50 = $175.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money all three girls have combined:

- Carmen: $100
- Samantha: $125
- Daisy: $175

Total = $100 + $125 + $175 = $400

"First, let's calculate the total price of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

The selling price of the house is $350,000.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price:
\[ \text{Brokerage Fee} = 350,000 \times \frac{5}{100} = 350,000 \times 0.05 = 17,500 \]

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price:
\[ \text{Transfer Fee} = 350,000 \times \frac{12}{100} = 350,000 \times 0.12 = 42,000 \]

Now, let's add the brokerage fee and the transfer fee to the selling price to get the total price of the house:
\[ \text{Total Price} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500 \]

Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. To find out how much more the total price of the house is than her budget, we subtract her budget from the total price:
\[ \text{Difference} = 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500 \]

So, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget."
"First, let's calculate the transfer fees. The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Transfer Fees} = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000 \]

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee. The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000 \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount paid for the transfer fees and the brokerage fee.

\[ \text{Total Fees} = 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000 \]

Mr. Tan also paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount of the house. To find the net proceeds, we subtract the total fees and the loan amount from the selling price.

\[ \text{Net Proceeds} = 400,000 - 32,000 - 250,000 = 118,000 \]

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is $118,000."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes for the oil to heat up to 400 degrees. We know it takes 20 minutes to heat the oil to 300 degrees, and it then takes 40% longer to heat it to 400 degrees.

40% of 20 minutes is:
\[ 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the additional time needed to heat the oil to 400 degrees is 8 minutes. Therefore, the total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that it takes 5 minutes less time to cook the chicken than it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees. So, the cooking time is:
\[ 28 - 5 = 23 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees and the time it took to cook the chicken:
\[ 28 + 23 = 51 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken is:
\[ 51 \text{ minutes} \]"
"To calculate the total amount spent by the real estate agent on buying all the ads, we need to calculate the cost for the newspaper ads and the television ads separately, and then add them together.

Cost per newspaper ad = $5
Number of newspaper ads = 50
Total cost for newspaper ads = $5 * 50 = $250

For the television ads:
Cost per television ad = $75
Number of television ads = 15
Total cost for television ads = $75 * 15 = $1125

Now, we add the total costs for the newspaper ads and the television ads:
Total cost = Total cost for newspaper ads + Total cost for television ads
Total cost = $250 + $1125 = $1375

The real estate agent spent $1375 on buying all the ads."

\[ \text{Number of golf balls} = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \]

Next, we know that half of the golf balls are blue. Therefore, we can calculate the number of blue golf balls as follows:

\[ \text{Number of blue golf balls} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \]

So, the number of blue golf balls is 4."
"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and then sum them up.

1. The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
2. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has \(300 + 12 = 312\) M&Ms.
3. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, so it has \(300 / 2 = 150\) M&Ms.

Now, we sum the M&Ms from all three bags:
\[ 300 + 312 + 150 = 762 \]

So, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"To determine the total number of windows in John's houses, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum the results.

1. **Windows in Bedrooms:**
   - Each house has 3 bedrooms.
   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.
   - Therefore, the number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is \(3 \text{ bedrooms} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows}\).
   - Since John has 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms of both houses is \(6 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 12 \text{ windows}\).

2. **Additional Windows:**
   - Each house has an additional 4 windows not connected to bedrooms.
   - Therefore, the total number of additional windows in one house is 4.
   - For both houses, the total number of additional windows is \(4 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 8 \text{ windows}\).

3. **Total Windows:**
   - Adding the windows from the bedrooms and the additional windows gives us the total number of windows.
   - Total windows = windows in bedrooms + additional windows = \(12 + 8 = 20\).

Thus, the total number of windows between the houses is 20."
"To find out the change the cashier gives back, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items the mother bought. The items and their costs are as follows:

- Cocoa: $4.20
- Laundry: $9.45
- Pasta: $1.35

First, we add these costs together:

\[ 4.20 + 9.45 + 1.35 \]

Let's add these step by step:

\[ 4.20 + 9.45 = 13.65 \]
\[ 13.65 + 1.35 = 15.00 \]

So, the total cost of the items is $15.00.

The mother pays with $20.00. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:

\[ 20.00 - 15.00 = 5.00 \]

Therefore, the change the cashier gives back is $5.00."
"First, let's determine the number of stitches for each part of the sweater:

- The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
- The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body, which is \( \frac{900}{10} = 90 \) stitches.
- The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is \( 2 \times 90 = 180 \) stitches.

Now, let's add up the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette:

\[ 900 \text{ (body)} + 90 \text{ (collar)} + 180 \text{ (rosette)} = 1170 \text{ stitches} \]

The total number of stitches for the whole sweater is 1800. Therefore, the number of stitches for the two sleeves combined is:

\[ 1800 - 1170 = 630 \text{ stitches} \]

Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches for each sleeve is:

\[ \frac{630}{2} = 315 \text{ stitches} \]

So, each sleeve takes 315 stitches."

$800 + $2400 = $3200

Therefore, Mrs. Rylan used $3200 to buy the seeds."
"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we will calculate the number of lines for each part of his role and then sum them up.

1. **Solo Song:**
   The solo song has 54 lines. Sean has to memorize all 54 lines of the solo song.

2. **First Scene:**
   The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song. Therefore, the first scene has:
   \[
   2 \times 54 = 108 \text{ lines}
   \]
   Sean has to memorize a third of the lines in the first scene. Thus, the number of lines Sean has to memorize from the first scene is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36 \text{ lines}
   \]

3. **Second Scene:**
   The second scene has six more lines than the solo song. Therefore, the second scene has:
   \[
   54 + 6 = 60 \text{ lines}
   \]
   Sean has to memorize four-fifths of the lines in the second scene. Thus, the number of lines Sean has to memorize from the second scene is:
   \[
   \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48 \text{ lines}
   \]

Now, we sum up the lines Sean has to memorize from all parts of his role:
\[
54 \text{ (solo song)} + 36 \text{ (first scene)} + 48 \text{ (second scene)} = 138 \text{ lines}

"First, let's find out how many cards had the letter A on them. Since 2/5 of the cards had the letter A, we calculate:

\[ \text{Cards with letter A} = \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \]

Next, we find out how many cards were left after removing the cards with letter A:

\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 80 - 32 = 48 \]

Then, we determine how many of these remaining cards had the letter B on them. Since 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B, we calculate:

\[ \text{Cards with letter B} = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]

Now, we find out how many cards were left after removing the cards with letter B:

\[ \text{Remaining cards after B} = 48 - 24 = 24 \]

Next, we determine how many of these remaining cards had the letter C on them. Since 5/8 of the remaining cards had the letter C, we calculate:

\[ \text{Cards with letter C} = \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \]

Finally, we find out how many cards had the letter D on them by subtracting the cards with letters A, B, and C from the total number of cards:

\[ \text{Cards with letter D} = 80 - 32 - 24 - 15 = 11 \]

So, the number of cards that had the letter D on them is 11."
"To calculate the total time Matthew will take to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we need to first calculate the time for each type of hole and then sum them up.

For the small holes:
- Time to dig one small hole = 3 minutes

- Total time for small holes = 3 minutes/hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes

For the large holes:
- Time to dig one large hole = 10 minutes
- Number of large holes = 15
- Total time for large holes = 10 minutes/hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes

Now, we add the total time for both types of holes:
- Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert the total time from minutes to hours:
- Total time in hours = 240 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 4 hours."
"If the sum of Mico and Marco's current ages is 20, then in 10 years, their ages will each increase by 10 years. Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

\[ 20 + 10 + 10 = 40 \]

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40."
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, which translates to \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. This can be written as \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

First, we substitute the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Now, we solve for \( S \):
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old. To verify, we can calculate Ruby's current age and check the conditions:
\[ R = 6S = 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

In 9 years:
- Ruby will be \( 36 + 9 = 45 \) years old.
- Sam will be \( 6 + 9 = 15 \) years old.

Indeed, \( 45 = 3 \times 15 \), which satisfies the second condition.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \]"

"First, let's determine the number of spots a mamba has. Since a cobra has 70 spots and a mamba has half as many spots as a cobra, a mamba has:

\[ \text{Spots per mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, so the total number of spots for the cobras is:

\[ \text{Total spots for cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots, so the total number of spots for the mambas is:

\[ \text{Total spots for mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Now, we add the total number of spots for the cobras and the mambas to find the combined total number of spots:

\[ \text{Total spots combined} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of the total number of spots:

\[ \text{Half the total spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 2450 \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of people who will be eating the pizza.

- There are 12 team members.
- There are 3 coaches.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so \(12 \text{ team members} \times 2 \text{ guests/team member} = 24 \text{ guests}\).

Adding these together, the total number of people is:
\[ 12 \text{ team members} + 3 \text{ coaches} + 24 \text{ guests} = 39 \text{ people} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Each pizza serves 3 people, so we divide the total number of people by the number of people each pizza can serve:
\[ \frac{39 \text{ people}}{3 \text{ people/pizza}} = 13 \text{ pizzas} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Each pizza costs $15, so:
\[ 13 \text{ pizzas} \times 15 \text{ dollars/pizza} = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Maddy will spend \(\boxed{195}\) dollars."
"To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to calculate the total length used by the topaz gemstones and then find out how much space is left for the sterling silver beads.

First, calculate the total length used by the topaz gemstones:
- Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long.
- Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace.
- Therefore, the total length used by the topaz gemstones is \( 8 \times 1 = 8 \) inches.

Next, determine the remaining length for the sterling silver beads:
- The total length of the necklace is 25 inches.
- The length used by the topaz gemstones is 8 inches.
- Therefore, the remaining length for the sterling silver beads is \( 25 - 8 = 17 \) inches.

"To find the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot altogether, we need to calculate the number of stories each wrote in both weeks and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of stories each wrote in the second week:
- Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week and doubled that in the second week, so she wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories in the second week.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week and doubled that in the second week, so he wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories in the second week.
- Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week and doubled that in the second week, so she wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories in the second week.

Next, we sum up the total number of stories written by each of them over the two weeks:
- Alani wrote \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories in total.
- Braylen wrote \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories in total.
- Margot wrote \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories in total.

Finally, we add up the total number of stories written by all three:

"To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we first need to calculate the total number of stars accounted for by the rows of 8 and 6 stars, and then subtract that from the total number of stars on the flag.

The total number of stars on the flag is 76. There are three rows of 8 stars and two rows of 6 stars. Let's calculate the number of stars in these rows:

- Three rows of 8 stars: \(3 \times 8 = 24\)
- Two rows of 6 stars: \(2 \times 6 = 12\)

Adding these together gives the total number of stars in the rows of 8 and 6 stars:

\[24 + 12 = 36\]

Now, we subtract the number of stars in the rows of 8 and 6 stars from the total number of stars on the flag to find out how many stars are in the rows of 5 stars:

\[76 - 36 = 40\]

Since each row of 5 stars contains 5 stars, we divide the remaining number of stars by 5 to find the number of rows of 5 stars:

\[40 \div 5 = 8\]

Therefore, the number of rows of 5 stars is 8."
"To determine how many trucks are needed, we first need to calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones.

Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight of 80 flagstones is:
\[ 80 \times 75 = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

The delivery trucks can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds. To find out how many trucks are needed to transport 6000 pounds, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:
\[ \frac{6000}{2000} = 3 \]

Therefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

The final numerical answer is:
3"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, the speed of the car in the slow lane is:

Next, we need to find out how long it took the car in the fast lane to travel 480 miles. The time taken can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the fast lane:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{fast lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at a constant speed of 30 miles/hour and it is covering the same distance of 480 miles, the time taken by the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance can be calculated as:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{slow lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

\[ 16 \text{ hours} \]"
"To find out how many medals have been given out for counting, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of medals Izzy has.
2. Calculate the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together.
3. Use the information that this total is 10 times less than the number of medals given out to find the total number of medals given out.

First, let's find out how many medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, we can calculate:

\[ \text{Medals Izzy has} = 22 - 5 = 17 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:

\[ \text{Total medals Ali and Izzy have} = 22 + 17 = 39 \]

According to the problem, this total is 10 times less than the number of medals given out. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have:

\[ \text{Total medals given out} = 39 \times 10 = 390 \]

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 390."
"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available:

- Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars.
- There are 8 packets.

So, the total number of chocolate bars is:
\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars/packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Next, let's determine how many chocolate bars the adults will get:

- There are 4 adults.
- Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars.

So, the total number of chocolate bars for the adults is:
\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars/adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, we can find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children:

\[ 40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

There are 8 children, and we need to share the remaining 16 chocolate bars equally among them:

\[ \frac{16 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars/child} \]

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars."
"Susan works for a total of 3 hours from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 180 minutes. She takes a 30-minute break, so she works for 150 minutes.

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we can calculate her earnings as follows:

\[ \text{Earnings per minute} = \frac{5}{10} = 0.5 \]

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 150 \times 0.5 = 75 \]

So, Susan earns $75 for the online task."
"First, let's determine the initial points for each player:

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Next, we check if any of the players get an extra point in the fourth round. The extra point is given to players who have over 20 points.

- Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so Mike gets an extra point.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so Jim does not get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so Tony gets an extra point.

Now, we add the extra points to their initial points:

- Mike's new total is \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
- Jim's total remains \(18\) points.
- Tony's new total is \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

Finally, we calculate the total points for all three players:

\[22 + 18 + 43 = 83\]

The total points for all three players after the extra points had been distributed is 83."

The total number of oranges washed by the sons is the sum of their ages:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \]

Will initially bought 15 oranges. After the sons washed 12 oranges, the number of oranges left unwashed is:
\[ 15 - 12 = 3 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"On the first day, Darren does:
- 100 pushups
- 50 squats
- 20 dumbbell presses

On the second day, he does:
- 20 more pushups than on the first day: 100 + 20 = 120 pushups
- 10 fewer squats than on the first day: 50 - 10 = 40 squats
- Doubles the number of dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses

The total count of activities he does in the two days is:
- Pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

Adding these together gives the total count of activities:
220 + 90 + 60 = 370

The final numerical answer is 370."
"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day by the household.
2. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week by the household.
3. Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

First, let's calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day by the household. There are 5 members, and each consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since they eat rice at lunch and dinner, each person consumes 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg of rice per day. Therefore, the total consumption per day is 5 * 0.4 kg = 2 kg.

Next, we calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week. Since there are 7 days in a week, the weekly consumption is 2 kg/day * 7 days/week = 14 kg/week.

Finally, we determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last. We divide the total amount of rice by the weekly consumption: 42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks.

The final numerical answer is 3 weeks."
"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target.

First, let's list the days he sold bread and the number of crates sold each day:
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates
- Over the weekend: 20 crates

Now, we sum the crates sold from Tuesday to Thursday and the crates sold over the weekend:
\[ 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 \]

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he did not sell any bread on those days. Therefore, the total number of crates sold in the week is 65.

Sam's target for the week was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off by, we subtract the number of crates he sold from his target:
\[ 120 - 65 = 55 \]

Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week."
"To determine the cost of the antique desk to Carmen, we need to calculate the total amount she bid, considering that she bids after each of the 3 other people and the bids increase by $50 each time.

1. **First Bid by Carmen**: $200
2. **Second Bid by Carmen**: $200 + $50 = $250
3. **Third Bid by Carmen**: $250 + $50 = $300
4. **Fourth Bid by Carmen**: $300 + $50 = $350

Carmen bids four times in total. Now, we sum up all her bids:

\[
200 + 250 + 300 + 350
\]

Let's add these step by step:

\[
200 + 250 = 450
\]
\[
450 + 300 = 750
\]
\[
750 + 350 = 1100
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Carmen spent to win the desk is:

"To calculate the total amount John pays for driving a year, we need to consider the cost of miles driven and the monthly bonus, then scale it up to a yearly amount.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven in a year:
- Distance to work one way: 30 miles
- Round trip to work each day: 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles
- Days per week: 5 days
- Weeks per year: 50 weeks
- Total miles driven in a year: 60 miles/day * 5 days/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles/year

Next, let's calculate the cost of the miles driven:
- Cost per mile: $2
- Total cost for miles driven in a year: 15,000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30,000/year

Now, let's calculate the total bonus paid in a year:
- Bonus per month: $150
- Months per year: 12 months
- Total bonus paid in a year: $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800/year

Finally, let's calculate the total amount John pays in a year:
- Total cost for miles driven: $30,000/year
- Total bonus paid: $1,800/year

"To find out how many minutes Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we first need to calculate the total amount of time he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.

On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes.
On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes.

So, the total time exercised on Monday and Sunday combined is:
16 minutes (Monday) + 23 minutes (Sunday) = 39 minutes.

Peter wants to exercise for twice this amount on Tuesday. Therefore, the time he needs to exercise on Tuesday is:
2 * 39 minutes = 78 minutes.

The final numerical answer is 78."
"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the folding process. When a piece of paper is folded vertically, it creates two pages on each fold. Therefore, for a 32-page tabloid, we need to fold the paper 5 times (since \(2^5 = 32\)).

Each fold of the paper results in two pages, so for 5 folds, the total number of pages is \(2^5 = 32\). Since each fold of the paper results in two pages, and we start with one piece of paper, we need 5 pieces of paper to create 32 pages.

Thus, the final numerical answer is 5."

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Elise has a total of 250 books.
2. There are currently 50 unsold books, so the number of books sold so far is \(250 - 50 = 200\).
3. This year, she sold 45 books.
4. In the first year, she sold twice as many books as she sold this year, so she sold \(2 \times 45 = 90\) books in the first year.
5. The total number of books sold over the three years is \(90 + 45 + 200 = 335\), but since she only had 250 books, this means she sold all the books she had.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money she earned in the second year. The price per book is $20, and she sold 45 books this year.

The total amount of money earned in the second year is:
\[ 45 \text{ books} \times 20 \text{ dollars/book} = 900 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 900 dollars."
"To calculate how much money Watson made in April, we need to consider his earnings from his hourly wage and his weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate his weekly earnings:
- Watson works 10 hours a day for 5 days a week, so he works 10 * 5 = 50 hours a week.
- He earns $10 per hour, so his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are 50 * $10 = $500.
- He also gets a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well.

So, his total weekly earnings are $500 (from his hourly wage) + $300 (bonus) = $800.

Next, we need to calculate his total earnings for the month of April. April has 30 days, and since he works 5 days a week, he works 30 / 5 = 6 weeks in April.

His total earnings for April are 6 weeks * $800 per week = $4800.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is $4800."
"To determine how many people John lost to, we first need to calculate how many people he beat and then subtract that number from the total number of people he arm wrestled.

John beats 80% of the 20 people he arm wrestled. 

80% of 20 is calculated as follows:
\[ 0.80 \times 20 = 16 \]

So, John beat 16 people. 

To find out how many people he lost to, we subtract the number of people he beat from the total number of people he arm wrestled:
\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, the number of people John lost to is 4."
"First, let's determine how many loaves of bread are sold in the morning. Since two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning, we calculate:

\[
\text{Morning sales} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
\]

Next, we find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales:

\[
\text{Loaves left after morning} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
\]

In the afternoon and evening, half of the remaining loaves are sold equally. Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening combined is:

\[
\text{Afternoon and evening sales combined} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
\]

Since the loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[
\text{Afternoon sales} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ loaves}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \text{Weight loss per week for Joey} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in 1 week, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds. Therefore, to lose the same amount of weight (2 pounds) that Joey loses in 1 week, Sandy will take:

\[ \text{Number of weeks for Sandy} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"To determine the savings, we need to calculate the difference in cost for both the ice cream and the milk when bought at the discounted prices.

First, let's calculate the savings on the ice cream:
- Original price for one tub of ice cream: $13
- Discounted price for one tub of ice cream: $11
- Savings on one tub of ice cream: $13 - $11 = $2

Since you are buying 2 tubs of ice cream, the total savings on ice cream will be:
- Savings on 2 tubs of ice cream: $2 * 2 = $4

Next, let's calculate the savings on the milk:
- Discount on one packet of milk: $0.5
- Since the discount is the same for each packet, the savings on one packet of milk is $0.5
- Since you are buying 4 packets of milk, the total savings on milk will be:
- Savings on 4 packets of milk: $0.5 * 4 = $2

Now, we add the savings from the ice cream and the milk to find the total savings:
- Total savings: $4 (from ice cream) + $2 (from milk) = $6

"To determine the number of new limbs Helena's serum will cause a person to grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and extra legs that grow based on the given growth rates.

The serum makes a person grow an extra arm every three days. So, in fifteen days, the number of extra arms grown is:
\[ \frac{15}{3} = 5 \]

The serum makes a person grow an extra leg every five days. So, in fifteen days, the number of extra legs grown is:
\[ \frac{15}{5} = 3 \]

Therefore, the total number of new limbs grown after fifteen days is the sum of the extra arms and extra legs:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \]

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
6 business suits at $100 each = 6 * $100 = $600

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
3 suitcases at $50 each = 3 * $50 = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit:
5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500
The cost of the flight ticket = $500 + $700 = $1200

Now, let's add up all the costs:
Cost of business suits = $600
Cost of suitcases = $150
Cost of flight ticket = $1200
Total cost = $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

Theo wishes to save $2000 for the trip, so the total amount he has available for spending is:
Total amount available = $6000 - $2000 = $4000

Now, let's calculate how much he has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners:
Amount to spend on gifts = Total amount available - Total cost
Amount to spend on gifts = $4000 - $1950 = $2050

"To determine the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum up the results.

First, let's identify the number of people in the family:
- There are 5 people in the family.

Next, we know the consumption pattern:
- Three people eat 3 eggs each day.
- The remaining two people eat 2 eggs each day.

Let's calculate the daily egg consumption:
- The three people who eat 3 eggs each day consume \(3 \times 3 = 9\) eggs per day.
- The two people who eat 2 eggs each day consume \(2 \times 2 = 4\) eggs per day.

Adding these together, the total daily egg consumption is:
\[9 + 4 = 13\] eggs per day.

Now, to find the weekly egg consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week):
\[13 \times 7 = 91\] eggs per week.

Therefore, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old six years ago.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since six years have passed, Noah is now \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Calculate the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age.
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

4. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now.
   - Therefore, the current population of Chile is \(60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

The population of Chile now is 120000."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so it is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players in the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve for \( D \), we first combine the terms on the left side of the equation:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 3D + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{6D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{7D}{2} \]

So the equation becomes:
\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve for \( D \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Then we divide both sides by 7:
\[ D = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we need to account for the people who couldn't come due to illness and those with previous commitments:

- 8 people couldn't come due to illness.
- 1/4 of the 8 people with illness had previous commitments, which is \(8 \div 4 = 2\) people.

Therefore, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Finally, the number of people who show up for the party is the total number of people invited minus the number who couldn't come:

\(24 - 10 = 14\)

So, the final numerical answer is 14."
"First, let's calculate the number of marbles Solomon received from his father. Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, and his father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna.

"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and there are 45 electric wires, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles.

Let \( P \) be the number of electric poles and \( W \) be the number of electric wires. According to the ratio, we have:
\[ \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Given \( W = 45 \), we can substitute this value into the proportion:
\[ \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \]

To find \( P \), we solve the equation by cross-multiplying:
\[ P \times 3 = 45 \times 1 \]
\[ 3P = 45 \]
\[ P = \frac{45}{3} \]
\[ P = 15 \]

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15."
"At the beginning, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 25 + 15 = 40 people.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left, which means 1/4 * 40 = 10 people left.

If 22 men stayed at the party, this means that 22 men + the number of women who stayed = 40 people in total.

Let's denote the number of women who stayed as W. So, we have:
22 men + W women = 40 people

Solving for W:
W = 40 - 22
W = 18

Therefore, 18 women are left at the party."
"First, let's determine the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as a book and the book costs $4, the magazine costs:

\[ \text{Cost of magazine} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cost of book} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of the pen. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so:

\[ \text{Cost of pen} = \text{Cost of magazine} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 \]

Therefore, the pen costs $1."
"First, let's determine the total number of pencils Jam has. We know that Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. So, the number of pencils in the boxes is:

\[ 26 - 2 = 24 \]

This means Jam has 24 pencils in boxes and 2 loose pencils, making a total of 26 pencils. Now, we need to find out how many boxes are needed to store all the pencils if Meg has 46 pencils. Since we don't know the number of pencils per box, we assume that each box contains the same number of pencils. However, since the number of pencils per box is not specified, we can only determine the total number of boxes needed for both Jam and Meg's pencils combined.

The total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together is:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

If we assume each box contains the same number of pencils, the number of boxes needed to store 72 pencils is:

\[ \frac{72}{x} \]

where \( x \) is the number of pencils per box. Since the problem does not specify the number of pencils per box, we can only provide the total number of pencils and the total number of boxes needed if we assume each box contains the same number of pencils. However, if we assume each box contains 12 pencils (which is a reasonable assumption given the numbers), then:

\[ \frac{72}{12} = 6 \]

So, Jam and Meg need 6 boxes to store all their pencils. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weakening of the coffee due to the cooling and the addition of cream.

First, let's calculate the weakening due to cooling. Each degree of cooling weakens the coffee by 13 milliliters. Shannon cools the coffee by 65 degrees, so the weakening due to cooling is:
\[ 65 \text{ degrees} \times 13 \text{ milliliters/degree} = 845 \text{ milliliters} \]

Next, we need to account for the weakening due to the addition of cream. Adding 15 milliliters of cream weakens the coffee by 12 milliliters. So, the weakening due to the addition of cream is:
\[ 15 \text{ milliliters} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/15 milliliters} = 12 \text{ milliliters} \]

Now, we add the weakening due to cooling and the weakening due to the addition of cream to find the total weakening:
\[ 845 \text{ milliliters} + 12 \text{ milliliters} = 857 \text{ milliliters} \]

Therefore, Shannon’s iced coffee is 857 milliliters weaker when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream."
"If 5 people leave with 7 new records between them, and each person can trade 2 old records for 1 new record, then the total number of new records traded is 7. Since each new record traded comes from 2 old records, the total number of old records brought in by the 5 people is \(7 \times 2 = 14\).

The final numerical answer is 14."
"First, let's determine the number of junior and senior programmers.

Given that the total number of employees is 100 and the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

\[ \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers is:

\[ \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Next, we know that each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total amount paid to junior programmers per month is:

\[ \text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

The senior programmers are paid $400 more than the junior programmers, so each senior programmer is paid:

\[ \text{Payment to each senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400 \]

Therefore, the total amount paid to senior programmers per month is:

\[ \text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

Finally, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers:

\[ \text{Total payment to all programmers} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 224000 \]"
"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the number of people on the bus becomes \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on, so the number of people on the bus becomes \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).

We are given that at the third stop, there were 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

The final numerical answer is:

"Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has:
\[ 24 - 2 = 22 \]
lollipops left.

He passes 14 lollipops to his friends, so he has:
\[ 22 - 14 = 8 \]
lollipops left.

He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is:
\[ 2 \times 14 = 28 \]
So, he adds these to the remaining lollipops:
\[ 8 + 28 = 36 \]
lollipops.

He eats 3 more that night and 2 more in the morning, so he eats:
\[ 3 + 2 = 5 \]
lollipops in total.

Therefore, the number of lollipops Oscar has left is:
\[ 36 - 5 = 31 \]

The final numerical answer is 31."
"To determine how long it will take to fully charge the cell phone from 60% to 100%, we first need to calculate the percentage of charging required. The phone needs to charge from 60% to 100%, which is a 40% increase.

Given that the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time required to charge 40 percentage points.

\[ \text{Time required} = 40 \text{ percentage points} \times 3 \text{ minutes/percentage point} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours.

"To determine the final amount the customer paid, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip:**
   - The customer spent $80.
   - For every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase.
   - Therefore, the rewards earned from the $80 spent is:
     \[
     \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ rewards}
     \]

2. **Apply the rewards to the current shopping trip:**
   - The customer used their $4 rewards on the current shopping trip.
   - The current shopping trip cost $43.
   - After applying the rewards, the cost becomes:
     \[
     43 - 4 = 39 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Apply the coupon:**
   - The coupon takes off twice the amount of rewards.
   - Since the customer used $4 in rewards, the coupon takes off:
     \[
     2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The final amount after applying the coupon is:
     \[
     39 - 8 = 31 \text{ dollars}

Therefore, the customer paid \(\boxed{31}\) dollars on this shopping trip."
"To determine which job Nick will make more money at, we need to calculate the net pay for both jobs.

**Job A:**
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours per year: 2000
- Total annual income before tax: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- State tax rate: 20%
- State tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

**Job B:**
- Annual income before tax: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax rate on net income: 10%
- Tax on net income: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:
- Job A net pay: $24,000
- Job B net pay: $32,400

The difference in net pay between Job B and Job A is:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Therefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate compared to the other job."

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The number of students in the smallest group would then be \( x - 10 \).

Given that the total number of students is 200, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two equal groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60."
"Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \) and the number of chickens as \( H \). According to the problem, the total number of animals is 60, and there are twice as many chickens as cows. This gives us the following equations:

\[ H + C = 60 \]
\[ H = 2C \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( C \):

\[ 2C + C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:

\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of legs. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each:

\[ \text{Total legs} = (2 \times H) + (4 \times C) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = (2 \times 40) + (4 \times 20) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 80 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 160 \]

So, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is 160."

"To solve this problem, let's first establish the weights of each animal based on the information given:

1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. A pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, so a blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
3. A pink frog weighs the same as a green toad, so a green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
4. A pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, so a yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
5. A pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than a red bird, so a red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, including the container itself:

- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

"First, let's calculate the daily earnings from tractors when they made them:

- They sold 10 tractors a day.
- They made $100 per tractor.

So, the daily earnings from tractors were:
\[ 10 \text{ tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate the daily earnings from silos now that they make them:

- They sell 5 silos a day.
- They make $220 per silo.

So, the daily earnings from silos are:

"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming.

Boating time: 6 hours
Swimming time: 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours

Total time for boating and swimming: 6 hours + 3 hours = 9 hours

Next, let's calculate the total time he spent watching the shows.

Number of shows: 3
Duration of each show: 2 hours
Total time for shows: 3 shows * 2 hours/show = 6 hours

The shows and boating/swimming together account for 30% of the total time spent. Let's denote the total time spent as \( T \).

So, 30% of \( T \) is 15 hours (9 hours for boating and swimming + 6 hours for shows).

\[ 0.30 \times T = 15 \]
\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} \]
\[ T = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John spent 40% of his total time sightseeing.

\[ \text{Time spent sightseeing} = 0.40 \times T \]
\[ \text{Time spent sightseeing} = 0.40 \times 50 \]
\[ \text{Time spent sightseeing} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the teddy bears. Dean bought 5 teddy bears, and each teddy bear costs $1. So, the total cost for the teddy bears is:
\[ 5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's find the total cost of the toys Dean bought:
\[ 12 + 5 = 17 \text{ dollars} \]

Dean initially had $28. After buying the toys, the amount of money he has left is:
\[ 28 - 17 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

Dean's mother then gives him an extra $10. So, the total amount of money Dean has now is:
\[ 11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 21 \]"
"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities she wants to do and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's calculate the cost of the mini-golf:
- Cost per round of mini-golf: $5
- Number of rounds: 1
- Total cost for mini-golf: $5

Next, let's calculate the cost of the go-karts:
- Cost per ride: $10
- Number of rides: 2
- Total cost for go-karts: $10 * 2 = $20

Now, let's add the cost of the arcade tokens:
- Cost of arcade tokens: $5

Now, let's sum up all the costs:
- Total cost for mini-golf: $5
- Total cost for go-karts: $20
- Total cost for arcade tokens: $5
- Total cost for all activities: $5 + $20 + $5 = $30

Finally, let's subtract the total cost from Morgan's budget to find out how much money is left for her and her friends:
- Morgan's budget: $90
- Total cost for activities: $30
- Remaining budget: $90 - $30 = $60

Since Morgan and her friends will each get to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice, we need to determine how many friends can be invited with the remaining $60.

The cost for one friend to play mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice is:
- Cost for one friend's mini-golf: $5
- Cost for one friend's arcade tokens: $5
- Cost for one friend's go-karts: $10 * 2 = $20
- Total cost for one friend: $5 + $5 + $20 = $30

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost for one friend:
- Remaining budget: $60
- Cost for one friend: $30
- Number of friends: $60 / $30 = 2

Therefore, Morgan can invite 2 friends to her birthday party."
"First, let's calculate how much Marisa spends on lollipops each day. She buys 4 lollipops, each costing 25 cents. 

\[ \text{Cost of lollipops per day} = 4 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 100 \text{ cents} \]

Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar, Marisa spends $1 on lollipops each day.

Next, let's calculate her total spending on lollipops over 5 days.

\[ \text{Total spending on lollipops in 5 days} = 5 \times 1 \text{ dollar} = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day. Over 5 days, she gets:

\[ \text{Total pocket money in 5 days} = 5 \times 5 \text{ dollars} = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much she saves in her piggy bank, we subtract her total spending on lollipops from her total pocket money.

\[ \text{Money saved in piggy bank} = 25 \text{ dollars} - 5 \text{ dollars} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Billy spent on gumballs. He bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, so the total cost for the gumballs is:

\[ 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Since he spent half of his change on gumballs, the total amount of money he had initially was twice the amount he spent on gumballs:

\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Billy started with $10, so the amount of money he spent on candy is:

\[ 10 - 4 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of the candy is $1.5 per pound. To find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we divide the total amount spent on candy by the cost per pound:

\[ \frac{6}{1.5} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( S \).

According to the problem, Carver's age is 5 years less than twice his son's age. This can be written as:
\[ 45 = 2S - 5 \]

To find \( S \), we need to solve this equation. First, we add 5 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 45 + 5 = 2S \]
\[ 50 = 2S \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ \frac{50}{2} = S \]
\[ 25 = S \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 25 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total distance of one complete trip from the first city to the third city and back to the first city.

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city back to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the second and third city trip, which is 100 miles - 50 miles = 50 miles.

So, the total distance for one complete trip is:
75 miles + 100 miles + 50 miles = 225 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
225 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 675 miles/day.

To find out how many days it goes between services, we need to divide the total distance traveled in one day by the distance at which the train needs service, which is 18,000 miles.

So, the number of days between services is:
675 miles/day ÷ 18,000 miles = 0.0375 days.

Therefore, the train goes between services every 0.0375 days."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the stuffing needed for a collie bed:**
   - A Rottweiler bed requires 8 pounds of stuffing.
   - A chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing.
   - The collie bed requires the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler and a chihuahua bed.
   - The average of 8 pounds and 2 pounds is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Average} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
     \]
   - Therefore, a collie bed requires 5 pounds of stuffing.

2. **Calculate the total stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds:**
   - Mark needs to make 4 chihuahua beds.
   - Each chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing.
   - The total stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds is:
     \[
     4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total stuffing needed for the collie beds:**
   - Mark needs to make 3 collie beds.
   - Each collie bed requires 5 pounds of stuffing.
   - The total stuffing needed for the collie beds is:

     \]

4. **Calculate the total stuffing needed for all the beds:**
   - The total stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds is 8 pounds.
   - The total stuffing needed for the collie beds is 15 pounds.
   - The total stuffing needed for all the beds is:
     \[
     8 + 15 = 23 \text{ pounds}
     \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 23 pounds."
"First, let's calculate the time John spent driving to his friend's house. The distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, and he drives at a speed of 70 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time taken to drive to his friend's house is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} = \frac{200 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} \]

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} = \frac{200}{70} \text{ hours} \]

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} \]

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} \approx 2.857 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time taken for the detour. The detour added 10 miles to his trip, so the total distance for the detour is:

\[ \text{Total detour distance} = 200 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 210 \text{ miles} \]

The speed during the detour is 70 mph, so the time taken for the detour is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} \]

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the time taken for the return trip. The return trip is 240 miles long, and he drives at a speed of 80 mph. The time taken for the return trip is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{return}} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} \]

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{return}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, the total time for the trip is the sum of the time taken to drive to his friend's house, the time taken for the detour, and the time taken for the return trip:

\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} + \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} + \text{Time}_{\text{return}} \]

\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} \]

\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} \]

To add these times, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 7 and 1 is 7:

\[ 6 \text{ hours} = \frac{42}{7} \text{ hours} \]

\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} + \frac{42}{7} \text{ hours} \]

\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{62}{7} \text{ hours} \]

\[ \text{Total time} \approx 8.857 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total trip took approximately 8.857 hours."
"To find out how many fourth-grade boys were at Small Tree School on Friday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of fourth-grade boys at the school.
2. Subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of fourth-grade boys.

First, we know the total number of fourth-graders is 96, and 43 of them are girls. Therefore, the number of boys is:
\[ 96 - 43 = 53 \]

Next, we know that 5 girls were absent on Friday. Since the total number of absentees is 5 girls and 4 boys, the number of absent boys is 4. Therefore, the number of boys present on Friday is:
\[ 53 - 4 = 49 \]

So, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is 49."
"If there are 6 girls in the park and twice the number of boys, then there are 6 * 2 = 12 boys in the park. The total number of kids in the park is the sum of the girls and boys, which is 6 + 12 = 18. 

The final numerical answer is 18."
"To find the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test, we first need to calculate the total points she has already scored on her first two tests.

Points scored on the first test: 15
Points scored on the second test: 18

Total points scored on the first two tests: 15 + 18 = 33

Jane needs a total of at least 42 points across all three tests. To find out how many points she needs on her third test, we subtract the points she has already scored from the total required:

Points needed on the third test: 42 - 33 = 9

Therefore, the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass is 9."
"Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as \( C \). According to the problem, \( C = 3 \).

The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is four times the number of customers minus 5, which can be expressed as \( 4C - 5 \). Substituting \( C = 3 \) into this equation, we get:
\[ 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]
So, 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting.

The number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is three times the number of shoplifters, which can be expressed as \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \).

Now, we know the total number of customers and shoplifters:
\[ C + 7 = 3 + 7 = 10 \]

The total number of people kicked out of the Walmart is 50. Therefore, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:
\[ 50 - (C + 7) = 50 - 10 = 40 \]

So, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is 40."
"To determine how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we need to first find out how many points Erin had after scoring 14 points.

Sara scored 8 points. After Erin scored 14 points, Erin has three times more points than Sara. Therefore, we can calculate Erin's points after scoring 14 points as follows:

\[ \text{Erin's points after scoring 14} = 3 \times \text{Sara's points} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Since Erin scored 14 points after this, we need to subtract these 14 points from her total points after scoring to find out how many points she had before:

\[ \text{Erin's points before scoring 14} = \text{Erin's points after scoring 14} - 14 = 24 - 14 = 10 \]

Thus, Erin had 10 points before scoring the additional 14 points. The final numerical answer is:

10"
"To calculate the total cost, let's break down the expenses:

1. **Cost of picture frames:**
   - Each frame costs $20.
   - Each frame needs to be etched at an additional 20% cost.
   - The total cost per frame is $20 + ($20 * 20%) = $20 + $4 = $24.
   - There are 44 seniors, so the total cost for the picture frames is $24 * 44 = $1056.

2. **Cost of pins:**
   - 2 seniors will receive pins.
   - Each pin costs $5.
   - The total cost for the pins is $5 * 2 = $10.

3. **Cost of cords for officers:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so there are 44 / 4 = 11 officers.
   - Each cord costs $12.
   - The total cost for the cords is $12 * 11 = $132.

Now, let's sum up all the costs:
- Cost of picture frames: $1056
- Cost of pins: $10
- Cost of cords: $132

Total cost = $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The final numerical answer is $1198."
"To determine the total cost for Ethan if he makes his own hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the savings from the DIY option and then subtract that from the original cost.

The original cost of the wallpaper is $400. The DIY option saves 20% of this cost. First, we calculate 20% of $400:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.20 \times 400 = 80 \]

This means Ethan saves $80 by making his own wallpaper. Therefore, the total cost for Ethan if he makes his own wallpaper is:

\[ 400 - 80 = 320 \]

So, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"To find the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale, let's break down the sales day by day:

1. **Friday**: The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.
2. **Saturday**: The store sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday. Therefore, they sold \(14 \times 2 = 28\) pairs of tennis shoes.
3. **Sunday**: The store sold one-half the amount that they did on Saturday. Therefore, they sold \(28 \div 2 = 14\) pairs of tennis shoes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pairs sold before accounting for the returns:

- Friday: 14 pairs
- Saturday: 28 pairs
- Sunday: 14 pairs

Total pairs sold before returns: \(14 + 28 + 14 = 56\) pairs.

Six pairs were returned, so we need to subtract these from the total:

Total pairs sold by the end of the sale: \(56 - 6 = 50\) pairs.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 50."
"To find out how many hours a week Hallie had dance practice, we need to calculate the total hours for each day she had practice and then sum them up.

On Tuesdays, she had 1 hour of practice.
On Thursdays, she had 2 hours of practice.
On Saturdays, she had practice that lasted twice as long as Tuesday's night class, which means she had 2 * 1 = 2 hours of practice on Saturdays.

Now, we add up the hours:
1 hour (Tuesday) + 2 hours (Thursday) + 2 hours (Saturday) = 5 hours.

So, the total number of hours Hallie had dance practice in a week is 5 hours."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of pieces of equipment and then calculate the cost of the functioning pieces.

First, let's find the total number of pieces of equipment. If 40% of the total number of pieces were faulty, then 60% of the total number of pieces were functioning.

Let's denote the total number of pieces of equipment as \( N \).

The number of faulty pieces is \( 0.4N \).

The number of functioning pieces is \( N - 0.4N = 0.6N \).

The total cost of the equipment is $400,000. Since the faulty pieces are returned, the company only pays for the functioning pieces. The cost of the functioning pieces is therefore \( 0.6N \times \frac{400000}{N} \).

Simplifying, we get:
\[ \text{Cost of functioning pieces} = 0.6 \times 400000 = 240000 \]

So, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $240,000.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 240000 \]"
"Mary gets 1 kg of milk from half of her 30 sheep, which is 15 sheep. So, she gets 15 sheep * 1 kg/sheep = 15 kg of milk from these sheep. From the other half of the sheep, which is also 15 sheep, she gets 15 sheep * 2 kg/sheep = 30 kg of milk. Therefore, the total amount of milk she collects every day is 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

The final numerical answer is 45."
"Mrs. Sherman made a dozen bread rolls, which is equal to 12 rolls. She gave one roll to each of her 6 children, so she gave away 6 rolls. This leaves her with 12 - 6 = 6 rolls. She then broke each of the remaining 6 rolls into 8 pieces. Therefore, the total number of pieces of rolls she fed to the chickens is 6 rolls * 8 pieces per roll = 48 pieces. 

The final numerical answer is 48."
"To find out how many pupils like the color yellow, we can follow these steps:

1. First, determine how many pupils like blue. Since half of the class likes blue, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Pupils who like blue} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how many pupils are left after accounting for those who like blue. This is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining pupils} = 40 - 20 = 20
   \]

3. One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Pupils who like green} = \frac{20}{4} = 5
   \]

4. The rest of the pupils like yellow. Therefore, the number of pupils who like yellow is:
   \[

"To find out how many apples Lucy picked over the three days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of apples Lucy picked on Monday.
2. Determine the number of apples Lucy picked on Tuesday.
3. Determine the number of apples Lucy picked on Wednesday.
4. Sum the number of apples picked over the three days.

First, we know that Lucy sold all the apples she picked on Monday for $56 at $4 per piece. So, the number of apples she picked on Monday is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Number of apples on Monday} = \frac{56}{4} = 14 \]

Next, we know that on Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of apples she picked on Wednesday is:
\[ \text{Number of apples on Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \]

Now, we sum the number of apples picked over the three days:
\[ \text{Total number of apples} = 14 + 12 + 24 = 50 \]

So, the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days is:
\[ 50 \]"
"To determine how many socks Lindsay has missed, we first need to calculate the total number of socks she has washed.

A pair of socks consists of 2 socks. Lindsay washes 10 pairs, so the number of socks from the pairs is:
\[ 10 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ socks per pair} = 20 \text{ socks} \]

She also washes 15 loose socks. So, the total number of socks she has washed is:
\[ 20 \text{ socks from pairs} + 15 \text{ loose socks} = 35 \text{ socks} \]

Lindsay started with 50 socks. To find out how many socks she has missed, we subtract the number of socks she has washed from the total number of socks:

"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she will have to pay back, including the interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

The formula to calculate the total amount to be paid back is:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + (\text{Principal} \times \text{Interest Rate} \times \text{Time}) \]

Given:
- Principal (P) = $3,650
- Interest Rate (R) = 10% = 0.10
- Time (T) = 5 months

First, we calculate the interest:
\[ \text{Interest} = P \times R \times T = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 5 = 1825 \]

Then, we calculate the total amount to be paid back:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = P + \text{Interest} = 3650 + 1825 = 5475 \]

Now, we divide the total amount by the number of months to find the monthly payment:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{5475}{5} = 1095 \]

So, Karan has to pay $1095 per month."

"First, let's determine the number of silver and gold pesos Anna has.

Axel has 50 silver pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Axel has 80 gold pesos. Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so:
\[ 80 + 40 = 120 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of silver pesos they have together:
\[ 50 \text{ (Axel's silver pesos)} + 100 \text{ (Anna's silver pesos)} = 150 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of gold pesos they have together:
\[ 80 \text{ (Axel's gold pesos)} + 120 \text{ (Anna's gold pesos)} = 200 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Finally, let's find the total number of pesos they have together by adding the total silver pesos and the total gold pesos:

"First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make:

- Each pitcher holds 12 cups.
- She can make 3 pitchers of lemonade.

Total cups of lemonade = 3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups.

Next, let's determine the total revenue from selling all the lemonade:

- She sells each cup for $1.
- She has 36 cups of lemonade.

Total revenue = 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

Now, let's calculate the cost of making the lemonade:

- She spent $18 to buy the supplies.

Total cost = $18.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $36 - $18 = $18.

Millie sells all of the lemonade, so to find the profit per hour, we need to know how long her lemonade stand is open. However, the question does not specify the number of hours her lemonade stand is open. Without this information, we can only calculate the profit per cup sold, which is:

Profit per cup = Total profit / Total cups of lemonade = $18 / 36 cups = $0.50 per cup.

Since the question asks for the profit per hour and the number of hours is not provided, the profit per cup is the best we can determine with the given information. If we assume the lemonade stand is open for 1 hour, then the profit per hour would be $0.50. However, the question asks for the final numerical answer, which implies a specific hour is being considered. Given the lack of specific hours, the profit per cup is the most precise answer we can provide.

Final numerical answer (profit per cup):
$0.50"
"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we need to determine the total amount of land he had before selling 3/5 of it. If he had 12.8 hectares left after selling 3/5 of his land, then 2/5 of his land is equal to 12.8 hectares.

Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had at first as \( L \). Therefore, 2/5 of \( L \) is 12.8 hectares. We can set up the following equation to solve for \( L \):

\[
\frac{2}{5} L = 12.8
\]

To find \( L \), we need to isolate it by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of 2/5, which is 5/2:

\[
L = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, let's calculate the value of \( L \).
```python
# Calculation
L = 12.8 * (5 / 2)
L
```
```output
Done
```
The calculation gives us:

\[
L = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
\]

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{32}

"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 50\% \times 52 = 0.50 \times 52 = 26 \]

Since the choir is evenly split between boys and girls, the number of boys is also 26.

Next, we need to find out how many female members are performing. Since all female members are performing, the number of female members is equal to the number of girls, which is 26.

On the day of the performance, half of the female members can't make it to the show because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of female members who can't make it is:

\[ \frac{26}{2} = 13 \]

This means that the number of female members who can make it to the show is:

\[ 26 - 13 = 13 \]

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is the sum of the female members who can make it and the 3 teachers:

\[ 13 + 3 = 16 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost for David to ride all 9 rides using the ride bracelet. Since the ride bracelet gives 9 rides for $30, David's total cost is $30.

Next, let's calculate the cost for Dasha to ride all 9 rides using tickets. Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2. Therefore, the cost per ride is $2 * 2 = $4. For 9 rides, the total cost is $4 * 9 = $36.

Now, we need to find out how much money David saves by buying the ride bracelet instead of buying tickets. The difference in cost between Dasha's and David's total costs is $36 - $30 = $6.

So, David saves $6."
"To determine how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of gifts Monica needs to wrap.
2. Divide the total inches of ribbon by the total number of gifts.

First, let's calculate the total number of gifts:
- Monica has 6 gifts to wrap for her family.
- She has 4 gifts to wrap for her friends.
- She has 2 gifts to wrap for her teachers.

Total number of gifts = 6 (family) + 4 (friends) + 2 (teachers) = 12 gifts.

Next, we divide the total inches of ribbon by the total number of gifts:
- Monica has 144 inches of ribbon.
- She needs to wrap 12 gifts.

Inches of ribbon per gift = 144 inches / 12 gifts = 12 inches per gift.

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many popsicles Betty and Sam each have based on the given ratio and total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. Together, they have a total of 165 popsicles.

First, we find the sum of the parts of the ratio:
\[ 5 + 6 = 11 \]

This means that the total number of popsicles (165) is divided into 11 equal parts. To find the number of popsicles in one part, we divide the total number of popsicles by 11:
\[ \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can find out how many popsicles Betty and Sam have individually:
- Betty's popsicles: \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \)
- Sam's popsicles: \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \)

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the monthly cost of the streaming services Tim will use after the discount:

- Netflix costs $10 a month.
- Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 each, but he saves 20% on bundling, which means they cost 80% of their normal price.
- The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus after the discount is $10 * 0.80 = $8 per month each.

Now, let's calculate the total monthly cost for the streaming services:
- Netflix: $10
- Hulu: $8
- Disney Plus: $8

Total monthly cost for streaming services = $10 + $8 + $8 = $26

Tim's cable package costs $60 a month. By cancelling his cable package and subscribing to the streaming services, he saves:
- $60 - $26 = $34 per month.

The final numerical answer is $34."
"First, let's convert all the time spent into the same unit. We'll use minutes for this calculation.

Carol spends 4 hours writing a song. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 4 hours is:
\[ 4 \times 60 = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

She spends half that much time recording it, which is:
\[ \frac{240}{2} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

She spends 90 minutes editing it.

Now, let's add up the total time spent on all activities:
\[ 240 \text{ minutes (writing)} + 120 \text{ minutes (recording)} + 90 \text{ minutes (editing)} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

To find the percentage of her total work time that she spent editing, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{90}{450} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplifying the fraction:
\[ \frac{90}{450} = \frac{1}{5} \]

So:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{5} \right) \times 100 = 20\% \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 20\% \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of books Wendy wants to place in the shelving system.

First, let's calculate the total number of slots in the shelving system:
- The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns.
- Therefore, the total number of slots is \(6 \times 6 = 36\).

Next, we need to find out how many books Wendy wants to place in these slots. According to the problem, she wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in the slots.

Let's denote the number of books in the slots as \(B\). According to the problem, Wendy wants to place \(2B + 20\) books.

Since the total number of slots is 36, we have:
\[ B = 36 \]

Now, we calculate \(2B + 20\):
\[ 2B + 20 = 2 \times 36 + 20 = 72 + 20 = 92 \]

Therefore, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for a quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for:
- 3 cups of flour
- 1 cup of milk

For a quadruple batch, the amounts are:
- Flour: \( 3 \text{ cups} \times 4 = 12 \text{ cups} \)
- Milk: \( 1 \text{ cup} \times 4 = 4 \text{ cups} \)

Next, we need to determine how many bags of flour and bottles of milk are required.

Flour is sold in 2-cup bags:
- \( \frac{12 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups per bag}} = 6 \text{ bags} \)

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles:
- \( \frac{4 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups per bottle}} = 2 \text{ bottles} \)

Finally, to find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:

"To determine the energy saved by Mel, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the energy consumption of the air conditioner per hour.
2. Determine the daily energy consumption after the reduction.
3. Calculate the total energy saved in 30 days.

First, the air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour. Reducing the usage by 5 hours a day means the new usage is 8 - 5 = 3 hours a day.

The daily energy consumption after the reduction is:
\[ 900 \text{ watts/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 2700 \text{ watt-hours/day} \]

To convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours, we divide by 1000:
\[ 2700 \text{ watt-hours/day} = 2.7 \text{ kilowatt-hours/day} \]

Now, to find the total energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the daily energy saved by 30:
\[ 2.7 \text{ kilowatt-hours/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 81 \text{ kilowatt-hours} \]

So, the total kilowatt-hours of electric energy saved in 30 days is 81 kilowatt-hours."

"To determine how much money Tyson would spend on meat and cheese, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of sandwiches needed.
2. Determine the total amount of meat and cheese required.
3. Calculate the cost of the meat and cheese.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of sandwiches needed.**

There are 20 people and each sandwich serves 4 people.
\[ \text{Total sandwiches needed} = \frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people/sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total amount of meat and cheese required.**

Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.
\[ \text{Total meat required} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound/sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]
\[ \text{Total cheese required} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound/sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of the meat and cheese.**

The cost of meat is $7.00 per pound and the cost of cheese is $3.00 per pound.
\[ \text{Cost of meat} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times \$7.00/\text{pound} = \$35.00 \]
\[ \text{Cost of cheese} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times \$3.00/\text{pound} = \$15.00 \]

**Total cost:**
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$35.00 + \$15.00 = \$50.00 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of cannolis**: Allan initially has 40 cannolis.
2. **Corn to cannolis ratio**: There is twice as much corn as cannolis. Therefore, initially, Allan has \(2 \times 40 = 80\) corns.
3. **Cannolis after buying more**: Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new total of cannolis is \(40 + 60 = 100\).
4. **Corn after buying fewer**: Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he had after buying more. Since he now has 100 cannolis, he bought \(100 - 40 = 60\) fewer corns. Therefore, the new total of corns is \(80 - 60 = 20\).

Now, to find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house, we add the new totals of corns and cannolis:

\[100 \text{ (cannolis)} + 20 \text{ (corns)} = 120\]

So, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 120."
"Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day. He has already completed half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which means he has taken 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps so far.

"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is sold at ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means for every 2 pounds of taffy, Sally pays $3 for the first pound and $1.50 for the second pound (since it's half off).

For 2 pounds of taffy:
- First pound costs $3.
- Second pound costs $1.50.
- Total cost for 2 pounds of taffy = $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets:
- Seashells cost $1.50.
- Each magnet costs $0.25, and she bought 4 magnets, so the total cost for the magnets is $0.25 * 4 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
- Cost of taffy = $4.50.
- Cost of seashells = $1.50.
- Cost of magnets = $1.00.
- Total cost = $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00.

Sally's parents gave her $10 to spend. To find out how much money Sally has left, we subtract the total cost from the $10:

"Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees as \( A \).

From the problem, we know:
- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples.
- Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
- Joanne's sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
- Joanne's sister doesn't take any apples from the average trees, so she contributes 0 apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is:

"Let's denote the number of camels as \( C \) and the number of dromedaries as \( D \).

From the problem, we have two equations:
1. The total number of heads: \( C + D = 180 \)
2. The total number of humps: \( 2C + D = 304 \)

We can solve these equations simultaneously. First, we can express \( C \) from the first equation:
\[ C = 180 - D \]

Next, we substitute \( C \) in the second equation:
\[ 2(180 - D) + D = 304 \]
\[ 360 - 2D + D = 304 \]
\[ 360 - D = 304 \]
\[ -D = 304 - 360 \]
\[ -D = -56 \]

"To find the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we need to calculate the distance he traveled each day and then sum these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the first 4 days:
\[ \text{Distance per day} = 200 \text{ kilometers} \]
\[ \text{Number of days} = 4 \]
\[ \text{Total distance for the first 4 days} = 200 \times 4 = 800 \text{ kilometers} \]

Next, we calculate the distance traveled in the next 2 days, which is 30% of the distance traveled in the first 4 days:
\[ \text{Distance for the next 2 days} = 0.30 \times 800 = 240 \text{ kilometers} \]

On the third day of the second week, Tom didn't travel at all, so the distance for that day is:
\[ \text{Distance for the third day} = 0 \text{ kilometers} \]

For the remaining 3 days of the second week, Tom traveled 300 kilometers each day:
\[ \text{Distance per day} = 300 \text{ kilometers} \]
\[ \text{Number of days} = 3 \]
\[ \text{Total distance for the last 3 days} = 300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ kilometers} \]

Now, we sum up all the distances:
\[ \text{Total distance} = 800 + 240 + 0 + 900 = 1940 \text{ kilometers} \]

Therefore, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:
\[ 1940 \text{ kilometers} \]"
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to work backwards from the information given.

1. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. If Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, then Zack's locker is 4 times larger than Peter's locker.
   \[
   \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

2. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. If Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches, then Timothy's locker is twice as large as Zack's locker.
   \[
   \text{Timothy's locker size} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

Therefore, the size of Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches."
"Stanley's comb fell from an elevation of 10,000 feet to a ledge at an elevation of 10,000 feet - 4,000 feet = 6,000 feet. Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. Therefore, Oliver must climb 6,000 feet - 3,000 feet = 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

The final numerical answer is 3000."
"To determine the total capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to calculate the amount of money he received from the second bank and then add it to the initial capital he had.

1. The first bank gave him $4000.
2. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is \(2 \times 4000 = 8000\) dollars.
3. The total amount of money he received from both banks is \(4000 + 8000 = 12000\) dollars.
4. Adding this to his initial capital of $5000, the total capital he has now is \(5000 + 12000 = 17000\) dollars.

Therefore, the final capital Mr. Josue has now is 17000 dollars."
"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, which means a total of 4 * 5 = 20 cats were taken away. So, the number of cats remaining on the rock is 50 - 20 = 30 cats. Later, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse they'd seen. The number of cats that ran away is 3/5 * 30 = 18 cats. Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is 30 - 18 = 12 cats.

The final numerical answer is 12."
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service with the given pricing structure, we need to break down the cost into segments based on the different rates.

1. **First 6 months**: The cost is $8 per month.
   - Total cost for the first 6 months = 6 months * $8/month = $48.

2. **Next 2 months (months 7 and 8)**: The cost is the normal rate of $12 per month.
   - Total cost for the next 2 months = 2 months * $12/month = $24.

3. **Next 8 months (months 9 to 16)**: The cost is the increased rate of $14 per month.
   - Total cost for the next 8 months = 8 months * $14/month = $112.

4. **Remaining 4 months (months 17 to 20)**: The cost is the increased rate of $14 per month.
   - Total cost for the remaining 4 months = 4 months * $14/month = $56.

Now, we sum up all the costs to get the total cost for 2 years:
- Total cost = $48 + $24 + $112 + $56 = $240.

Therefore, the total cost for 2 years of the service is $240."
"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:

\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of both jeans:

\[ 28 + 22 = 50 \]

Cole saved a total of $6. According to the problem, he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. Let's denote the total savings as \( S \). Since he saved $6 in total, we have:

\[ S = 6 \]

The savings from the jogger jeans is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]

The savings from the tattered jeans is:

\[ 6 - 2 = 4 \]

Now, let's verify the savings from the individual jeans. The cost of the tattered jeans is $28, and he saved $4 from it. The cost of the jogger jeans is $22, and he saved $2 from it. This confirms the savings are correct.

The question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. We already know the cost of the tattered jeans is $28 and the cost of the jogger jeans is $22. The difference in cost is:

\[ 28 - 22 = 6 \]

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 more than the tattered jeans. The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to add up the capacities of all the vehicles rented.

First, we calculate the capacity of the buses:
\[ 4 \text{ buses} \times 60 \text{ employees per bus} = 240 \text{ employees} \]

Next, we calculate the capacity of the minibusses:
\[ 6 \text{ minibusses} \times 30 \text{ employees per minibus} = 180 \text{ employees} \]

Then, we calculate the capacity of the minivans:
\[ 10 \text{ minivans} \times 15 \text{ employees per minivan} = 150 \text{ employees} \]

Now, we add up the capacities of all the vehicles:
\[ 240 \text{ employees} + 180 \text{ employees} + 150 \text{ employees} = 570 \text{ employees} \]

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is:
\[ 570 \]"
"Lillian builds 3 bird feeders herself and buys 3 more, making a total of 6 bird feeders. Each of her bird feeders attracts 20 birds per day. The store-bought bird feeders attract 20 birds each, while her bird feeders attract 10 more birds each, which means they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds per day.

To find the total number of birds she can expect to see each day, we multiply the number of feeders by the number of birds each feeder attracts:

\[ 6 \text{ feeders} \times 30 \text{ birds per feeder} = 180 \text{ birds per day} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 180."
"First, let's determine the cost of the soup. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. The bagel costs $4.

To find 25% of $4:
\[ 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]

So, the soup costs:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Next, we know the cake costs half of the price of the bagel. The bagel costs $4, so:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the dinner by adding the cost of the soup, the bagel, and the cake:
\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \]

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for the dinner she ordered."
"Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( x \).

Kenny keeps \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his cards, so he sells \( \frac{2}{3} \) of them. The number of cards he sells is \( \frac{2}{3}x \).

He sells each card for $1.5, so the total amount of money he earns from selling the cards is \( 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}x = x \).

According to the problem, after spending $50 on the ticket, he has $50 left. This means the total amount of money he earned from selling the cards is $100 (the cost of the ticket plus the $50 he has left).

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ x = 100 \]

Therefore, Kenny started with 100 cards."
"First, let's determine how many hotdogs were prepared initially. The caterer was told to prepare enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs each. There were 36 guests, so half of the guests is:

\[ \frac{36}{2} = 18 \]

Each of these 18 guests was supposed to have 2 hotdogs, so the total number of hotdogs prepared initially is:

\[ 18 \times 2 = 36 \]

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. Since only 36 hotdogs were prepared, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:

\[ 40 - 36 = 4 \]

So, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 4."
"First, let's determine the number of letters in Indras' sister's name. We know that Indras' name has 6 letters. Half of the letters in Indras' name is:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name, so:

\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Now, to find the total number of letters in both names, we add the number of letters in Indras' name to the number of letters in her sister's name:

\[ 6 + 7 = 13 \]

So, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Mixing bowls: $20.00
- Utensils: 5 utensils at $5.00 each, so 5 * $5.00 = $25.00

Adding these together gives the total cost before the discount:
$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Now, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost:
20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00

Subtracting the discount from the total cost gives the final amount:
$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

So, the final numerical answer is $132.00."

Next, we calculate how many dragons Prince Walter slew. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur.

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Walter} = 2 \times 75 = 150 \]

Finally, we determine how many dragons Prince Bruce slew. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter.

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Bruce} = \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine how many gallons of gas are in one container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we can calculate the amount per container as follows:

\[ \text{Gallons per container} = \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5 \text{ containers}} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Josey needed \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a container. Therefore, the amount of gas Josey needed in gallons is:

\[ \text{Gallons needed} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ container} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so:

\[ \text{Pints needed} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints per gallon} = \frac{3 \times 8}{4} = \frac{24}{4} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, let's determine how much money George spent on chips. Since he got 3 bags of chips and each bag costs 40 cents, the total cost for the chips is:
\[ 3 \times 40 \text{ cents} = 120 \text{ cents} \]

Next, we need to find out how much money George had initially. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending 120 cents, this means he spent 99% of his money. Let's denote the total amount of money George had initially as \( M \). Since 99% of \( M \) is 120 cents, we can write:
\[ 0.99M = 120 \text{ cents} \]
\[ M = \frac{120 \text{ cents}}{0.99} \]
\[ M = \frac{120}{0.99} \text{ cents} \]
\[ M = 121.2121 \text{ cents} \]

Since George spent $5, which is 500 cents, we can verify that:
\[ 121.2121 \text{ cents} - 120 \text{ cents} = 1.2121 \text{ cents} \]
This is indeed 1% of 121.2121 cents, confirming our calculation.

Now, we need to find out how much money George spent on candy bars. Since he spent 120 cents on chips, the remaining money is:
\[ 500 \text{ cents} - 120 \text{ cents} = 380 \text{ cents} \]

Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so the number of candy bars George bought is:
\[ \frac{380 \text{ cents}}{75 \text{ cents per candy bar}} = \frac{380}{75} = \frac{76}{15} \approx 5.0667 \]

Since George can only buy whole candy bars, he bought 5 candy bars. Therefore, the number of candy bars George bought is:
\[ 5 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the amount of onions Antoine uses. The recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, and he doubles that amount:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00 \text{ per pound} = \$8.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box is $2.00:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00 \text{ per box} = \$4.00 \]

The total cost for the ingredients is the sum of the cost of the onions and the beef stock:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

"To determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to calculate the time it takes for Bernadette to drive to the theater.

First, we know that it takes Wayne four minutes to drive to the theater. According to the problem, the drive from Bernadette’s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne’s hotel. Therefore, we can calculate the time it takes for Bernadette to drive to the theater as follows:

\[
\text{Time for Bernadette} = 4 \times \text{Time for Wayne} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes}
\]

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne will take 4 minutes to get to the theater, he will arrive at the theater in:

\[
4 + 4 = 8 \text{ minutes}

"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to determine the width of the room. We know the area of the room and the length, so we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

Given:
- Area = 360 square feet
- Length = 3 yards

First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Now we can use the area formula to find the width:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{Width} \]

Solving for the width:

\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can calculate the perimeter of the rectangle using the formula:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

So, the perimeter of the room is 98 feet."

"First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven. Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour.

\[ \text{Temperature increase from oven} = 3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, let's calculate the temperature decrease due to the window. Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.

\[ \text{Temperature decrease from window} = \left(\frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes}}\right) \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 3 \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 6 \text{ degrees} \]

Now, let's add the initial temperature of the house, the temperature increase from the oven, and the temperature decrease from the window.

\[ \text{Final temperature} = 40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees} \]

"First, let's convert all the times to minutes for easier calculation:
- Jon's swim time: 40 minutes
- Jon's bike ride time: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 60 + 20 = 80 minutes
- Jon's run time: 50 minutes

Now, let's calculate James's times:
- James's swim time: Jon's swim time minus 10% of Jon's swim time
  \[ \text{James's swim time} = 40 - (0.10 \times 40) = 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]
- James's bike ride time: Jon's bike ride time plus 5 minutes
  \[ \text{James's bike ride time} = 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]
- James's run time: We need to find this.

Next, let's calculate the total time for Jon and James:
- Jon's total time: 
  \[ \text{Jon's total time} = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes} \]
- James's total time:
  \[ \text{James's total time} = 36 + 85 + \text{James's run time} \]

We know that Jon won by 10 minutes, so:
\[ \text{James's total time} = 170 - 10 = 160 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we can solve for James's run time:
\[ 36 + 85 + \text{James's run time} = 160 \]
\[ 121 + \text{James's run time} = 160 \]
\[ \text{James's run time} = 160 - 121 = 39 \text{ minutes} \]

"First, we need to determine how many miles the horse runs. The horse runs at a speed of 32 miles per hour for 30 minutes, which is half an hour. Therefore, the distance the horse runs is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 32 \text{ miles/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of hay the horse eats. For every mile the horse runs, it eats 1/2 a bail of hay. Therefore, for 16 miles, the horse eats:

\[ \text{Hay eaten} = 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail/mile} = 8 \text{ bails} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the hay. Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost for 8 bails is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars/bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which means he has:

\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

"To find the total number of crayon pieces Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the total from both types of packets.

For the six packets with eight pieces each:
\[ 6 \times 8 = 48 \]

For the four packets with sixteen pieces each:
\[ 4 \times 16 = 64 \]

Now, we add the totals from both types of packets:
\[ 48 + 64 = 112 \]

Therefore, the total number of crayon pieces Beatrice bought is:
\[ 112 \]"
"Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as \( P \).

The cost of the super ticket is $20, and it includes one popcorn and one soda for an extra $1. So, the total cost for the super ticket is $20 + $1 = $21.

The cost of buying a movie ticket for $12 and a popcorn and a soda at regular price is $12 + \( P \) + $3 = $15 + \( P \).

According to the problem, you saved $2 by buying the super ticket instead of buying the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda separately. Therefore, the cost of buying the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda separately is $2 more than the cost of the super ticket.

We can set up the equation as follows:
\[ 15 + P = 21 + 2 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[ 15 + P = 23 \]

To find \( P \), we subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:
\[ P = 23 - 15 \]
\[ P = 8 \]

So, the regular price of popcorn is $8."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the initial cost per balloon and then calculate the new cost per balloon after the price increase. Finally, we will find out how much Bentley paid for 170 balloons at the new price.

First, let's find the initial cost per balloon:
- The total cost for 20 balloons was $900.
- Therefore, the cost per balloon initially was:
  \[
  \text{Initial cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Two days later, the cost per balloon increased by $20:
- The new cost per balloon is:
  \[
  \text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost for 170 balloons at the new price:
- The total cost for 170 balloons at the new price is:
  \[
  \text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = 170 \times 65
  \]

Let's perform the multiplication:
\[
170 \times 65 = 170 \times (60 + 5) = (170 \times 60) + (170 \times 5)
\]
\[
170 \times 60 = 10200
\]
\[
170 \times 5 = 850
\]
\[
170 \times 65 = 10200 + 850 = 11050
\]

Therefore, the total amount Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons after the price increase is:
\[
\boxed{11050}
\]"
"To find the average speed of the car during the entire trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance for each segment of the trip:
- For the first segment, the car travels at 60 mph for 2 hours. The distance is \(60 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles}\).
- For the second segment, the car travels at 30 mph for 1 hour. The distance is \(30 \text{ mph} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 30 \text{ miles}\).

The total distance traveled is \(120 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 150 \text{ miles}\).

The total time taken for the trip is \(2 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} = 3 \text{ hours}\).

The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time:
\[ \text{Average speed} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ mph} \]

So, the car's average speed during the trip is 50 mph."
"First, let's determine the value of the sapphires Jenna traded. She traded 3 sapphires, and each sapphire is worth $800. Therefore, the value of the sapphires she traded is:

\[ 3 \text{ sapphires} \times \$800 \text{ per sapphire} = \$2400 \]

Next, we need to determine how many sapphires Jenna has left after the trade. Initially, she had 8 sapphires and traded 3, so she has:

\[ 8 - 3 = 5 \text{ sapphires} \]

Now, we calculate the total value of the sapphires she has left:

\[ 5 \text{ sapphires} \times \$800 \text{ per sapphire} = \$4000 \]

Jenna also received 2 rubies in the trade. Each ruby is worth $1200, so the value of the rubies she received is:

\[ 2 \text{ rubies} \times \$1200 \text{ per ruby} = \$2400 \]

To find the total value of all her jewels, we add the value of the sapphires she has left to the value of the rubies she received:

\[ \$4000 + \$2400 = \$6400 \]

Therefore, the total value of all her jewels is:

\[ \$6400 \]"
"To find out how many apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we can calculate it step by step.

First, we know that Marin eats 4 apples a day. Therefore, in 30 days, Marin will eat:
\[ 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples} \]

Similarly, Nancy also eats 4 apples a day. Therefore, in 30 days, Nancy will eat:
\[ 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples} \]

Now, to find out the total number of apples they both eat in 30 days, we add the apples eaten by Marin and Nancy:
\[ 120 \text{ apples} + 120 \text{ apples} = 240 \text{ apples} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 240 \]"
"First, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the raised bed) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

For one raised bed, the volume is:

\[ V = 8 \text{ feet} \times 2 \text{ feet} \times 2 \text{ feet} = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:

\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 \text{ cubic feet} = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \text{ cubic feet}}{2 \text{ cubic feet per bag}} = 160 \text{ bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \text{ bags} \times 12 \text{ dollars per bag} = 1920 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 1920 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of green cards. We know there are 15 red cards and 60% more green cards than red cards.

To find 60% of 15:
\[ 0.60 \times 15 = 9 \]

So, the number of green cards is:
\[ 15 + 9 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find the number of yellow cards. The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards:
\[ 15 + 24 = 39 \]

Now, we can find the total number of cards by adding the red, green, and yellow cards together:
\[ 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 \]

Therefore, the total number of cards of all mentioned colors is:
\[ 78 \]"
"Katelyn initially saw 50 fairies. Her friend saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw, which is 50 / 2 = 25 fairies. After these 25 fairies joined the original 50 fairies, the total number of fairies became 50 + 25 = 75 fairies. Then, 30 fairies flew away, so the remaining number of fairies is 75 - 30 = 45 fairies.

The final numerical answer is 45."
"To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we first need to determine the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies with 3 having spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies with 4 having spots.

The total number of puppies is:
\[ 8 + 12 = 20 \]

The total number of puppies with spots is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

The percentage of all the puppies that have spots is calculated by the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 \]

Now, let's calculate this:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.35 \times 100 = 35\% \]

So, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is:
\[ 35\% \]"
"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of the feed.

1. **Sugar Cubes:**
   - 2 boxes, each 1 pound.
   - Total weight = 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

2. **Carrots:**
   - 4 bags, each 12 pounds.
   - Total weight = 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

3. **Hay:**
   - 42 bales, each 75 pounds.
   - Total weight = 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

4. **Oats:**
   - 20 sacks, each 65 pounds.
   - Total weight = 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

Now, we sum the weights of all the feed to find the total weight:
- Total weight = 2 (sugar cubes) + 48 (carrots) + 3150 (hay) + 1300 (oats) = 4500 pounds.

The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find the number of trips needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number since partial trips are not possible:
- Number of trips = 4500 / 2250 = 2.

Therefore, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To determine how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate her weekly earnings and then multiply by four.

First, let's calculate her weekly earnings from aluminum cans:
- Each aluminum can is worth 2 cents.
- She drinks 3 aluminum cans a week.

Weekly earnings from aluminum cans = 3 cans/week * 2 cents/can = 6 cents/week.

Next, let's calculate her weekly earnings from plastic bottles:
- Each plastic bottle is worth 3 cents.
- She drinks 5 plastic bottles a week.

Weekly earnings from plastic bottles = 5 bottles/week * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents/week.

Now, let's find her total weekly earnings by adding the earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles:
- Total weekly earnings = 6 cents/week (from aluminum cans) + 15 cents/week (from plastic bottles) = 21 cents/week.

Finally, to find her total earnings for a four-week month, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4:
- Total earnings for a four-week month = 21 cents/week * 4 weeks = 84 cents.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many kids are not allergic to anything, we need to first determine how many kids are allergic to at least one of the allergens (dairy or peanuts).

Given:
- 9 kids are allergic to dairy.
- 6 kids are allergic to peanuts.
- 3 kids are allergic to both dairy and peanuts.

We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of kids allergic to at least one of the allergens:
\[ \text{Allergic to at least one} = \text{Allergic to dairy} + \text{Allergic to peanuts} - \text{Allergic to both} \]
\[ \text{Allergic to at least one} = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to at least one of the allergens. 

To find the number of kids who are not allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids allergic to at least one allergen from the total number of kids in the class:
\[ \text{Not allergic to anything} = \text{Total kids} - \text{Allergic to at least one} \]
\[ \text{Not allergic to anything} = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is 20."

"To find out how much more Keegan and Tashay need to earn to reach their goal, we first need to calculate the total amount they have already earned together.

Keegan earned $83 and Tashay earned $91. So, the total amount they have earned is:
\[ 83 + 91 = 174 \]

Their goal is to raise $200. To find out how much more they need to earn, we subtract the total amount they have already earned from their goal:
\[ 200 - 174 = 26 \]

Therefore, Keegan and Tashay need to earn \(\boxed{26}\) more dollars to reach their goal."
"First, let's determine how many songs Luri currently has on his player. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, we can calculate the number of songs Luri has as follows:

\[ \text{Number of songs Luri has} = 3 \times \text{Number of songs Gabriel has} = 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

Next, we need to find out how many songs each can add to their player. Since both players can store up to 100 songs, the number of additional songs each can add is:

\[ \text{Number of additional songs Gabriel can add} = 100 - \text{Number of songs Gabriel has} = 100 - 20 = 80 \]
\[ \text{Number of additional songs Luri can add} = 100 - \text{Number of songs Luri has} = 100 - 60 = 40 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Number of additional songs Gabriel can add} - \text{Number of additional songs Luri can add} = 80 - 40 = 40 \]

So, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to his player than Gabriel can add to his. The final numerical answer is:

# Number of oranges Stetson ate
oranges_eaten = fraction_eaten * total_oranges

# Amount of money Stetson gave up per orange
money_per_orange = 10

# Total amount of money Stetson gave up
total_money_given_up = oranges_eaten * money_per_orange
total_money_given_up
```
```output
240.0
```
Stetson gave up a total of \( \boxed{240} \) dollars."

"To determine the number of bags of oats Uncle Ben needs for his horses over five days, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. **Calculate the total amount of oats consumed by one horse per day:**
   - Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal.
   - Each horse is fed twice a day.
   - Therefore, one horse consumes \(5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day}\).

2. **Calculate the total amount of oats consumed by all four horses per day:**
   - There are four horses.
   - Each horse consumes 10 pounds of oats per day.
   - Therefore, all four horses consume \(10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}\).

3. **Calculate the total amount of oats consumed by all four horses over five days:**
   - All four horses consume 40 pounds of oats per day.
   - Over five days, they consume \(40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds}\).

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total height of the human pyramid. We know that 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall, and the 10th cheerleader is 60 inches tall. The human pyramid is structured as follows:

- 4 girls on the bottom layer
- 3 girls on the second layer
- 2 girls on the third layer
- 1 girl on the top layer

First, we calculate the total height of the pyramid by summing the heights of all the cheerleaders:

- 9 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall, so their total height is \(9 \times 64\) inches.
- 1 cheerleader is 60 inches tall, so her height is 60 inches.

Next, we add these heights together:

\[ 9 \times 64 + 60 \]

Let's calculate this step by step:

\[ 9 \times 64 = 576 \]
\[ 576 + 60 = 636 \]

So, the total height of the human pyramid is 636 inches. To convert this height into feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):

\[ \frac{636}{12} = 53 \]

Therefore, the height of the human pyramid is 53 feet."

So, Angela is currently 38 years old."
"To calculate the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks, we need to consider the cost of his morning and afternoon rides.

First, let's determine the number of rides Paul took each day:
- Morning ride: 1
- Afternoon ride: 1

So, the total number of rides per day is:
\[ 1 + 1 = 2 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of rides over 14 days:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ rides} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the morning rides:
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- Total cost for morning rides:
\[ 28 \text{ rides} \times 6 \text{ dollars/ride} = 168 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the afternoon rides:
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- Total cost for afternoon rides:
\[ 28 \text{ rides} \times 2 \text{ dollars/ride} = 56 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the total costs of the morning and afternoon rides to find the total amount spent:

"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let's denote the number of guests by \( n \).

**Cost at the first venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Cost of food per guest: $5
- Total cost at the first venue: \( 200 + 5n \)

**Cost at the second venue:**
- Cost per guest: $25
- Cost of food per guest: $5 (already included in the price)
- Total cost at the second venue: \( 25n \)

We need to find the value of \( n \) for which the costs at both venues are equal. Therefore, we set the two cost equations equal to each other:

\[ 200 + 5n = 25n \]

Next, we solve for \( n \):

1. Subtract \( 5n \) from both sides of the equation:
   \[ 200 = 25n - 5n \]
   \[ 200 = 20n \]

2. Divide both sides by 20:
   \[ n = \frac{200}{20} \]
   \[ n = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \( 10 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \( D \). According to the problem, Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects. Additionally, David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.

The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides to isolate the term with \( D \):

\[ 4D = 36 \]

Now, divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( D \):

\[ D = 9 \]

Since Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects, we substitute \( D = 9 \) into the expression:

\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Therefore, Lily found 16 insects. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his sled dogs, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
2. Determine the number of pairs of legs (since each pair of snowshoes is for one pair of legs).
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of pairs of legs.

First, we know that each dog has four legs and Mario has 6 dogs. Therefore, the total number of legs is:
\[ 6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Since each pair of snowshoes covers one pair of legs, the number of pairs of legs (and thus the number of pairs of snowshoes) is:
\[ 24 \text{ legs} \div 2 \text{ legs per pair} = 12 \text{ pairs of legs} \]

Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, so the total cost for 12 pairs of snowshoes is:
\[ 12 \text{ pairs} \times 12 \text{ dollars per pair} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is:

"To determine how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her current bus trips and compare it to the cost of the weekly bus pass.

First, let's calculate the total cost of her current bus trips:
- Janet takes two bus trips each day.
- She takes these trips five days a week.
- Each bus trip costs $2.20.

The total number of bus trips per week is:
\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 10 \text{ trips/week} \]

The total cost of her current bus trips per week is:
\[ 10 \text{ trips/week} \times \$2.20 \text{ per trip} = \$22.00 \text{ per week} \]

Next, we compare this to the cost of the weekly bus pass:
- The weekly bus pass costs $20.

\[ \$22.00 - \$20.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, Janet would save $2.00 by buying the weekly bus pass."
"The farm has 30 cows and 15 sheep (since the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, and the zoo has 20 sheep, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep, but the question states the farm has 15 sheep, which is consistent with the zoo having twice as many cows as the farm).

The zoo has 20 sheep and 40 cows (since the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, and the farm has 30 cows, so the zoo has 30 * 2 = 60 cows, but the question states the zoo has 20 sheep and 40 cows, which is consistent).

The total number of animals on the farm is 30 cows + 15 sheep = 45 animals.
The total number of animals in the zoo is 40 cows + 20 sheep = 60 animals.

Therefore, the combined total number of animals on the farm and in the zoo is 45 + 60 = 105 animals."

"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we first need to calculate the total number of calories he needs to burn to lose 30 pounds. Given that he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose one pound, the total calories he needs to burn to lose 30 pounds is:

\[ 3500 \text{ calories/pound} \times 30 \text{ pounds} = 105000 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to determine the number of days Andy has until his birthday. He has until July 19th from December 31st. Counting the days:

- December has 31 days, so from December 31st to December 19th is 12 days.
- January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days.
- February has 28 days in a non-leap year, so from February 1st to February 28th is 28 days.
- March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days.
- April has 30 days, so from April 1st to April 30th is 30 days.
- May has 31 days, so from May 1st to May 31st is 31 days.
- June has 30 days, so from June 1st to June 30th is 30 days.
- July 1st to July 19th is 19 days.

Adding these up, the total number of days from December 31st to July 19th is:

\[ 12 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 212 \text{ days} \]

Now, to find the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we divide the total calories he needs to burn by the number of days:

\[ \frac{105000 \text{ calories}}{212 \text{ days}} \approx 495.52 \text{ calories/day} \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, Andy needs to have a daily calorie deficit of approximately 496 calories."

Therefore, the final amount of money Julie has left is $300."
"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, the house cost three times as much as the lot, so we can write:

\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]

Combining like terms, we have:

\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

To find \( L \), we divide both sides by 4:

\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000 \]

Now that we know the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):

\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000 \]

So, the house cost $90,000."

First, the fight lasts 5 rounds, and each round is 3 minutes long. So, the total duration of the fight is:
\[ 5 \text{ rounds} \times 3 \text{ minutes/round} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, since Joe throws 25 punches per minute, the total number of punches thrown in 15 minutes is:
\[ 25 \text{ punches/minute} \times 15 \text{ minutes} = 375 \text{ punches} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 375 \]"
"To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many cookies Josh made.
2. Use the number of cookies Josh made to find out how many cookies Kelsie made.

First, we know that Suzanne made 36 cookies. Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made. Therefore, we calculate the number of cookies Josh made as follows:

\[
\text{Cookies made by Josh} = \frac{1}{4} \times 36 = 9
\]

Next, Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. Therefore, we calculate the number of cookies Kelsie made as follows:

\[
\text{Cookies made by Kelsie} = 2 \times 9 = 18
\]

So, Kelsie made 18 cookies. The final numerical answer is:

\[
18

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has. He has four $10 bills and six $20 bills.

The total amount from the $10 bills is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

The total amount from the $20 bills is:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of money Ali has:
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \]

Ali gives half of this total money to his sister:
\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \]

So, the remaining amount of money Ali has is:
\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \]

Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = \frac{3 \times 80}{5} = \frac{240}{5} = 48 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is:
\[ 80 - 48 = 32 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 32 \]"
"First, let's convert Rob's time to minutes. Rob takes 2 hours, and since there are 60 minutes in an hour, Rob takes:

\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we know that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time Rob takes. So, we first calculate double the time Rob takes:

\[ 2 \times 120 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

Then, we add the additional 40 minutes:

\[ 240 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 280 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Royce takes 280 minutes to shingle a house."
"To determine the total number of skeins of wool Martha will need, we should calculate the total required for each item and then sum them up.

- Hats: 3 hats * 2 skeins per hat = 6 skeins
- Scarves: 3 scarves * 4 skeins per scarf = 12 skeins
- Sweaters: 3 sweaters * 12 skeins per sweater = 36 skeins
- Mittens: 3 pairs * 1 skein per pair = 3 skeins
- Socks: 3 pairs * 2 skeins per pair = 6 skeins

Now, we sum up the total skeins needed:
6 (hats) + 12 (scarves) + 36 (sweaters) + 3 (mittens) + 6 (socks) = 63 skeins

Therefore, Martha will need to buy 63 skeins of wool."
"To determine how many math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of problems Chris completes on Tuesday.
2. Determine the total number of problems completed by the end of Tuesday.
3. Calculate the number of problems remaining after Tuesday.
4. Determine the number of problems Chris completes on Wednesday.
5. Calculate the number of problems remaining after Wednesday.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Chris completes 12 problems on Monday.
2. On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday. Therefore, the number of problems completed on Tuesday is:
   \[
   3 \times 12 = 36
   \]

3. The total number of problems completed by the end of Tuesday is:
   \[
   12 + 36 = 48
   \]

4. The number of problems remaining after Tuesday is:
   \[
   100 - 48 = 52
   \]

5. On Wednesday, Chris completes one-quarter of the remaining problems. Therefore, the number of problems completed on Wednesday is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 52 = 13
   \]

6. The number of problems remaining after Wednesday is:
   \[
   52 - 13 = 39
   \]

Therefore, the number of math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday is:
\[
\boxed{39}

"First, let's determine the number of quarts each person can pick per hour:

- Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.
- Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
- Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick \(5 \times 2 = 10\) quarts per hour.
- Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than does Kathy, so Ricky can pick \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, let's add up the quarts picked per hour by all four individuals:

- Tony: 6 quarts
- Bobby: 5 quarts
- Kathy: 10 quarts
- Ricky: 8 quarts

Total quarts picked per hour = \(6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29\) quarts.

The final numerical answer is 29."

- Total rows = 6 + 3 = 9 rows.

The final numerical answer is 9."
"To determine how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we first need to find out how many cups of raisins she has available for making the cookies. Since she has 27 cups of raisins and she wants to divide them equally among oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix, we divide the total amount of raisins by 3.

\[ \text{Raisins per category} = \frac{27 \text{ cups}}{3} = 9 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we know that each batch of oatmeal cookies requires \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a cup of raisins. To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make with 9 cups of raisins, we divide 9 by \( \frac{3}{4} \).

\[ \text{Number of batches} = 9 \div \frac{3}{4} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 12 \]

So, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies."
"To calculate the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily consumption before adding the new device.
2. Calculate the daily consumption after adding the new device.
3. Calculate the weekly consumption before and after adding the new device.
4. Calculate the weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device.
5. Find the difference between the two weekly electric bills.

**Step 1: Calculate the daily consumption before adding the new device.**
- Daily consumption before = 12 kilowatts per hour.

**Step 2: Calculate the daily consumption after adding the new device.**
- Daily consumption after = 12 kilowatts per hour + 2 kilowatts per hour = 14 kilowatts per hour.

- Weekly consumption after = 14 kilowatts per hour/day * 7 days = 98 kilowatt-hours.

**Step 4: Calculate the weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device.**
- Weekly electric bill before = 84 kilowatt-hours * $1.50/kilowatt-hour = $126.
- Weekly electric bill after = 98 kilowatt-hours * $1.50/kilowatt-hour = $147.

**Step 5: Find the difference between the two weekly electric bills.**
- Difference = $147 - $126 = $21.

The difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is $21."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which one person paints and then scale it up for 5 people.

1. One person can paint half a house in 5 days. Therefore, one person can paint a whole house in 10 days.
2. In one day, one person can paint \( \frac{1}{10} \) of a house.
3. If 5 people are working together, they can paint \( 5 \times \frac{1}{10} = \frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{2} \) of a house in one day.
4. To paint a whole house, 5 people would need \( \frac{1}{\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \) days.

To convert 2 days into hours:
- Since there are 24 hours in a day, 2 days is equal to \( 2 \times 24 = 48 \) hours.

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ophelia has 20 sofas.
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. Therefore, Ophelia has \(20 + 2 = 22\) chairs.
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. So, Jenna has \(3 \times 22 = 66\) chairs.
4. Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, Ophelia also has 22 sofas (as previously calculated).
5. Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so Jenna has \(66 - 2 = 64\) sofas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have together:

- Ophelia's total: \(20\) sofas + \(22\) chairs = \(42\)
- Jenna's total: \(64\) sofas + \(66\) chairs = \(130\)

Adding their totals together:

\[42 + 130 = 172\]

The total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have is 172."
"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had not bought the headphone set, we need to first determine the cost of the headphone set. We know that the total amount Tom paid was $48, and he bought one CD for $4. Therefore, the cost of the headphone set is:

\[ \text{Cost of headphone set} = \text{Total amount paid} - \text{Cost of CD} = 48 - 4 = 44 \]

Next, we need to find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with the $44 he spent on the headphone set. Since each CD costs $4, the number of CDs he could have bought is:

\[ \text{Number of CDs} = \frac{\text{Cost of headphone set}}{\text{Cost of CD}} = \frac{44}{4} = 11 \]

So, if Tom had not bought the headphone set, he would have been able to buy 11 more CDs. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 11 \]"
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we need to account for the hours he worked out each week, including the exceptions.

First, let's calculate the total hours for the weeks where he worked out 4 hours each week:
\[ 4 \text{ hours/week} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 24 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we add the hours for the two weeks where he worked out 5 hours each week:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

Then, we add the hours for the week where he worked out 6 hours:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/week} \times 1 \text{ week} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we sum all these hours together:
\[ 24 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:
\[ 40 \text{ hours} \]"
"Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

On the first stop, 8 people get off. Then, 5 times as many people as those who got off get on the bus. So, \(5 \times 8 = 40\) people get on the bus. The number of people on the bus after the first stop is:
\[48 - 8 + 40 = 80\]

On the second stop, 21 people get off. Then, 3 times fewer people get on the bus than those who got off, which means \(21 / 3 = 7\) people get on the bus. The number of people on the bus after the second stop is:
\[80 - 21 + 7 = 66\]

Therefore, the final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is 66."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, Jame's current age is \( 27 - 5 = 22 \) years.

2. **Determine the cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 22 + 8 = 30 \) years old.
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, the cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \).
   - Therefore, the cousin's age in 8 years will be \( 60 - 5 = 55 \) years.

3. **Determine the cousin's current age:**
   - If the cousin will be 55 in 8 years, then the cousin's current age is \( 55 - 8 = 47 \) years.

4. **Calculate the age difference between Jame and his cousin:**
   - Jame is currently 22 years old.
   - The cousin is currently 47 years old.
   - The age difference is \( 47 - 22 = 25 \) years.

The final numerical answer is 25."
"Let's break down the information given:

- The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400.
- The computer costs $1,100.
- The printer costs $400 less than the computer, so the printer costs $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the computer and the printer:
- Cost of the computer: $1,100
- Cost of the printer: $700
- Total cost of the computer and the printer: $1,100 + $700 = $1,800

Since the total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400, we can find the total cost of the 2 monitors by subtracting the total cost of the computer and the printer from the total cost:
- Total cost of the computer and the printer: $1,800
- Total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer: $2,400
- Total cost of the 2 monitors: $2,400 - $1,800 = $600

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the total cost of the 2 monitors by 2:
- Total cost of the 2 monitors: $600
- Cost of one monitor: $600 / 2 = $300

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is $300."
"To find out how many seashells each girl brought, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of boys and girls.
2. Calculate the total number of seashells brought by the boys.
3. Calculate the total number of seashells brought by the girls.

First, since there are twenty kids in total and they are divided into two equal groups of girls and boys, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

Next, each boy brought back 60 seashells. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is:
\[ 10 \text{ boys} \times 60 \text{ seashells/boy} = 600 \text{ seashells} \]

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. So, the total number of seashells brought by the girls is:
\[ 600 \text{ seashells} + 4 \times 600 \text{ seashells} = 600 \text{ seashells} + 2400 \text{ seashells} = 3000 \text{ seashells} \]

Since there are 10 girls, the number of seashells each girl brought is:
\[ \frac{3000 \text{ seashells}}{10 \text{ girls}} = 300 \text{ seashells/girl} \]

Therefore, the number of seashells brought by each girl is:
\[ 300 \]"
"If George has 3 candies left after eating 5, it means George originally had 3 + 5 = 8 candies.

Since Nick had twice as many candies as George originally, Nick had 2 * 8 = 16 candies.

So, the final numerical answer is 16."
"First, let's determine Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, we can calculate Alyana's age as follows:

Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4
Alyana's age = 10 - 4
Alyana's age = 6

Next, we need to find Anne's age. Since Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, we can calculate Anne's age as follows:

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2
Anne's age = 6 + 2
Anne's age = 8

Therefore, Anne is 8 years old."
"To find the total thickness of the four books, let's calculate the thickness of each book step by step:

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so it is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm thick.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm thick.

Now, let's add the thicknesses of all four books together:

\[31 + 50 + 45 + 62\]

First, add 31 and 50:

\[31 + 50 = 81\]

Next, add 45 to the result:

\[81 + 45 = 126\]

Finally, add 62 to the result:

\[126 + 62 = 188\]

So, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma still needs to make to complete her monthly goal of 72 vlogs, we can subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her monthly goal.

Vlogs made so far: 18 (first week) + 21 (second week) + 15 (third week) = 54 vlogs

Vlogs needed to reach the goal: 72 (monthly goal) - 54 (vlogs made so far) = 18 vlogs

So, Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete her monthly goal."
"To calculate the total amount you ended up paying, we need to first calculate the tip and then add it to the original dinner bill.

The tip is 20% of the $50 dinner bill. 

\[ \text{Tip} = 50 \times \frac{20}{100} = 50 \times 0.20 = 10 \]

So, the total amount you paid is the original bill plus the tip:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 50 + 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 60."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Sharing:**
   - The total amount is $18.
   - It is shared among 3 boys.
   - Each boy's initial share is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, each boy gets $6 initially.

2. **Eldest Boy's Actions:**
   - The eldest boy adds $5 to his share.
   - His new share is \( 6 + 5 = 11 \) dollars.
   - The following day, he adds another $10.
   - His total amount after these additions is \( 11 + 10 = 21 \) dollars.

3. **Spending:**
   - The eldest boy spends $8.
   - His amount after spending is \( 21 - 8 = 13 \) dollars.

4. **Saving and Tripling:**
   - He saves some more money and triples the amount he had left after spending the $8.
   - Let's denote the amount he saved as \( x \).
   - His total amount before tripling is \( 13 + x \).
   - After tripling, his total amount is \( 3(13 + x) \).

Since the problem does not specify the exact amount he saved, we assume he saved enough to make the total amount after tripling a specific value. However, without loss of generality, we can assume he saved enough to make the total amount after tripling a specific value that fits the problem's context.

Let's assume he saved enough to make the total amount after tripling a specific value, say \( y \). Then:
\[ 3(13 + x) = y \]

Given the problem's context, we can infer that the final amount he has is a specific value. Let's solve for \( y \) assuming he saved enough to make the total amount after tripling a specific value.

Let's assume he saved enough to make the total amount after tripling $24 (a reasonable assumption based on the problem's context):
\[ 3(13 + x) = 24 \]
\[ 13 + x = \frac{24}{3} \]
\[ 13 + x = 8 \]
\[ x = 8 - 13 \]
\[ x = -5 \]

This negative value for \( x \) is not practical, so let's assume he saved enough to make the total amount after tripling $21:
\[ 3(13 + x) = 21 \]
\[ 13 + x = \frac{21}{3} \]
\[ 13 + x = 7 \]
\[ x = 7 - 13 \]
\[ x = -6 \]

This negative value for \( x \) is also not practical. Let's assume he saved enough to make the total amount after tripling $27:
\[ 3(13 + x) = 27 \]
\[ 13 + x = \frac{27}{3} \]
\[ 13 + x = 9 \]
\[ x = 9 - 13 \]
\[ x = -4 \]

This negative value for \( x \) is also not practical. Let's assume he saved enough to make the total amount after tripling $30:
\[ 3(13 + x) = 30 \]
\[ 13 + x = \frac{30}{3} \]
\[ 13 + x = 10 \]
\[ x = 10 - 13 \]
\[ x = -3 \]

This negative value for \( x \) is also not practical. Let's assume he saved enough to make the total amount after tripling $33:
\[ 3(13 + x) = 33 \]
\[ 13 + x = \frac{33}{3} \]
\[ 13 + x = 11 \]
\[ x = 11 - 13 \]
\[ x = -2 \]

This negative value for \( x \) is also not practical. Let's assume he saved enough to make the total amount after tripling $36:
\[ 3(13 + x) = 36 \]
\[ 13 + x = \frac{36}{3} \]
\[ 13 + x = 12 \]
\[ x = 12 - 13 \]
\[ x = -1 \]

This negative value for \( x \) is also not practical. Let's assume he saved enough to make the total amount after tripling $39:
\[ 3(13 + x) = 39 \]
\[ 13 + x = \frac{39}{3} \]
\[ 13 + x = 13 \]
\[ x = 13 - 13 \]
\[ x = 0 \]

This value for \( x \) is practical. Therefore, the eldest boy's final amount is:
\[ 3(13 + 0) = 39 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{39} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and use the information given.

First, let's determine the total number of days in April. April has 30 days.

Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half of the month as he does in the first half. This means the first half of the month has 15 days and the second half also has 15 days.

Let's denote the amount Elvis saves daily in the first half of the month as \( x \). Therefore, the amount he saves daily in the second half of the month would be \( 2x \).

The total savings for the first half of the month would be:
\[ 15x \]

The total savings for the second half of the month would be:
\[ 15 \times 2x = 30x \]

The total savings for the entire month would be the sum of the savings from the first and second halves:
\[ 15x + 30x = 45x \]

We know that Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 45:
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Elvis has to save $25 for each day in the first half of the month. For the second half of the month, he has to save:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save $50 for each day in the second half of the month.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 50 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the apples:
- Verna bought 3 apples at $1.50 each.
- Total cost for apples = 3 * $1.50 = $4.50

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the oranges:
- Verna bought 5 oranges at $0.80 each.
- Total cost for oranges = 5 * $0.80 = $4.00

Then, let's calculate the total cost of the peaches:
- Verna bought 6 peaches at $0.75 each.
- Total cost for peaches = 6 * $0.75 = $4.50

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the fruits:
- Total cost = Cost of apples + Cost of oranges + Cost of peaches
- Total cost = $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

Verna gave $20 to the seller. To find out the change she received, we subtract the total cost of the fruits from the amount she gave:
- Change received = Amount given - Total cost
- Change received = $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

Therefore, the final numerical answer is $7.00."
"To determine how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we first need to calculate the total amount each of them earns.

Jairus earns $0.8 for each task. If he finished 20 tasks, his total earnings are:
\[ 0.8 \times 20 = 16 \]

Jenny earns $0.5 for each task. If she finished 20 tasks, her total earnings are:
\[ 0.5 \times 20 = 10 \]

Now, to find out how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we subtract Jenny's total earnings from Jairus's total earnings:
\[ 16 - 10 = 6 \]

So, Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny."
"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars. The total amount of money they have to divide is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's amount as follows:

\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars.

The final numerical answer is 80."
"Jeff walks 3 miles to work and 3 miles back home each day, so he walks a total of 3 + 3 = 6 miles each day. If he has to work 5 times a week, then the total miles he walks in a week is 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week. 

The final numerical answer is 30."
"To determine the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Rewriting**: Elise writes the entire alphabet twice.
   - The alphabet has 26 letters.
   - Therefore, writing it twice means \(26 \times 2 = 52\) letters.

2. **Second Rewriting**: Elise writes half of the alphabet once.
   - Half of the alphabet is \(26 / 2 = 13\) letters.
   - Therefore, writing half of the alphabet once means \(13\) letters.

3. **Third Rewriting**: Elise rewrites everything she has already written.
   - This includes the two full alphabets and the half alphabet.
   - The total number of letters already written is \(52 + 13 = 65\).
   - Rewriting everything means writing \(65\) letters again.

Now, we sum up all the letters written:
- First rewriting: \(52\) letters.
- Second rewriting: \(13\) letters.
- Third rewriting: \(65\) letters.

Adding these together:
\[ 52 + 13 + 65 = 130 \]

Therefore, the total number of letters Elise has written is:
\[ 130 \]"

"First, let's calculate the total cost of each item before the discount:

- Five notebooks: \(5 \times \$1.50 = \$7.50\)
- Two pens: \(2 \times \$0.25 = \$0.50\)
- One calculator: \(1 \times \$12 = \$12\)
- One geometry set: \(1 \times \$10 = \$10\)

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost before the discount:

\[
\$7.50 + \$0.50 + \$12 + \$10 = \$20
\]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:

\[
10\% \text{ of } \$20 = 0.10 \times \$20 = \$2
\]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Daniel has to spend:

\[
\$20 - \$2 = \$18
\]

So, Daniel has to spend \$18 on all the items he wants to buy."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the hamburgers:
5 hamburgers * $4 each = $20

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the potato fries:
10 packs * $0.30 each = $3

Then, let's calculate the total cost of the fruit drinks:
5 cans * $2 each = $10

Now, let's add up the total cost of all items:
Total cost = Cost of hamburgers + Cost of potato fries + Cost of fruit drinks
Total cost = $20 + $3 + $10 = $33

Carly gives a fifty-dollar bill, so the change she gets back is:
Change = $50 - Total cost
Change = $50 - $33 = $17

The final numerical answer is $17."
"To calculate the amount of money Antonella earned, we need to break down the commission structure:

1. For the first $1000 of sales, she earns a 30% commission.
2. For sales over $1000, she earns an additional 10% commission on the amount over $1000.

First, let's calculate the commission for the first $1000:
\[ \text{Commission for first } \$1000 = 1000 \times 0.30 = \$300 \]

Next, we calculate the additional commission for the sales over $1000. Antonella sold goods worth $2500, so the amount over $1000 is:
\[ 2500 - 1000 = \$1500 \]

The additional commission for the $1500 is:
\[ \text{Additional commission} = 1500 \times 0.10 = \$150 \]

Now, we add the two commissions together to find the total commission:
\[ \text{Total commission} = 300 + 150 = \$450 \]

Therefore, Antonella earned:
\[ \text{Final amount} = \$450 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 450 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of bottles Bill currently has. He has 2 cases of water, and each case has 24 bottles.

Total bottles Bill currently has = 2 cases * 24 bottles/case = 48 bottles.

Next, we need to determine the total number of bottles Bill needs for his guests. He has 70 guests and wants to provide 2 bottles per guest.

Total bottles needed = 70 guests * 2 bottles/guest = 140 bottles.

Now, we can find out how many additional bottles Bill needs to buy by subtracting the number of bottles he currently has from the number of bottles he needs.

Additional bottles needed = Total bottles needed - Total bottles Bill currently has
Additional bottles needed = 140 bottles - 48 bottles = 92 bottles.

So, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water."
"First, let's determine how long it takes Ray to swim a mile when the water is warm.

Given:
- When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.
- When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold.

Let's calculate the time it takes to swim a mile in warm water:
- Twice the time it takes in cold water is \(2 \times 16 = 32\) minutes.
- Adding 2 minutes to this gives \(32 + 2 = 34\) minutes.

So, it takes Ray 34 minutes to swim a mile in warm water.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water:
- In cold water, it takes \(16 \times 3 = 48\) minutes to swim 3 miles.
- In warm water, it takes \(34 \times 3 = 102\) minutes to swim 3 miles.

Finally, to find out how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day, we subtract the time taken in cold water from the time taken in warm water:
- \(102 - 48 = 54\) minutes.

Therefore, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day."
"First, let's calculate how much John earns in a day. He earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day, so his daily earnings are:
\[ 2 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours/day} = 10 \text{ dollars/day} \]

Next, let's calculate his weekly earnings. He works 4 days a week, so his weekly earnings are:
\[ 10 \text{ dollars/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 40 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Now, we need to determine how many weeks it will take for John to save $80. We can find this by dividing the total amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ dollars}}{40 \text{ dollars/week}} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80."

\[ 3 \times 40 = 120 \]

Now, to find the total cost for both subs, we add the cost of the foot-long fish sub and the six-inch cold-cut combo sub:

\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \]

So, the total cost for lunch today at Subway is $160."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes in all the buttons.

First, we know that there are 21 buttons in total. Out of these, 7 buttons have 2 holes each. So, the number of holes in these 7 buttons is:
\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ holes} \]

The rest of the buttons have 4 holes each. Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 of them have 2 holes, the number of buttons with 4 holes is:
\[ 21 - 7 = 14 \text{ buttons} \]

The number of holes in these 14 buttons is:
\[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \text{ holes} \]

"First, let's determine the volume of Zack's locker. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can calculate the volume of Zack's locker as follows:

\[ \text{Volume of Zack's locker} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Volume of Timothy's locker} \]

Given that Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches, we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[ \text{Volume of Zack's locker} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 = 12 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we need to find the volume of Peter's locker. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, so we can calculate the volume of Peter's locker as follows:

\[ \text{Volume of Peter's locker} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Volume of Zack's locker} \]

Substituting the volume of Zack's locker into the equation:

\[ \text{Volume of Peter's locker} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, the volume of Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches."
"First, let's determine the daily recommended cups of coffee for Octavia. Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, if we denote the daily recommended cups of coffee as \( R \), then Octavia drinks \( \frac{R}{2} \) cups of coffee.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks. Therefore, Juan drinks \( 10 \times \frac{R}{2} = 5R \) cups of coffee.

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. This means Juan needs to reduce his coffee intake from \( 5R \) cups to 4 cups.

To find out by how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we subtract the recommended daily intake from Juan's current intake:

\[ 5R - 4 \]

Since \( R \) is the daily recommended cups of coffee, the reduction Juan must make is:

\[ 5R - 4 \]

However, without the specific value of \( R \), we can't provide a numerical answer. If we assume \( R \) is the standard daily recommended cups of coffee, which is typically 4 cups, then:

\[ 5 \times 4 - 4 = 20 - 4 = 16 \]

Therefore, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups."
"To find the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then add them together.

Now, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs together:
30 hamsters + 15 guinea pigs = 45 rodents

The final numerical answer is 45."
"First, let's determine the weights of Susan and Bob.

Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark. Since Mark weighs 150 pounds, Susan's weight is:
\[ 150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds} \]

Bob weighs twice as much as Susan. Since Susan weighs 130 pounds, Bob's weight is:
\[ 2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we can find the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob. The average weight is calculated by summing their weights and dividing by the number of friends (which is 3).

The total weight of the three friends is:
\[ 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

The average weight is:
\[ \frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the pages read in the first week and add it to the pages read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week. She read for 15 minutes each night for 7 nights, so the total reading time in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pages she can read in 105 minutes. Since she can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, we first find out how many 1.5-minute intervals are in 105 minutes:
\[ \frac{105 \text{ minutes}}{1.5 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 70 \text{ intervals} \]

Since she reads 2 pages in each 1.5-minute interval, the total number of pages read in the first week is:
\[ 70 \text{ intervals} \times 2 \text{ pages/interval} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

Now, we know that in the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:

"To find out how many goals all three teenagers scored, we need to determine the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna based on the information given.

First, we know that Richie scored 80 goals. According to the problem, Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. Therefore, we can calculate the number of goals Mark scored as follows:
\[ \text{Goals scored by Mark} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 20 = 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Next, we know that Richie also scored 45 more goals than Anna. Therefore, we can calculate the number of goals Anna scored as follows:
\[ \text{Goals scored by Anna} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 45 = 80 - 45 = 35 \]

Now, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers by adding the goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna:
\[ \text{Total goals} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} + \text{Goals scored by Mark} + \text{Goals scored by Anna} = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Starting Value**: Diane gave the number train a starting value of 20.
2. **First Operation**: This starting value plus half the number was divided by 5.
   - Half of the starting value is \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \).
   - Adding this to the starting value gives \( 20 + 10 = 30 \).
   - Dividing this result by 5 gives \( \frac{30}{5} = 6 \).
3. **Second Operation**: The resulting value was multiplied by the starting value minus 12.
   - The starting value minus 12 is \( 20 - 12 = 8 \).

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by which the oven is off and then apply that same percentage to the 520 degrees required by the recipe.

First, let's find the percentage by which the oven is off when set to 450 degrees. The actual temperature is 468 degrees.

The difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature is:
\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage by which the oven is off is:
\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

Now, we need to apply this 4% off percentage to the 520 degrees required by the recipe.

The amount by which the temperature should be adjusted is:
\[ 520 \times \frac{4}{100} = 520 \times 0.04 = 20.8 \]

Therefore, the temperature Maggie should set her oven to is:
\[ 520 - 20.8 = 499.2 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 499.2 \]"
"To find the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, I need to add the duration of the first movie to the duration of the second movie.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Converting this to minutes:
1 hour = 60 minutes
1 hour and 30 minutes = 60 + 30 = 90 minutes

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting this to minutes:
2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes
2 hours and 5 minutes = 120 + 5 = 125 minutes

Now, adding the durations of both movies:
90 minutes (first movie) + 125 minutes (second movie) = 215 minutes

So, the total time Max will take to watch the two movies is 215 minutes."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we first need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and then subtract that from Herb's price.

Herb's house price = $76,000

30% of Herb's house price = 0.30 * $76,000 = $22,800

Juan's house price = Herb's house price - 30% of Herb's house price
Juan's house price = $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

Now, we add the prices of both houses to find the combined value:

Combined value = Herb's house price + Juan's house price
Combined value = $76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200

The value of the two houses combined is $129,200."
"First, let's determine the number of cups and dishes Judy initially bought.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups.

She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.

At the event, her friend brought 40 cups. Since Judy initially bought 12 cups, her friend brought \(40 - 12 = 28\) more cups than Judy bought.

Her friend also brought 20 more dishes than Judy bought. Since Judy bought 24 dishes, her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend.

Total cups brought:
- Judy brought 12 cups.
- Her friend brought 40 cups.
- Total cups = \(12 + 40 = 52\).

Total dishes brought:
- Judy brought 24 dishes.
- Her friend brought 44 dishes.
- Total dishes = \(24 + 44 = 68\).

Total number of utensils (cups and dishes) brought by the two:
- Total utensils = Total cups + Total dishes = \(52 + 68 = 120\).

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the discounted price of one box of contacts. The original price of one box is $100.00, and it is currently 10% off. 

To find the discount amount:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 100.00 \times \frac{10}{100} = 10.00 \]

So, the discounted price of one box is:
\[ \text{Discounted Price} = 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

Since Pete is buying 2 boxes, the total cost for 2 boxes is:
\[ \text{Total Cost for 2 Boxes} = 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost per pair of contacts. Since each box contains 90 single use contacts, 2 boxes will contain:
\[ \text{Total Contacts} = 90 \times 2 = 180 \]

Therefore, the cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ \text{Cost per Pair} = \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 1.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total hours Jill worked.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so:
\[ \text{Total hours Jill worked} = 2 + 1 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Tabitha agreed to pay $10 per hour, so Jill's earnings are:
\[ \text{Jill's earnings} = 3 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$30 \]

Next, let's calculate the total hours John worked.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so:
\[ \text{John's hours on Saturday} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so:
\[ \text{John's hours on Sunday} = 3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, John's total hours worked are:
\[ \text{John's total hours} = 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ hours} \]

John's earnings are:
\[ \text{John's earnings} = 7 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$70 \]

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings:
\[ \text{Difference in earnings} = \$70 - \$30 = \$40 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$40 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total calories burned by Hannah during her workout.

For the aerobics:
- She spends 2 hours doing aerobics.
- Aerobics burn 500 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from aerobics = 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.

For the running:
- She spends 1 hour running.
- Running burns 600 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from running = 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.

Now, let's add the calories burned from both activities to get the total calories burned:
- Total calories burned = 1000 calories (aerobics) + 600 calories (running) = 1600 calories.

Next, we need to determine how much water Hannah needs to drink. She needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns.

To find out how much water she needs to drink for 1600 calories:
- For 200 calories, she drinks 100 ml of water.
- For 1600 calories, she drinks (1600 calories / 200 calories) * 100 ml = 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
800"
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \).

According to the note, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans. Therefore, the number of red jelly beans \( R \) can be expressed as:
\[ R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B \]

Similarly, the number of green jelly beans \( G \) is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans:
\[ G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B \]

The total number of jelly beans is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
\[ R = 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]
\[ G = 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans:
\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 30 \]"
"To find the average of the three measurements, we first need to determine the typing speed for the third test. Jared's typing speed increased by 5 words per minute after the second test, so his speed for the third test will be:

\[ 52 \text{ WPM} + 5 \text{ WPM} = 57 \text{ WPM} \]

Now we have the three typing speeds: 47 WPM, 52 WPM, and 57 WPM. To find the average, we sum these values and divide by 3:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{47 + 52 + 57}{3} \]

Let's calculate the sum:

\[ 47 + 52 + 57 = 156 \]

Now, we divide the sum by 3:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{156}{3} = 52 \]

So, the average of the three measurements is 52 WPM."
"To find the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and eating donuts, we need to calculate the weight change for each option over the 5-week period and then find the difference.

- Weight loss over 5 weeks: \(1.25 \times 5 = 6.25\) pounds

For donuts:
- Weight gain per week: 1.75 pounds
- Weight gain over 5 weeks: \(1.75 \times 5 = 8.75\) pounds

Now, we find the difference in weight:
- Difference in weight: \(8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5\) pounds

The difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and eating donuts is 2.5 pounds."
"To determine the total number of seats Alex needs, we will calculate the number of attendees based on the invitations and responses.

1. Alex initially invites 100 people.
2. Each of these 100 people invites 2 friends, so the number of additional attendees is \(100 \times 2 = 200\).
3. Alex calls 10 friends and 8 of them bring their spouses. Since each of these 8 brings a spouse, the number of additional attendees is \(8\).

Adding these together, the total number of attendees is:
\[100 + 200 + 8 = 308\]

Therefore, Alex will need 308 seats."
"First, let's determine the weight of each dog based on the information provided:

The beanstalk starts at 4 feet tall and doubles its height every day. Let's calculate the height of the beanstalk day by day:

- Day 0: 4 feet
- Day 1: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
- Day 2: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
- Day 3: 16 * 2 = 32 feet

On Day 3, the beanstalk reaches 32 feet, which is taller than Mark's window that is 20 feet off the ground.

Therefore, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window."
"To determine how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms every day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Calculate the total protein intake per week.

First, we know that 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein. Therefore, the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Protein per 200 grams} = \left(\frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams of mushrooms}}\right) \times 200 \text{ grams of mushrooms} = 6 \text{ grams of protein} \]

Next, we calculate the total protein intake per week. Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, the total protein intake per day is 6 grams. Therefore, the total protein intake per week is:
\[ \text{Protein per week} = 6 \text{ grams/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 42 \]"
"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, we can write the equation:

Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
\[ J - 2J = -10 \]
\[ -J = -10 \]
\[ J = 10 \]

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

George needs 2 implants, and each implant has a base price of $2000. So, the cost for the implants is:
\[ 2 \times 2000 = 4000 \]

For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. So, the additional cost for the porcelain crown is:
\[ 500 \]

The total cost for the dental work is:
\[ 4000 + 500 = 4500 \]

George has already put down a deposit of $600. Therefore, the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
\[ 4500 - 600 = 3900 \]

George makes $15 per hour at work. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
\[ \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \]

So, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 260 \]"
"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees, and the other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees. The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ degrees} \]
\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ degrees} \]

"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz makes in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we can calculate the hourly rate for Ruiz as follows:

\[ \text{Ruiz's hourly rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa makes in one hour. According to the problem, Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we can calculate Marissa's hourly rate as follows:

\[ \text{Marissa's hourly rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 60 \text{ pounds per hour} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we can calculate the total amount of chocolates Ruiz makes in 12 hours:

"To calculate the total earnings from selling lemonade, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first four hours and the next two hours.

For the first four hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.
- Total cups sold in four hours = 15 cups/hour * 4 hours = 60 cups.
- Total earnings from the first four hours = 60 cups * $0.50/cup = $30.

For the next two hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.
- Total cups sold in two hours = 10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups.
- Total earnings from the next two hours = 20 cups * $0.60/cup = $12.

Now, we add the earnings from both periods to find the total earnings:
- Total earnings = $30 (from the first four hours) + $12 (from the next two hours) = $42.

Therefore, Patrick earned $42 from selling lemonade for 6 hours."
"First, let's calculate the total number of rotations the tires make in a month. We know that for every 2 miles driven, the tires rotate 725 times. Jeremy drives 400 miles a month.

Total rotations per month = (400 miles / 2 miles per 725 rotations) * 725 rotations

Let's calculate this:
```python
# Given values
miles_per_month = 400
rotations_per_2_miles = 725

# Calculate total rotations per month
rotations_per_month = (miles_per_month / 2) * rotations_per_2_miles

The car's tires rotate 145,000 times in a month. Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations before replacement. To find out how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to determine how many months it takes for the tires to reach 10,440,000 rotations.

First, we calculate the number of months:

\[ \text{Number of months} = \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{145,000 \text{ rotations per month}} \]

Let's calculate this:
```python
# Given values
total_rotations_per_tire = 10440000
rotations_per_month = 145000

# Calculate the number of months before replacement
months_before_replacement = total_rotations_per_tire / rotations_per_month

The car's tires will need to be replaced after approximately 9.23 months. To convert this into years, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):

\[ \text{Number of years} = \frac{9.230769230769231 \text{ months}}{12 \text{ months per year}} \]

Let's calculate this:
```python
# Convert months to years
years_before_replacement = months_before_replacement / 12
years_before_replacement
```
```output
NameError: name 'months_before_replacement' is not defined

"To find out how much each pump costs, we first need to determine the total number of washes Jackie can get from one bottle of shampoo. Since the directions say 2 pumps give 120 washes, we can calculate the number of washes per pump:

\[ \text{Washes per pump} = \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washes per pump} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pumps are in the bottle. Since the bottle gives 120 washes and each pump gives 60 washes, the number of pumps in the bottle is:

\[ \text{Number of pumps} = \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{60 \text{ washes per pump}} = 2 \text{ pumps} \]

The cost of the bottle is $24.00. To find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the number of pumps:

\[ \text{Cost per pump} = \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 12.00 \text{ dollars per pump} \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert dollars to cents (1 dollar = 100 cents):

\[ 12.00 \text{ dollars} = 12.00 \times 100 \text{ cents} = 1200 \text{ cents} \]

"First, let's calculate the discount on the shirt and the shorts.

The shirt's original price is $25, and there is a 30% discount:
\[ \text{Discount on shirt} = 25 \times \frac{30}{100} = 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]
\[ \text{Discounted price of shirt} = 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

The shorts' original price is $35, and there is a 30% discount:
\[ \text{Discount on shorts} = 35 \times \frac{30}{100} = 35 \times 0.30 = 10.50 \]
\[ \text{Discounted price of shorts} = 35 - 10.50 = 24.50 \]

Now, let's add the discounted prices of the shirt and the shorts to find the total cost of the outfit:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 17.50 + 24.50 = 42.00 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. To find out how much money he will have left after the purchase, we subtract the total cost of the outfit from the amount of money he has:
\[ \text{Money left} = 50 - 42.00 = 8.00 \]

So, Joe will have $8.00 left after the purchase."
"To determine how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a week.
2. Determine the total amount of butter needed based on the number of dozens.

Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week. A week has 7 days.

So, the total number of dozens of croissants he wants to make in a week is:
\[ 4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozen} \]

It takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. Therefore, to find out how many pounds of butter are needed for 28 dozen croissants, we multiply the number of dozens by the amount of butter needed per dozen:
\[ 28 \text{ dozen} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Pack of Gum**: Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum.

2. **Gum Chewed During School**: Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since a school day lasts 8 hours, he chews:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours/piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces}
   \]

3. **Gum Chewed on the Way Home**: Jim chews 1 piece on the way home from school.

4. **Gum Chewed After Dinner**: Jim chews 1 piece after dinner.

5. **Gum Given to His Sister**: After dinner, Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Let's calculate the remaining gum before giving any to his sister:
   \[

"To calculate the total number of cars towed by the tow truck over the week, we can break down the problem into two parts: the first three days and the last four days.

For the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day. Therefore, the total number of cars pulled in the first three days is:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

For the remaining four days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day than it did on the first three days. Since it pulled 10 cars each day on the first three days, on the remaining days it pulled:
\[ 10 \text{ cars} - 4 \text{ cars} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]

Therefore, the total number of cars pulled in the last four days is:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Adding the number of cars pulled over the first three days and the last four days gives us the total number of cars towed that week:

"First, we need to convert Adam's current height from inches to feet to compare it with the required height. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, Adam's height in feet is:

\[ 40 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{40}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The minimum height required to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. Therefore, Adam needs to grow:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Adam grows 2 inches per year, which is equivalent to \(\frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6}\) feet per year. To find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet, we divide \(\frac{2}{3}\) by \(\frac{1}{6}\):

\[ \frac{2}{3} \div \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = \frac{2 \times 6}{3 \times 1} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Therefore, Adam will be tall enough to ride the roller coaster in 4 years. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 cars James sold:
\[ \text{Total cost of cars} = 10 \times \$25,000 = \$250,000 \]

Next, we calculate the amount the company paid to acquire the cars:
\[ \text{Cost to acquire the cars} = 30\% \times \$250,000 = 0.30 \times \$250,000 = \$75,000 \]

Now, we find the total profit from selling the cars:
\[ \text{Total profit} = \text{Total cost of cars} - \text{Cost to acquire the cars} = \$250,000 - \$75,000 = \$175,000 \]

James gets a 10% commission on the profits:
\[ \text{James's commission} = 10\% \times \$175,000 = 0.10 \times \$175,000 = \$17,500 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$17,500 \]"
"First, let's determine how many riders can stay upright on the wave. Since only 25% of the riders can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives, we calculate:

\[ 100 \text{ riders} \times 25\% = 100 \text{ riders} \times 0.25 = 25 \text{ riders} \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 25 riders are women. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we calculate:

\[ 25 \text{ riders} \times 60\% = 25 \text{ riders} \times 0.60 = 15 \text{ women} \]

The remaining riders must be men. To find the number of men, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

\[ 25 \text{ riders} - 15 \text{ women} = 10 \text{ men} \]

Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is:

\[ 10 \]

Final numerical answer:

"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to determine the price of each type of jewel and then sum them up.

1. **Price of a diamond jewel**: Given as $2000.
2. **Price of a gold jewel**: The price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel.
   \[
   \text{Price of a gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600
   \]
3. **Price of a silver jewel**: The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel.
   \[
   \text{Price of a silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200

Now, we sum the prices of all three jewels:
\[
\text{Total price} = \text{Price of a diamond jewel} + \text{Price of a gold jewel} + \text{Price of a silver jewel}
\]
\[
\text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800

Now, we sum up the number of each type of stamp to find the total number of stamps Max bought:
\[
16 \text{ (snowflake)} + 19 \text{ (truck)} + 10 \text{ (rose)} = 45
\]

So, the total number of stamps Max bought is 45."
"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between him and Bob.

First, let's find the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap. Since Bob is driving at 55 mph and Tom is driving at 70 mph, the difference in their speeds is:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is closing the 75-mile gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. To find out how long it will take Tom to close this gap, we divide the distance by the relative speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 14."
"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the maximum cost per class and then find out how many classes he can attend without exceeding this cost.

First, let's denote the total cost of the 10 classes as \( C \). The total cost is given as $60. If the cost per class exceeds $10, they won't sign him up again. Therefore, we need to find the maximum number of classes \( n \) such that the cost per class is not more than $10.

The cost per class if he misses \( m \) classes is:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60 - \text{cost of missed classes}}{10 - m} \]

We need to find the maximum \( m \) such that:
\[ \frac{60 - \text{cost of missed classes}}{10 - m} \leq 10 \]

Let's assume Manny misses \( m \) classes. Then the number of classes he attends is \( 10 - m \). The cost per class in this case is:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60 - \text{cost of missed classes}}{10 - m} \]

To ensure the cost per class is not more than $10, we set up the inequality:
\[ \frac{60 - \text{cost of missed classes}}{10 - m} \leq 10 \]

Since the cost of missed classes is the cost of the classes he didn't attend, and each class costs $10, the cost of missed classes is \( 10m \). Substituting this into the inequality, we get:
\[ \frac{60 - 10m}{10 - m} \leq 10 \]

Now, solve the inequality:
\[ 60 - 10m \leq 10(10 - m) \]
\[ 60 - 10m \leq 100 - 10m \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 \]

This inequality is always true, which means the cost per class will never exceed $10 as long as he attends at least one class. Therefore, the maximum number of classes he can miss is:
\[ 10 - 1 = 9 \]

So, Manny can miss up to 9 classes before his parents decide not to sign him up again.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 9 \]"
"To determine the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we first need to find out how many customers each of them processes in a day.

Given that Jewel processes 50 customers per day, and Julie processes twice as many customers as Jewel, we can calculate the number of customers Julie processes per day as follows:
\[ \text{Customers processed by Julie per day} = 2 \times \text{Customers processed by Jewel per day} = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of customers processed by each of them in a week (7 days):
\[ \text{Total customers processed by Jewel in a week} = 50 \times 7 = 350 \]
\[ \text{Total customers processed by Julie in a week} = 100 \times 7 = 700 \]

Finally, we add the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel in a week to find the total weekly production:
\[ \text{Total weekly production} = \text{Total customers processed by Jewel in a week} + \text{Total customers processed by Julie in a week} = 350 + 700 = 1050 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1050 \]"

\[ \text{Reggie's distance} = 5 \times \text{Paisley's distance} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. So, to find out how many miles Lynn ran, we subtract 3 miles from Reggie's distance:

\[ \text{Lynn's distance} = \text{Reggie's distance} - 3 = 20 - 3 = 17 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles."
"To find the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we first need to determine the cost of one apple and one orange.

Given:
- Four apples cost $5.20.
- Three oranges cost $3.30.

First, we calculate the cost of one apple:
\[ \text{Cost of one apple} = \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of one orange:
\[ \text{Cost of one orange} = \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \]

Now, we calculate the cost of 5 apples:
\[ \text{Cost of 5 apples} = 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \]

And the cost of 5 oranges:
\[ \text{Cost of 5 oranges} = 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \]

"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the hole:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 3 \]

\[ V = 72 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel one cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) it will take him to shovel the entire volume of the hole is:

\[ T = V \times \text{time per cubic foot} \]

\[ T = 72 \times 3 \]

\[ T = 216 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 216 \text{ seconds} \]"

"To determine the total time Bill will take to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay separately, and then sum these times.

First, let's calculate the time to dig through the soil:
- Bill digs at a rate of 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He needs to dig 24 feet of soil.

\[
\text{Time to dig through soil} = \frac{\text{Distance through soil}}{\text{Rate through soil}} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, let's calculate the time to dig through the clay:

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's denote:
- \( s \) as the number of sheep,
- \( g \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we know:
1. Sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs.
2. The total number of legs is 70.
3. The total number of heads is 20.

We can write the following equations based on the information:
1. \( 4s + 2g = 70 \) (total number of legs)
2. \( s + g = 20 \) (total number of heads)

We can solve this system of equations step by step.

First, we can simplify the second equation to express \( g \) in terms of \( s \):
\[ g = 20 - s \]

Next, we substitute \( g \) in the first equation:
\[ 4s + 2(20 - s) = 70 \]

Now, we solve for \( s \):
\[ 4s + 40 - 2s = 70 \]
\[ 2s + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2s = 30 \]
\[ s = 15 \]

- Second eight days: 8 bad days
- Last eight days: 8 neutral days

So, the total number of good days is 12. The number of good days that have already occurred is:
\[ 8 \text{ (first eight days)} + 1 \text{ (next good day)} = 9 \text{ good days} \]

The number of good days left in the month is:
\[ 12 \text{ (total good days)} - 9 \text{ (good days already occurred)} = 3 \text{ good days} \]

The next three days consist of one good day, one neutral day, and one good day, which means there are no additional good days in the next three days. Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is still 3.

The final numerical answer is:
3"
"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Number of books Janey has} = 2S + 3 \]

We are given that Janey has 21 books. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 21 \]

To find \( S \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 18 \]

Next, divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 9 \]"
"First, we need to convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can calculate the current height in inches as follows:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine the difference in height between the target height and the current height:

\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

Given that the bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day, we can calculate the number of days required to grow 360 inches:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 12 days."
"Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs. When 8 more dogs arrive, he needs to buy toys for these 8 dogs. So, he needs 8 toys.

After buying the toys for the 8 new dogs, there are now twice as many more dogs than when he left. This means there are 8 * 2 = 16 more dogs in the shelter. So, he needs to buy toys for these 16 dogs.

When James came back again, 3 dogs were gone, so he no longer needed the toys for those 3 dogs. However, we don't need to subtract these 3 dogs from the total because the question is asking for the total number of toys he needs to buy, not the number of dogs he currently has.

So, the total number of toys James needs to buy is the sum of the toys needed for the initial 4 dogs, the 8 new dogs, and the 16 new dogs:

4 (initial toys) + 8 (toys for 8 new dogs) + 16 (toys for 16 new dogs) = 28 toys.

Therefore, the total number of toys James needs is 28."
"First, let's determine how much Dylan invested. Dylan invested \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total amount of $1200.

\[ \text{Dylan's investment} = \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = \frac{2 \times 1200}{5} = \frac{2400}{5} = 480 \]

After Dylan's investment, the remaining amount in the account is:

\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

Next, Frances invested \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the remaining amount.

\[ \text{Frances's investment} = \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = \frac{2 \times 720}{3} = \frac{1440}{3} = 480 \]

After Frances's investment, the remaining amount in the account is:

\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 720 - 480 = 240 \]

Skyler's investment accounted for the rest of the remaining amount, which is $240.

\[ \text{Skyler's investment} = 240 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 240 \]"
"To reach their goal of 100 signatures, the sisters need to collect:

"First, let's determine how much Karen earns per hour. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much Karen earns in one day if she works 3 hours. This can be calculated as:

\[ 20 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ dollars per day} \]

Now, to find out how much Karen earns in two days, we multiply her daily earnings by 2:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 120 \]"
"To solve this, we can set up a proportion. If 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, then 1 potato makes 36/6 = 6 hash browns. Therefore, 96 potatoes would make 96 * 6 = 576 hash browns.

"First, let's calculate the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults.

Jack's weight: 80 kg
Weight of 8 other adults: 8 adults * 80 kg/adult = 640 kg

Total weight: Jack's weight + Weight of 8 other adults
Total weight = 80 kg + 640 kg = 720 kg

Now, let's find out by how much they will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator.

Exceeding load = Total weight - Maximum load
Exceeding load = 720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg

The final numerical answer is 20 kg."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Katarina has 68 cookies.
2. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.
3. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.
4. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, to find the total number of cookies they all have, we add up the cookies each of them has:

Katarina's cookies: 68
Max's cookies: 73
Cookie Monster's cookies: 61
Summer's cookies: 96

Total cookies = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96

Let's calculate the total:

Total cookies = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298

So, the total number of cookies they have is 298."
"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) centimeters.

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means she adds \( 0.5x \) to the original length. Additionally, she adds 20 cm to the bottom of the dress with a lace trim. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm.

So, the equation representing the final length of the dress is:
\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Now, divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} \]
\[ x = 80 \]

Therefore, the original length of the dress was 80 cm."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time Chris spent mowing half of his lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half in ""rabbit"" mode.

First, let's convert the times to a consistent unit. We'll use minutes for this calculation.

- In ""turtle"" mode, Chris takes 60 minutes to mow the entire lawn.
- In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris takes 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn.

Chris mows half of the lawn in each mode. Therefore, the time taken to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Similarly, the time taken to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode is:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

To find the total time taken to mow the entire lawn, we add the time taken in both modes:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is:
\[ 50 \text{ minutes} \]"
"To determine how much longer John and Jack have to get to school without being late, we first need to calculate the total time they have already spent walking.

They have spent:
- 6 minutes to get to the corner with the library.
- 13 minutes to get to the fire station.

Adding these times together:
6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes

They have a total of 30 minutes to get to school. To find out how much longer they have, we subtract the time they have already spent from the total time they have:
30 minutes - 19 minutes = 11 minutes

Therefore, they have 11 minutes longer to get to school without being late."

Total cost = $4 + $4 + $6 = $14

So, Catherine pays a total of $14."
"Celinda bakes twice as many cookies as Greta, so she bakes \(30 \times 2 = 60\) cookies. Together, they bake \(30 + 60 = 90\) cookies. After eating 10 cookies, the number of cookies left in the box is \(90 - 10 = 80\).

The final numerical answer is 80."
"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( Tr \).

Given that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can write:
\[ T = Tr + 7 \]

We also know that the combined ages of the twins and the triplets are 44:
\[ T + T + Tr + Tr + Tr = 44 \]
\[ 2T + 3Tr = 44 \]

Substituting \( T = Tr + 7 \) into the equation:
\[ 2(Tr + 7) + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 2Tr + 14 + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr = 30 \]
\[ Tr = 6 \]

Now, substituting \( Tr = 6 \) back into the equation \( T = Tr + 7 \):
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, one of the twins is 13 years old."
"First, let's calculate the total time John needs to complete his homework:

- Math homework: 20 minutes
- Reading homework: 40 minutes
- History homework: 20 minutes

Total homework time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, 3 hours is equal to 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's find out how many minutes John has left for napping:

Total minutes before dinner - Total homework time = Minutes for napping
180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes

So, John has 100 minutes to nap."
"First, let's determine the cost of the lollipops and candies Manolo bought.

Manolo bought five lollipops at $0.40 each:
\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

He also bought four candies that cost $3.20 in total.

Now, we need to find the cost of one candy:
\[ \text{Cost of one candy} = \frac{3.20}{4} = 0.80 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of 10 lollipops:
\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

Then, we calculate the cost of 10 candies:
\[ 10 \times 0.80 = 8.00 \]

Finally, we add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies to find the total cost:
\[ 4.00 + 8.00 = 12.00 \]

So, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $12.00."

1. **Determine how many coins Rong saves per month:**
   Rong saves 20 coins per month.

2. **Calculate how many coins Neil saves per month:**
   Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong. This means Neil saves:
   \[
   20 + \left(\frac{2}{5} \times 20\right) = 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of months in ten years:**
   There are 12 months in a year, so in ten years, there are:
   \[
   10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of coins Rong has after ten years:**
   Rong saves 20 coins per month, so in 120 months, he will have:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20.

\[ \text{Cost of vaccines} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, let's denote the cost of the heartworm check as \( H \). According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as \( T \). Therefore, we have:

\[ H = 0.60 \times T \]

Since the total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check, we can write:

\[ T = 40 + H \]

Substituting \( H \) from the previous equation:

\[ T = 40 + 0.60 \times T \]

To solve for \( T \), we rearrange the equation:

\[ T - 0.60 \times T = 40 \]
\[ 0.40 \times T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:

\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 25 \]"
"To find the price for a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum them up.

First, let's determine the cost of each type of fruit:
- The price of one apple is $0.5.
- The price of one banana is twice the price of one apple, so it is \(2 \times 0.5 = $1.0\).
- The price of one orange is three times the price of one banana, so it is \(3 \times 1.0 = $3.0\).

Next, we calculate the total cost for each type of fruit in the crate:
- The cost of 5 bananas is \(5 \times 1.0 = $5.0\).
- The cost of 12 apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = $6.0\).
- The cost of 7 oranges is \(7 \times 3.0 = $21.0\).

"First, let's calculate how much Greta puts into her retirement account. She puts 50% of her $2400.00 paycheck into her retirement account:

\[ 2400 \times 0.50 = 1200 \]

So, she has $1200 left after putting money into her retirement account.

Next, we calculate how much she uses for her monthly car payment. She uses 20% of her $2400.00 paycheck for her car payment:

\[ 2400 \times 0.20 = 480 \]

So, she has $480 left after paying for her car.

Now, we subtract the amount spent on her car payment from the remaining amount after retirement contributions:

\[ 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Greta has left to spend is $720."

"First, let's determine the total number of people in the group. Aiden and his 12 friends are going to the cinema, and they meet up with 7 more friends. So the total number of people is:

\[ 1 + 12 + 7 = 20 \]

Each person gets one seat, two drinks, and three snacks. Since each drink and each snack costs $2, we can calculate the cost for each person:

- Cost of drinks per person: \(2 \text{ drinks} \times \$2 \text{ per drink} = \$4\)
- Cost of snacks per person: \(3 \text{ snacks} \times \$2 \text{ per snack} = \$6\)

So, the total cost per person for drinks and snacks is:

\[ \$4 + \$6 = \$10 \]

Since there are 20 people in the group, the total cost for all the drinks and snacks is:

\[ 20 \text{ people} \times \$10 \text{ per person} = \$200 \]

"First, let's determine the capacity of Gordy's truck. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, we can calculate Gordy's truck capacity as follows:

\[ \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = \text{Gissela's truck capacity} + 800 \]
\[ \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = 4000 + 800 \]
\[ \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = 4800 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that the combined capacity of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks is 11,600 pounds. Let's denote Gary's truck capacity as \( G \). Therefore, we can write the equation for the total capacity as:

\[ \text{Gissela's truck capacity} + \text{Gordy's truck capacity} + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11600 \]
\[ 4000 + 4800 + G = 11600 \]

Now, we solve for \( G \):

\[ 8800 + G = 11600 \]
\[ G = 11600 - 8800 \]
\[ G = 2800 \]

So, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel. The final numerical answer is:

"If each female ate 3 dumplings and there are 6 females, then the total number of dumplings eaten by the females is:

\[ 6 \text{ females} \times 3 \text{ dumplings/female} = 18 \text{ dumplings} \]

Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, each male ate:

\[ 3 \text{ dumplings/female} + 1 \text{ dumpling} = 4 \text{ dumplings/male} \]

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is:

\[ 8 \text{ males} \times 4 \text{ dumplings/male} = 32 \text{ dumplings} \]

Adding the dumplings eaten by the females and the males gives the total number of dumplings cooked:

\[ 18 \text{ dumplings} + 32 \text{ dumplings} = 50 \text{ dumplings} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 50 \]"
"First, we need to determine how much money Gerald and Julia received based on the given ratio of 3:2.

The total parts of the ratio are 3 + 2 = 5 parts.

Since the total amount of money is $100, each part of the ratio is worth $100 / 5 = $20.

Gerald's share, which is 3 parts, is therefore 3 * $20 = $60.

If Gerald spent $10 on a book, the amount of money he has left is $60 - $10 = $50.

The final numerical answer is $50."
"To find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we first need to determine the speed of the turtle. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, we can find the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5.

The cat's speed is 15 feet/second. Therefore, the turtle's speed is:

\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{\text{Cat's speed}}{5} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Now, to find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we multiply the turtle's speed by the time:

\[ \text{Turtle's distance} = \text{Turtle's speed} \times \text{Time} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

So, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money the firefighters have left to raise and then calculate how many additional hours they need to work to reach their goal.

1. The total goal is $6300.
2. After 3 hours, they have raised $2100.
3. Therefore, the amount left to raise is $6300 - $2100 = $4200.
4. They need to raise $4200 in equal amounts per hour.
5. Since they have already raised for 3 hours, they have 3 hours left to raise the remaining $4200.

To find out the total number of hours they need to work to reach their goal, we add the 3 hours they have already worked to the 3 hours they need to work to reach their goal:

Total hours = 3 (already worked) + 3 (remaining to work) = 6 hours.

The final numerical answer is 6."
"To find the percent of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the percentage of water used by the city for industrial purposes.
2. Subtract the industrial usage percentage from 100% to find the non-industrial usage percentage.

First, we know that Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. Out of this 40%, 80% is used for industrial purposes. Therefore, the percentage of water used by the city for industrial purposes is:
\[ 40\% \times 80\% = 40\% \times 0.80 = 32\% \]

Next, to find the percentage of water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the industrial usage percentage from 100%:
\[ 100\% - 32\% = 68\% \]

So, the percent of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is 68%."

"First, let's determine the production rate for each type of ice cream.

For chocolate ice cream:
- 100 quarts in 2 hours means the factory makes 50 quarts per hour.

For vanilla ice cream:
- 50 quarts in 4 hours means the factory makes 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, let's calculate how many quarts of each type of ice cream would be made in 48 hours.

For chocolate ice cream:
- 50 quarts per hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts.

For vanilla ice cream:
- 12.5 quarts per hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts.

Finally, to find the total quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours:
- 2400 quarts (chocolate) + 600 quarts (vanilla) = 3000 quarts.

The final numerical answer is 3000 quarts."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of baked good:

- Croissants: 5 croissants * $3.00 each = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls * $2.50 each = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches * $4.00 each = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 blueberry muffins * $1.00 each = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:

Total cost = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $49.00

Marcus gets a 10% discount on his purchase. To find the discount amount:

Discount amount = 10% of $49.00 = 0.10 * $49.00 = $4.90

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final bill:

Final bill = $49.00 - $4.90 = $44.10

So, Marcus' total bill is $44.10."
"First, let's determine the cost of the deal. For every 2 scoops bought, Erin gets 1 scoop free. Since each scoop costs $1.50, the cost for 2 scoops is:

\[ 2 \times 1.50 = 3.00 \]

This means for every $3.00 spent, Erin gets 3 scoops of ice cream (2 bought + 1 free).

Erin has $6.00, so we need to find out how many sets of $3.00 she can spend:

\[ 6.00 \div 3.00 = 2 \]

This means Erin can spend $3.00 twice, which gives her:

\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

Therefore, Erin should buy 6 scoops of ice cream. The final numerical answer is:

6"
"To determine how much more candy Amy has after two weeks compared to Ginger, we need to calculate the amount of candy each of them eats over that period and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the number of days in two weeks:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ days} \]

Next, we calculate how much candy Ginger eats in 14 days:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Then, we calculate how much candy Amy eats in 14 days:
\[ 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we find out how much candy Ginger has left after 14 days:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces} \]

And how much candy Amy has left after 14 days:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces} \]

Finally, we find the difference in the amount of candy Amy has compared to Ginger:
\[ 58 \text{ pieces} - 44 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy after two weeks."
"To find out how many mosaic tiles Mr. Boarden needs to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the area of the bathroom that needs to be covered with tiles. This is two thirds of the total area of the bathroom.
2. Multiply the area that needs to be covered by the number of tiles required per square foot.

Let's start with step 1:

\[ \text{Area to be covered} = \frac{2}{3} \times 36 \, \text{sq ft} \]

\[ \text{Area to be covered} = 24 \, \text{sq ft} \]

Now, for step 2:

\[ \text{Number of tiles needed} = \text{Area to be covered} \times \text{Tiles per sq ft} \]

\[ \text{Number of tiles needed} = 24 \, \text{sq ft} \times 24 \, \text{tiles/sq ft} \]

\[ \text{Number of tiles needed} = 576 \, \text{tiles} \]

So, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom."
"First, let's calculate the total cost James incurred for picking the blueberries. The cost to go picking is $20, and the cost per pound is $1.5. He picked 30 pounds.

The cost for the blueberries he picked is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.5 \text{ per pound} = \$45 \]

So, the total cost for James to pick the blueberries is:
\[ \$20 + \$45 = \$65 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the same 30 pounds of blueberries at the store. The store price is $2.5 per pound.

The cost for 30 pounds at the store is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.5 \text{ per pound} = \$75 \]

Now, to find out how much James saved compared to buying at the store, we subtract the cost James paid for picking the blueberries from the cost of buying them at the store:
\[ \$75 - \$65 = \$10 \]

So, James saved:
\[ \$10 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the original price of each computer.
2. Calculate the new price of each computer after a 10% increase.
3. Compute the total cost for 500 computers at the new price.

First, let's find the original price of each computer. The company planned to buy 500 computers for $700 each. Therefore, the original total cost for 500 computers is:
\[ 500 \times 700 = 350,000 \]

Since this is the total cost for 500 computers, the original price per computer is:
\[ \frac{350,000}{500} = 700 \]

Next, we calculate the new price of each computer after a 10% increase. A 10% increase on $700 is:
\[ 700 \times 0.10 = 70 \]
So, the new price per computer is:
\[ 700 + 70 = 770 \]

Finally, we calculate the total amount of money paid for 500 computers at the new price:
\[ 500 \times 770 = 385,000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices is:
\[ 385,000 \]"
"To calculate the total calories in the omelet, we need to consider the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham.

- John uses 6 eggs, and each egg is 75 calories. So, the total calories from eggs are \(6 \times 75\).
- The cheese is 2 oz, and each ounce is 120 calories. So, the total calories from cheese are \(2 \times 120\).
- The ham is also 2 oz, and each ounce is 40 calories. So, the total calories from ham are \(2 \times 40\).

Let's calculate the total calories:

Calories from eggs: \(6 \times 75 = 450\)
Calories from cheese: \(2 \times 120 = 240\)
Calories from ham: \(2 \times 40 = 80\)

Total calories in the omelet: \(450 + 240 + 80 = 770\)

The final numerical answer is 770 calories."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the pencils and erasers.

The cost of one pencil is $0.50, so the cost of 6 pencils is:
\[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \]

The cost of one eraser is $0.25, so the cost of 8 erasers is:
\[ 8 \times 0.25 = 2.00 \]

Now, let's add the cost of the pencils and the erasers to find the total cost:
\[ 3.00 + 2.00 = 5.00 \]

You paid $10 for the items. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:
\[ 10.00 - 5.00 = 5.00 \]

So, the change you would get is:
\[ 5.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of people who receive interviews. Since 30% of the 100 people receive interviews, we have:

\[ 100 \times 0.30 = 30 \text{ people} \]

Next, we calculate the number of people who receive a job offer. Since 20% of the 30 people who receive interviews get a job offer, we have:

\[ 30 \times 0.20 = 6 \text{ people} \]

Finally, we determine how many of those who receive a job offer accept the position. Since a third of the 6 people who receive a job offer accept the position, we have:

\[ 6 \times \frac{1}{3} = 2 \text{ people} \]

So, the number of people who accept the position is 2."
"Goldy gave a total of 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother, which sums up to 3 + 4 = 7 sacks.

- 5 boxes of Fruit Loops

So, the total number of boxes bought this week is:
3 + 5 = 8 boxes

Last week, she bought 4 boxes of cereal.

Now, to find out how many more boxes she bought this week than last week, we subtract the number of boxes bought last week from the number of boxes bought this week:
8 - 4 = 4 boxes

Therefore, Castle bought 4 more boxes of cereal this week than last week."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of taps Helga makes in the 5 minutes, considering the different tap rates for different parts of her dance.

First, let's calculate the number of taps when her arms are at her sides:
- Right foot taps at 300 taps per minute.
- Left foot taps at 250 taps per minute.
- Combined, both feet tap at 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute.

For 3 minutes (since her arms are at her sides for 3 minutes out of the 5):
\[ 550 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 1650 \text{ taps} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of taps when her arms are raised:
- Right foot taps at 200 taps per minute.
- Left foot taps at 200 taps per minute.
- Combined, both feet tap at 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute.

For 2 minutes (since her arms are raised for 2 minutes out of the 5):
\[ 400 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 800 \text{ taps} \]

Now, we add the taps from both parts of the dance:
\[ 1650 \text{ taps} + 800 \text{ taps} = 2450 \text{ taps} \]

The combined total number of times that Helga taps both of her feet is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost if Ron fixes the pothole himself.

1. Fine for unauthorized road maintenance: $120
2. Cost of 3 buckets of asphalt: 3 buckets * $25 per bucket = $75

Total cost if Ron fixes the pothole himself:
$120 (fine) + $75 (asphalt) = $195

Now, let's calculate the damage to his car if the pothole is not fixed:
$450

To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we subtract the total cost of fixing the pothole from the potential damage to his car:

So, the restaurant has 160 chairs left."
"First, let's determine the total number of slices of pizza ordered. Since there are 5 people (Bryce and his four friends) and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate how many slices Bryce and two of his friends ate. They ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizzas:
\[ 2 \times 12 \times \frac{2}{3} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Then, we calculate how many slices the remaining two friends ate. They ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizzas:
\[ 2 \times 12 \times \frac{3}{4} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Now, we add the slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends and the slices eaten by the remaining two friends:
\[ 16 + 18 = 34 \]

Finally, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices ordered to find out how many slices are left:
\[ 60 - 34 = 26 \]

So, the number of slices of pizza left is:
\[ 26 \]"
"First, let's determine the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages. The cat takes 30 minutes to eat nine sausages. The dog takes \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the time the cat takes, so the dog's time is:

\[ \text{Dog's time} = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. The average time is calculated by adding the times together and then dividing by 2:

\[ \text{Average time} = \frac{\text{Cat's time} + \text{Dog's time}}{2} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes} \]

"First, let's convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, Topher's shoe length of 8-feet and 4-inches is:

\[ 8 \times 12 + 4 = 96 + 4 = 100 \text{ inches} \]

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( x \) inches. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches. Let's confirm this by substituting \( x = 10 \) back into the original equation:

\[ 9(10) + 10 = 90 + 10 = 100 \]

The equation holds true, so the length of one of Bobby's shoes is indeed 10 inches. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 10 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of windows in the students' cars and teachers' cars.

For the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars.
- Each car has 4 windows.
- Therefore, the total number of windows in the students' cars is \(64 \times 4 = 256\) windows.

For the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each car has 2 windows.
- Therefore, the total number of windows in the teachers' cars is \(32 \times 2 = 64\) windows.

Next, we calculate the number of windows Hannah smashes.

For the students' cars:
- She smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.
- A quarter of 256 windows is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64\) windows.

For the teachers' cars:
- She smashes three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows.
- Three-quarters of 64 windows is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48\) windows.

Finally, we add the number of windows smashed from both the students' and teachers' cars:
- Total windows smashed = 64 (from students) + 48 (from teachers) = 112 windows.

"To find the percentage of blue spools, we first need to calculate the total number of spools and the number of blue spools.

Candy has:
- 15 light blue spools
- 45 dark blue spools
- 40 light green spools
- 50 dark green spools

The total number of spools is:
\[ 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150 \]

The total number of blue spools (light blue and dark blue) is:
\[ 15 + 45 = 60 \]

To find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplifying the fraction:
\[ \frac{60}{150} = \frac{2}{5} \]

Now, calculate the percentage:
\[ \left( \frac{2}{5} \right) \times 100 = 40\% \]

So, the percentage of blue spools is:
\[ 40\% \]"

"To determine how many packs of gum Parker will need for 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will chew in 30 days.
2. Determine how many packs of gum are needed based on the total number of pieces.

First, let's calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will chew in 30 days:
\[ \text{Total pieces of gum} = \text{Pieces per day} \times \text{Number of days} \]
\[ \text{Total pieces of gum} = 4 \times 30 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of gum are required to get 120 pieces. Since each pack contains 15 pieces:
\[ \text{Number of packs} = \frac{\text{Total pieces of gum}}{\text{Pieces per pack}} \]
\[ \text{Number of packs} = \frac{120}{15} = 8 \]

Therefore, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

"To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Dora's father's age.
2. Determine Dora's mother's age.
3. Add the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother.

First, we know Dora is 15 years old. According to the problem, Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. So, we calculate Dora's father's age as follows:
\[
\text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8 = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38
\]

Next, we know Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. So, we calculate Dora's mother's age as follows:
\[
\text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4 = 38 - 4 = 34
\]

Now, we add the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother to find the total combined age:
\[
\text{Total combined age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87

"First, let's calculate the total weight of Cindy's math and science books. Since each of these books weighs 2 pounds and there are two of them, the total weight for the math and science books is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds/book} \times 2 \text{ books} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know the weight of her French book is 4 pounds and her English book is 3 pounds. So, the total weight of her French and English books is:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} + 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Her history book weighs twice as much as her English book. Since her English book weighs 3 pounds, the weight of her history book is:
\[ 2 \times 3 \text{ pounds} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add up the weights of all her books to find the total weight:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds (math and science)} + 7 \text{ pounds (French and English)} + 6 \text{ pounds (history)} = 17 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is:

"First, let's calculate the number of votes candidate B received. Candidate A got 20% of the votes, and candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes.

Candidate A's votes:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ votes} \]

Candidate B's votes:
\[ 50\% \text{ more than candidate A's votes} = 20 + (0.50 \times 20) = 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ votes} \]

Now, let's find out how many votes candidate C received. The total number of votes is 100, and we know the votes for candidates A and B.

Votes for candidate C:
\[ 100 - (\text{votes for candidate A} + \text{votes for candidate B}) = 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \text{ votes} \]

So, candidate C received 50 votes."
"First, let's determine how many apples Beck has initially. Since Boris has 100 apples and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, we can calculate the number of apples Beck has as follows:

\[ \text{Beck's initial apples} = \text{Boris's apples} - 23 = 100 - 23 = 77 \]

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. So, we need to update the number of apples each person has after this transaction:

\[ \text{Boris's apples after giving 10 to Beck} = 100 - 10 = 90 \]
\[ \text{Beck's apples after receiving 10 from Boris} = 77 + 10 = 87 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after this transaction:

\[ \text{Difference in apples} = \text{Boris's apples} - \text{Beck's apples} = 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now. The final numerical answer is:

- For the medium cubes: 7 medium cubes * 2 ounces per cube = 14 ounces
- For the small cubes: 8 small cubes * 0.5 ounces per cube = 4 ounces

Now, let's add up the total amount of water used:

Total water used = 12 ounces (giant cubes) + 14 ounces (medium cubes) + 4 ounces (small cubes) = 30 ounces

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. To find out how much water he has left, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount:

Water left = 32 ounces - 30 ounces = 2 ounces

So, the final numerical answer is 2 ounces."
"If Clara has 20 books and Clara has two times as many books as Steven, then Steven has half the number of books Clara has. Therefore, Steven has \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) books.

Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so Alice has \( 10 + 6 = 16 \) books.

To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has: \( 20 - 16 = 4 \).

Thus, Clara has 4 more books than Alice. The final numerical answer is 4."
"First, let's determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. Since a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar and a gallon jar costs $5, we can calculate the cost of a half-gallon jar as follows:

"Let's break down the information given:

- Total number of students: 50
- Number of students who like to bake: 10
- Number of students who like to play basketball: 5
- The rest like to either play video games or play music.

Let's denote the number of students who like to play video games as \( V \) and the number of students who like to play music as \( M \).

According to the problem, \( M = 2 \times 5 = 10 \).

The total number of students who like to play video games or play music is \( V + M \).

The number of students who like to bake is 10, and the number who like to play basketball is 5. Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games or play music is \( 50 - 10 - 5 = 35 \).

Since \( M = 10 \), we can find \( V \) by subtracting \( M \) from the total number of students who like to play video games or play music:

"To find the number of boys in each class, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of students in each class.
2. Calculate the number of girls in each class.
3. Subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class to find the number of boys.

First, since the total number of students in both classes is 80 and each class has the same number of students, we can find the number of students in each class by dividing the total number of students by 2:

\[ \text{Number of students in each class} = \frac{80}{2} = 40 \]

Next, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. Therefore, the number of girls in each class is:

\[ \text{Number of girls in each class} = 40 \times \frac{40}{100} = 40 \times 0.4 = 16 \]

Now, to find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class:

\[ \text{Number of boys in each class} = 40 - 16 = 24 \]

So, the number of boys in each class is 24."
"Mara initially added 3 slices to the plate that already had 2 slices, so the plate had 3 + 2 = 5 slices. She then tripled the number of slices, which means she had 5 * 3 = 15 slices. After eating 2 slices, she had 15 - 2 = 13 slices. Then, her friend stole 5 slices, leaving her with 13 - 5 = 8 slices. Therefore, the number of cake slices that remained on the plate is 8."
"To find out how many animals Melissa will groom each day, we first need to calculate the total number of animals she has to groom this week. 

The total number of animals is:
8 dogs + 5 cats + 3 birds + 12 horses = 28 animals

28 animals ÷ 7 days = 4 animals per day

So, the final numerical answer is 4."
"First, let's calculate the total cost Mark incurred. He bought 3 packs at $1800 each, so the total cost is:

\[ 3 \times 1800 = 5400 \]

Next, let's calculate the total value of the cards he received. He got one card worth $4000, another card worth $1000, and 30 cards each worth $50. The total value of these cards is:

\[ 4000 + 1000 + 30 \times 50 = 4000 + 1000 + 1500 = 6500 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value of the cards:

\[ 6500 - 5400 = 1100 \]

So, the profit Mark made is:

\[ 1100 \]"
"To determine how much Jake's family will save by choosing the second amusement park over the first, we need to calculate the total cost for each park and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total cost for the first amusement park:
- The cost for 2 adults at the first park is \(2 \times 26 = 52\) dollars.
- The cost for 2 children at the first park is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the first amusement park is \(52 + 24 = 76\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the second amusement park:
- The cost for 2 adults at the second park is \(2 \times 14 = 28\) dollars.
- The cost for 2 children at the second park is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the second amusement park is \(28 + 20 = 48\) dollars.

Now, we find the savings by subtracting the total cost of the second park from the total cost of the first park:
- The savings are \(76 - 48 = 28\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:

   224 + 112 = 336
   \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 336."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many students would be in each group if the activity is divided into 12 groups.

Given:
- Total number of students = 54
- Total number of groups required = 12

To find the number of students per group when divided into 12 groups:
\[ \text{Number of students per group} = \frac{\text{Total number of students}}{\text{Total number of groups}} = \frac{54}{12} = 4.5 \]

Since the number of students per group must be a whole number, it's clear that 12 groups of 4.5 students each is not possible. Therefore, we need to find the smallest number of groups that can accommodate all 54 students with each group having an equal number of students.

To find the number of groups needed to have equal-sized groups, we need to find the factors of 54. The factors of 54 are:
\[ 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54 \]

Since we are looking for 12 groups, we need to determine how many more groups are needed to reach 12 groups from the initial 6 groups. 

The difference between the required number of groups (12) and the initial number of groups (6) is:
\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

Thus, 6 more groups are needed to form 12 groups.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \]"

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during a single weekday and a single weekend day:
- Weekdays: 60 chairs per day
- Weekends: 100 chairs per day

Next, we need to determine the number of weekdays and weekend days in a 4-week month:
- There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a single week.
- Therefore, in a 4-week month, there are \(5 \times 4 = 20\) weekdays and \(2 \times 4 = 8\) weekend days.

Now, we can calculate the total number of chairs rented during a 4-week month:
- Chairs rented during weekdays: \(60 \times 20 = 1200\)
- Chairs rented during weekends: \(100 \times 8 = 800\)
- Total chairs rented in one 4-week month: \(1200 + 800 = 2000\)

Finally, we need to find out the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months:
- Total chairs rented in two 4-week months: \(2000 \times 2 = 4000\)

Therefore, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is 4000."

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - Number of small stickers traded: \( 30 \times 0.90 = 27 \)
   - Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she trades 27 small stickers for 27 large buttons.

3. **Remaining Small Stickers:**
   - Remaining small stickers: \( 30 - 27 = 3 \)

4. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - Number of large stickers traded: \( 40 \times 0.50 = 20 \)
   - Since each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons, trading 20 large stickers for large buttons gives her 20 large buttons.

5. **Remaining Large Stickers:**
   - Remaining large stickers: \( 40 - 20 = 20 \)

6. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons.
   - Since each large button is worth three small buttons, trading 20 large stickers for small buttons gives her \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) small buttons.

7. **Total Number of Buttons:**
   - Large buttons from trading large stickers: 20
   - Small buttons from trading large stickers: 60
   - Total buttons: \( 20 + 60 = 80 \)

Therefore, the final number of buttons Lorraine has by the end is 80."

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, so it is \( 2x \).

The total number of votes cast is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is \( x + 2x = 3x \).

We know the total number of people on the council is 33, so:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x \):
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22."

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The first house needs \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the second house, so the first house needs \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases.
- The third house needs double the first house, so the third house needs \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) cases.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{5}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{5} \):
\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{5} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. The third house needs double the first house, which is:
\[ 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = 2 \times \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles."

"To calculate Tanya's earnings for the two days, we need to break down her earnings for each day and then sum them up.

**Monday:**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She also earns an additional $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Monday:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} \times 5 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 20 \times 5 \times 15 = \$1500 \]

Next, calculate the additional earnings for Monday:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} > 3 \text{ classes} \]
\[ 4 \text{ classes} - 3 \text{ classes} = 1 \text{ extra class} \]
\[ 1 \text{ extra class} \times \$5 = \$5 \]

So, the total earnings for Monday are:
\[ \$1500 + \$5 = \$1505 \]

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She does not earn the additional $5 per day since she does not teach more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Wednesday:
\[ 2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 2 \times 2 \times 15 = \$60 \]

"To determine how long Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time he spends driving to the museum and the time he spends driving back home, and then add the time he spends at the museum.

First, we calculate the time it takes to drive to the museum. The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and Jack drives at a speed of 75 mph. The time taken to drive to the museum is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time to drive to the museum is:

\[ \text{Time to museum} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Since the trip back home is the same distance and speed, the time to drive back home is also 2 hours.

Now, we add the time spent driving to the museum, the time spent driving back home, and the time spent at the museum:

\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time to museum} + \text{Time back home} + \text{Time at museum} \]
\[ \text{Total time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

"First, let's calculate the total number of wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles.

Henry needs 4 wheels for each car. Since he needs to assemble 57 cars, the total number of wheels needed for the cars is:
\[ 4 \times 57 = 228 \text{ wheels} \]

Next, Henry needs 2 wheels for each motorcycle. Since he needs to assemble 73 motorcycles, the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles is:
\[ 2 \times 73 = 146 \text{ wheels} \]

Now, let's find the total number of wheels needed for all the toys:
\[ 228 + 146 = 374 \text{ wheels} \]

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left after assembling all the toys, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the number of wheels he has:
\[ 650 - 374 = 276 \text{ wheels} \]

So, the number of wheels left is:

"To calculate the price after a 20% discount, first find the amount of the discount:

\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Original Price} \times \frac{\text{Discount Percentage}}{100} \]

\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 1000 \times \frac{20}{100} \]

\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 1000 \times 0.20 \]

\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 200 \]

Now, subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the final price:

\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount Amount} \]

\[ \text{Final Price} = 1000 - 200 \]

\[ \text{Final Price} = 800 \]

So, the final price you have to pay is $800."
"First, let's determine the number of movies in various series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of series movies} = \frac{600}{3} = 200 \]

This means the number of non-series movies is:

\[ \text{Number of non-series movies} = 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Next, we calculate the number of older movies among the non-series movies. Since 40% of the non-series movies are older movies:

\[ \text{Number of older movies} = 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \]

The remaining non-series movies are not older movies:

\[ \text{Number of non-series movies that are not older} = 400 - 160 = 240 \]

Now, we calculate the cost of replacing the movies. The cost for the series movies is $6 each, and the cost for the non-series movies is $10 each.

\[ \text{Cost for series movies} = 200 \times 6 = 1200 \]

\[ \text{Cost for non-series movies} = 240 \times 10 + 160 \times 5 = 2400 + 800 = 3200 \]

Adding these costs together gives the total cost:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 1200 + 3200 = 4400 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 4400 \]"

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the driving speed:**
   The Llesis family drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.

2. **Determine the hiking speed:**
   The hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half the driving speed.
   - Half of the driving speed is \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) miles per hour.
   - The hiking speed is \( 25 - 5 = 20 \) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the distance driven:**
   They drove for 6 hours at 50 miles per hour.
   - Distance driven = \( 50 \times 6 = 300 \) miles.

4. **Calculate the distance hiked:**
   They hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 miles per hour.
   - Distance hiked = \( 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the total distance to the vacation spot:**
   - Total distance = Distance driven + Distance hiked
   - Total distance = \( 300 + 30 = 330 \) miles.

The final numerical answer is 330 miles."
"Let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumps on as \( E_e \) and the number of berries she collects as \( B_e \). Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so Ava jumps on \( E_e + 8 \) enemies. Emma collects 3 more berries than Ava, so Emma collects \( B_e + 3 \) berries. Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower, so she has 4 seconds less than the maximum time.

The points for enemies and berries are:
- 10 points per enemy
- 5 points per berry

The points for the remaining time are:
- 30 points per second

Let's denote the maximum time in seconds as \( T \). Then, Ava's score is:
\[ \text{Ava's score} = 10 \times (E_e + 8) + 5 \times (B_e + 3) + 30 \times (T - 4) \]

Emma's score is:
\[ \text{Emma's score} = 10 \times E_e + 5 \times (B_e + 3) + 30 \times (T - 4) \]

The difference in their scores is:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Ava's score} - \text{Emma's score} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = [10 \times (E_e + 8) + 5 \times (B_e + 3) + 30 \times (T - 4)] - [10 \times E_e + 5 \times (B_e + 3) + 30 \times (T - 4)] \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 10 \times (E_e + 8) - 10 \times E_e + 5 \times (B_e + 3) - 5 \times (B_e + 3) + 30 \times (T - 4) - 30 \times (T - 4) \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 10 \times 8 \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 80 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of each of the other two pizzas. We know the total cost of the four pizzas is 64 dollars, and two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars each. Let's denote the cost of each of the other two pizzas as \( x \).

First, we calculate the total cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each:
\[ 30 + 30 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we subtract this amount from the total cost to find the combined cost of the other two pizzas:
\[ 64 - 60 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the remaining cost by 2 to find the cost of each:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, each of the other two pizzas cost 2 dollars. The final numerical answer is:
2"
"To solve this, let's break down the problem into parts:

1. Chase and Rider ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days.
2. On two other days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days.

First, let's calculate the number of times they ride their bikes on the usual days:
- They ride 3 times a day.
- They ride for 5 days.
- So, the total number of rides on usual days is \(3 \times 5 = 15\).

Next, let's calculate the number of times they ride their bikes on the other two days:
- On these days, they ride twice as much as usual, which means they ride \(3 \times 2 = 6\) times a day.
- They ride for 2 days.
- So, the total number of rides on these days is \(6 \times 2 = 12\).

Now, let's add the rides from both sets of days to get the total number of rides in a week:
- Total rides in a week = rides on usual days + rides on other days
- Total rides in a week = \(15 + 12 = 27\)

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 27."
"Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as \( w \) and the number of orange fish he bought as \( o \). We know that the total number of fish he bought from the pet store is \( o + w = 17 \).

After adding these fish to his pond, the total number of orange fish became \( 3 + o \) and the total number of white fish became \( 4 + w \). According to the problem, after adding the new fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish. This gives us the equation:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( o + w = 17 \)
2. \( 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \)

Let's solve the second equation first:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]
\[ 3 + o = 8 + 2w \]
\[ o - 2w = 5 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( o + w = 17 \)
2. \( o - 2w = 5 \)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use elimination. First, we'll eliminate \( o \) by subtracting the second equation from the first:
\[ (o + w) - (o - 2w) = 17 - 5 \]
\[ o + w - o + 2w = 12 \]
\[ 3w = 12 \]
\[ w = 4 \]

Now that we have \( w = 4 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( o \):
\[ o + 4 = 17 \]
\[ o = 13 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish and 13 orange fish. The number of white fish Bob bought at the store is \( 4 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \]"
"To calculate how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total distance Andy travels in a week.
2. Calculate the amount of fuel consumed in a week.
3. Calculate the cost of the fuel consumed in a week.

**Step 1: Total distance traveled in a week**

Andy goes to work from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles.

Total distance = 5 miles/day * 5 days = 25 miles

**Step 2: Amount of fuel consumed in a week**

Andy's car fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon. To find out how many gallons of fuel he consumes for 25 miles:

Fuel consumed = Total distance / Fuel efficiency
Fuel consumed = 25 miles / 10 miles/gallon = 2.5 gallons

**Step 3: Cost of the fuel consumed in a week**

The price of regular gas is $3/gallon. To find out the cost of 2.5 gallons:

Cost = Fuel consumed * Price per gallon
Cost = 2.5 gallons * $3/gallon = $7.5

Therefore, Andy's car is consuming $7.5 per week.

The final numerical answer is:
7.5"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie has in quarters. Since she has 140 quarters, and each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount in quarters is:

\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie has in twenties. Since she has 10 twenties, and each twenty is worth $20, the total amount in twenties is:

\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Carrie spent 3/5 of the twenties. So, the amount spent on twenties is:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the amount spent on quarters and the amount spent on twenties to find the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch:

"To find out how many fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to calculate the total yield from the tomato plants and the eggplant plants separately, and then add them together.

For the tomato plants:
Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes, and Ricardo planted 5 tomato plants.
So, the total yield from tomato plants is \( 22 \times 5 = 110 \) tomatoes.

For the eggplant plants:
Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants, and Ricardo planted 8 eggplant plants.
So, the total yield from eggplant plants is \( 4 \times 8 = 32 \) eggplants.

Now, we add the total yield from both types of plants:
Total yield = Yield from tomato plants + Yield from eggplant plants
Total yield = 110 tomatoes + 32 eggplants
Total yield = 142 fruits

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 142."
"To find out how many OLED TVs were sold, we first need to determine the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold, and then subtract these from the total sales.

Given:
- One-fourth of the sales are smart TVs.
- One-eighth of the sales are analog TVs.
- The rest are OLED TVs.
- Total sales = 40 TVs.

First, calculate the number of smart TVs sold:
\[ \text{Number of smart TVs} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

Next, calculate the number of analog TVs sold:
\[ \text{Number of analog TVs} = \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5 \]

Now, calculate the number of OLED TVs sold by subtracting the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total sales:
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (\text{Number of smart TVs} + \text{Number of analog TVs}) \]
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (10 + 5) \]
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - 15 \]
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 25 \]

So, the number of OLED TVs sold is 25."

"To solve this problem, let's first determine Billy's starting salary and his salary after the raises.

1. **Billy's initial salary:**
   - Initial rate: $10 per hour
   - Hours worked: 20 hours
   - Initial salary = $10/hour * 20 hours = $200

2. **Billy's salary after the first raise:**
   - First raise: $0.50 per hour
   - New rate: $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour
   - Salary after first raise = $10.50/hour * 20 hours = $210

3. **Billy's salary after the second raise:**
   - Second raise: $1.00 per hour
   - New rate: $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour
   - Salary after second raise = $11.50/hour * 20 hours = $230

So, Billy's total earnings over 2 months (20 hours each month) are $230.

Now, let's determine Sally's starting salary:
- Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary.
- Billy's starting salary was $10 per hour.
- Sally's starting salary = $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour

Next, we calculate Sally's total earnings over 2 months (20 hours each month):
- Sally's salary = $10.50/hour * 20 hours = $210

Finally, we find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally:
- Difference in earnings = Billy's total earnings - Sally's total earnings
- Difference in earnings = $230 - $210 = $20

Therefore, Billy will earn $20 more than Sally over the 2-month period."

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the ring before the premium is added:

Cost of diamond = $600
Cost of gold = $300

Total cost before premium = Cost of diamond + Cost of gold
Total cost before premium = $600 + $300
Total cost before premium = $900

Now, let's calculate the premium:

Premium = 30% of the total cost before premium
Premium = 0.30 * $900
Premium = $270

Finally, let's calculate the total cost including the premium:

Total cost including premium = Total cost before premium + Premium
Total cost including premium = $900 + $270
Total cost including premium = $1170

So, James paid $1170 for the ring."
"First, let's calculate the pass rates for each grade:

- For third graders: \( \frac{340}{500} = 0.68 \) or 68%
- For fourth graders: \( \frac{40}{100} = 0.40 \) or 40%
- For fifth graders: The pass rate is twice that of fourth graders, so \( 2 \times 0.40 = 0.80 \) or 80%

Next, we calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students:

- Third graders: 340
- Fourth graders: 40
- Fifth graders: 400

Total number of students who passed: \( 340 + 40 + 400 = 780 \)

Total number of students: \( 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 \)

The overall pass rate is calculated by dividing the total number of students who passed by the total number of students:

\( \text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{780}{1000} = 0.78 \) or 78%

The final numerical answer is 78%."
"To determine how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has.
2. Determine the total area of the mosaic he can make with the chips he has.
3. Calculate the length of the mosaic based on the area and the height.

First, let's find out how many glass chips Milo has:
- Each bag contains 72 chips.
- Milo has two bags.
- Therefore, the total number of chips is \( 72 \times 2 = 144 \) chips.

Next, we need to find out how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips:
- It takes 12 chips to make every square inch.
- Therefore, the total area in square inches is \( \frac{144}{12} = 12 \) square inches.

Now, we know the height of the mosaic is 3 inches. To find the length, we use the area formula for a rectangle (Area = Length × Height):
- The area is 12 square inches.
- The height is 3 inches.
- Therefore, the length is \( \frac{12}{3} = 4 \) inches.

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts of tea:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Now, let's add the quarts of tea consumed by all the students:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

We know that there are 10 quarts of tea left from the party. Therefore, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

To convert quarts to gallons, we use the conversion factor that 1 gallon = 4 quarts:
\[ \frac{48 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ quarts/gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"Dale initially had 100 candies and sold 150, which means he is short by 50 candies (150 - 100 = 50). After ordering 100 more candies, he now has 100 (initial) + 100 (new order) = 200 candies. To find out how many candies he still needs to sell, we subtract the number of candies he has from the total number of candies he ordered, which is 200 - 150 = 50.

The final numerical answer is 50."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students on campus at the end of each month and then determine the total number of additional students who joined by the end of May.

Starting with 10 students at the beginning of the year, the number of students doubles every month.

- At the end of January: \(10 \times 2 = 20\) students
- At the end of February: \(20 \times 2 = 40\) students
- At the end of March: \(40 \times 2 = 80\) students
- At the end of April: \(80 \times 2 = 160\) students
- At the end of May: \(160 \times 2 = 320\) students

Now, we calculate the total number of additional students who joined by the end of May:

- Additional students in January: \(20 - 10 = 10\)
- Additional students in February: \(40 - 20 = 20\)
- Additional students in March: \(80 - 40 = 40\)
- Additional students in April: \(160 - 80 = 80\)
- Additional students in May: \(320 - 160 = 160\)

Summing these additional students:

\(10 + 20 + 40 + 80 + 160 = 310\)

Therefore, the number of additional students who would have joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year, is 310."
"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we first need to determine the total number of branches he climbed during the week.

Felix made $105 during the week. Since each branch costs $0.25, we can calculate the total number of branches he climbed by dividing the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches} = \frac{\text{Total money made}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} \]

\[ \text{Total branches} = 420 \]

Felix made this amount over 7 days, so to find out how many branches he climbed per day, we divide the total number of branches by the number of days:

\[ \text{Branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{420}{7} \]

\[ \text{Branches per day} = 60 \]

So, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day."
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose initially picks:

- For the first 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals
- For the next 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals
- For the next 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals
- For the last 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals

Adding these together gives the total number of petals before any are dropped:
\[15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\]

Rose drops 1 of each type of flower, so she drops:
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

The total number of petals dropped is:
\[5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\]

Subtracting the dropped petals from the initial total gives the number of petals remaining in the vase:
\[101 - 22 = 79\]

So, the total number of petals in the vase is 79."
"First, let's determine the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean to make S'mores. John makes 9 S'mores and DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so together they make:

\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \text{ S'mores} \]

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they use 18 marshmallows in total. They started with 35 marshmallows and dropped 3 on the ground, so the number of marshmallows left is:

\[ 35 - 18 - 3 = 14 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Now, we need to determine how many S'mores they can make with the remaining 14 marshmallows. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they can make:

\[ 14 \text{ S'mores} \]

Since John and DeSean are sharing the remaining marshmallows equally, each of them can have:

\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ S'mores} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 7 \]"
"First, let's determine the total play time for each person in minutes. Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter. His two friends who are significantly worse can play for 10 minutes each (half of 20 minutes), and the one friend who is significantly better can play for 30 minutes (1.5 times 20 minutes).

The total play time for all four friends is:
- Jack: 20 minutes
- Friend 1 (worse): 10 minutes
- Friend 2 (worse): 10 minutes
- Friend 3 (better): 30 minutes

Adding these up, we get:
20 + 10 + 10 + 30 = 70 minutes

They play for a total of 4 hours, which is 240 minutes. The total play time of 70 minutes is less than the total available time of 240 minutes, so we need to determine how many quarters are used based on the total play time.

Since each quarter allows for 20 minutes of play, we can calculate the number of quarters used by dividing the total play time by 20:
240 minutes / 20 minutes per quarter = 12 quarters

Therefore, the total amount of money used is:
12 quarters × $0.25 per quarter = $3.00

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the amount of each ingredient Tanya uses as follows:
- Let \( S \) be the amount of salt.
- Let \( O \) be the amount of oil.
- Let \( F \) be the amount of fragrance.
- Let \( C \) be the amount of citrus zest.
- Let \( G \) be the amount of sugar.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S = G \) (same amount of salt as sugar)
2. \( O = 2S \) (twice as much oil as salt)
3. \( F = C \) (same amount of fragrance as citrus zest)
4. \( S = C \) (same amount of salt as citrus zest)

Since \( S = C \) and \( F = C \), we can say \( S = F = C \).

The total amount of ingredients in the jar is 10 ounces. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total amount of ingredients as:
\[ S + O + F + C + G = 10 \]

Substituting the relationships into the equation:
\[ S + 2S + S + S + S = 10 \]
\[ 6S = 10 \]
\[ S = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \]

Now, we need to find the amount of oil \( O \):
\[ O = 2S = 2 \left( \frac{5}{3} \right) = \frac{10}{3} \]

So, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \( \frac{10}{3} \) ounces. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \frac{10}{3} \]"

"To calculate how much John makes in a full 7-day week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of tasks John completes in a day.
2. Calculate the total amount of money John earns in a day.
3. Calculate the total amount of money John earns in a week.

Step 1: Total number of tasks John completes in a day:
John does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle has 5 different tasks.
So, the total number of tasks in a day is \(30 \times 5 = 150\) tasks.

Step 2: Total amount of money John earns in a day:
Each task pays $1.20, so the total amount of money John earns in a day is \(150 \times 1.20 = 180\) dollars.

Step 3: Total amount of money John earns in a week:
John works 7 days a week, so the total amount of money he earns in a week is \(180 \times 7 = 1260\) dollars.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 1260."
"To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, let's break down the information given:

1. In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points.
2. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, so Julie scored \(14 - 4 = 10\) points.
3. In the second game, which was at Julie's home court, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored \(10 - 6 = 4\) points in the second game.
4. To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add the points from the first game and the second game: \(14 + 4 = 18\).

Therefore, the total points Sasha scored during both games is 18."
"First, let's calculate the total number of tins of cat food Kimberly bought. She bought 8 packages of cat food, and each package contains 11 tins. So, the total number of tins of cat food is:

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now we know PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards. Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

So, the number of cards Becca has is 153."

"To solve this problem, let's first establish the relationship between the number of kangaroos, their speed, and the time it takes for them to cross the highway.

Given:
- 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway.

Let's denote:
- The speed of one kangaroo as \( v \).
- The time taken by 3 kangaroos to cross the highway as \( t = 18 \) hours.

The distance \( D \) across the highway can be calculated using the formula:
\[ D = \text{speed} \times \text{time} \]
\[ D = v \times 18 \]

Now, we need to find out how long it will take for 4 turtles to cross the same distance. Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).

Let \( t' \) be the time it takes for 4 turtles to cross the highway. Using the distance formula again:
\[ D = \text{speed of one turtle} \times t' \]
\[ D = \left(\frac{v}{2}\right) \times t' \]

Since the distance \( D \) is the same for both the kangaroos and the turtles, we can set the two expressions for \( D \) equal to each other:
\[ v \times 18 = \left(\frac{v}{2}\right) \times t' \]

Solving for \( t' \):
\[ 18 = \frac{t'}{2} \]
\[ t' = 18 \times 2 \]
\[ t' = 36 \]

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 36 hours to cross the highway."
"If Kora made 20 dishes, and Rory makes 20 more clay dishes than Kora, then Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.

Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

To find the total number of clay dishes they all made together, we add the number of dishes each person made: 20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140 dishes.

The final numerical answer is 140."

- Money from her part-time job: $150
- Money from her mom: $80
- Money in her purse: \( x \)

The total amount she has is:
- $150 (part-time job) + $80 (from mom) + \( x \) (money in her purse) = $350

We can set up the equation:
\[ 150 + 80 + x = 350 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 230 + x = 350 \]
\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

Therefore, Erika has $120 in her purse."
"First, let's calculate the total number of slices from the large apples:
- Each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces.
- Adam decides to slice 3 large apples.
- Therefore, the total number of slices from the large apples is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) slices.

Next, let's calculate the total number of slices from the small apples:
- Each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces.
- Adam decides to slice 5 small apples.
- Therefore, the total number of slices from the small apples is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) slices.

Now, let's find the total number of slices Adam has:
- Total slices from large apples: 15
- Total slices from small apples: 15
- Therefore, the total number of slices Adam has is \(15 + 15 = 30\) slices.

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:
- Total slices Adam has: 30
- Slices Adam eats: 15
- Therefore, the number of slices left is \(30 - 15 = 15\) slices.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to have to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to calculate the current daily milk production and then find out how much additional milk is needed.

The current daily milk production from 3 cows is:
\[ 5 \text{ liters/cow/day} \times 3 \text{ cows} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The additional milk needed is:
\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed to produce the additional 10 liters of milk is:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow/day}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs to have 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"

"To determine how many students are good at math, we need to consider the information given:

- There are 20 students in total.
- 5 students are good at math only.
- 8 students perform well in English only.
- The rest are good at both math and English.

First, we calculate the number of students who are good at both math and English. Since the total number of students is 20, and we know the number of students who are good at math only and those who perform well in English only, we can find the number of students who are good at both by subtracting the sum of students who are good at math only and those who perform well in English only from the total number of students.

Let's denote:
- \( M \) as the number of students good at math.
- \( E \) as the number of students good at English.
- \( B \) as the number of students good at both math and English.

From the problem, we know:
- \( M = 5 \) (students good at math only)
- \( E = 8 \) (students good at English only)
- The total number of students is 20.

The number of students good at both math and English is:
\[ B = 20 - (5 + 8) = 20 - 13 = 7 \]

So, the total number of students good at math (which includes those who are good at both math and English) is:
\[ M = 5 + B = 5 + 7 = 12 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time required for one group to perform, including the time for setup, performance, and exit, and then add the intermission time. Here's the breakdown:

- Time for one group to get on stage: 2 minutes
- Time for one group to perform: 6 minutes
- Time for one group to exit the stage: 2 minutes
- Total time for one group: 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes
- Intermission time: 10 minutes

The total time for the concert is 2 hours, which is equivalent to 120 minutes. We subtract the intermission time from the total time to find out how much time is available for the groups to perform:

- Time available for performances: 120 - 10 = 110 minutes

Now, we divide the time available for performances by the time required for one group to perform:

- Number of groups that can perform: 110 / 10 = 11

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 11."
"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years with simple interest, we can use the formula for simple interest:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Given:
- Principal (P) = $300
- Rate (R) = 3/4 of the original amount = 3/4 * $300 = $225 per year
- Time (T) = 3 years

First, we calculate the simple interest earned over 3 years:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times \frac{225}{100} \times 3 \]

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 2.25 \times 3 \]

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 675 \times 3 \]

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 2025 \]

Now, we add the simple interest to the principal to find the total amount:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Simple Interest} \]

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 2025 \]

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 2325 \]

So, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is $2325."

"To find out how many goats are left in the two farms altogether, let's first determine how many goats Mr. Smith sold from each farm and then calculate the remaining goats.

From Farm X, he sold 10 goats. So, the number of goats left in Farm X is:
\[ 55 - 10 = 45 \]

From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats as he sold from Farm X. Since he sold 10 goats from Farm X, he sold:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \]
goats from Farm Y. So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is:
\[ 45 - 20 = 25 \]

Now, to find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the remaining goats from Farm X and Farm Y:
\[ 45 + 25 = 70 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of Green Food**: Each basket costs $25.
2. **Cost of Red Food**: Each basket costs $18.
3. **Discount for Red Food**: For each basket of red food, you get $2 off.

First, calculate the total cost for 3 baskets of green food:
\[ 3 \times 25 = 75 \]

Next, calculate the total cost for 3 baskets of red food before any discount:
\[ 3 \times 18 = 54 \]

Now, apply the discount for each basket of red food. Since you get $2 off for each basket of red food, the total discount for 3 baskets of red food is:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Subtract the total discount from the original cost of the red food:
\[ 54 - 6 = 48 \]

The total number of homes built over the next three years is 144."
"Let's denote the ages as follows:
- Let \( S \) be my age.
- Then my brother's age is \( S + 3 \).
- My sister's age is \( S - 2 \).
- My mom's age is \( 3(S + 3) - 1 \).

The sum of our ages is given as 87. So we can write the equation:
\[ S + (S + 3) + (S - 2) + (3(S + 3) - 1) = 87 \]

Simplifying the left side:
\[ S + S + 3 + S - 2 + 3S + 9 - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 87 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 6S = 78 \]

Divide both sides by 6:

"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of glue sticks required for his 27 students, with each student receiving 2 glue sticks.

Total glue sticks needed = Number of students × Glue sticks per student
Total glue sticks needed = 27 × 2
Total glue sticks needed = 54

Next, we need to find out how many packs of glue sticks are required. Each pack contains 8 glue sticks. To find the number of packs needed, we divide the total number of glue sticks by the number of glue sticks per pack.

Number of packs needed = Total glue sticks needed ÷ Glue sticks per pack
Number of packs needed = 54 ÷ 8

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, we need to round up to the nearest whole number because he cannot buy a fraction of a pack. We use the ceiling function for this purpose.

Using the ceiling function, we get:
Number of packs needed = ceil(54 ÷ 8)
Number of packs needed = ceil(6.75)
Number of packs needed = 7

Therefore, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of new infections each day and add them to the total number of infected people.

- **Day 0**: Initially, there are 10 infected people.
- **Day 1**: Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others, so the number of new infections is \(10 \times 6 = 60\). Therefore, the total number of infected people after Day 1 is \(10 + 60 = 70\).
- **Day 2**: Now there are 70 infected people, and each of them infects 6 others, so the number of new infections is \(70 \times 6 = 420\). Therefore, the total number of infected people after Day 2 is \(70 + 420 = 490\).
- **Day 3**: Now there are 490 infected people, and each of them infects 6 others, so the number of new infections is \(490 \times 6 = 2940\). Therefore, the total number of infected people after Day 3 is \(490 + 2940 = 3430\).

So, the total number of people infected after three days is 3430."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Rafaela received as tips. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate the total as follows:

\[ \text{Total tips for Rafaela} = 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

"Let's denote the number of books Anne has as \( A \), the number of books Sofie has as \( S \), and the number of books Fawn has as \( F \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S = A + 25 \)
2. \( A = F - 12 \)
3. \( S + A + F = 85 \)

We can substitute the expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \) into the third equation. First, we express \( A \) and \( S \) in terms of \( F \):
- From \( A = F - 12 \), we get \( S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \).

Now, substitute \( S \) and \( A \) into the total number of books equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water.

Cost of 3 bottles of soda = 3 * $3.00 = $9.00
Cost of 2 bottles of water = 2 * $2.00 = $4.00

Total cost = Cost of 3 bottles of soda + Cost of 2 bottles of water
Total cost = $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00

The final numerical answer is $13.00."

"To determine how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Use the total revenue to find the cost of the chickens.

First, let's calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell. He plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his 300 chickens:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \text{ chickens} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling these 180 chickens at $50 per chicken:
\[ 180 \times 50 = 9000 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, the total cost of the chickens must be the total revenue minus the profit:
\[ 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \text{ dollars} \]

"To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we first need to determine how many glasses Micah sold.

The total number of glasses sold by Julie, Micah, and Mitchell is 32. Julie sold 14 glasses. Since the boys (Micah and Mitchell) sold an equal number of glasses, we can denote the number of glasses sold by each boy as \( x \).

The equation representing the total number of glasses sold is:
\[ 14 + x + x = 32 \]
\[ 14 + 2x = 32 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ 2x = 32 - 14 \]
\[ 2x = 18 \]
\[ x = 9 \]

So, Micah sold 9 glasses. Now, we need to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah:

"To solve this problem, let's denote Melanie's current age as \( x \).

According to the information given, in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 10 = 18 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 18 - 10 \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

We need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. Let's denote the number of years from now as \( y \). At that time, her age will be \( 8 + y \), and we want this to be three times her current age:
\[ 8 + y = 3 \times 8 \]
\[ 8 + y = 24 \]

"First, let's calculate the cost of each item Kelly is purchasing:

1. **Bacon:**
   - Kelly has 5 packs of bacon.
   - The total cost for the bacon is $10.
   - Cost per pack of bacon = $10 / 5 = $2.

2. **Chicken:**
   - Kelly has 6 packets of chicken.
   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - Cost per packet of chicken = 2 * $2 = $4.
   - Total cost for the chicken = 6 * $4 = $24.

3. **Strawberries:**
   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries.
   - Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   - Total cost for the strawberries = 3 * $4 = $12.

4. **Apples:**
   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples.
   - Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   - Cost per pack of apples = $4 / 2 = $2.
   - Total cost for the apples = 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's sum up the total cost of all the items:
- Total cost = Cost of bacon + Cost of chicken + Cost of strawberries + Cost of apples
- Total cost = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60.

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget:

"First, let's determine the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants, so we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. We find the number of flowering plants by subtracting the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:

\[ \text{Number of flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25 \]

To find what percent of the total plants are flowering plants, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to first understand the capacity of the pot and how it is divided among the family members.

Calvin, his wife, and their two children make a total of 4 people. The pot can fill 4 adult's bowls or 8 child's bowls. Since Calvin is an adult, the pot can be divided into 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. This means the pot can serve 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls.

If the pot is filled to serve 4 adult bowls, then it can also serve 8 child bowls. Since there are 4 people in total, the pot can serve 4 adult bowls, which means it can serve 8 child bowls as well.

Calvin and his wife each have one adult bowl, so that accounts for 2 adult bowls. This leaves 2 adult bowls and 8 child bowls available. Since there are 2 children, each child can have one bowl of soup. This means the leftover soup can be divided into 2 bowls for the children.

"First, let's determine the size of Farmer Smith's farm. Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

Twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm is:
\[ 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ acres} \]

Adding 100 acres to this amount gives the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \text{ acres} \]

Now, to find the total number of acres for both farms, we add the size of Farmer Brown's farm to the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 200 + 500 = 700 \text{ acres} \]

So, the total number of acres for both farms together is 700 acres."
"First, let's determine how many packages Colby completes per hour. If he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

So, Colby completes 40 packages per hour. 

Next, we need to find out how many packages he completes in an eight-hour workday. We do this by multiplying the number of packages he completes per hour by the number of hours in an eight-hour workday:

\[ 40 \text{ packages/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 320 \text{ packages} \]

Colby earns $0.20 for each package he completes. To find out how much he earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we multiply the total number of packages he completes by the amount he earns per package:

\[ 320 \text{ packages} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars/package} = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 64 \]"
"First, let's determine the time John spends on an extreme sudoku puzzle. A normal sudoku puzzle takes him 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long:

\[ 45 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many half-hour intervals are in 180 minutes:

\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/half-hour}} = 6 \text{ half-hour intervals} \]

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, he will drink 6 bottles of water in the time he spends on the extreme sudoku puzzle.

The final numerical answer is:

6"
"Let's denote the number of red balloons as \( R \) and the number of yellow balloons as \( Y \). According to the problem, \( R = 20 \).

Benny threw two pieces of bologna at each red balloon, so the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is \( 2R \). Given that \( R = 20 \), the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \).

The total number of pieces of bologna thrown at all the balloons is 58. Therefore, the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons is \( 58 - 40 = 18 \).

Since Benny threw three pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, the number of yellow balloons \( Y \) can be found by dividing the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons by 3. So, \( Y = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).

Thus, the number of yellow balloons is 6."
"First, let's calculate how many miles Jon drives in a month. He drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, so:

\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Since his car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can determine the number of tune-ups by dividing the total miles driven by the distance between tune-ups:

\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

So, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time."
"To find the total number of hours Bruce works over the three days, let's calculate the hours worked each day:

- On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.
- On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.
- On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, which is \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.

Now, let's add up the hours worked over the three days:
\[ 5 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 10 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 8 \text{ (Thursday)} = 23 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 23 \]"
"To determine how much Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount spent and then divide it by 2.

First, let's calculate the cost of the cake:
- The cake costs $11.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the balloons:
- They bought 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons.
- The balloons cost $0.5 for 2 balloons.
- Therefore, the cost per balloon is $0.5 / 2 = $0.25.
- The total cost for 12 balloons is 12 * $0.25 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the ice cream:
- They bought 2 tubs of ice cream, each costing $7.
- The total cost for the ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

Now, let's calculate the total amount spent:
- Total cost = Cost of the cake + Cost of the balloons + Cost of the ice cream
- Total cost = $11 + $3 + $14 = $28.

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to spend this amount, the total allowance given by their mother is $28. Since they each received the same amount, we divide the total allowance by 2:
- Each allowance = Total allowance / 2
- Each allowance = $28 / 2 = $14.

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $14.

The final numerical answer is:
14"

- Tennis: There are 6 students playing tennis.
- Volleyball: There are twice the number of students playing tennis, so \(6 \times 2 = 12\) students playing volleyball.
- Soccer: There are 16 boys and 22 girls, so the total number of students playing soccer is \(16 + 22 = 38\).

Now, let's add up the total number of students playing all the sports:

- Tennis: 6 students
- Volleyball: 12 students
- Soccer: 38 students

Total number of students = \(6 + 12 + 38 = 56\)

The final numerical answer is 56."
"First, let's calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class. Since there are 30 students and each student sold an average of 10 lollipops, the total number of lollipops sold is:

\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops. Each lollypop was sold for $0.8, so the total revenue is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollypop} = \$240 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops. Each lollypop was bought for $0.5, so the total cost is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollypop} = \$150 \]

Finally, the profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ \$240 - \$150 = \$90 \]

So, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops."
"To find the total number of Larry's pets, let's calculate the number of each type of pet step by step:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has \(9 - 2 = 7\) rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has \(3 \times 7 = 21\) fish.
5. He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\) gerbils.

Now, let's sum up all the pets:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Total number of pets = \(3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47\)

"Martha collects shells every month. She started collecting at the age of 5 and her 10th birthday marks the end of her collection period. To find out how many months she collected shells, we calculate the difference in years and convert it to months.

From age 5 to 10, she has 5 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of months is:

\[ 5 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 60 \text{ months} \]

Since she collects one shell each month, the total number of shells she has collected by her 10th birthday is:

\[ 60 \text{ shells} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total cups of tea**: Lana has 27 cups of tea.
2. **Rows of tea cups**: She divides these cups into 3 rows, so each row has \( \frac{27}{3} = 9 \) cups.
3. **Tea types in each row**: In each row, she brews an equal amount of chamomile and mint tea. Therefore, each row has \( \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \) cups of chamomile tea and \( \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \) cups of mint tea.
4. **Cups of cinnamon tea**: She uses the remaining cups to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea. Since she has 27 cups in total and 15 of these are cinnamon tea, the remaining \( 27 - 15 = 12 \) cups are for chamomile and mint tea.

Since each row has 9 cups and half of these are chamomile and the other half are mint, each row has 4.5 cups of mint tea.

Therefore, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is 4.5.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground, given that he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

First, let's break down the time spent on each trip:
- The sloth takes 4 hours to make the trip down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up into his tree.

Since the sloth needs to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we can calculate the number of trips he can make in 8 hours:
- Number of trips in 8 hours = 8 hours / 4 hours per trip = 2 trips.

Now, we need to determine how many berries he picks up per trip:
- Total berries to be picked up = 24 berries.
- Number of trips = 2 trips.

Therefore, the number of berries picked up per trip is:
- Berries per trip = Total berries / Number of trips = 24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries per trip.

Thus, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip down to the ground is 12."
"First, let's determine the amount of water in the tank. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons of water, the tank will have:

\[ \text{Tank capacity} = \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much water will be left in the tank after 6 days, given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. The total amount of water removed from the tank over 6 days is:

\[ \text{Total water removed} = 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we subtract the total amount of water removed from the initial capacity of the tank to find the remaining water:

\[ \text{Remaining water} = 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2000 \]"
"To determine how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate his remaining budget after accounting for the items he has already purchased.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items he has already bought:
- 2 tubs of popcorn: \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars
- 4 boxes of candy: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars
- 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday: \(5 \times 10 = 50\) dollars
- 8 movies on other days: \(8 \times 7 = 56\) dollars

Adding these up gives the total cost of the items he has already bought:
\[16 + 8 + 50 + 56 = 120\]

Colby starts with $150 each month. After spending $120, his remaining budget is:
\[150 - 120 = 30\]

Now, we need to determine how many movies he can see with the remaining $30. Each movie ticket costs $10, and he also wants to buy a popcorn and a box of candy. The cost for one movie, popcorn, and candy is:
\[10 + 8 + 2 = 20\]

With $30, he can buy:
\[\frac{30}{20} = 1.5\]

Since he can only see whole movies, he can see 1 more movie. Therefore, the total number of movies he can see is:
\[5 + 8 + 1 = 14\]

"First, let's calculate the calories for the mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins.

For the mini cinnamon rolls:
- A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
- A mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll.
- Therefore, a mini cinnamon roll has \( \frac{600}{3} = 200 \) calories.
- Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls.
- So, the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls are \( 200 \times 200 = 40000 \) calories.

For the mini blueberry muffins:
- A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
- A mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin.
- Therefore, a mini blueberry muffin has \( \frac{450}{3} = 150 \) calories.
- Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins.
- So, the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins are \( 300 \times 150 = 45000 \) calories.

Now, let's add the total calories from both the mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins:
- Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls: 40000 calories.
- Total calories from mini blueberry muffins: 45000 calories.
- Therefore, the total calories from all the pastries are \( 40000 + 45000 = 85000 \) calories.

The final numerical answer is 85000."
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the five days and then divide that total by the number of days.

Let's break it down:

- On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
- On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday. So, for each of these days, she removed \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
- On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
- On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days:

\[ \text{Total Junebugs} = 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 \]

Let's add these numbers:

\[ 39 + 78 = 117 \]
\[ 117 + 78 = 195 \]
\[ 195 + 48 = 243 \]
\[ 243 + 57 = 299 \]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days is 299.

To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days (which is 5):

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{299}{5} \]

Now, let's perform the division:

\[ \frac{299}{5} = 59.8 \]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is 59.8."
"To find out how much farther the bus traveled than the car, we first need to calculate the distance each traveled.

The distance traveled by the bus can be calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For the bus:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

For the car:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find out how much farther the bus traveled than the car:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car."

"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old:
   \[
   P + Pa + J = 100
   \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   Pa = J + 10
   \]

3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = Pa + J
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now, we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, we can find Paul's age:
\[
Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]

And Peter's age:
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

So, Peter's age is:
\[

\[ 35 \text{ seeds} \times 12 \text{ feet/seed} = 420 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we need to find the average total distance spat by both Zoey and Sydney. To do this, we add the total distances and divide by the number of people (which is 2):

\[ \text{Average total distance} = \frac{400 \text{ feet} + 420 \text{ feet}}{2} = \frac{820 \text{ feet}}{2} = 410 \text{ feet} \]

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the daily, monthly, and total earnings for each machine.

First, let's calculate the daily production and earnings for the Widgeteer 3000:
- The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour.
- It runs 24 hours a day.
- Therefore, the daily production is \(60 \times 24 = 1440\) widgets.
- Each widget sells for $6.
- Therefore, the daily earnings from the Widgeteer 3000 are \(1440 \times 6 = 8640\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the daily production and earnings for the WidgetMaster 9000:
- The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour.
- It also runs 24 hours a day.
- Therefore, the daily production is \(45 \times 24 = 1080\) widgets.
- Each widget sells for $6.
- Therefore, the daily earnings from the WidgetMaster 9000 are \(1080 \times 6 = 6480\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the monthly earnings for each machine:
- There are 30 days in the month.
- The Widgeteer 3000's monthly earnings are \(8640 \times 30 = 259200\) dollars.
- The WidgetMaster 9000's monthly earnings are \(6480 \times 30 = 194400\) dollars.

Finally, to find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we subtract the WidgetMaster 9000's monthly earnings from the Widgeteer 3000's monthly earnings:
- The difference is \(259200 - 194400 = 64800\) dollars.

Therefore, Fern will make \(\boxed{64800}\) dollars more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000."
"To determine how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the total cost for his stay under both options and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost if Cameron pays for a 24-hour stay:
- The initial 12-hour stay costs 1600 pesos.
- The additional 12 hours cost 12 * 70 pesos = 840 pesos.
- Therefore, the total cost for a 24-hour stay is 1600 + 840 = 2440 pesos.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Cameron pays for the additional hours after the initial 12 hours:
- The initial 12-hour stay costs 1600 pesos.
- The additional hours from 12 pm to 10 am the next morning is 10 pm - 12 pm = 10 hours.
- The cost for these additional hours is 10 * 70 pesos = 700 pesos.
- Therefore, the total cost for the additional hours is 1600 + 700 = 2300 pesos.

Now, we find the savings by subtracting the total cost for the additional hours from the total cost for a 24-hour stay:
- Savings = 2440 - 2300 = 140 pesos.

"First, let's determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. So, we calculate twice the amount each goat needs and then subtract 3 pounds:

\[ \text{Hay per sheep} = 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep. There are 15 goats, and each needs 5 pounds of hay:

\[ \text{Hay for goats} = 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

There are 12 sheep, and each needs 7 pounds of hay:

\[ \text{Hay for sheep} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the hay needed for the goats and the sheep gives us the total amount of hay Nate needs:

"First, let's calculate John's earnings for the week:
\[ \text{Earnings} = \text{Hourly Wage} \times \text{Hours Worked} = 50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of gas:
\[ \text{Cost of Gas} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the remaining money after spending on gas:
\[ \text{Remaining Money} = \text{Earnings} - \text{Cost of Gas} = 300 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so we subtract that from his remaining money:
\[ \text{Money After Deposit} = \text{Remaining Money} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of 5 pencils:

"First, let's calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can redeem with her coupons. The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice.

\[ 9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles per coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles of apple juice are given to the students. There are 29 pupils, and each student receives 2 bottles of apple juice.

\[ 29 \text{ pupils} \times 2 \text{ bottles per pupil} = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher redeemed to find out how many bottles the teacher has left for herself.

\[ 900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself is:

\[ 842 \]"
"To calculate the total charge for Patty's Plumbing, we need to consider the visit fee, the labor cost, and the cost of parts.

1. The visit fee is $40.
2. The labor cost is $35 per hour. Since the job took 2.25 hours, the labor cost is $35 * 2.25.
3. The cost of parts is $60.

Let's calculate the labor cost first:
\[ \text{Labor cost} = 35 \times 2.25 = 78.75 \]

Now, we add the visit fee, the labor cost, and the cost of parts to get the total charge:
\[ \text{Total charge} = 40 + 78.75 + 60 = 178.75 \]

So, Patty charged $178.75."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the CDs before the discount. James gets 10 new CDs, and each CD costs $15. So, the total cost before the discount is:

\[ 10 \text{ CDs} \times \$15 \text{ per CD} = \$150 \]

Next, we apply the 40% discount to the total cost. A 40% discount means he pays 60% of the original price. So, the cost after the discount is:

\[ \$150 \times 0.60 = \$90 \]

James decides he doesn't like 5 of the CDs and sells them for $40. The cost of these 5 CDs is:

\[ 5 \text{ CDs} \times \$15 \text{ per CD} = \$75 \]

Since he sells these 5 CDs for $40, he loses:

\[ \$75 - \$40 = \$35 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money he was out is the cost of the 5 CDs he doesn't like plus the discount he received on the 5 CDs he decided to keep:

\[ \$35 + \$90 = \$125 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$125 \]"
"To calculate the total earnings, I will multiply the number of each type of root crop by its respective price and then sum up the totals.

For the yams:
6 yams * $1.5 per yam = $9.00

For the sweet potatoes:
10 sweet potatoes * $2 per sweet potato = $20.00

For the carrots:
4 carrots * $1.25 per carrot = $5.00

Now, I will add up the earnings from each type of root crop:
$9.00 + $20.00 + $5.00 = $34.00

Jen will earn $34.00 if she sells everything."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   \[
   \text{Distance swum} = 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time it takes to swim 12 miles:**
   James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time to swim 12 miles} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the time James rests:**
   James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   \[
   \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance to be swum:**
   The total distance is 20 miles, and James has already swum 12 miles.
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the speed for the remaining distance:**
   James swims at half the initial speed after resting.
   \[
   \text{Speed for remaining distance} = \frac{2 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile/hour}
   \]

6. **Calculate the time it takes to swim the remaining 8 miles:**
   \[
   \text{Time to swim remaining 8 miles} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

7. **Calculate the total time taken:**
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{Time to swim 12 miles} + \text{Rest time} + \text{Time to swim remaining 8 miles}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, the total time it took James to get across the lake is 17 hours."

"To calculate the total commission Cayley will earn, we need to calculate the commission for each newspaper separately and then sum them up.

For the New York Times:
- Number of copies sold: 6
- Cost per copy: $5
- Commission rate: 10%

The commission per New York Times copy is:
\[ 5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \]

The total commission for 6 copies of the New York Times is:
\[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \]

For the Wall Street Journal:
- Number of copies sold: 10
- Cost per copy: $15
- Commission rate: 8%

The commission per Wall Street Journal copy is:
\[ 15 \times 0.08 = 1.20 \]

The total commission for 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal is:
\[ 10 \times 1.20 = 12.00 \]

The total commission Cayley will earn is the sum of the commissions from both newspapers:
\[ 3.00 + 12.00 = 15.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 15.00 \]"
"If Deanna is 26 years old and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, then Marcus is 26 - 5 = 21 years old. Since Marcus is half of Leo’s age, Leo is 21 * 2 = 42 years old.

"Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as \( A \), by Bahati as \( B \), and by Dinar as \( D \).

From the problem, we know:
1. \( B = A + 20 \)
2. \( B = D + 10 \)
3. The total points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar is 45, so \( B + A + D = 45 \).

First, we can express \( D \) in terms of \( A \) using the second equation:
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Next, we substitute \( B \) from the first equation into the expression for \( D \):
\[ D = (A + 20) - 10 = A + 10 \]

Now we substitute \( B \) and \( D \) in terms of \( A \) into the total points equation:
\[ (A + 20) + A + (A + 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]

Subtract 30 from both sides:
\[ 3A = 15 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of reports Vince can staple from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM.

First, calculate the total time Vince was stapling reports:
- From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Next, convert the total time into minutes:
- 15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes.

Now, determine how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:
- 900 minutes / 15 minutes/interval = 60 intervals.

Since Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes, we can calculate the total number of reports he stapled:
- 60 intervals * 30 reports/interval = 1800 reports.

Therefore, the total number of reports Vince stapled is 1800."
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up early.

1. **Total sleep time**: Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Converting this to minutes:
   \[
   8 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Time spent sleepwalking**: Kim sleepwalked from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. The duration of sleepwalking is:
   \[
   2:38 \text{ a.m.} - 2:15 \text{ a.m.} = 23 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Time woke up early**: Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. This means she woke up at:
   \[
   6:00 \text{ a.m.} - 5 \text{ minutes} = 5:55 \text{ a.m.}
   \]
   The time she was awake before waking up early is:
   \[
   5:55 \text{ a.m.} - 6:00 \text{ a.m.} = 5 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Total time awake**: Adding the time spent sleepwalking and the time she woke up early:
   \[
   23 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 28 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Time slept on the bed**: Subtracting the total time awake from the total sleep time:
   \[
   480 \text{ minutes} - 28 \text{ minutes} = 452 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Therefore, Kim slept on her bed for 452 minutes that day."
"First, let's determine the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has initially. Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has two dozen measuring cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons as follows:

- Two dozen measuring cups is equal to \(2 \times 12 = 24\) measuring cups.
- Therefore, the number of measuring spoons is \(\frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16\) measuring spoons.

Next, we account for the 6 measuring spoons that Jonathan gifts to Pedro:

- After giving away 6 measuring spoons, the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has left is \(16 - 6 = 10\).

Now, we add the remaining measuring spoons to the number of measuring cups to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining:

- Jonathan has 24 measuring cups and 10 measuring spoons remaining.
- Therefore, the total number of utensils is \(24 + 10 = 34\).

The final numerical answer is 34."
"First, let's determine the initial number of occupied beds in the hospital. The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of these beds are occupied.

\[ \text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

Next, we calculate the number of beds that are unoccupied initially.

\[ \text{Initial unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 200 = 800 \]

Now, we need to find out how many patients are admitted over 2 weeks. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, and 50 patients are admitted each day.

\[ \text{Total patients admitted in 2 weeks} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

We then subtract the total number of patients admitted from the initial number of unoccupied beds to find the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks.

\[ \text{Unoccupied beds after 2 weeks} = 800 - 700 = 100 \]

So, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100."
"First, let's determine the number of emails Robyn sends to her family. We know that out of the sixteen emails, seven are work emails. Therefore, the number of emails that are not work emails is:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these nine emails are sent to her family. According to the problem, two-thirds of the remaining emails are to her family. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

This means Robyn sends six emails to her family. Now, we need to find out how many emails are left after sending emails to her family. We subtract the six family emails from the nine non-work emails:

\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

These three remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. According to the problem, one-third of these remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

Therefore, Robyn sends one email to her boyfriend each day. The final numerical answer is:

"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate the number that is 20% less than the number reported by Courtney.

Courtney reported that there were 48 people in attendance. If this number is 20% more than the actual number, we can set up the following equation to find the actual number of people, which we'll call \( x \):

\[ 48 = x + 0.20x \]
\[ 48 = 1.20x \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.20:

\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]

Now, let's calculate the value of \( x \).
```python
# Calculation
x = 48 / 1.20
x
```
```output
RuntimeError: Buffer overflow when getting elements
```
It seems there was an error in the execution environment. Let's perform the calculation manually:

\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{40}

"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \). According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls. Therefore, we can set \( 2J = 2 \), which means \( J = 1 \). So, Jeffrey carried 1 ball, Jason carried \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) balls, and Jordan carried \( 4 \times 1 = 4 \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey:
\[ 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 7."
"To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the number of holes at the end of the first day.
3. Calculate the number of holes at the end of the third day.
4. Find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day.

Let's start with the first step:

- Holes dug on the first day: 10
- Holes dug on the second day: 13
- Holes dug on the third day: 8

Total holes dug by the end of the third day:
\[ 10 + 13 + 8 = 31 \]

The problem states that the island had four times as many holes by the end of the third day as it did at the end of the first day. Therefore, the number of holes at the end of the first day is:
\[ \frac{31}{4} = 7.75 \]

Since the number of holes must be a whole number, and considering the context of digging holes, it's reasonable to assume the number of holes at the end of the first day is 7 (as 7.75 would imply a fractional hole, which is not practical in this context).

Now, let's find out how many holes were at the end of the third day:
\[ 7 + 31 = 38 \]

The problem states that on the fourth day, they dug holes and then filled in 2 holes. Therefore, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[ 38 - 2 = 36 \]

So, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is:
\[ 36 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 36 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of corn chips given the conditions.

Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips. Since Collins received 15 more corn chips than the number Amora and Lainey got, Collins received:

"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( X = S + 5 \)
2. \( S = 4A - 13 \)
3. \( X + S + A = 339 \)

First, we substitute the expressions for \( X \) and \( S \) from the first two equations into the third equation.

Substituting \( X = S + 5 \) and \( S = 4A - 13 \) into \( X + S + A = 339 \):

\[ (4A - 13) + 5 + (4A - 13) + A = 339 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 4A - 13 + 5 + 4A - 13 + A = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Add 21 to both sides:

\[ 9A = 360 \]

Divide both sides by 9:

\[ A = 40 \]

Now, we can find \( S \) using \( S = 4A - 13 \):

\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

The final numerical answer is:
147"

1. Each episode is 20 minutes long.
2. There are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode.

Let's denote the number of minutes per episode as \( M \) and the number of episodes as \( E \).

From the information given:
- \( M = 20 \) minutes per episode.
- \( E = \frac{M}{2} \).

Substituting \( M \) with 20:
- \( E = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) episodes.

Now, to find the total time John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode:

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance the bird traveled in each leg of the journey and then sum these distances.

1. **First Leg:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Second Leg:**
   - Direction: Norttherly
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \)

3. **Third Leg:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \)

Now, we sum the distances of all three legs to find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes:

\[ 300 \text{ miles} + 36 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 446 \text{ miles} \]

The distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 446 miles."
"To determine the total number of brownies Greta had left over, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she received and then subtract the number of brownies that were eaten.

1. Greta made a batch for herself: 1 dozen brownies.
2. At her office, she received 1/2 dozen brownies.
3. At her friends' surprise party, she received 4 dozen brownies.
4. During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.

First, let's convert all the quantities to the same unit, which is the number of individual brownies. Since 1 dozen equals 12 brownies, we can convert the quantities as follows:

- 1 dozen brownies = 12 brownies
- 1/2 dozen brownies = 1/2 * 12 = 6 brownies
- 4 dozen brownies = 4 * 12 = 48 brownies
- 1 1/2 dozen brownies = 1.5 * 12 = 18 brownies

Now, let's sum up the total number of brownies Greta received:

Total brownies received = 12 (from herself) + 6 (from the office) + 48 (from her friends) = 66 brownies

Next, we subtract the number of brownies eaten:

Total brownies eaten = 18 brownies

Finally, we calculate the number of brownies left over:

Brownies left over = Total brownies received - Total brownies eaten = 66 - 18 = 48

The final numerical answer is 48."
"To find the total age of Nani, his brother, and his sister, we need to calculate the ages of each family member and then sum them up.

1. Nani's age is given as 8 years.
2. Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is \( 8 \times 2 = 16 \) years.
3. Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. So, her age is \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \) years.

Now, we sum up the ages of Nani, his brother, and his sister:
\[ 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 \]

The total age of all three family members is 30."

"To find the total number of players in both teams combined, we first need to determine the number of players on Zeke's team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team as follows:

Number of players on Zeke's team = Number of players on Carlton's team + 7
Number of players on Zeke's team = 13 + 7
Number of players on Zeke's team = 20

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams combined, we add the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team:

Total number of players = Number of players on Zeke's team + Number of players on Carlton's team
Total number of players = 20 + 13
Total number of players = 33

- Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges.
- She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which totals to 4 boxes.

So, the number of boxes she kept is:
\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of oranges in the boxes she kept:
- Each box contains 20 oranges.
- Therefore, the total number of oranges in the 8 boxes is:
\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \]

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges, so we need to find out how many oranges she kept:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 160 = 40 \]

The number of oranges she sold is the total number of oranges minus the number she kept:

"To solve this problem, let's first determine the number of states in the USA. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the United States has 50 states.

Given that India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, we can calculate the number of states in India as follows:

Half the number of states in the USA = 50 / 2 = 25
India has 4 more than this number = 25 + 4 = 29 states

Now, to find the total number of states in both countries together, we add the number of states in India and the number of states in the USA:

Total number of states = Number of states in India + Number of states in the USA
Total number of states = 29 + 50 = 79

The final numerical answer is 79."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Tyler wants to buy:
- Dictionary: $18
- Dinosaur book: $13
- Children's cookbook: $8

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Tyler has already saved $14. Therefore, the additional amount he needs to earn is:
Additional amount needed = Total cost - Amount saved
Additional amount needed = $39 - $14 = $25

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn the additional $25, we divide the additional amount needed by his hourly wage:
Hours needed = Additional amount needed / Hourly wage
Hours needed = $25 / $5 = 5 hours

So, Tyler has to work 5 hours to afford his books."
"First, let's determine how many cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 30 cherries and has 10 more than Richard, we can calculate Richard's cherries as follows:

\[ \text{Richard's cherries} = \text{Robert's cherries} - 10 = 30 - 10 = 20 \]

Now, we know the total number of cherries is 60. We can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting the number of cherries Richard and Robert have from the total:

\[ \text{Jerry's cherries} = \text{Total cherries} - (\text{Richard's cherries} + \text{Robert's cherries}) = 60 - (20 + 30) = 60 - 50 = 10 \]

Now, to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Robert's cherries} - \text{Jerry's cherries} = 30 - 10 = 20 \]

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"To solve this, let's break down the sales and costs for both days.

**Saturday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes
- Apple pie: 10 - 4 = 6 boxes

**Sunday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 + 5 = 15 boxes
- Apple pie: 15 boxes

Now, let's calculate the earnings for each type of baked good:

**Saturday Earnings:**
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes * $6/box = $60
- Apple pie: 6 boxes * $15/box = $90
- Total for Saturday: $60 + $90 = $150

**Sunday Earnings:**
- Gingerbread: 15 boxes * $6/box = $90
- Apple pie: 15 boxes * $15/box = $225
- Total for Sunday: $90 + $225 = $315

**Total Earnings for Two Days:**
- Total: $150 (Saturday) + $315 (Sunday) = $465

The final numerical answer is $465."

"To find the cost of the red car, we first calculate 40% of the price of the blue car. The price of the blue car is $100.

40% of $100 is calculated as:
\[ 0.40 \times 100 = 40 \]

So, the red car is $40 cheaper than the blue car. Therefore, the price of the red car is:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Now, to find the total cost of both cars, we add the price of the red car to the price of the blue car:
\[ 60 + 100 = 160 \]

The total cost of both cars is $160."
"To solve this problem, let's define the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother as \(D\) and \(B\) respectively.

Given:
- Emil is currently 19 years old.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.

First, let's determine how many years it will be until Emil turns 24:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \text{ years} \]

When Emil turns 24, his dad's age will be:
\[ D + 5 \]

According to the problem, at that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad:
\[ 24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5) \]

Solving for \(D\):
\[ 24 = \frac{D + 5}{2} \]
\[ 48 = D + 5 \]
\[ D = 43 \]

So, Emil's dad is currently 43 years old.

Next, we know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother:
\[ 24 = 2B \]

Solving for \(B\):
\[ B = \frac{24}{2} \]
\[ B = 12 \]

So, Emil's brother is currently 12 years old.

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother:
\[ D + B = 43 + 12 = 55 \]

The sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is:
\[ \boxed{55} \]"

- Her mother gave her 20 beads.
- Her sister gave her ten more beads than her mother, which is \(20 + 10 = 30\) beads.
- Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother gave, which is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) beads.

Now, let's add up all the beads Adrianne received:

- Beads from her mother: 20
- Beads from her sister: 30
- Beads from her friend: 40

Total beads = \(20 + 30 + 40 = 90\)

"On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, which is \(12 \div 2 = 6\) pounds.

The total amount of crawfish caught over the three days is \(3 + 12 + 6 = 21\) pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, the number of servings Joe has is \(21 \div 3 = 7\).

The final numerical answer is 7."
"First, let's find out how many students are football players. Since 20% of the class are football players, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 30 = \frac{20}{100} \times 30 = 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are football players. This means the remaining number of students is:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining 24 students are either cheerleaders or part of the band. Since 25% of the remaining students are cheerleaders or part of the band, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 24 = \frac{25}{100} \times 24 = 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are either cheerleaders or part of the band. Adding the football players to these students, we get the total number of students leaving early:

\[ 6 \text{ (football players)} + 6 \text{ (cheerleaders or band members)} = 12 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"If Sophie wears size five boots, then Charlie's boots are 5 * 5 = 25 in size.

To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we add their shoe sizes together and divide by 2:

(5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15

The average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie is 15."
"First, let's convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches to make the calculations easier. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the flower bed is 111 * 12 = 1332 inches long.

Each flower plant is 12 inches wide, and there needs to be 1.5 feet (which is 1.5 * 12 = 18 inches) between every plant. So, the total space taken by one plant and the space between it and the next plant is 12 + 18 = 30 inches.

To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we divide the total length of the flower bed by the space taken by one plant and the space between it and the next plant:

1332 inches / 30 inches/plant = 44.4 plants

Since Pat can't have a fraction of a plant, she can fit 44 plants in her flower bed.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 more plants.

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for 27 plants is 27 * $6 = $162.

Therefore, Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed."
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we first need to determine how many pretzels his brother eats in a day. Since Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, we calculate:

\[ \text{Pretzels Edgar's brother eats per day} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many pretzels his brother eats in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of pretzels he eats in a day by 7:

\[ \text{Pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week} = 9 \times 7 = 63 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 63."
"To determine how much Katherine will spend, we need to calculate the cost for one basket and then multiply by the number of baskets.

First, let's calculate the cost for one basket:
- Cost of petunias: 3 petunias * $3.00 per petunia = $9.00
- Cost of sweet potato vines: 2 sweet potato vines * $2.50 per sweet potato vine = $5.00

Total cost for one basket:
$9.00 (petunias) + $5.00 (sweet potato vines) = $14.00

Now, we need to find the total cost for 5 baskets:
5 baskets * $14.00 per basket = $70.00

Therefore, Katherine will spend $70.00 filling all 5 hanging baskets."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

For the sunflowers:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds per sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

For the carnations:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds per carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of soil they have is 30 pounds. So, the remaining soil for roses is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. Therefore, the number of roses they can plant is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound per rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"First, let's determine how much Jessica sets aside each month for fancy shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly paycheck.

\[ \text{Amount set aside per month} = 25\% \times \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times \$2,000.00 = \$500.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy with her monthly savings. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes per month} = \frac{\$500.00}{\$1,000.00} = 0.5 \]

Since Jessica can only buy whole pairs of shoes, she can buy 0 pairs of shoes per month.

Now, we need to find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes per year} = 0.5 \times 12 = 6 \]

However, since she can only buy whole pairs of shoes, the number of pairs she can buy in a year is 0.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 0 \]"
"First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, we divide the total number of shrimp by the number of shrimp she can peel per minute:

\[ \text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to saute 30 shrimp. Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we need to determine how many sets of 30 shrimp are in 90 shrimp:

\[ \text{Number of sets of 30 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/set}} = 3 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set takes 10 minutes to saute, the total time to saute 90 shrimp is:

\[ \text{Total time to saute 90 shrimp} = 3 \text{ sets} \times 10 \text{ minutes/set} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time it takes to peel the shrimp and the time it takes to saute the shrimp:

\[ \text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp."
"To determine the final temperature of the room, we need to calculate the temperature changes step by step.

1. **Initial Cooling on Low:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - It ran on low for 3 hours.
   - Total cooling on low: \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ degrees}\).

2. **Cooling on High:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 3 degrees per hour.
   - It ran on high for 4 hours.
   - Total cooling on high: \(3 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ degrees}\).

3. **No Cooling (Room Warms Up):**
   - The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - It was turned off for 2 hours.
   - Total warming: \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ degrees}\).

Now, we sum up the cooling and warming effects:
- Total cooling: \(6 \text{ degrees} + 12 \text{ degrees} = 18 \text{ degrees}\).
- Total warming: \(4 \text{ degrees}\).

The net change in temperature is:
- Net change: \(18 \text{ degrees} - 4 \text{ degrees} = 14 \text{ degrees}\).

Since the room warms up by 14 degrees, the final temperature is 14 degrees higher than the starting temperature. Therefore, the room is 14 degrees higher than the starting temperature.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's father when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Bill's father saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Since his father was 30 years old when he saw the comet, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw it for the second time.

3. **Determine the age difference between the first and second sightings:**
   - The comet orbits the sun every 75 years, so the second sighting was 75 years after the first sighting.
   - Therefore, Bill was 90 years old 75 years after he was \(x\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.
   - This gives us the equation: \(x + 75 = 90\).

4. **Solve for \(x\):**
   - \(x = 90 - 75 = 15\).

So, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, let's break down the information given:

1. He writes a check for the electric bill once per month.
2. He writes a check for the gas bill once per month.
3. He writes a check to the church twice per month.
4. He writes a check to the pest and lawn service quarterly (which is 4 times per year).

First, let's calculate the number of checks he writes for the electric and gas bills:
- Electric bill: 12 checks per year (once per month)
- Gas bill: 12 checks per year (once per month)

Next, let's calculate the number of checks he writes for the church:
- Church: 24 checks per year (twice per month)

Finally, let's calculate the number of checks he writes for the pest and lawn service:
- Pest and lawn service: 4 checks per year (quarterly)

Now, we sum up all the checks:
- Electric bill checks: 12
- Gas bill checks: 12
- Church checks: 24
- Pest and lawn service checks: 4

Total number of checks per year = 12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 52."
"Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as \( F \). According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4}F \). The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany, so the number of flights to France is \( \frac{1}{4}F \) and the number of flights to Germany is also \( \frac{1}{4}F \).

The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and this is half the number of flights the first plane makes in a day. Therefore, the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day is \( 2 \times 44 = 88 \). So, \( F = 88 \).

Now, we can calculate the number of flights to France by the first plane:
\[ \text{Flights to France} = \frac{1}{4}F = \frac{1}{4} \times 88 = 22. \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, let's calculate the duration of each wolf's howl first.

1. Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
2. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote's howl is \(20 \times 2 = 40\) seconds.
3. Igneous howls for as long as Tobias and Chikote combined, so Igneous's howl is \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.

Now, let's add up the total duration of their howls:
- Tobias: 20 seconds
- Chikote: 40 seconds
- Igneous: 60 seconds

Total duration in seconds is \(20 + 40 + 60 = 120\) seconds.

To convert the total duration from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):
\[ \frac{120}{60} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

The combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Adam's parents gave him.

Adam's mother gave him $6.
Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) dollars.

So, the total amount of money given by his parents is \(6 + 12 = 18\) dollars.

Adam's trousers cost $30. To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount given by his parents from the cost of the trousers.

So, Adam had to contribute \(30 - 18 = 12\) dollars from his savings.

The final numerical answer is 12."
"To find Wilfred's age, we first need to determine the average age of the group. The total age of the children is given as 20 years. Since there are four children, the average age is:

\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Total age of the children}}{\text{Number of children}} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \text{ years}
\]

Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. Therefore, Helene's age is:

\[
\text{Helene's age} = 2 \times \text{Average age} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ years}
\]

Now, we know the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene. We can use the total age of the children to find Wilfred's age. Let's denote Wilfred's age by \( W \). The total age of the children is the sum of the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred:

\[
\text{Total age} = \text{Akbar's age} + \text{Alessandro's age} + \text{Helene's age} + \text{Wilfred's age}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
20 = 3 + 4 + 10 + W
\]

Solving for \( W \):

\[
20 = 17 + W

"First, let's calculate the total amount Walter has collected from his neighbors and the online fund:

- From neighbors: $500
- From online fund: $1500

Total collected so far: $500 + $1500 = $2000

Next, we need to determine how much Walter's lawyer will contribute. The lawyer will donate three times as much as everyone else donates. To find out how much everyone else has donated, we need to add the $200 that Walter's friend is going to give:

Total donations from neighbors and online fund: $500 + $1500 = $2000
Friend's contribution: $200

Total donations from everyone else: $2000 + $200 = $2200

The lawyer's contribution will be three times this amount:

Lawyer's contribution: $2200 * 3 = $6600

So, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6600."
"First, we need to calculate the total number of cookies. Since there were 100 guests and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies/guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies} \]

The bride decided to give half of the cookies to the church next door. Therefore, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500 \text{ cookies}}{2} = 750 \text{ cookies} \]

Each person in the church next door got 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church next door, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people} \]

So, the number of people in the church next door is 50."
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the distribution of the watermelon slices among the family members. Let's denote the total volume of the watermelon as \( V \).

Given that there are 2 adults and 4 kids, and each adult's slice is twice as big as each kid's slice, we can set up the following relationships:

Let the volume of each kid's slice be \( x \). Then, the volume of each adult's slice is \( 2x \).

The total volume of the watermelon is the sum of the volumes of all slices:
\[ V = 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

Now, we need to find out what percentage of the watermelon each adult gets. Each adult's slice is \( 2x \), and the total volume of the watermelon is \( 8x \).

The percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Volume of each adult's slice}}{\text{Total volume of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon."
"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones will spend on checking on the inpatients. He has 9 inpatients, and it takes him 20 minutes per inpatient.

\[ 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes per inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's convert the 180 minutes into hours:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the total time he will spend on his appointments. He has 10 appointments, and each appointment takes 30 minutes.

\[ 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes per appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's convert the 300 minutes into hours:

\[ 300 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's add up the time he will spend on the clinic, checking on the inpatients, and his appointments:

\[ 9 \text{ hours (clinic)} + 3 \text{ hours (inpatients)} + 5 \text{ hours (appointments)} = 17 \text{ hours} \]

Doctor Jones is working for 9 hours on Monday. Therefore, the time he will have left to update his records is:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 17 \text{ hours} = -8 \text{ hours} \]

Since it's not possible to have a negative number of hours left, it means Doctor Jones will not have any time left to update his records and will be over his scheduled working hours by 8 hours."
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to complete all the steps and then subtract this total from the desired serving time of 5:00 pm.

1. Time to make the cake batter: 20 minutes
2. Time to bake the cake: 30 minutes
3. Time to cool the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
4. Time to frost the cake: 10 minutes

Now, let's add up all these times:
20 minutes + 30 minutes + 120 minutes + 10 minutes = 180 minutes

180 minutes is equivalent to 3 hours.

Since Jordan wants the cake to be ready by 5:00 pm, we subtract the total time required from 5:00 pm:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, the latest time of day that Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

The final numerical answer is 2:00 pm."

"To find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we first need to determine the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes.

Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars. Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes is:
\[ \text{Chocolate bars per box (Peter)} = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]

Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars. Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes is:
\[ \text{Chocolate bars per box (Martha)} = \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

Now, to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we subtract the number of chocolate bars per box for Martha from the number of chocolate bars per box for Peter:
\[ \text{Difference} = 16 - 8 = 8 \]

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha."
"To find the number of porcupines in the park after a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of female porcupines.
2. Calculate the number of babies born each month.
3. Calculate the total number of babies born in a year.
4. Add the babies born in a year to the initial population to get the final population.

First, let's find the number of female porcupines. Given that the number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population, we can calculate it as follows:

\[ \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Next, we calculate the number of babies born each month. Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, so:

\[ \text{Number of babies born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of babies born in a year (12 months):

\[ \text{Total number of babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440 \]

Finally, we add the babies born in a year to the initial population to get the final population:

\[ \text{Final population} = 50 + 1440 = 1490 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1490 \]"
"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet.
2. Multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons needed.
3. Calculate the cost based on the number of gallons and the cost per gallon.

First, let's calculate the volume of the pool. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

\[ V = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

\[ V = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. We know that 1 cubic foot is approximately 7.48 gallons.

\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = 1400 \times 7.48 \]

\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = 10472 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we multiply the volume in gallons by 5.9 to find the total number of gallons needed:

\[ \text{Total gallons needed} = 10472 \times 5.9 \]

\[ \text{Total gallons needed} = 62088.8 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 62088.8 \times 0.10 \]

\[ \text{Total cost} = 6208.88 \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is $6208.88."
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to calculate the number of each color and then sum them up.

1. Number of red sticks: 9
2. Number of blue sticks: 9 (red) + 5 = 14
3. Number of yellow sticks: 14 (blue) - 3 = 11

Now, we sum up the sticks:
9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34

The total number of sticks is 34."
"First, we calculate the distance Matteo traveled. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Matteo:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 55 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance Shandy traveled:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} = 45 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the distance Matteo traveled from the distance Shandy traveled:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."
"To find the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. **Total number of students**: 3000

2. **Students over 16 years old**: Half of the total students.
   \[
   \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
   \]

3. **Students under 16 years old**: The other half of the total students.
   \[
   \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
   \]

4. **Male students over 16 years old**: One-fourth of the students over 16 years old.
   \[
   \frac{1500}{4} = 375
   \]

5. **Female students over 16 years old**: The remaining students over 16 years old.
   \[
   1500 - 375 = 1125
   \]

6. **Male students under 16 years old**: One-half of the students under 16 years old.
   \[
   \frac{1500}{2} = 750
   \]

7. **Female students under 16 years old**: The remaining students under 16 years old.
   \[
   1500 - 750 = 750
   \]

8. **Total female students**: Sum of female students over 16 years old and under 16 years old.
   \[
   1125 + 750 = 1875
   \]

Therefore, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is 1875."
"First, let's determine how many laps each person can run:

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run \(14 / 2 = 7\) laps.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps.

Now, to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run:

\[10 - 5 = 5\]

So, Bethany can run 5 more laps than Quinn."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   - Wanda fills \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity.
   - Tank capacity = 18000 gallons.
   - Wanda's contribution on the first day = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons.
   - Ms. B pumps \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much as Wanda, so Ms. B's contribution on the first day = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons.
   - Total water filled on the first day = 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

2. **Second Day:**
   - Wanda pumps \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what she pumped on the first day.
   - Wanda's contribution on the second day = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons.
   - Ms. B pumps \( \frac{1}{3} \) of what she pumped on the first day.
   - Ms. B's contribution on the second day = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons.
   - Total water filled on the second day = 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

3. **Total Water Filled in Two Days:**
   - Total water filled = 7875 (first day) + 4125 (second day) = 12000 gallons.

4. **Remaining Water to Fill the Tank:**
   - Tank capacity = 18000 gallons.
   - Remaining water = 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

Therefore, the number of gallons of water remaining for the tank to be full is 6000 gallons."
"Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as \( C \).

First, we know that the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour for 5 hours. This means that after 5 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ C \times (1 - 0.09)^5 = C \times 0.91^5 \]

Next, for the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour. The charge remaining after the first 5 hours is multiplied by \( 0.93 \) (since \( 1 - 0.07 = 0.93 \)) for each of the next 3 hours. So, after 8 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ C \times 0.91^5 \times 0.93^3 \]

We know that after 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%, or 0.28. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ C \times 0.91^5 \times 0.93^3 = 0.28 \]

Now, we need to solve for \( C \):
\[ C = \frac{0.28}{0.91^5 \times 0.93^3} \]

Let's calculate the numerical value:
\[ 0.91^5 \approx 0.652 \]
\[ 0.93^3 \approx 0.817 \]
\[ 0.91^5 \times 0.93^3 \approx 0.652 \times 0.817 \approx 0.532 \]

So,
\[ C \approx \frac{0.28}{0.532} \approx 0.527 \]

Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 52.7%."
"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up 20% of the cost of a $10000 car for a downpayment, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate 20% of the cost of the car.
2. Determine Janet's total weekly earnings.
3. Calculate the number of weeks required to save the amount needed.

First, calculate 20% of the cost of the car:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } \$10000 = 0.20 \times 10000 = \$2000 \]

Next, determine Janet's total weekly earnings. She earns $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, and she works 40 hours a week:
\[ \text{Total weekly earnings} = (10 + 15) \times 40 = 25 \times 40 = \$1000 \]

Now, calculate the number of weeks required to save $2000:
\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \]

Therefore, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment for the car."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased:

- Peaches: 3 peaches * $0.50 each = $1.50
- Pears: 4 pears * $0.50 each = $2.00
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00 each = $2.00
- Apples: 5 apples * $0.75 each = $3.75

Now, let's add up the cost of these fruits:

Total cost of purchased fruits = $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar has $10 to spend, so the remaining amount he can spend on plums is:

Remaining amount = $10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums he can buy is:

Number of plums = $0.75 / $0.25 each = 3

So, Jamaar can buy 3 plums."
"First, let's determine the total number of pieces of sweets Anne purchased. She bought a box with 15 packs, and each pack contains 60 pieces.

\[
\text{Total pieces of sweets} = 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 900 \text{ pieces}
\]

Anne kept 2 packs for herself. Let's calculate how many pieces she kept:

\[
\text{Pieces Anne kept} = 2 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 120 \text{ pieces}
\]

Now, we need to find out how many pieces of sweets she gave to her 10 friends. We subtract the pieces Anne kept from the total pieces:

\[
\text{Pieces given to friends} = 900 \text{ pieces} - 120 \text{ pieces} = 780 \text{ pieces}
\]

Anne gave these 780 pieces equally to her 10 friends. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide the total pieces given to friends by the number of friends:

\[
\text{Pieces per friend} = \frac{780 \text{ pieces}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 78 \text{ pieces}
\]

So, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To calculate the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating compounded price increases:

\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (1 + \text{Rate})^{\text{Number of Years}} \]

Given:
- Initial Price = $120
- Rate = 5% = 0.05
- Number of Years = 3

Let's calculate the final price:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years would be $139."
"To solve this, we first need to determine how many pictures were put into each album. Since Olivia uploaded 72 pictures and divided them equally into 8 albums, we can calculate the number of pictures per album by dividing 72 by 8.

\[ \text{Pictures per album} = \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these pictures were selfies and how many were portraits. We know that 3 of the albums were selfies only and 2 of the albums were portraits. Since each album contains 9 pictures, we can calculate the number of selfies and portraits as follows:

\[ \text{Number of selfies} = 3 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures/album} = 27 \]
\[ \text{Number of portraits} = 2 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures/album} = 18 \]

To find the total number of selfies and portraits, we add the number of selfies and portraits together:

\[ \text{Total number of selfies and portraits} = 27 + 18 = 45 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 45 \]"
"To determine how long James spends reading, we first need to find out how many minutes it takes him to read one page. Since it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can calculate the time it takes to read one page by dividing 10 minutes by 3 pages:

\[ \text{Time per page} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages. We do this by multiplying the time it takes to read one page by 18:

\[ \text{Time to read 18 pages} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes} \]

Let's perform the multiplication:

\[ 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, James spends 60 minutes reading. The final numerical answer is:

"To find the final number of guests in the hotel, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.
2. 24 guests checked out early, so the number of guests decreased by 24:
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76
   \]
3. 15 guests checked out late, so the number of guests decreased by 15:
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61
   \]
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, twice that number is:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30
   \]
   Adding these 30 guests to the current total:
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91
   \]
5. After dinner was served, 7 more people checked in:
   \[
   91 + 7 = 98

"On Wednesday, John picks 4 bananas.
On Thursday, John picks 6 bananas.
On Friday, John picks triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

To find the total number of bananas John has, we add the bananas picked on each day:
4 (Wednesday) + 6 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) = 22 bananas.

The final numerical answer is 22."
"First, let's determine the number of easy, average, and difficult questions in the quiz.

- Total number of questions: 60
- Easy questions: 40% of 60 = 0.40 * 60 = 24 questions
- Average and difficult questions combined: 60 - 24 = 36 questions
- Since the average and difficult questions are equally divided, there are 36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct. So, the number of easy questions she is sure to get correct is:
\[ 75\% \text{ of } 24 = 0.75 \times 24 = 18 \]

Aries is sure to get half of the average and difficult questions correct. So, the number of average and difficult questions she is sure to get correct is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \text{ of } 18 = 9 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:
\[ 18 \text{ (easy)} + 9 \text{ (average)} + 9 \text{ (difficult)} = 36 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 36 \]"
"First, let's determine the price of a large stuffed animal. Since each small stuffed animal costs $4 and large stuffed animals are sold at three times the price of small ones, the price of a large stuffed animal is:

\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( L \). According to the problem, the number of small stuffed animals sold is twice the number of large stuffed animals sold, so the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2L \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as the sum of the earnings from the large stuffed animals and the small stuffed animals. The earnings from the large stuffed animals are \( 12L \) dollars, and the earnings from the small stuffed animals are \( 4 \times 2L = 8L \) dollars. The total earnings are given as $120, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ 12L + 8L = 120 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 20L = 120 \]

To find \( L \), we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

\[ L = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

Since the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2L \), we substitute \( L = 6 \) into the expression for the number of small stuffed animals sold:

\[ 2L = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, the wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and the son eats 2 sandwiches per day. So, the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by the family is:

\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \text{ sandwiches per day} \]

Now, to find out how many sandwiches they eat in one week, we multiply the daily total by 7:

\[ 11 \times 7 = 77 \text{ sandwiches per week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 77."
"First, let's calculate Suzanne's earnings from selling cookies and cupcakes.

She sold 80 cookies at $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are:
\[ 80 \text{ cookies} \times \$1/\text{cookie} = \$80 \]

She sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are:
\[ 60 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$4/\text{cupcake} = \$240 \]

Now, let's add the earnings from cookies and cupcakes to find her total earnings:
\[ \$80 + \$240 = \$320 \]

Next, we need to account for the money she gave to her two sisters. She gave each sister $10, so the total amount given to her sisters is:
\[ 2 \times \$10 = \$20 \]

Finally, to find out how much money Suzanne has left, we subtract the amount given to her sisters from her total earnings:
\[ \$320 - \$20 = \$300 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$300 \]"
"The Smith twins found a total of 30 + 30 = 60 eggs. If there were 100 eggs hidden in total and 10 were not found, then 100 - 10 = 90 eggs were found. Since the Smith twins found 60 eggs, the friends found 90 - 60 = 30 eggs. 

The final numerical answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the ore mining rate with a steel pickaxe:**
   - A dwarf with an iron pickaxe mines 12 pounds per day.
   - A dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 50% more than a dwarf with an iron pickaxe.
   - 50% of 12 pounds is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6\) pounds.
   - Therefore, a dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines \(12 + 6 = 18\) pounds per day.

2. **Calculate the total ore mined by one dwarf with a steel pickaxe in a month:**
   - A month has 30 days.
   - One dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines \(18 \times 30 = 540\) pounds in a month.

3. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month:**
   - There are 40 dwarves.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 21600 pounds."
"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to use the information that the prices are proportional. We can set up a proportion based on the given information:

- The first package with 2 sandwiches costs $3.
- The second package with 4 sandwiches costs $6.
- The third package with 8 sandwiches costs an unknown amount, which we will call \( x \).

Since the prices are proportional, the ratio of the number of sandwiches to the cost should be the same for all packages. We can write the proportion as:

\[
\frac{2 \text{ sandwiches}}{3 \text{ dollars}} = \frac{4 \text{ sandwiches}}{6 \text{ dollars}} = \frac{8 \text{ sandwiches}}{x \text{ dollars}}
\]

We can use the first two parts of the proportion to find the cost of the third package. The ratio of the number of sandwiches to the cost is the same, so:

\[
\frac{2}{3} = \frac{4}{6}
\]

This confirms the proportionality. Now, we can use the ratio to find \( x \):

\[
\frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{x}
\]

To solve for \( x \), we can cross-multiply:

\[
2x = 3 \times 8
\]

\[
2x = 24
\]

\[
x = \frac{24}{2}
\]

\[
x = 12
\]

Therefore, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12."
"First, let's determine how much Tom has to pay for the bedroom set after using the money from selling his old bedroom. He bought the new bedroom set for $3000 and received $1000 from selling his old bedroom. So, the remaining amount he needs to pay is:

\[ 3000 - 1000 = 2000 \]

Tom has to pay 10% of this remaining amount each month. To find out how much he has to pay per month, we calculate 10% of $2000:

\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month."
"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst due to the gust of wind. Sally initially had 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst.

\[ \text{Red balloons that burst} = 25 \times \frac{40}{100} = 25 \times 0.4 = 10 \]

So, the number of red balloons remaining is:

\[ \text{Remaining red balloons} = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Next, Sally accidentally released half of the yellow balloons. She initially had 12 yellow balloons.

\[ \text{Yellow balloons released} = 12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons remaining is:

\[ \text{Remaining yellow balloons} = 12 - 6 = 6 \]

Sally found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining balloons.

\[ \text{Blue balloons added} = 8 \times \frac{75}{100} = 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \]

So, the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school is the sum of the remaining red, yellow, and the added blue balloons:

\[ \text{Total balloons} = \text{Remaining red balloons} + \text{Remaining yellow balloons} + \text{Blue balloons added} \]
\[ \text{Total balloons} = 15 + 6 + 6 = 27 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of the different scenarios and their outcomes.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of the substitute teacher collecting the homework: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of having to turn in the homework: 50% or 0.50

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having the normal teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of getting an extension from the normal teacher: 40% or 0.40
   - Probability of not getting an extension from the normal teacher: 60% or 0.60
   - Probability of convincing the teacher to give an extension: 20% or 0.20

Now, let's calculate the overall probability of having to turn in the homework:

- **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
  - Probability of having to turn in the homework = 50% or 0.50

- **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
  - Probability of not getting an extension and having to turn in the homework = 60% (probability of not getting an extension) * 20% (probability of convincing the teacher)
  - Probability of not getting an extension and having to turn in the homework = 0.60 * 0.20 = 0.12

Now, we add the probabilities of the two scenarios:

- Total probability of having to turn in the homework = Probability of substitute teacher scenario + Probability of normal teacher scenario
- Total probability of having to turn in the homework = 0.50 + 0.12 = 0.62

To convert this to a percentage:

- Percentage chance of having to turn in the homework = 0.62 * 100 = 62%

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 62%."
"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we first need to determine the total number of tickets that need to be distributed after accounting for the seats reserved for graduates and faculty.

The total capacity of the Fine Arts Center is 6000 seats. The number of seats reserved for graduates is 950, and the number of seats reserved for faculty is 300. Therefore, the number of tickets that need to be distributed to the graduates and their guests is:

\[ 6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750 \]

This means there are 4750 tickets to be distributed among the graduates. If we assume each graduate will give one ticket to a friend or family member, and we want to split these tickets equally among the graduates, we need to know the number of graduates. However, the number of graduates is not provided in the question. Assuming the question implies that the tickets are to be distributed equally among the graduates, we can proceed with the calculation.

If we let \( n \) be the number of graduates, then each graduate would receive:

\[ \frac{4750}{n} \]

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we first need to calculate the number of soda bottles he will place along the driveway.

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and he wants to place a bottle every 3 feet. Therefore, the number of bottles is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Number of bottles} = \frac{\text{Total width of the driveway}}{\text{Distance between each bottle}} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles}
\]

Richard will need to go from one bottle to the next to drop the candy in. Since he starts at the first bottle and goes to the next 7 times (from the first to the second, second to the third, and so on until the seventh to the eighth), he will need to make 7 trips.

Each trip takes 5 seconds, so the total time for all the trips is:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Number of trips} \times \text{Time per trip} = 7 \times 5 \text{ seconds} = 35 \text{ seconds}
\]

Thus, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total amount Jim borrowed:**
   - Jim borrowed $50,000 per year for 4 years.
   - Total loan amount = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000.

2. **Calculate the income Jim lost while in college:**
   - Before college, Jim had a $25,000 a year job.
   - After college, his income tripled, so it became $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 a year.
   - Income lost per year = $25,000 - $75,000 = -$50,000 (negative because he didn't work).
   - Total income lost over 4 years = -$50,000 * 4 = -$200,000.

3. **Calculate the total income Jim earned after college:**
   - After college, Jim earns $75,000 a year.
   - Total income earned over 4 years = $75,000 * 4 = $300,000.

4. **Calculate the total income Jim needs to earn to cover the loan and the lost income:**
   - Total loan amount = $200,000.
   - Total income lost = -$200,000.
   - Total income needed = $200,000 + (-$200,000) = $0.

Since Jim needs to earn $0 to cover the loan and the lost income, it would take him 0 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

**Final numerical answer:**

"To determine the total square feet of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of each piece of fabric he requires.

The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each piece of fabric is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the dimensions of each piece of fabric are:
- Length: \(6 + 2 = 8\) feet
- Width: \(8 + 2 = 10\) feet

Next, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
\[
\text{Area of one piece} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 8 \, \text{feet} \times 10 \, \text{feet} = 80 \, \text{square feet}
\]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[
\text{Total area} = 2 \times 80 \, \text{square feet} = 160 \, \text{square feet}
\]

Therefore, the total square feet of fabric Jim needs to buy is:
\[
\boxed{160}

"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then sum them up.

First, let's determine the number of letters delivered on Tuesday. According to the problem, Tuesday's delivery is 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery. Monday's delivery was 425 letters.

\[
\text{Tuesday's delivery} = \frac{1}{5} \times 425 + 17
\]

Calculating \(\frac{1}{5} \times 425\):

\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 425 = 85
\]

Adding 17 to 85:

\[
85 + 17 = 102
\]

So, Tuesday's delivery was 102 letters.

Next, we calculate the number of letters delivered on Wednesday. According to the problem, Wednesday's delivery is 5 more than twice Tuesday's delivery.

\[
\text{Wednesday's delivery} = 2 \times 102 + 5
\]

Calculating \(2 \times 102\):

\[
2 \times 102 = 204
\]

Adding 5 to 204:

\[
204 + 5 = 209
\]

So, Wednesday's delivery was 209 letters.

Now, we sum the deliveries from Monday to Wednesday:

\[
\text{Total delivery} = \text{Monday's delivery} + \text{Tuesday's delivery} + \text{Wednesday's delivery}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total delivery} = 425 + 102 + 209
\]

Adding these values:

\[
425 + 102 = 527
\]

\[
527 + 209 = 736

"To find out how much Johnny's dad lost on average that day, we need to calculate the total amount lost and then divide it by the number of races.

1. **First Race:**
   - Johnny's dad lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost.
   - Amount lost in the first race = $5.
   - Twice the amount lost in the first race = $5 * 2 = $10.
   - Amount won in the second race = $10 + $1 = $11.
   - Since he won, this is a positive amount, but for the purpose of calculating the total loss, we consider the amount lost, which is $0.

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Amount won in the second race = $11.
   - Amount lost in the third race = 1.5 * $11 = $16.5.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost:
- Total loss = Amount lost in the first race + Amount lost in the third race
- Total loss = $5 + $16.5 = $21.5

To find the average loss per race, we divide the total loss by the number of races:
- Number of races = 3
- Average loss per race = Total loss / Number of races
- Average loss per race = $21.5 / 3 = $7.16666666667

Rounding to two decimal places, the average loss per race is $7.17.

The total number of people in South America is 130,000."
"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll use inches.

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, Xavier's initial height in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Xavier grew 3 inches, so his current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole's initial height was 50 inches. Cole grew 2 inches, so his current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is 1 inch."
"Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( 420 \).

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, Rory retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2}) = 2 \cdot 19 \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now that we know \( x = 6 \), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time for the meal is the sum of the times for both parts, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Next, we subtract 18 from both sides to isolate the term with \( D \):

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( D \):

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's part as follows:

\[ Betsy's\ part = D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

3. The cost of the painkillers: $4/pill for 30 pills. So, the cost is $4 * 30 = $120
4. The cost of parking: $6/hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours. So, the cost is $6 * 2 = $12

Now, we sum these costs to find the total cost of the doctor's visit:

Total cost = Cost of cast + Cost of visit + Cost of painkillers + Cost of parking
Total cost = $200 + $150 + $120 + $12
Total cost = $482

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"To find out how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of emails that require a response each day.
2. Multiply the daily response count by the number of work days in a week.

First, we know that 20% of the 80 emails do not require a response. Therefore, 80% of the emails do require a response.

\[ \text{Emails requiring a response per day} = 80 \times \frac{80}{100} = 64 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of emails requiring a response in a 5-day work week:

\[ \text{Total emails requiring a response in a week} = 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 320 \]"
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to calculate the number of classes for each day and then sum them up.

- Monday: 32 classes
- Tuesday: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 32 = 64\) classes
- Wednesday: Three times as many as Monday, so \(3 \times 32 = 96\) classes
- Thursday: 30 classes
- Friday: 25 classes

Now, let's add these numbers together:

\[ 32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 \]

First, add 32 and 64:
\[ 32 + 64 = 96 \]

Next, add 96 and 96:
\[ 96 + 96 = 192 \]

Then, add 192 and 30:
\[ 192 + 30 = 222 \]

Finally, add 222 and 25:
\[ 222 + 25 = 247 \]

So, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is 247."
"To find John's average score across the 4 tests, we need to add up all his scores and then divide by the number of tests.

His total score is: 100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380

So, the average score is: 380 / 4 = 95

The final numerical answer is 95."
"First, let's calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club. They ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them.

\[ \text{Pizzas eaten by glee club} = 20 \times \frac{70}{100} = 20 \times 0.7 = 14 \]

So, the glee club has:

\[ \text{Pizzas left with glee club} = 20 - 14 = 6 \]

Next, let's calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the football team. They ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

The football team ate 80% of their pizzas.

\[ \text{Pizzas eaten by football team} = 40 \times \frac{80}{100} = 40 \times 0.8 = 32 \]

So, the football team has:

\[ \text{Pizzas left with football team} = 40 - 32 = 8 \]

Now, let's find the total number of pizzas left:

\[ \text{Total pizzas left} = \text{Pizzas left with glee club} + \text{Pizzas left with football team} = 6 + 8 = 14 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 14 \]"
"To determine the total cost of mailing the coupons, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of big coupons Anthony wants to send.
2. Calculate the total cost for mailing the small coupons.
3. Calculate the total cost for mailing the big coupons.
4. Sum the costs from steps 2 and 3 to get the total cost.

Step 1: Calculate the number of big coupons.
Anthony wants to send twice as many big coupons as small coupons. Since he wants to send 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is:
\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Step 2: Calculate the total cost for mailing the small coupons.
Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail. Therefore, the total cost for mailing 700 small coupons is:
\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total cost for mailing the big coupons.
Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail. Therefore, the total cost for mailing 1400 big coupons is:
\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

Step 4: Sum the costs from steps 2 and 3.
The total cost for mailing all the coupons is:
\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

To convert the total cost from cents to dollars, we divide by 100:
\[ 24500 \text{ cents} = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:
\[ \boxed{245} \]"
"First, let's determine how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney ordered. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which means she ordered:

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ meatball sub sandwiches} \]

Next, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. So, the number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney had left after Mark ate some is:

\[ 7 - 4 = 3 \text{ meatball sub sandwiches} \]

Then, Sidney ordered another three meatball sub sandwiches. So, the total number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney had after ordering the additional ones is:

\[ 3 + 3 = 6 \text{ meatball sub sandwiches} \]

Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. Therefore, the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is:

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 24 \]"
"Initially, Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks, each carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. Therefore, the total amount of fertiliser dispatched was:

\[ 20 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 400 \text{ tons} \]

Two hours after departure, a quarter of the trucks experienced mechanical failures. The number of trucks that failed is:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks} \]

This means that the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks} \]

The total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:

\[ 15 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 300 \text{ tons} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 300 \]"
"To determine the cost Dennis will incur for purchasing 6 pounds of butter, we need to consider the promotion and the cost per pound of butter.

First, let's calculate the total amount of butter Dennis needs:
- Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants.
- He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
- Therefore, he needs \( 6 \times 1 = 6 \) pounds of butter.

Next, we need to consider the promotion: ""buy one pound of butter get one half off."" This means for every two pounds of butter purchased, Dennis only pays for one pound.

Let's break down the purchase of 6 pounds of butter under the promotion:
- For the first pound, Dennis pays the full price of $4.00.
- For the second pound, he gets the second pound at half price, which is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.
- For the third pound, he pays the full price of $4.00.
- For the fourth pound, he gets the fourth pound at half price, which is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.
- For the fifth pound, he pays the full price of $4.00.
- For the sixth pound, he gets the sixth pound at half price, which is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.

Now, let's sum up the total cost:
- First pound: $4.00
- Second pound: $2.00
- Third pound: $4.00
- Fourth pound: $2.00
- Fifth pound: $4.00
- Sixth pound: $2.00

Total cost = $4.00 + $2.00 + $4.00 + $2.00 + $4.00 + $2.00 = $18.00

Therefore, the total cost Dennis will incur to purchase 6 pounds of butter is $18.00."
"First, let's calculate the total number of guests Kayla invited:

- Kayla's classmates: 25
- Girls in her dance class: 7
- Family members: 13
- Total guests invited: 25 + 7 + 13 = 45

Next, we need to account for the 4 people who could not come:

- Total guests who will attend: 45 - 4 = 41

Now, we need to calculate the cost based on the given pricing structure:

- The base fee for renting the theater for 20 guests is $125.
- The additional fee is $6 for each guest beyond the initial 20.

The number of additional guests beyond the initial 20 is:

- Additional guests: 41 - 20 = 21

The cost for the additional guests is:

- Additional cost: 21 * $6 = $126

Finally, we add the base fee to the additional cost to get the total cost:

- Total cost: $125 + $126 = $251

The final numerical answer is $251."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she spent \( \frac{1}{4} \) of $60. So, the amount Maggie spent is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \]
Therefore, the amount of money Maggie has left is:
\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \]

Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she spent \( \frac{1}{3} \) of $60. So, the amount Riza spent is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \]
Therefore, the amount of money Riza has left is:
\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \]

Now, to find out how much money Maggie and Riza have left together, we add the amounts they each have left:
\[ 45 + 40 = 85 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 85 \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats:
\[ 10 + 4 = 14 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of bananas eaten by both monkeys in a day:
\[ 10 + 14 = 24 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. Therefore, the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day is:
\[ \frac{315}{7} = 45 \text{ bananas each day} \]

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we subtract the number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day:
\[ 45 - 24 = 21 \text{ bananas each day} \]

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day."
"Teddy finished half of the first 500-piece puzzle, which means he placed 500 / 2 = 250 pieces. He also finished another 500-piece puzzle within the hour, which means he placed 500 pieces for the second puzzle. Therefore, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is 250 + 500 = 750 pieces."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the roses Jenny bought. She bought 15 roses, and since roses cost $2 each, the total cost for the roses is:

\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2/\text{rose} = \$30 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jenny has initially. She arrived with five 5 dollar bills, so she has:

\[ 5 \times \$5 = \$25 \]

Since the total cost of the roses is $30 and Jenny only has $25, she needs an additional $5 to pay for the roses. However, the question asks how many quarters she leaves with, which implies we need to find out how many quarters she receives in change.

The change she receives is:

\[ \$30 - \$25 = \$5 \]

Since quarters are worth $0.25 each, the number of quarters she receives is:

\[ \frac{\$5}{\$0.25/\text{quarter}} = 20 \text{ quarters} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"To calculate the total money Terry makes, we need to calculate the earnings from each item and then sum them up.

1. Earnings from milkshakes: 6 milkshakes * $5.50 each = $33.00
2. Earnings from burger platters: 9 burger platters * $11 each = $99.00
3. Earnings from sodas: 20 sodas * $1.50 each = $30.00

Now, we sum these amounts to find the total earnings:

Total earnings = Earnings from milkshakes + Earnings from burger platters + Earnings from sodas
Total earnings = $33.00 + $99.00 + $30.00
Total earnings = $162.00

So, the total money Terry makes is $162.00."
"To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, let's break down the schedule step by step:

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays in the station for 20 minutes.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives half an hour after the first train leaves the station.
   - The first train leaves the station 10 minutes after it arrives, so it leaves at 10 + 10 = 20 minutes.
   - The second train arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves, so it arrives at 20 + 30 = 50 minutes.
   - Stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives an hour after the second train leaves the station.
   - The second train leaves the station 50 minutes after it arrives, so it leaves at 50 + 60 = 110 minutes.
   - The third train arrives 60 minutes after the second train leaves, so it arrives at 110 + 60 = 170 minutes.
   - Leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it stays in the station for 0 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station.
   - The third train leaves the station at 170 minutes, so it arrives at 170 + 20 = 190 minutes.
   - This is the train Paul needs to board.

Now, let's calculate the time Paul will wait for his train:
- The fourth train arrives at 190 minutes.
- Paul arrives at 10 minutes (when the first train arrives).
- Therefore, Paul will wait for 190 - 10 = 180 minutes.

The final numerical answer is 180 minutes."
"To determine how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we first need to calculate how many toothpicks she has already saved.

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks:
\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie needs a total of 200 toothpicks. She has already saved 120 toothpicks, so she still needs:
\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks, we divide the number of toothpicks she still needs by the number of toothpicks she saves each week:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks."
"First, let's determine the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch. The original price of the watch is $2000, and he bought it at 75% of its original price.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers paid} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage discount Mr. Rogers's friend obtained from the original price. The original price was $2000, and the friend paid $1800 for the watch.

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

To find the percentage discount, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage Discount} = \left( \frac{\text{Discount Amount}}{\text{Original Price}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage Discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers's friend from the original price is 10%."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs over a period of 4 hours.

1. First, we need to find out how many jellyfish one spring can create in one hour. Since a spring creates one jellyfish every second, and there are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, one spring can create:
   \[
   60 \text{ jellyfish per hour}
   \]

2. Next, we calculate how many jellyfish one spring can create in 4 hours:
   \[
   60 \text{ jellyfish/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 240 \text{ jellyfish}
   \]

3. Since there are 5 springs working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours is:
   \[
   240 \text{ jellyfish} \times 5 = 1200 \text{ jellyfish}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs working at the same rate in 4 hours is 1200."

\[ 180 + 15 = 195 \]

So, Frankie's score is 195."
"To determine how long it took James to reach the store, we need to break down his journey into segments and calculate the time for each segment.

1. **First Segment (Halfway to the Store):**
   - Distance: 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles
   - Speed: 4 miles per hour
   - Time: Distance / Speed = 2 miles / 4 miles per hour = 0.5 hours

2. **Second Segment (Back Home):**
   - Distance: 2 miles
   - Speed: 4 miles per hour
   - Time: Distance / Speed = 2 miles / 4 miles per hour = 0.5 hours

3. **Third Segment (From Home to the Store):**
   - Distance: 2 miles
   - Speed: 4 miles per hour
   - Time: Distance / Speed = 2 miles / 4 miles per hour = 0.5 hours

Now, we sum up the times for all segments:

"First, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually.

Jenny buys 10 bunches, and each bunch has 4 bananas. Therefore, the total number of bananas she buys is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

The cost of buying 40 bananas individually at $0.80 each is:
\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches.

Jenny buys 10 bunches at $3.00 per bunch, so the total cost is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

Now, we find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually:
\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) and the amount of fence Harry gets as \( H \). According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so we can write:

\[ H = S + 60 \]

Since the total amount of fence is 100 feet, we can also write:

\[ S + H = 100 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month, we need to calculate the total earnings from each type of bike and then sum them up.

First, let's determine the number of each type of bike sold:
- Total bikes sold = 300
- Number of Trekking bikes sold = 50% of 300 = 0.5 * 300 = 150
- Number of BMX bikes sold = 15% of 300 = 0.15 * 300 = 45
- Number of MTB bikes sold = Total bikes sold - Trekking bikes sold - BMX bikes sold = 300 - 150 - 45 = 65

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike:
- Price of one MTB = $500
- Price of one BMX = Half the price of an MTB = $500 / 2 = $250
- Price of one Trekking bike = $450

Now, we calculate the total earnings:
- Earnings from MTB bikes = Number of MTB bikes sold * Price of one MTB = 65 * $500 = $32,500
- Earnings from BMX bikes = Number of BMX bikes sold * Price of one BMX = 45 * $250 = $11,250
- Earnings from Trekking bikes = Number of Trekking bikes sold * Price of one Trekking bike = 150 * $450 = $67,500

Finally, we sum up the earnings from all types of bikes:
- Total earnings = Earnings from MTB bikes + Earnings from BMX bikes + Earnings from Trekking bikes = $32,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $111,250

Therefore, Marcel earned $111,250 from selling bicycles during that month."
"To determine how many bales of hay are left in the field after a 6-hour workday, we need to calculate the number of bales made and the number of bales picked up by the truck.

First, let's calculate the number of bales made by the farmer in 6 hours:
- The farmer makes 5 bales per hour.
- In 6 hours, the farmer makes \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \) bales.

Next, let's calculate the number of bales picked up by the truck in 6 hours:
- The truck picks up 3 bales per hour.
- In 6 hours, the truck picks up \( 3 \times 6 = 18 \) bales.

Now, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer to find the number of bales left in the field:
- Bales left = Bales made - Bales picked up
- Bales left = \( 30 - 18 = 12 \)

Therefore, the number of bales of hay left in the field is 12."
"To determine the total number of hours John spends learning each week, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. **Calculate the total number of periods John has to attend each day:**
   - A normal student has 6 periods.
   - John has 2 extra classes.
   - Therefore, John has \(6 + 2 = 8\) periods each day.

2. **Calculate the total number of minutes John spends in class each day:**
   - Each class is 40 minutes long.
   - John has 8 periods each day.
   - Therefore, John spends \(8 \times 40 = 320\) minutes in class each day.

3. **Calculate the total number of minutes John spends in class each week:**
   - John goes to class 5 days a week.
   - Therefore, John spends \(320 \times 5 = 1600\) minutes in class each week.

4. **Calculate the total number of minutes John spends on Saturday and Sunday:**
   - John spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday.
   - Therefore, John spends \(\frac{1}{16} \times 1600 = 100\) minutes on Saturday and Sunday combined.

5. **Calculate the total number of minutes John spends learning each week:**
   - John spends 1600 minutes in class each week and 100 minutes on Saturday and Sunday.
   - Therefore, John spends \(1600 + 100 = 1700\) minutes learning each week.

6. **Convert the total number of minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, John spends \(\frac{1700}{60} = \frac{1700 \div 20}{60 \div 20} = \frac{85}{3} \approx 28.33\) hours learning each week.

"First, let's determine the initial height from which Nathan drops the ball. Since the ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony and each story is 24 feet high, the height from which the ball is dropped is:

\[ 3 \text{ stories} \times 24 \text{ feet/story} = 72 \text{ feet} \]

The ball bounces to 2/3 of its starting height with each bounce. Therefore, on the first bounce, the ball will reach:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 72 \text{ feet} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

On the second bounce, the ball will again bounce to 2/3 of its height from the first bounce:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 48 \text{ feet} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height the ball reaches on its second bounce is:

\[ 32 \text{ feet} \]"
"First, let's convert the height of the first child from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the first child is:

6 feet * 12 inches/foot = 72 inches tall.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so:

72 inches + 2 inches = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so:

74 inches - 5 inches = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so:

69 inches + 3 inches = 72 inches tall.

Therefore, the fourth child is 72 inches tall."
"To determine the earnings from selling 2000 apples at a rate of $5 per bag, we first need to find out how many bags were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can calculate the number of bags sold as follows:

\[ \text{Number of bags sold} = \frac{\text{Total number of apples sold}}{\text{Number of apples per bag}} = \frac{2000}{10} = 200 \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags sold by the price per bag:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of bags sold} \times \text{Price per bag} = 200 \times 5 = 1000 \]

Therefore, the orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag."
"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the meat, so it left \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
3. The Allosaurus then ate the remaining meat, which is \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms. According to the problem, this amount is 270 kilograms.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]

To find \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

Therefore, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 kilograms.

The final numerical answer is:
1080"
"First, let's calculate the total area of the walls that Tony needs to paint.

The north and south walls are each 10 feet by 8 feet, so the area of each is:
\[ 10 \times 8 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is:
\[ 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The east and west walls are each 5 feet by 8 feet, so the area of each is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is:
\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Now, let's add the areas of all the walls to get the total area that needs to be painted:
\[ 160 + 80 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost of the paint. Since each gallon costs $12, the total cost is:
\[ 12 \times 12 = 144 \]

Therefore, the cost to paint the room is:
\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda.

Initially, Ellen has a case of 12 sodas. She shakes 3 of them, leaving 9 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.

Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 8 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.

Her brother then takes 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas. This leaves 7 unshaken sodas and 2 shaken sodas.

Now, Ellen's friend comes along. There are 7 unshaken sodas and 2 shaken sodas left. The total number of sodas left is 9.

The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left. 

So, the probability is \( \frac{2}{9} \).

To express this as a percentage, we calculate:
\[ \frac{2}{9} \times 100 \approx 22.22\% \]

Therefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is approximately 22.22%."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours and then sum these distances since the trains are traveling in opposite directions.

The first train travels at 60 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will travel:
\[ 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \]

The second train travels at half the speed of the first train, which is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]
In 3 hours, it will travel:
\[ 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles} \]

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each train has traveled:
\[ 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 270 \]"
"To determine how many people Billy helps with their taxes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.
2. Determine the number of days Billy works.
3. Calculate the total number of hours Billy works.
4. Determine the total number of people he helps.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.**

- March has 31 days.
- April 19th is included in the count.

Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days

**Step 2: Determine the number of days Billy works.**

Billy takes 20% of the days off.

Days off = 20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days

Days Billy works = Total days - Days off = 50 - 10 = 40 days

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of hours Billy works.**

Billy works 3 hours a day.

Total hours = 40 days * 3 hours/day = 120 hours

**Step 4: Determine the total number of people he helps.**

Billy can help 2 people per hour.

Total people helped = 120 hours * 2 people/hour = 240 people

The final numerical answer is 240."
"First, let's calculate the number of people in the buses:

Number of people in buses = Number of buses * People per bus
Number of people in buses = 12 * 35
Number of people in buses = 420

Next, let's calculate the number of people in the cars:

Number of people in cars = Number of cars * People per car
Number of people in cars = 20 * 3
Number of people in cars = 60

Now, let's add the number of people in the buses and the cars to find the total number of people who were not inside the church:

Total number of people outside the church = Number of people in buses + Number of people in cars
Total number of people outside the church = 420 + 60
Total number of people outside the church = 480

Therefore, the number of people inside the church is:

Number of people inside the church = Total number of people outside the church
Number of people inside the church = 480

The final numerical answer is 480."

"To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes for each slide and then find the difference.

For the biggest slide:
- Length: 300 feet
- Speed: 60 feet/minute

Time to slide down the biggest slide = Length / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
- Length: 240 feet
- Speed: 80 feet/minute

Time to slide down the second biggest slide = Length / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

Now, we find the difference in time:
Time difference = Time for biggest slide - Time for second biggest slide = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

The final numerical answer is 2 minutes."
"To calculate the total time Bobby spends on his lunches and breaks over 5 days, we first need to determine the daily total and then multiply by the number of days.

Bobby's daily break time is 2 breaks of 15 minutes each, which totals:
\[ 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding his 30-minute lunch break, his total daily break time is:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

To find the total time over 5 days, we multiply the daily total by 5:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ \frac{300 \text{ minutes}}{60} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \]"
"First, let's calculate how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's miles as follows:

\[ \text{Micah's miles} = 3.5 \times 8 \]

Now, let's calculate that:

\[ \text{Micah's miles} = 28 \]

Next, we need to find out how many miles Ahito ran. We know the total miles run by all three is 52 miles. So, we can subtract the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total to find Ahito's miles:

\[ \text{Ahito's miles} = 52 - (\text{Amber's miles} + \text{Micah's miles}) \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ \text{Ahito's miles} = 52 - (8 + 28) \]

Now, let's calculate Ahito's miles:

\[ \text{Ahito's miles} = 52 - 36 \]
\[ \text{Ahito's miles} = 16 \]

So, Ahito ran 16 miles."
"First, let's calculate the initial charge and the return:

Initial charge: $85.00
Returned item: $15.00

After the return, the charge on the credit card is:
$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of the items she bought after the discounts:

Frying pan on sale for 20% off $20.00:
Discounted price = $20.00 - (20% of $20.00) = $20.00 - ($20.00 * 0.20) = $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Set of towels on sale for 10% off $30.00:
Discounted price = $30.00 - (10% of $30.00) = $30.00 - ($30.00 * 0.10) = $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, let's add the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels to the remaining balance on the credit card:

Remaining balance: $70.00
Frying pan: $16.00
Set of towels: $27.00

Total charge: $70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00

The new balance on her credit card is $113.00."
"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem:
- A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{1}{5}J \).
- A third of the large jellyfish change color under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{5}J = \frac{1}{15}J \).
- When the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color. Therefore, \( \frac{1}{15}J = 6 \).

To find \( J \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{15}J = 6 \]
\[ J = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ J = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate Lauren's annual savings:**
   Lauren saves 20% of her annual salary.
   \[
   \text{Annual savings} = 20\% \times \$100,000 = 0.20 \times \$100,000 = \$20,000
   \]

2. **Determine Lauren's retirement savings goal:**
   Lauren plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years.
   \[
   \text{Total retirement savings} = \$20,000 \times 20 = \$400,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the amount Lauren needs to live on after retirement:**
   Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary after retirement.
   \[
   \text{Annual living cost after retirement} = 40\% \times \$100,000 = 0.40 \times \$100,000 = \$40,000
   \]

4. **Determine the number of years Lauren needs to work to save for retirement:**
   We need to find out how many years Lauren needs to work to save \$400,000 at an annual savings rate of \$20,000.
   \[
   \text{Number of years} = \frac{\text{Total retirement savings}}{\text{Annual savings}} = \frac{\$400,000}{\$20,000} = 20 \text{ years}

Therefore, the length of each final cut is 5 centimeters."
"To find the total number of students in the school, we start by understanding that 40% of the school population consists of 240 boys. Let's denote the total number of students in the school as \( T \).

Given that 40% of \( T \) is equal to 240 boys, we can write the equation as:
\[ 0.40 \times T = 240 \]

To find \( T \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} \]

Now, let's calculate the value of \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} = 600 \]

So, the total number of students in the school is 600. To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = T - \text{Number of boys} = 600 - 240 = 360 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360."

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days in June.
2. Determine the total number of miles Soledad plans to hike in June.
3. Calculate the number of miles Soledad plans to hike per day.
4. Determine the difference between the planned miles per day and the required miles per day.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days in June.**
June has 30 days.

**Step 2: Determine the total number of miles Soledad plans to hike in June.**
Soledad plans to hike 9,300 miles in June.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of miles Soledad plans to hike per day.**
To find the planned miles per day, we divide the total miles by the number of days:
\[ \text{Planned miles per day} = \frac{9,300 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 310 \text{ miles/day} \]

**Step 4: Determine the difference between the planned miles per day and the required miles per day.**
Soledad wants to hike twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. Therefore, the total miles per day she plans to hike is:
\[ \text{Planned miles per day} = 125 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

Now, we find the difference between the planned miles per day and the required miles per day:
\[ \text{Difference} = 250 \text{ miles/day} - 310 \text{ miles/day} = -60 \text{ miles/day} \]

Since the result is negative, it indicates that Soledad is already planning to hike more than the required miles per day. Therefore, she does not need to hike any more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how long it will take the light to blink 459 times, we first need to determine the rate of blinking. The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. Therefore, the rate of blinking is:

\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute} \]

Now, to find out how long it will take to blink 459 times, we use the rate we just calculated:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} \]

\[ \text{Time} = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take 9 minutes for the light to blink 459 times."
"First, let's calculate the total number of male and female guppies and goldfishes Tate has after the purchase.

Initially, Tate has:
- 4 male guppies
- 7 female guppies
- 3 male goldfishes
- 5 female goldfishes

After buying more fish:
- He buys 2 more male guppies, so he now has 4 + 2 = 6 male guppies.
- He buys 1 more female guppy, so he now has 7 + 1 = 8 female guppies.
- He buys 2 more male goldfishes, so he now has 3 + 2 = 5 male goldfishes.
- He buys 3 more female goldfishes, so he now has 5 + 3 = 8 female goldfishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of male and female fishes:
- Total male fishes = 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfishes) = 11 male fishes.
- Total female fishes = 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfishes) = 16 female fishes.

To find out how many more female fishes than male fishes Tate has, we subtract the total number of male fishes from the total number of female fishes:
- Difference = 16 (female fishes) - 11 (male fishes) = 5.

So, Tate has 5 more female fishes than male fishes. The final numerical answer is 5."
"First, let's determine the time each person took to complete their chores:

1. Amalia mowed the lawn, which took her 4 hours.
2. Megan walked the dog, which took her 2 hours longer than Amalia. Therefore, Megan's chore took her \(4 + 2 = 6\) hours.
3. Dior did the laundry, which took her well over 4 hours longer than Amalia. Since Amalia's chore took 4 hours, Dior's chore took more than \(4 + 4 = 8\) hours. Let's assume the minimum time Dior took, which is 9 hours (since ""well over"" typically means more than the minimum additional time).

Now, we can calculate the total time they all took to do their chores altogether:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Amalia's time} + \text{Megan's time} + \text{Dior's time} = 4 + 6 + 9 = 19 \text{ hours}

"To solve this, let's first calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers.

Two workers produce 6 toys per hour:
\[ 2 \text{ workers} \times 6 \text{ toys/hour} = 12 \text{ toys/hour} \]
\[ 12 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ toys} \]

The other two workers produce 4 toys per hour:
\[ 2 \text{ workers} \times 4 \text{ toys/hour} = 8 \text{ toys/hour} \]
\[ 8 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 80 \text{ toys} \]

Adding the toys produced by all four workers:
\[ 120 \text{ toys} + 80 \text{ toys} = 200 \text{ toys} \]

The total order is 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, they have 200 toys. Therefore, they still need:
\[ 400 \text{ toys} - 200 \text{ toys} = 200 \text{ toys} \]

These 200 toys need to be produced by the fifth worker in the remaining 10 hours. Therefore, the fifth worker must produce:

Next, we need to determine how many M&Ms are in the 30 ounces of M&Ms. We know that 1 ounce of M&Ms contains 30 M&Ms. Therefore, the total number of M&Ms is:
\[ 30 \text{ ounces} \times 30 \text{ M&Ms per ounce} = 900 \text{ M&Ms} \]

Now, John wants to put 10 M&Ms in each small bag. To find out how many small bags he can make, we divide the total number of M&Ms by the number of M&Ms per small bag:
\[ \frac{900 \text{ M&Ms}}{10 \text{ M&Ms per small bag}} = 90 \text{ small bags} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we first need to calculate half of the earth's circumference.

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of this distance is:
\[ \frac{40,000}{2} = 20,000 \text{ kilometers} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:
\[ \frac{20,000}{400} = 50 \text{ days} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 50 \]"
"To find the speed of the faster car, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car.
2. Use the speed of the 2nd fastest car to find the speed of the faster car.

First, we know the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. Therefore, the speed of the 2nd fastest car is:
\[ 120 \times 5 = 600 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. Therefore, the speed of the faster car is:
\[ 600 \times 1.25 = 750 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 750 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's first determine Liam's age two years ago. Since Liam is currently 16 years old, two years ago he was:

\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \text{ years old} \]

According to the problem, two years ago Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. Let's denote Vince's age two years ago as \( V \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 14 = 2V \]

To find \( V \), we solve for \( V \):

\[ V = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]

So, two years ago Vince was 7 years old. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:

\[ 7 + 2 = 9 \]

Therefore, Vince is now 9 years old. The final numerical answer is:

9"
"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline as \( A \) (since they painted the same number). Therefore, the total number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline is \( 2A \).

Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Sarah as \( S \). Then, the number of eggs painted by Camden is \( S + 12 \). Therefore, we can write the equation for the total eggs painted by Camden and Sarah as:
\[ S + (S + 12) = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]
So, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

Now, we know the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total number of eggs painted by Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah as:
\[ 2A + 9 + 21 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]
So, Arnold and Madeline each painted 13 eggs.

Now, we need to find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold. Since Camden painted 21 eggs and Arnold painted 13 eggs, the difference is:
\[ 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Therefore, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold. The final numerical answer is:
8"
"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups} \]

Each group of 8 crayons will be placed in a box. Since each box contains 8 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the weight of each box will be:

\[ \text{Weight of each box} = 8 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 8 \text{ ounces} \]

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the weight of each box in pounds is:

\[ \text{Weight of each box in pounds} = \frac{8 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes. There are 25 boxes, each weighing 0.5 pounds:

\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 0.5 \text{ pounds/box} = 12.5 \text{ pounds} \]

The total weight of the crayons is the weight of 200 crayons, each weighing 1 ounce:

\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Converting the total weight of the crayons to pounds:

\[ \text{Total weight of crayons in pounds} = \frac{200 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 12.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the total weight of the crayons and the boxes together:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 12.5 \text{ pounds (crayons)} + 12.5 \text{ pounds (boxes)} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[ 25 \text{ pounds} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many 4-foot logs John can make from the 80-foot tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we calculate:

\[ \text{Length of logs} = 80 \text{ feet} \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we determine how many 4-foot logs can be cut from 64 feet of wood:

\[ \text{Number of logs} = \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

Now, we need to find out how many planks John can get from these 16 logs. Since he cuts 5 planks from each log:

\[ \text{Number of planks} = 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

Finally, we calculate the total revenue from selling these planks at $1.2 per plank:

\[ \text{Total revenue} = 80 \text{ planks} \times \$1.2/\text{plank} = \$96 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$96 \]"
"First, let's determine how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns half of what her brother earns, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Valerie's salary} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

Given that Valerie earns $5000 per month, we can solve for her brother's salary:

\[ 5000 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

\[ \text{Brother's salary} = 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Now, we know Valerie's brother earns $10000 per month. Next, we need to find out how much their mother earns. Their mother earns twice their combined salary. First, we calculate their combined salary:

\[ \text{Combined salary} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} \]

\[ \text{Combined salary} = 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Their mother earns twice this amount:

\[ \text{Mother's salary} = 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \]

Now, we can find the total amount of money they all have together by adding their salaries:

\[ \text{Total amount} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} + \text{Mother's salary} \]

\[ \text{Total amount} = 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

So, the total amount of money they all have together is $45000."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk, and then calculate the total time for the entire walk.

First, let's find Grandma's speed on the beach. We know that she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes. Therefore, her speed on the beach is:

\[ \text{Speed on the beach} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} \]

Since she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is:

\[ \text{Speed on the sidewalk} = 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, we calculate the time spent on the sidewalk. Since she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk in 10 minutes, for 1 mile:

\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the time spent on the beach. Since she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes, for 2 miles:

\[ \text{Time on the beach} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk to find the total time for the entire 3-mile walk:

\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time on the beach} + \text{Time on the sidewalk} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it takes for her to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:

\[ 50 \text{ minutes} \]"
"Jane has already saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount she has saved so far is:
\[ 4 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 8 \, \text{weeks} = 32 \, \text{dollars} \]

To reach a total of $60, she needs to save an additional:
\[ 60 \, \text{dollars} - 32 \, \text{dollars} = 28 \, \text{dollars} \]

Since she saves $4 each week, the number of additional weeks required to save the remaining $28 is:
\[ \frac{28 \, \text{dollars}}{4 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 7 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to have saved a total of $60."
"To find the total number of blue birds, we can break down the information given and sum it up:

- 3 trees each had 7 blue birds: \(3 \times 7 = 21\)
- 2 different trees each had 4 blue birds: \(2 \times 4 = 8\)
- 1 tree had 3 blue birds: \(1 \times 3 = 3\)

Now, we add these numbers together to get the total number of blue birds:

\[21 + 8 + 3 = 32\]

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"First, let's determine how many marbles Bob currently has. If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen is equal to 24 marbles, we can set up the following equation to find out how many marbles Bob currently has:

\[ \text{Current marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

Subtracting 24 from both sides of the equation gives:

\[ \text{Current marbles} = 60 - 24 \]
\[ \text{Current marbles} = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles. If he loses 10 of the marbles he has, the number of marbles he will have is:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the second mug of water so that after Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle, the remaining water in both mugs is at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote the temperature of the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

First, we calculate the temperature of the remaining water in the 33-degree mug after pouring 4 ounces:
- Initial temperature of the 33-degree mug: 33 degrees
- Temperature of the water poured out: 33 degrees
- Remaining water in the 33-degree mug: \( 33 - 33 = 0 \) degrees

Since the remaining water in the 33-degree mug is now 0 degrees, it is no longer relevant for the temperature calculation.

Next, we calculate the temperature of the remaining water in the second mug after pouring 1 ounce:
- Initial temperature of the second mug: \( T \) degrees
- Temperature of the water poured out: \( T \) degrees
- Remaining water in the second mug: \( T - T = 0 \) degrees

Again, the remaining water in the second mug is now 0 degrees, which is not relevant for the temperature calculation.

However, we need to ensure that the water in the water bottle, which contains the remaining water from the second mug (1 ounce), is at least 40 degrees. Since the water bottle initially had no water, the water in the bottle is now 1 ounce of water from the second mug, which is at least \( T \) degrees.

Therefore, the temperature of the water in the water bottle must be at least 40 degrees:
\[ T \geq 40 \]

Thus, the minimum temperature of the second mug is 40 degrees.

The final numerical answer is:
40"
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added over the period and then add these to the initial numbers.

First, let's calculate the number of cows added:
- Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day.
- There are 21 days in three weeks (since 3 weeks = 21 days).

So, the number of cows added is:
\[ 20 \text{ cows/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 420 \text{ cows} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of chickens added:
- Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day.
- There are 21 days in three weeks.

So, the number of chickens added is:
\[ 10 \text{ chickens/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ chickens} \]

Now, let's add the initial number of animals to the number of animals added:
- Initial number of cows: 50
- Initial number of chickens: 20

So, the total number of cows after three weeks is:
\[ 50 + 420 = 470 \text{ cows} \]

And the total number of chickens after three weeks is:
\[ 20 + 210 = 230 \text{ chickens} \]

Finally, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is:
\[ 470 \text{ cows} + 230 \text{ chickens} = 700 \text{ animals} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 700 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount:

Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs cost:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Since he orders 4 packs, he will receive a 10% discount on the total cost. The discount amount is:
\[ 40 \times 0.10 = 4 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels he gets in total. Each pack contains 9 bagels, so 4 packs contain:
\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \]

To find the cost per bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels:
\[ \frac{36}{36} = 1 \]

So, the cost per bagel is $1.00. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1 \]"
"First, let's determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. According to the question, Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, we calculate:

\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 1 less than 3 is 2 scoops, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. The question states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, 1 less than 3 scoops is 2 scoops, and 3 less than 6 potatoes is 3 potatoes. Therefore, 2 scoops of mashed potatoes require 3 potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes are required for 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 2 scoops require 3 potatoes, 18 scoops would require:

\[ \frac{18}{2} \times 3 = 9 \times 3 = 27 \]

So, Gomer ate 27 potatoes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 27 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days:
- Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days.
- Total eggs in the first 30 days = 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs.

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the next 30 days:
- Chester eats 5 eggs a day for 30 days.
- Total eggs in the next 30 days = 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.

Now, let's find the total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days:
- Total eggs in 60 days = 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.

To find out how many dozens of eggs Chester needs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs):
- Total dozens of eggs = 240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens.

The final numerical answer is 20 dozens."
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we first need to determine the number of red jellybeans and then subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans.

"To determine how many sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to first calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day and then multiply by 3.

From the information given:
- Each bouquet of sunflowers costs $8 and contains 12 sunflowers.
- Faraday earned $56 from selling bouquets per day.

First, we calculate the number of bouquets sold per day:
\[ \text{Number of bouquets sold per day} = \frac{\text{Earnings from bouquets per day}}{\text{Cost of one bouquet}} = \frac{56}{8} = 7 \text{ bouquets per day} \]

Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold per day is:
\[ \text{Number of sunflowers sold per day} = \text{Number of bouquets sold per day} \times 12 = 7 \times 12 = 84 \text{ sunflowers per day} \]

Now, to find the total number of sunflowers sold over 3 days:
\[ \text{Total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days} = \text{Number of sunflowers sold per day} \times 3 = 84 \times 3 = 252 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that both tickets are winners.

First, let's denote the probability of winning with the first ticket as \( P_1 \). According to the problem, \( P_1 = 20\% = 0.20 \).

The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning with the second ticket, \( P_2 \), is:
\[ P_2 = 3 \times P_1 = 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60 \]

Since the events are independent, the probability that both tickets are winners is the product of their individual probabilities:
\[ P(\text{both tickets are winners}) = P_1 \times P_2 = 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to determine Carl's height first. We know Isabel's height and the relationships between the heights of Isabel, Ned, and Carl.

1. Isabel is 7 feet tall.
2. Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, so Ned's height is \(7 - 2 = 5\) feet.
3. Carl is one foot taller than Ned, so Carl's height is \(5 + 1 = 6\) feet.

Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is \(6 / 2 = 3\) feet.

"To determine how many more bottles of juices Hortex would have to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bottles needed to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.
2. Subtract the current daily production from the total number of bottles needed.

First, let's calculate the total number of bottles needed:
- Each person's daily energy demand is covered by 20% of a bottle.
- Therefore, to cover 100% of a person's daily energy demand, we need 5 bottles (since 100% / 20% = 5).

For 2300 people:
\[ 2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we subtract the current daily production from the total number of bottles needed:
- Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day.

\[ 11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles/day} = 7300 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, Hortex would have to produce 7300 more bottles of juices to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 7300 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the total number of babies and their clothing distribution:**
   - Total babies: 8
   - Babies dressed in purple: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
   - Babies dressed in blue: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

2. **Determine the number of babies wearing bows:**
   - Babies wearing bows among the blue-wearers: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 2 = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.6667 \) (rounding to the nearest whole number, 1 baby)
   - Babies wearing bows among the purple-wearers: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

3. **Calculate the total number of babies wearing bows:**
   - Total babies wearing bows: \( 1 + 2 = 3 \)

4. **Calculate the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple:**
   - Percentage chance: \( \frac{\text{Number of purple-wearers wearing bows}}{\text{Total number of babies wearing bows}} \times 100 \)
   - Percentage chance: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 100 \approx 66.67\% \)

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and on Thursday and Friday, from the total number of reports received last week.

Total reports received last week = 5168
Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

Reports received on Wednesday = Total reports - (Reports on Monday and Tuesday + Reports on Thursday and Friday)

Let's calculate it:

Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - (1907 + 2136)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043
Reports received on Wednesday = 1125

So, the final numerical answer is 1125."
"First, let's determine how much land Abraham sold in each transaction.

1. Abraham initially owned 80 square meters of land.
2. He sold half of his land for $50. Half of 80 square meters is 40 square meters. So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.
3. After a month, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. One quarter of 80 square meters is 20 square meters. So, he sold 20 square meters for $30.
4. The remaining land is the total land minus the land sold in the first and second transactions. The land sold in the first transaction was 40 square meters, and in the second transaction, it was 20 square meters. So, the total land sold is 40 + 20 = 60 square meters. Therefore, the remaining land is 80 - 60 = 20 square meters.

Now, let's calculate the total money Abraham earned from selling the land.

- From the first transaction, he earned $50.
- From the second transaction, he earned $30.
- For the remaining 20 square meters, he sold them at $3 per square meter. So, he earned 20 * $3 = $60.

Adding these amounts together, the total money Abraham earned is $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the total number of eggs Cole hid in the yard. Since a dozen is equal to 12, 3 dozen eggs would be:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we'll calculate how many eggs each person found:

- Lamar found 5 eggs.
- Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy found:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ eggs} \]

- Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie found:

\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ eggs} \]

- Mei found half as many as Charlie, so Mei found:

\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we'll sum the number of eggs found by Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei:

\[ 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 \text{ eggs} \]

Finally, to find out how many eggs are still hidden in the yard, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden:

\[ 36 - 27 = 9 \text{ eggs} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 9 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of apartments in the third apartment complex. The first two complexes each have 200 apartments, so together they have:

\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments} \]

The third complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined. To find out how many apartments the third complex has, we calculate 60% of 400 and add it to 400:

\[ 400 \times 0.60 = 240 \]
\[ 400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from in a week. He collects garbage from each of the three complexes 3 times a week:

\[ 3 \times (200 + 200 + 640) = 3 \times 1040 = 3120 \text{ collections} \]

John gets paid $0.40 per collection. Therefore, his weekly earnings are:

"To calculate the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we need to determine the number of fruits produced each year and then sum them up.

1. **5-year-old tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount, which is \(50 \times 3 = 150\) fruits.
3. **7-year-old tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount, which is \(50 \times 7 = 350\) fruits.
4. **8-year-old tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is \(50 \times 20 = 1000\) fruits. Therefore, an 8-year-old tree produces \(1000 - 200 = 800\) fruits.
5. **9-year-old tree**: Produces 0 fruits.
6. **10-year-old tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount, which is \(50 \times 20 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, we sum up the fruits produced each year:

\[
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350
\]

The total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is 2350."

"Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters, the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters, and the red rope as \( R \) centimeters.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we substitute \( B \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ R = 4(Y - 7) \]

Next, we substitute \( B \) and \( R \) into the third equation:
\[ 4(Y - 7) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]

Add 35 to both sides:
\[ 6Y = 72 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now, we find \( B \) and \( R \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \]
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

The length of the red rope is \( 20 \) centimeters."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine how much money Rissa and Ronnie were given initially:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = $15\).

2. **Let \(x\) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister.**
   - After giving \(x\) dollars to their sister, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her initial amount.
   - Therefore, \(15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15\).

3. **Solve for \(x\):**
   \[
   15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
   \]
   \[
   15 - x = 12
   \]
   \[
   x = 15 - 12
   \]
   \[
   x = 3

4. **Determine how much money Rissa has left:**
   - Rissa initially had $15 and gave $3 to her sister.
   - Therefore, Rissa is left with \(15 - 3 = 12\) dollars.

5. **Determine how much money Ronnie has left:**
   - Ronnie initially had $5 and did not give any money to his sister.
   - Therefore, Ronnie is left with $5.

"Let's break down the information given:

- There are four different colors of paint: red, white, purple, and yellow.
- There are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint.
- Half the mural is yellow.
- The total amount of paint used is 12 pints.

Let's denote the amount of red paint as \( R \), white paint as \( W \), purple paint as \( P \), and yellow paint as \( Y \).

From the information given:
- \( R = W = P \)
- \( Y = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \) pints (since half the mural is yellow)
- The total amount of paint is \( R + W + P + Y = 12 \) pints

Since \( R = W = P \), we can substitute \( W \) and \( P \) with \( R \) in the equation:
\[ R + R + R + 6 = 12 \]
\[ 3R + 6 = 12 \]

Now, solve for \( R \):
\[ 3R = 12 - 6 \]
\[ 3R = 6 \]
\[ R = 2 \]

Therefore, the number of pints of red paint used is 2 pints."
"To find the total area of Tom's house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the remaining area of the house.

First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom:
\[ \text{Area of one bedroom} = 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:
\[ \text{Total area of bedrooms} = 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of the living room, which is 5 times the area of one bedroom:
\[ \text{Area of the living room} = 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

Now, we know the remaining area of the house is 1000 square feet.

To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the remaining area:
\[ \text{Total area of the house} = 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

So, the total area of the house is:

So, at the end of the week, Alice will have counted 93 puffs of clouds in the sky at lunch across all five days."
"To determine how many dishwashing cycles can be run for $1 with the new box, we first need to find out how many pods are in the new box.

The original box has 100 pods and costs $12. The new box has 20% more pods than the original box. Therefore, the number of pods in the new box is:

\[ 100 + (0.20 \times 100) = 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The new box also costs $12, so the cost per pod in the new box is:

\[ \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

If you use 1 pod per cycle, the number of cycles you can run for $1 is:

\[ \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \text{ cycles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 10 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of 20 dollar bills Thomas initially withdraws from the bank. Since he withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills, we can calculate the number of bills as follows:

\[ \text{Number of 20 dollar bills} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \]

Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home, so the number of bills he has left is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Next, Thomas uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. The number of bills he uses is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, the number of bills he has left is:

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \]

Thomas then triples his money. Since each bill is worth $20, the total amount of money he has after tripling is:

\[ 20 \times 20 \times 3 = 1200 \]

Finally, Thomas converts all his money to 5 dollar bills. The number of 5 dollar bills he has is:

\[ \frac{1200}{5} = 240 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 240 \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. In the first half, team A scores 4 goals.
2. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A in the first half, so team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals in the first half.
3. In the second half, team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half.
4. Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals in the second half.
5. Therefore, team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals in the second half.

Now, let's calculate the total goals scored by each team:

- Team A's total goals: \(4 \text{ (first half)} + 2 \text{ (second half)} = 6\)
- Team B's total goals: \(2 \text{ (first half)} + 8 \text{ (second half)} = 10\)

Finally, the total number of goals scored in the match is the sum of the goals scored by both teams:

\[6 + 10 = 16\]

The final numerical answer is 16."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chalk the teacher has left and then calculate how many days he can continue using 20% of the chalk each day before he has to recycle it.

1. **Initial Chalk Length**: The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk.

"First, let's determine the number of girls and boys on varsity.

One-third of the girls are on varsity:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ girls on varsity} \]

One-fourth of the boys are on varsity:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ boys on varsity} \]

Next, we calculate the number of girls and boys not on varsity.

Number of girls not on varsity:
\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ girls not on varsity} \]

Number of boys not on varsity:
\[ 12 - 3 = 9 \text{ boys not on varsity} \]

Finally, we add the number of girls and boys not on varsity to find the total number of students not on varsity:
\[ 8 + 9 = 17 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 17 \]"
"First, let's determine how many face masks Mike bought. According to the problem, Mike bought 5 face masks.

Next, we need to calculate how many face masks Johnny bought. The problem states that Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike. We can express this mathematically as:

\[ \text{Number of face masks Johnny bought} = 3 \times (\text{Number of face masks Mike bought}) + 2 \]

Substituting the number of face masks Mike bought (which is 5) into the equation:

\[ \text{Number of face masks Johnny bought} = 3 \times 5 + 2 \]

Now, let's perform the calculation:

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]
\[ 15 + 2 = 17 \]

Therefore, Johnny bought 17 face masks.

The final numerical answer is:
17"
"First, let's determine the number of teeth that the dentist fixes. According to the problem, the dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills. Since he drills 4 teeth, the number of teeth capped is:

\[ 4 + 7 = 11 \]

So, the total number of teeth fixed by the dentist is the sum of the teeth drilled and the teeth capped:

\[ 4 + 11 = 15 \]

Now, to find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 50 \]"
"To calculate the refund amount, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total cost of the milk Mr. Marcellus initially purchased.
2. Calculate the amount of milk that was returned due to expiry.
3. Calculate the refund amount based on the returned milk.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the milk Mr. Marcellus initially purchased:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Number of gallons} \times \text{Cost per gallon} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 4000 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5/\text{gallon} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$14000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much milk was returned due to expiry. Since 2/5 of the milk had passed the expiry date:
\[ \text{Milk returned} = \text{Total milk purchased} \times \frac{2}{5} \]
\[ \text{Milk returned} = 4000 \text{ gallons} \times \frac{2}{5} \]
\[ \text{Milk returned} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, we calculate the refund amount based on the returned milk:
\[ \text{Refund amount} = \text{Milk returned} \times \text{Cost per gallon} \]
\[ \text{Refund amount} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5/\text{gallon} \]
\[ \text{Refund amount} = \$5600 \]

So, the refund amount Mr. Marcellus received is:
\[ \$5600 \]"
"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now, we substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5(C + 7)) \]

Simplify the right side of the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5(C + 7)}{3} \]

Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]

Expand both sides:
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Rearrange the equation to isolate \( C \):
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]

Solve for \( C \):
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old. Let's verify this by calculating Wendy's current age and checking the conditions of the problem.

If Colin is 20 years old, then seven years from now he will be 27 years old. According to the first condition:
\[ W = 5(27) = 135 \]

In 25 years, Colin will be 45 years old. According to the second condition:
\[ 45 = \frac{1}{3}W \]
\[ 45 = \frac{1}{3} \times 135 \]
\[ 45 = 45 \]

Both conditions are satisfied, so the solution is correct. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's determine how many books Bob can buy with $27,000. We know that he can buy 100 books for $500. Therefore, the cost per book is:

\[ \text{Cost per book} = \frac{500}{100} = 5 \text{ dollars per book} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27,000:

\[ \text{Total number of books} = \frac{27000}{5} = 5400 \text{ books} \]

Since Bob is distributing the money between 3 schools, we need to find out how many books he can buy per school:

\[ \text{Books per school} = \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \text{ books per school} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1800 \]"

So, Newton brought home 6 apples."
"First, we need to determine how many 50 kg bags are in 850 kg of coal. We do this by dividing the total weight of coal by the weight of each bag:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{850 \text{ kg}}{50 \text{ kg/bag}} = 17 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of bags by the cost per bag:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 17 \text{ bags} \times 18 \text{ dollars/bag} = 306 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed by Kate's friends. Each of the 6 friends eats 6 slices of cheese pizza:

\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices} \]

Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, we need to determine how many cheese pizzas are required to provide 36 slices:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed by Kate's friends. Each of the 6 friends eats 4 slices of pepperoni pizza:

\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Since the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we need to determine how many pepperoni pizzas are required to provide 24 slices:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

To find the total number of pizzas Kate needs to buy, we add the number of cheese pizzas and pepperoni pizzas required:

\[ 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, Kate needs to buy 6 pizzas in total."
"To calculate the total miles Sam ran this week, we need to add up the miles he ran on each day.

- On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day. So for these three days, he ran \(3 \times 3 = 9\) miles.
- On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. So for these two days, he ran \(5 \times 2 = 10\) miles.

Adding these together, the total miles Sam ran this week is \(9 + 10 = 19\) miles."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many snowballs Jay can actually make in an hour, accounting for the ones that melt.

Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. This means that in 15 minutes, 2 snowballs melt, so he only has 20 - 2 = 18 snowballs at the end of every 15 minutes.

To find out how many snowballs he makes in 15 minutes, we can calculate:
- In 15 minutes, he makes 18 snowballs.

Now, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are needed to reach 60 snowballs:
- 60 snowballs / 18 snowballs per 15 minutes = 3.3333 intervals.

Since he can't have a fraction of an interval, we round up to the next whole number, which means he needs 4 intervals of 15 minutes to have at least 60 snowballs.

Now, we calculate the total time:
- 4 intervals * 15 minutes per interval = 60 minutes.

So, it will take Jay 60 minutes to have at least 60 snowballs.

The final numerical answer is 60."
"If John is 28 years old now and he is twice as old as Jim when the Digimon series came out, we can determine Jim's age at that time by dividing John's age by 2. 

So, Jim's age when the series came out was \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \) years old.

Since the question asks for Jim's current age, and no information is given about the passage of time since the series came out, we can only conclude that Jim was 14 years old at the time the series came out. Without additional information about how much time has passed since then, we cannot determine Jim's current age."
"Doxa ate 1 slice.
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so she ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so he ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

The final numerical answer is 6."
"Let's break down the problem day by day to find out how many bandages were used and how many were left at the end of each day.

**First Day:**
- They used 38 bandages.
- They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
- Total bandages at the end of the first day: \(38 - 38 + 50 = 50\).

**Second Day:**
- They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
- Total bandages at the end of the second day: \(50 - 28 = 22\).

**Third Day:**
- They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered \(2 \times 50 = 100\) bandages.
- They used half a pack, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.
- Total bandages at the end of the third day: \(22 - 25 + 100 = 97\).

According to the problem, they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means there was a discrepancy in the calculation. Let's correct it:

- They used 25 bandages on the third day, so the correct calculation should be: \(22 - 25 + 100 = 97\). But since they ended up with 78 bandages, we need to adjust the initial bandages to match this.

Let's denote the number of bandages they started with on the first day as \(x\).

**First Day:**
- They used 38 bandages, so they had \(x - 38\) bandages left.
- They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages, so they had \(x - 38 + 50 = x + 12\) bandages at the end of the first day.

**Second Day:**
- They used 28 bandages, so they had \(x + 12 - 28 = x - 16\) bandages left.
- They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages, so they had \(x - 16 + 50 = x + 34\) bandages at the end of the second day.

**Third Day:**
- They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered \(2 \times 50 = 100\) bandages.
- They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages, so they had \(x + 34 - 25 = x + 9\) bandages left.
- They ended up with 78 bandages, so \(x + 9 = 78\).

Solving for \(x\):
\[x + 9 = 78\]
\[x = 78 - 9\]
\[x = 69\]

Therefore, they started with 69 bandages on the first day."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the haircut. May's hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches, so the length of hair cut is:

10 inches - 8 inches = 2 inches

The cost for the haircut is $30 per inch, so for 2 inches, the cost is:

2 inches * $30/inch = $60

Now, we add the cost of the color, which is $40, to the cost of the haircut:

$60 (haircut) + $40 (color) = $100

Therefore, the total cost for the haircut and color is $100."
"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to consider her regular pay and the additional attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her regular pay:
- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- She works 6 days a week.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

So, her daily pay is:
\[ 7.5 \text{ hours/day} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = \$11.25/\text{day} \]

Her weekly pay is:
\[ \$11.25/\text{day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = \$67.50/\text{week} \]

Since there are exactly 4 weeks in April, her total pay for April is:
\[ \$67.50/\text{week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = \$270.00 \]

Additionally, since she did not incur any absences for the month of April, she receives the $10 bonus for complete attendance.

Therefore, her total earnings for April are:
\[ \$270.00 + \$10.00 = \$280.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$280.00 \]"
"To calculate how much money Jason earned, I'll add up the earnings from each task he completed.

1. For doing laundry: $3.00
2. For cleaning his room: $1.50
3. For taking the trash out: $0.75 per trip, and he took the trash out twice, so 2 * $0.75 = $1.50
4. For emptying the dishwasher: $0.50 per time, and he did this 6 times, so 6 * $0.50 = $3.00

Now, I'll add these amounts together:

$3.00 (laundry) + $1.50 (cleaning room) + $1.50 (taking trash) + $3.00 (emptying dishwasher) = $9.00

So, Jason earned $9.00 in a two-week period."
"First, let's determine the amount of blood in one shark. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons of blood, we can calculate the blood volume in one shark as follows:

\[ \text{Blood volume in one shark} = 3 \times 40 \text{ gallons} = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have. Since each shark has 120 gallons of blood, ten sharks will have:

\[ \text{Total blood volume for ten sharks} = 10 \times 120 \text{ gallons} = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:

\[ 1200 \]"
"To calculate the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day, we need to add up all the groups of people who entered.

1. In the morning, 50 people entered.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people.

Now, let's add these numbers together:

\[
50 \text{ (morning)} + 40 \text{ (10:00)} + 80 \text{ (twice 10:00)} + 150 \text{ (evening)} = 320

So, the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day is 320."
"Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack contains 5 pens. Therefore, the total number of red pens is:
\[ 5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 25 \text{ red pens} \]

She also bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. So, the number of black pens is:
\[ 2 \times 25 \text{ red pens} = 50 \text{ black pens} \]

To find the total number of pens Alain has, we add the number of red pens and black pens together:
\[ 25 \text{ red pens} + 50 \text{ black pens} = 75 \text{ pens} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 75 \]"
"First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600. Therefore, the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{\$600}{10 \text{ bottles}} = \$60 \text{ per bottle} \]

Next, we need to find the cost per bottle of cognac. The cognac costs 50% more per bottle than the scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = \$60 \times 1.5 = \$90 \text{ per bottle} \]

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch. Since he bought 10 bottles of scotch, he buys:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the cognac:

\[ \text{Total cost of cognac} = 20 \text{ bottles} \times \$90 \text{ per bottle} = \$1800 \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the scotch and the total cost of the cognac to find the total amount John spends:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = \$600 + \$1800 = \$2400 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \$2400 \]"
"To find the total number of trees Mr. Julius planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted each day and then sum them up.

First, let's determine the number of trees planted on the first day:
- Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
- He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which means he planted \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

So, the total number of trees planted on the first day is:
\[ 20 \text{ (White Oak)} + 40 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 60 \text{ trees} \]

Next, let's determine the number of trees planted on the second day:
- Mr. Julius planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day, which means he planted \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
- He planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day. The number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the first day was 40, so \(\frac{1}{4}\) more than 40 is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]
Thus, the number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is:
\[ 40 + 10 = 50 \]

So, the total number of trees planted on the second day is:
\[ 30 \text{ (White Oak)} + 50 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 80 \text{ trees} \]

Finally, the total number of trees planted over the two days is:
\[ 60 \text{ (first day)} + 80 \text{ (second day)} = 140 \text{ trees} \]

Therefore, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is:
\[ \boxed{140} \]"
"To find out how much root beer was available for each person to drink during the party, we need to calculate the total amount of root beer that was left after all the losses and spills.

Starting with 24 gallons:
- On the first day, 4 gallons were drunk by Fred's children, so we subtract 4 gallons: \(24 - 4 = 20\) gallons.
- On the second day, 7 gallons were accidentally spilled by Barbie, so we subtract 7 gallons: \(20 - 7 = 13\) gallons.
- On the third day, 5 gallons were taken by Ronnie, so we subtract 5 gallons: \(13 - 5 = 8\) gallons.

On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party, and the remaining 8 gallons were shared equally among them. Therefore, each person would get \(8 \div 3\) gallons.

To find the numerical answer:
\[ 8 \div 3 = \frac{8}{3} \approx 2.67 \]

So, the amount of root beer available for each person to drink during the party is \(\frac{8}{3}\) gallons."
"Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as \( x \).

According to the problem, eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation step by step.

First, subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8 \]
\[ 4x = 32 \]

Next, divide both sides by 4:
\[ \frac{4x}{4} = \frac{32}{4} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 8.

"First, let's determine the number of fish with red stripes. Since one-third of the fish have red stripes, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of fish with red stripes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

Next, we need to find out how many fish are left after accounting for the fish with red stripes. This is:

\[
\text{Remaining fish} = 66 - 22 = 44
\]

Now, we need to find out how many of these remaining fish have blue stripes. Since 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of fish with blue stripes} = \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
\]

Finally, to find the total number of fish that have either red or blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes:

\[
\text{Total number of fish with red or blue stripes} = 22 + 20 = 42
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[

"First, let's calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had:

- Two eyeshadow palettes, each with four colors: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors
- Three makeup sets, each with six colors: \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors

So, the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had is:
\[8 + 18 = 26\]

Her sister steals one of the palettes, which means Amy loses 4 colors:
\[26 - 4 = 22\]

Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which means she uses up 3 colors (since half of 6 is 3):
\[22 - 3 = 19\]

Therefore, the final number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is:
\[19\]"
"First, let's determine the height of Mattison's house and the height of the first floor.

Mattison's height is 60 inches. The house is 7 times as high as he is:
\[ \text{Height of the house} = 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

The first floor is thrice as high as Mattison is:
\[ \text{Height of the first floor} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Since the house has two stories, the height of the second floor is the total height of the house minus the height of the first floor:
\[ \text{Height of the second floor} = 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height from the floor to the roof of the second floor is the height of the second floor:
\[ \text{Height from the floor to the roof of the second floor} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 240 \]"
"First, let's calculate how many shells team Alphas found. They found 40% of the 700 shells.

\[ \text{Shells found by Alphas} = 700 \times \frac{40}{100} = 700 \times 0.40 = 280 \]

Next, we need to find out how many shells are left after team Alphas have found their share.

\[ \text{Remaining shells} = 700 - 280 = 420 \]

Team The finders then found 60% of the remaining shells.

\[ \text{Shells found by The finders} = 420 \times \frac{60}{100} = 420 \times 0.60 = 252 \]

Finally, to find out how many shells team Gogetters found, we subtract the shells found by Alphas and The finders from the total number of shells.

\[ \text{Shells found by Gogetters} = 700 - 280 - 252 = 168 \]

So, the number of shells that team Gogetters found is 168."
"Let's denote the number of miles the last dog needs to walk as \( x \).

The total number of miles the four dogs need to walk per day is the sum of the miles each dog needs:
- The first dog needs 1 mile.
- The second dog needs 4 miles.
- The third dog needs 3 miles.
- The fourth dog needs \( x \) miles.

So, the total number of miles is \( 1 + 4 + 3 + x \).

We are given that the average number of miles the four dogs need to walk per day is 3 miles. The average is calculated by dividing the total number of miles by the number of dogs, which is 4. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ \frac{1 + 4 + 3 + x}{4} = 3 \]

First, simplify the numerator:
\[ \frac{8 + x}{4} = 3 \]

Next, multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to eliminate the denominator:
\[ 8 + x = 12 \]

Then, solve for \( x \) by subtracting 8 from both sides:
\[ x = 4 \]

So, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \text{Loan Amount} = 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

Next, John uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts.

\[ \text{Amount Used to Pay Off Debt} = 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

To find out how much money he has leftover after paying off his debts, we subtract the amount used to pay off the debts from the loan amount.

\[ \text{Money Leftover} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 40,000 \]"
"To find out how much Deandre will earn, we first need to calculate the total weight of the tunas he caught and then multiply that by the price per kilogram.

The weights of the tunas are:
- First tuna: 56 kilograms
- Second tuna: 46 kilograms
- Third tuna: 26 kilograms

The total weight of the tunas is:
\[ 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 \text{ kilograms} \]

The price per kilogram of tuna is $0.50. Therefore, the total earnings from selling all the tunas is:

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 64 \]"
"To determine Trinity's profit, we first need to calculate the selling price of the magazines and then subtract the cost price from it.

Trinity bought the magazines at $72 each. She sells them at 11/8 of the price she bought them. Therefore, the selling price is:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72 \]

Let's calculate the selling price:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72 = 11 \times 9 = 99 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the cost price from the selling price:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price} \]
\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 = 27 \]

So, Trinity's profit is $27."
"To find the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed per day for each setting and then multiply by the number of days it was used at that setting.

1. **Low setting:**
   - Removes 1 liter of water per day.
   - Brian used it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed at low setting: \(1 \text{ liter/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 3 \text{ liters}\).

2. **Medium setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the low setting.
   - Therefore, it removes \(2 \times 1 = 2\) liters of water per day.
   - Brian used it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed at medium setting: \(2 \text{ liters/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ liters}\).

3. **High setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting.
   - Therefore, it removes \(2 \times 2 = 4\) liters of water per day.
   - Brian used it for 5 days.
   - Total water removed at high setting: \(4 \text{ liters/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ liters}\).

Now, we sum up the total water removed from all settings:
- Total water removed: \(3 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} + 20 \text{ liters} = 29 \text{ liters}\).

The final numerical answer is 29 liters."

\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 30 \text{ balloons per pack} = 300 \text{ balloons} \]

By the end of the afternoon, 12 balloons were left. To find out how many balloons were thrown, we subtract the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons:

\[ 300 \text{ balloons} - 12 \text{ balloons left} = 288 \text{ balloons thrown} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 288 \]"
"First, let's determine the amount of the second medicine Saanvi had to combine with the first medicine. Since she combined 14 mL of the first medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine, the amount of the second medicine is:

\[ 3 \times 14 \, \text{mL} = 42 \, \text{mL} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of medicine in one dose by adding the amounts of the first and second medicines:

\[ 14 \, \text{mL} + 42 \, \text{mL} = 56 \, \text{mL} \]

Now, to find out how many mL of medicine would be in 8 doses, we multiply the amount of medicine in one dose by 8:

\[ 56 \, \text{mL} \times 8 = 448 \, \text{mL} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 448 \, \text{mL} \]"
"First, let's determine the capacity of Ali's class. According to the information provided, Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students.

Next, we need to find the capacity of John's classes. Since each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, we calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:
\[ \text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{120}{8} = 15 \text{ students} \]

John has two classes, so the total capacity of John's classes is:
\[ \text{Total capacity of John's classes} = 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ students} \]

Now, we can find the combined capacity of both schools by adding the capacity of Ali's class and the total capacity of John's classes:
\[ \text{Combined capacity} = 120 + 30 = 150 \]

The combined capacity of both schools is 150 students."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen will owe his sister, including the 2% interest.

The interest is 2% of $300, which is:
\[ 0.02 \times 300 = 6 \]

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of the jar:**
   The jar has a square base with dimensions 6 inches by 6 inches and a height of 15 inches.
   \[
   \text{Volume of the jar} = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans:**
   Given the packing efficiency is 80%, the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans is:
   \[
   \text{Effective volume} = \text{Volume of the jar} \times \text{Packing efficiency} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of jelly beans that fit in the jar:**
   Each jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches.
   \[
   \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{\text{Effective volume}}{\text{Volume per jelly bean}} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of red jelly beans:**
   Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red.
   \[
   \text{Number of red jelly beans} = 0.30 \times \text{Total number of jelly beans} = 0.30 \times 2880 = 864

Therefore, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is 20."
"To determine how much Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to break down the problem into steps.

1. **Initial Cost per Visit:**
   The initial cost of one visit to the museum is $2.

2. **Cost Increase:**
   After 5 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%. To find the new cost, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{New Cost} = \text{Initial Cost} + (\text{Initial Cost} \times 150\%)
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Cost} = 2 + (2 \times 1.5) = 2 + 3 = 5
   \]
   So, the new cost per visit is $5.

3. **Total Visits Over 5 Years:**
   Pauline visits the museum three times a year for 5 years:
   \[
   \text{Total Visits in 5 Years} = 3 \times 5 = 15
   \]

4. **Total Cost for 5 Years:**
   The total cost for the visits over the first 5 years is:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost for 5 Years} = 15 \times 2 = 30
   \]

5. **Total Visits Over Next 3 Years:**
   Pauline continued to visit the museum for 3 more years, still three times a year:

"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, so the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find the value of \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece:

\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet."
"To determine how much of his secret seasoning Aiden will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many pounds of meat are needed to make 80 meatballs.
2. Calculate the amount of secret seasoning needed based on the amount of meat.

First, we know that Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat. To find out how many pounds of meat are needed for 80 meatballs, we divide the number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound:

\[ \text{Pounds of meat needed} = \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds of meat} \]

Next, we know that Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of his secret seasoning for every pound of ground beef. Therefore, for 5 pounds of meat, the amount of seasoning needed is:

"To find the final price of the toy after the price changes, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price of the toy in December after an 80% increase.
2. Calculate the price of the toy in January after a 50% decrease from the December price.

**Step 1: Calculate the price in December.**

The original price of the toy in November was $40. In December, the price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we calculate 80% of $40 and add it to the original price.

\[ \text{Increase in December} = 40 \times \frac{80}{100} = 40 \times 0.8 = 32 \]

So, the price in December is:

\[ 40 + 32 = 72 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the price in January.**

In January, the price decreased by 50% from the December price. To find the new price, we calculate 50% of $72 and subtract it from the December price.

\[ \text{Decrease in January} = 72 \times \frac{50}{100} = 72 \times 0.5 = 36 \]

So, the price in January is:

\[ 72 - 36 = 36 \]

The final price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"To calculate the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to consider both the standard lessons and the lessons given to veterans.

First, let's calculate the earnings from the standard lessons:
- Charlie has 4 lessons at his standard rate of $80 per hour.
- The total for these lessons is \(4 \times 80 = 320\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the earnings from the lessons given to veterans:
- Charlie has 2 lessons at a reduced rate of 75% of the standard rate (since he reduces his rate by 25% for veterans).
- The reduced rate is \(80 \times 0.75 = 60\) dollars per hour.
- The total for these lessons is \(2 \times 60 = 120\) dollars.

Now, we add the earnings from both types of lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day:

\]

Next, Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. We calculate 25% of 36:

\[
0.25 \times 36 = 9 \text{ apples}
\]

So, the number of apples remaining after giving 9 apples to his sister is:

\[
36 - 9 = 27 \text{ apples}
\]

Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. The total amount of money he received is:

"To find the percentage of the distance Michael has covered, we first need to calculate the total distance he travels in 3 days.

Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr. There are 24 hours in a day, so in 3 days, the total number of hours is:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 72 \text{ hours} \]

The total distance Michael travels in 72 hours at 50 km/hr is:
\[ 72 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ km/hr} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

The distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. To find the percentage of the total distance that Michael has covered, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{\text{Distance covered}}{\text{Total distance}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 0.6 \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the distance Michael has covered is 60%."
"First, let's determine the number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother to make the grape juice.

Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother used up 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so:
\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ grapes} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother:
\[ 6 + 30 = 36 \text{ grapes} \]

Their mother then used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. Each pie recipe calls for 12 grapes, so the total number of grapes used for the pies is:
\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ grapes} \]

Since the total number of grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and their mother is the sum of the grapes they used, we can set up the following equation to find the initial number of grapes:
\[ 36 + 48 = 84 \text{ grapes} \]

Therefore, the initial number of grapes at the beginning is:
\[ 84 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms. Since it takes 15 minutes per classroom, the total time required is:

\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert the total time into hours because the workday is given in hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 1200 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

The custodian works 8 hours per day. To find out how many days it will take to complete the cleaning, we divide the total hours required by the hours worked per day:

\[ 20 \text{ hours} \div 8 \text{ hours/day} = 2.5 \text{ days} \]

Since the custodian has 5 days to complete the cleaning, they will have 2.5 days to clean all the classrooms, which is within the given timeframe.

Now, to find out what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning classrooms, we need to calculate the total time spent cleaning per day and then find the percentage of that time relative to the 8-hour workday.

Since the total time required is 20 hours and they have 5 days to complete it, the average time spent cleaning per day is:

\[ 20 \text{ hours} \div 5 \text{ days} = 4 \text{ hours/day} \]

To find the percentage of the day spent cleaning, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent cleaning per day}}{\text{Total hours in a workday}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{4 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the custodian spends 50% of their day, on average, cleaning classrooms."
"First, let's determine the capacity of each shelf:

- Each of the middle shelves can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase:

- The total capacity of one bookcase is the sum of the capacities of all the shelves: \(10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books.

Given that Elly has 110 books, we need to determine how many bookcases are required to hold all of them:

- The number of bookcases needed is the total number of books divided by the capacity of one bookcase: \(110 \div 55 = 2\).

Therefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs Rose bought. She bought five dozens of eggs at $2.40 per dozen.

Total cost = 5 dozens * $2.40/dozen = $12.00

Next, let's determine the total number of eggs Rose bought. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:

Total eggs = 5 dozens * 12 eggs/dozen = 60 eggs

Now, let's find out how much Rose will earn by selling the eggs. She sells the eggs at $1 for 3 eggs. Therefore, the price per egg is:

Price per egg = $1 / 3 eggs = $0.3333 (repeating)

Total earnings from selling 60 eggs:

Total earnings = 60 eggs * $0.3333 (repeating)/egg = $20.00 (approximately)

Finally, to find Rose's profit, we subtract the total cost from the total earnings:

Profit = Total earnings - Total cost = $20.00 - $12.00 = $8.00

So, Rose's profit is $8.00."
"To determine the number of white hats Skyler has, we can follow these steps:

1. **Total Hats**: Skyler has 100 hats in total.

2. **Red Hats**: Half of the hats are red.
   \[
   \text{Number of red hats} = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50
   \]

3. **Remaining Hats After Red Hats**: Subtract the number of red hats from the total number of hats.
   \[
   \text{Remaining hats} = 100 - 50 = 50
   \]

4. **Blue Hats**: 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue.
   \[
   \text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]

5. **White Hats**: The rest of the hats are white. Subtract the number of red and blue hats from the remaining hats.
   \[
   \text{Number of white hats} = 50 - 30 = 20
   \]

Therefore, the number of white hats Skyler has is 20."
"First, let's determine the cost of the beef jerky after the discount. The original price of the bag is $18.00, and there is a $3.00 discount. So, the price Archie will pay is:

\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many sticks of beef jerky are in the bag. Since each bag contains 30 sticks, we can calculate the cost per stick by dividing the total cost by the number of sticks:

\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

The cost per stick is $0.50, which is equivalent to 50 cents. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 50 \]"
"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to calculate how many questions she answered correctly on the first test.

The first test has 70 questions, and she gets 60% of them correct:
\[ 70 \times 0.60 = 42 \]
So, Audrey got 42 questions correct on the first test.

To pass 6th grade, she needs to correctly answer 70% of the total questions. The total number of questions across both tests is:
\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]
To pass, she needs to answer 70% of 110 questions correctly:
\[ 110 \times 0.70 = 77 \]
This means she needs to get 77 questions correct in total to pass.

Since she already got 42 questions correct on the first test, the number of questions she needs to get correct on the second test is:
\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]
So, Audrey needs to get 35 questions correct on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 35 \]"
"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, which can be written as:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

The total number of ice cubes is the sum of the strawberry and blueberry cubes, which is given as 116:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:
\[ S = 20 \]

Now, substituting \( S = 20 \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

So, Mary makes 96 blueberry cubes."

"To determine how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we can break down the problem into the steps provided by the historical averages.

1. **Determine the number of customers needed to sell 15 cars:**
   - For every 2 cars sold, 1 customer comes in.
   - Therefore, for 15 cars, the number of customers needed is:
     \[
     \frac{15 \text{ cars}}{2 \text{ cars/customer}} = 7.5 \text{ customers}
     \]
   - Since Jason can't have half a customer, we round up to the next whole number, which is 8 customers.

2. **Determine the number of telephone calls needed to get 8 customers:**
   - For every 25 telephone calls, 1 customer comes in.
   - Therefore, the number of telephone calls needed to get 8 customers is:
     \[
     8 \text{ customers} \times 25 \text{ calls/customer} = 200 \text{ calls}
     \]

So, Jason needs to make 200 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Number of people**: There are 4 people in the house, including Brianna.
2. **Number of flashlights**: There is a flashlight for every person, so there are 4 flashlights. Additionally, there are 2 flashlights for each room. Since there are 8 rooms, there are \(8 \times 2 = 16\) flashlights for the rooms. Therefore, the total number of flashlights is \(4 + 16 = 20\).
3. **Number of rooms**: There are 8 rooms in the house.
4. **Number of small candles**: There are 4 small candles for half the rooms. Half of 8 rooms is 4 rooms, so there are \(4 \times 4 = 16\) small candles.
5. **Number of medium candles**: There are 5 medium candles for the other half of the rooms. Half of 8 rooms is 4 rooms, so there are \(4 \times 5 = 20\) medium candles.
6. **Total number of candles and flashlights**: Adding the total number of flashlights and candles together, we get \(20 + 16 + 20 = 56\).

Therefore, the total number of candles and flashlights Brianna's family is using when the lights go out is 56."
"To determine how many chips each person gets, we first need to calculate the total number of chips Mitchell bought. He bought two bags of chips, with each bag containing 55 chips.

First, we calculate the total number of chips:
\[ 2 \text{ bags} \times 55 \text{ chips per bag} = 110 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we need to divide the total number of chips equally among the five family members. We do this by dividing the total number of chips by the number of family members:

"To solve this, let's break down the time it takes John to solve each side of the Rubik's cube:

1. The first side takes 5 minutes.
2. The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so each takes \(5 \times 2 = 10\) minutes.
3. The fourth and fifth sides each take half as long as the first side, so each takes \(5 \div 2 = 2.5\) minutes.

Now, let's add up the time for all sides:

- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes

"To determine the total cost of the phone plan, we need to calculate the cost of the additional phones and then add it to the cost of the main phone.

Given:
- The main phone costs $20.
- The main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone.

Let's denote the cost of each additional phone as \( x \). Therefore, the main phone costs \( 2x \). Since the main phone costs $20, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2x = 20 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

So, each additional phone costs $10.

There are five phones in total, with one being the main phone and the other four being additional phones. The cost of the additional phones is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Now, we add the cost of the main phone to the cost of the additional phones to find the total cost of the phone plan:

"To determine how far Elvis is from his house, we need to calculate the distance he traveled west and the distance he traveled east, and then find the net distance from his starting point.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled west:
- Elvis drives west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance west = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled east:
- Elvis drives east for 8 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance east = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles

Now, we need to find the net distance from his starting point. Since he traveled west first and then east, we subtract the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east:
- Net distance = Distance east - Distance west
- Net distance = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

Therefore, Elvis is 54 miles from his house now."

- Total of red, orange, and yellow candies = 54 (red) + 108 (orange) + 27 (yellow) = 189

The total number of candies in the bag is 232. To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:
- Pink candies = Total candies - (Red candies + Orange candies + Yellow candies)
- Pink candies = 232 - 189 = 43

Therefore, the number of pink candies is 43."
"To calculate the total cost Helen paid for the hotel and bus travels during her trip, we need to break down the costs step by step.

First, let's calculate the cost for the hotel:
- Helen stayed for 3 nights.
- The cost for one night at the hotel is $80.
- Therefore, the total cost for the hotel is \(3 \times 80 = 240\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the bus travels:
- Helen rode the bus 7 times.
- The cost for one bus trip is 10% of the price of one night at the hotel.
- The cost for one bus trip is \(0.10 \times 80 = 8\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the bus travels is \(7 \times 8 = 56\) dollars.

Now, we add the total cost for the hotel and the total cost for the bus travels to find the final amount Helen paid:
- Total cost for the hotel: $240
- Total cost for the bus travels: $56
- Therefore, the final amount Helen paid is \(240 + 56 = 296\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
296"
"First, let's determine how many marbles Dallas has after dropping 4 of them in the playground. Dallas originally had 21 marbles and dropped 4, so:

\[ 21 - 4 = 17 \]

This means Dallas has 17 marbles after the drop. Since Dallas and Darla together received all 52 marbles from Mazie, we can find out how many marbles Darla received by subtracting the number of marbles Dallas has from the total number of marbles:

\[ 52 - 17 = 35 \]

Therefore, the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla is:

\[ 35 \]"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to add the cost of the tickets and the cost of the popcorns.

First, let's calculate the cost of the tickets:
- The cost of an adult ticket is $12, and there are 2 adults, so the cost for the adult tickets is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dollars.
- The cost of a child ticket is $8, and there is 1 child, so the cost for the child ticket is \(1 \times 8 = 8\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the tickets is \(24 + 8 = 32\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the popcorns:
- Each popcorn costs $3, and they buy 2 popcorns, so the total cost for the popcorns is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) dollars.

Finally, we add the cost of the tickets and the cost of the popcorns to find the total amount paid:
- The total cost is \(32 + 6 = 38\) dollars.

So, the family pays a total of 38 dollars."
"First, we need to calculate the total weight of the car and its contents. The car weighs 1200 pounds and the luggage weighs 250 pounds. John also has two children, each weighing 75 pounds, so the total weight of the children is \(2 \times 75 = 150\) pounds. Adding these together gives the total weight:

\[1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 \text{ pounds}\]

The force required to move the car is 1% of its total weight. To find 1% of 1600 pounds, we calculate:

\[0.01 \times 1600 = 16 \text{ pounds}\]

So, the force John needs to push the car is:

\[\boxed{16}\]"
"To determine how many feet of crepe paper James needs to buy, we need to calculate the perimeter of his rectangular backyard fence. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the fence:
- Length (\( l \)) = 20 feet
- Width (\( w \)) = 15 feet

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (20 + 15) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 35 \]
\[ P = 70 \]

Therefore, James needs to buy 70 feet of crepe paper."
"To find the average of their ages, we first need to determine Emma's age. Since Mia is 40 years old and they are 16 years apart in age, Emma is 40 + 16 = 56 years old.

Now, we can calculate the average of their ages. The average is found by adding their ages together and then dividing by 2.

So, the sum of their ages is 40 + 56 = 96.

The average of their ages is 96 / 2 = 48.

The final numerical answer is 48."
"To find the total number of good seashells, we first need to determine the total number of seashells found by Tom, Nancy, and Benny, and then subtract the number of cracked seashells.

Tom found 214 seashells.
Nancy found 432 seashells.
Benny found 86 seashells.

The total number of seashells found is:
\[ 214 + 432 + 86 \]

Let's calculate the sum:
\[ 214 + 432 = 646 \]
\[ 646 + 86 = 732 \]

So, they found a total of 732 seashells. Since 67 of these were cracked, the number of good seashells is:
\[ 732 - 67 \]

Now, let's calculate the number of good seashells:
\[ 732 - 67 = 665 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 665 \]"
"To calculate the total cost for the place settings, we need to determine the cost for one complete set (dinner plate, salad plate, and bowl) and then multiply by the number of people.

The cost for one complete set is:
- Dinner plate: $6.00
- Salad plate: $4.00
- Bowl: $5.00

Total cost for one set = $6.00 + $4.00 + $5.00 = $15.00

Since Avery is having 12 people over, she will need 12 sets.

Total cost for 12 sets = 12 * $15.00 = $180.00

The final numerical answer is $180.00."

"To determine how many pounds of feed are left after a week, we need to calculate the total amount of feed consumed by the pigs over that period.

First, let's find out how much feed one pig eats in a day:
- Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day.
- Therefore, one pig eats \(4 \times 2 = 8\) pounds of feed per day.

Next, we calculate the total feed consumption for all five pigs in one day:
- Five pigs eat \(8 \times 5 = 40\) pounds of feed per day.

Now, we find out how much feed all five pigs consume in a week (7 days):
- In a week, the pigs consume \(40 \times 7 = 280\) pounds of feed.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. To find out how much feed is left after a week, we subtract the total feed consumed from the initial amount:
- The remaining feed is \(300 - 280 = 20\) pounds.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
20"
"First, we need to calculate the total number of hot dogs required for the party. John invited 20 people and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs, so:

\[ 20 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ hot dogs/guest} = 40 \text{ hot dogs} \]

John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party, so we subtract these from the total required:

\[ 40 \text{ hot dogs} - 4 \text{ hot dogs} = 36 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Next, we need to determine how many packs of hot dogs John needs to buy. Each pack contains 6 hot dogs, so we divide the number of hot dogs needed by the number of hot dogs per pack:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ hot dogs}}{6 \text{ hot dogs/pack}} = 6 \text{ packs} \]

Each pack costs $2, so the total cost for the packs is:

\[ 6 \text{ packs} \times 2 \text{ dollars/pack} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, John needs to spend $12 on hot dogs."
"First, let's calculate the total money Frances earns from selling cupcakes and cookies.

For cupcakes:
20 cupcakes * $2/cupcake = $40

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Street**: There are 5 children.
2. **Second Street**: Each of the 5 children is joined by another child. Therefore, the number of children becomes \(5 + 5 = 10\).
3. **Third Street**: Each of the 10 children is joined by another 2 children. Therefore, the number of children becomes \(10 + (10 \times 2) = 10 + 20 = 30\).

On the third street, the original 5 children give up and leave the group. So, we subtract these 5 children from the total of 30 children.

The final number of children following the truck is \(30 - 5 = 25\).

The final numerical answer is:
25"
"To find out how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to subtract the total number of meals she has already given out from the total number of meals she has to distribute.

First, let's calculate the total number of meals given out:
- Meals given out on Friday: 64
- Meals given out on Saturday: 30
- Meals given out on Sunday: 48

Total meals given out = 64 + 30 + 48

Now, let's add these numbers:
64 + 30 = 94
94 + 48 = 142

So, Mamou has given out 142 meals in total.

Now, we subtract the total meals given out from the total meals to be distributed:
1,360 - 142 = 1,218

Therefore, the number of meals Mamou has left to distribute is 1,218."
"To determine the total amount of money James has, we need to convert each type of coin into cents and then sum them up.

- A quarter is worth 25 cents.
- A nickel is worth 5 cents.
- A dime is worth 10 cents.

James has:
- 1 quarter = 25 cents
- 2 nickels = 2 * 5 = 10 cents
- 7 dimes = 7 * 10 = 70 cents

25 cents (quarter) + 10 cents (nickels) + 70 cents (dimes) = 105 cents

So, the final numerical answer is 105."
"To find the total age of all the siblings, we need to add up the ages of the 2 brothers and 3 sisters.

We know the ages of the sisters:
- The first sister is 16 years old.
- The second sister is also 16 years old.

So, the total age of the sisters is:
\[ 16 + 16 = 32 \]

We know the age of one of the brothers is 12 years old. The problem states that this age is half the age of the older brother. Therefore, the age of the older brother is:
\[ 12 \times 2 = 24 \]

So, the total age of the brothers is:

"To calculate the total time Charisma has spent on meditation and yoga practice over 4 weeks, we need to break down the activities and their durations.

First, let's calculate the time spent on meditation each day:
- Meditation time: 15 minutes each time
- Number of meditation sessions per day: 2
- Total meditation time per day: 15 minutes * 2 = 30 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time spent on yoga each week:
- Yoga time: 1 hour per session
- Number of yoga sessions per week: 5
- Total yoga time per week: 1 hour * 5 = 5 hours

Now, we need to convert all times to the same unit for easier calculation. Let's use minutes:
- Total yoga time per week in minutes: 5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 300 minutes

Now, let's calculate the total time spent on meditation and yoga over 4 weeks:
- Total meditation time per day in minutes: 30 minutes
- Number of days per week: 7
- Total meditation time per week in minutes: 30 minutes * 7 = 210 minutes
- Total meditation time over 4 weeks in minutes: 210 minutes * 4 = 840 minutes

Finally, we add the total meditation time over 4 weeks to the total yoga time over 4 weeks:
- Total time spent on meditation/yoga practice over 4 weeks: 840 minutes + 300 minutes = 1140 minutes

To convert the total time back to hours:

Therefore, the total square footage of the quilt is 101 square feet."
"First, let's determine the number of seeds in a large sunflower. A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since one dozen equals 12, a small sunflower has:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds} \]

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36 seeds, we calculate:

\[ 0.50 \times 36 = 18 \text{ seeds} \]

Adding this to the 36 seeds of the small sunflower gives us the number of seeds in a large sunflower:

\[ 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds} \]

Now, to find the total number of seeds in both a small and a large sunflower, we add the seeds from both:

\[ 36 + 54 = 90 \text{ seeds} \]

So, the total number of sunflower seeds altogether is:

\[ 90 \]"

"To calculate the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars of the honey and jam mix, we need to first determine the cost of ingredients for one jar and then calculate the profit per jar. Finally, we will multiply the profit per jar by 10 to find the total profit for 10 jars.

1. **Cost of ingredients for one jar:**
   - Passion fruit: 2 pounds at $6 per pound = 2 * $6 = $12
   - Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds at $8 per pound = 1.5 * $8 = $12
   - Special honey: 2 pounds at $10 per pound = 2 * $10 = $20

2. **Total cost for one jar:**
   - Total cost = Cost of passion fruit + Cost of jackfruit + Cost of honey
   - Total cost = $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

3. **Profit per jar:**
   - Selling price per jar = $50
   - Profit per jar = Selling price - Total cost
   - Profit per jar = $50 - $44 = $6

4. **Total profit for 10 jars:**
   - Total profit = Profit per jar * Number of jars
   - Total profit = $6 * 10 = $60

"First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate returns, the dog continues to dig 6 holes a day, but Nate starts filling in 9 holes a day. The net effect is that 3 holes are filled each day (since 9 holes are filled minus 6 holes are dug):

\[ 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/day} = 3 \text{ holes/day filled} \]

Now, we need to determine how many days it will take to fill in all 84 holes. Since 3 holes are filled each day, we divide the total number of holes by the number of holes filled per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

To find out how many weeks it takes, we divide the number of days by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws per leg} = 8 \text{ screws per table} \]

James is assembling 4 tables, so the total number of screws needed for all the tables is:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws per table} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the number of screws he has:
\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

So, the number of screws James will have left over is:
\[ 8 \]"
"If there are 10 eggs in the first basket, then there are 2 * 10 = 20 eggs in the second basket. Therefore, the total number of eggs in both baskets is 10 + 20 = 30.

The final numerical answer is 30."
"First, let's determine how much money each person raised individually.

Alexandra raised $430.

Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so:
\[ \text{Kim's amount} = \text{Alexandra's amount} + 320 = 430 + 320 = 750 \]

Sarah raised $300.

Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so:
\[ \text{Maryam's amount} = \text{Sarah's amount} + 400 = 300 + 400 = 700 \]

Now, let's add up the total amount of money raised by all of them:
\[ \text{Total amount} = \text{Alexandra's amount} + \text{Kim's amount} + \text{Sarah's amount} + \text{Maryam's amount} \]
\[ \text{Total amount} = 430 + 750 + 300 + 700 \]

Adding these amounts together:
\[ 430 + 750 = 1180 \]
\[ 1180 + 300 = 1480 \]
\[ 1480 + 700 = 2180 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they all raised is:
\[ 2180 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2180 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Aaron's speed:**
   - Let's assume Aaron's speed is \( v \) miles per minute.
   - Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed is \( \frac{v}{2} \) miles per minute.

2. **Determine the distance Vanessa ran:**
   - We are given that Vanessa ran 4 miles.

3. **Determine the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles:**
   - Time is calculated as distance divided by speed.
   - Vanessa's speed is \( \frac{v}{2} \) miles per minute.
   - Therefore, the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles is:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{\frac{v}{2} \text{ miles per minute}} = \frac{4 \times 2}{v} = \frac{8}{v} \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Determine Aaron's distance:**
   - We know that Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron.
   - Therefore, Aaron ran \( \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{2} = 2 \text{ miles} \).

5. **Determine Aaron's time:**
   - Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.
   - Aaron's speed is \( v \) miles per minute.
   - Therefore, the time Aaron took to run 2 miles is:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{v \text{ miles per minute}} = \frac{2}{v} \text{ minutes}
     \]

6. **Relate Aaron's and Vanessa's times:**
   - Since Aaron and Vanessa were relay race partners, the total time for their part of the race is the sum of their individual times.
   - Given that Aaron's time is 16 minutes, we have:
     \[
     \frac{2}{v} + \frac{8}{v} = 16
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     \frac{10}{v} = 16
     \]
   - Solve for \( v \):
     \[
     v = \frac{10}{16} = \frac{5}{8} \text{ miles per minute}
     \]

7. **Calculate Vanessa's time:**
   - Vanessa's speed is \( \frac{v}{2} = \frac{\frac{5}{8}}{2} = \frac{5}{16} \text{ miles per minute} \).
   - Vanessa's time to run 4 miles is:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{\frac{5}{16} \text{ miles per minute}} = 4 \times \frac{16}{5} = \frac{64}{5} = 12.8 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, Vanessa took 12.8 minutes to complete her part of the race."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of line needed based on the current dock length. The caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. With 200 feet of dock, the total line needed is:

\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Next, we need to determine how much more line the caretaker needs to buy. He currently has 6 feet of new line. Therefore, the additional line required is:

\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

So, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"To determine how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, calculate the cost of the meals and wine per reservation:
- Each reservation includes 2 meals at $5 each and 1 bottle of wine at $5.
- The total cost per reservation is \(2 \times 5 + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15\) dollars.

Next, calculate the total cost per night:
- The restaurant gets 6 reservations per night.
- The total cost per night is \(6 \times 15 = 90\) dollars.

Now, calculate the total cost per week:
- The restaurant is open 2 days a week.
- The total cost per week is \(2 \times 90 = 180\) dollars.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
180"
"First, let's calculate the total selling price of the watermelons. The vendor made a profit of 25% on the cost price. The cost price for 50 watermelons is $80.

To find the selling price, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Selling Price} = \text{Cost Price} + (\text{Profit Percentage} \times \text{Cost Price}) \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ \text{Selling Price} = 80 + (0.25 \times 80) \]
\[ \text{Selling Price} = 80 + 20 \]
\[ \text{Selling Price} = 100 \]

This is the total selling price for all 50 watermelons. To find the selling price per watermelon, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:
\[ \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{100}{50} \]
\[ \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = 2 \]

So, each watermelon was sold for $2."
"First, let's determine James's current age. Since Dora will be 12 in 3 years, she is currently 9 years old. James is now twice as old as Dora, so James is currently 2 * 9 = 18 years old.

John had James when he was 19, so John is currently 19 + 18 = 37 years old.

Now, let's find out how old John's youngest son is. The youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest son is currently 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, the youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

The final numerical answer is 8."
"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in that time.

First, let's find out how many oranges each can peel in one minute:
- Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in one minute, she peels \( \frac{1}{3} \) of an orange.
- Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in one minute, she peels \( \frac{1}{4} \) of an orange.

Next, we calculate how many oranges each can peel in one hour (60 minutes):
- In one hour, Ana peels \( 60 \times \frac{1}{3} = 20 \) oranges.
- In one hour, Jane peels \( 60 \times \frac{1}{4} = 15 \) oranges.

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane in one hour:
- The difference is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \).

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

The final numerical answer is:
5"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400, and Mark gets it at 80% off.

The discount amount is:
\[ 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \]

So, the cost of the radiator after the discount is:
\[ 400 - 320 = 80 \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost of hiring the mechanic to install the radiator. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.

The cost for the mechanic is:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator after the discount to the cost of hiring the mechanic to find the total amount Mark paid:
\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

Therefore, the total amount Mark paid is:
\[ 230 \]"
"Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( Co \).

We know that:
1. Each chicken has 2 legs.
2. Each cow has 4 legs.
3. The total number of animals is 20.
4. The total number of legs is 70.

From the information given, we can set up the following equations:
\[ C + Co = 20 \]
\[ 2C + 4Co = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2Co = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + Co = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2Co = 35 \)

To solve this system, we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (C + 2Co) - (C + Co) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ C + 2Co - C - Co = 15 \]
\[ Co = 15 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can substitute \( Co = 15 \) back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 20 - 15 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is 5."
"First, we need to determine the total number of slices available from the 7 pizzas. Since each pizza is cut into 8 slices, we can calculate the total number of slices as follows:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to share these 56 slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends, which makes a total of 4 people. To find out how many slices each person can have, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people:

\[ \frac{56 \text{ slices}}{4 \text{ people}} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

So, each of them can have 14 slices. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 14 \]"
