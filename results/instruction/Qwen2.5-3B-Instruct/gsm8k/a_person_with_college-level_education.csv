"First, let's determine how many eggs Janet has left after eating and using some for baking.

Janet starts with 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 eggs for baking muffins. So, the number of eggs left for sale is:

\[ 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 \]

Janet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg. Therefore, the total amount she makes every day is:

\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 18 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of fiber required for both the blue and white fibers and then sum them up.

1. The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.
2. The robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber, which means it takes \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) bolt of white fiber.

Now, we add the bolts of blue and white fiber together:
\[ 2 \text{ bolts (blue)} + 1 \text{ bolt (white)} = 3 \text{ bolts} \]

So, the total number of bolts required is 3.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"First, we need to calculate the new value of the house after the repairs and the increase in value.

The initial value of the house is $80,000. Josh adds $50,000 in repairs, so the total cost before the increase is:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

The value of the house increases by 150%. To find the increase in value, we calculate 150% of $130,000:
\[ 130,000 \times 1.5 = 195,000 \]

Adding this increase to the original total cost gives the new value of the house:
\[ 130,000 + 195,000 = 325,000 \]

The profit Josh made is the new value of the house minus the total amount he spent (the purchase price plus the repairs):
\[ 325,000 - 130,000 = 195,000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 195,000 \]"
"To determine the total number of meters James runs in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the total distance James runs in one sprint.
2. Calculate the total distance James runs in one day (3 sprints).
3. Calculate the total distance James runs in a week (3 days).

Step 1: James runs 60 meters in each sprint.
Step 2: Since he runs 3 sprints a day, the distance he runs in one day is:
\[ 60 \, \text{meters/sprint} \times 3 \, \text{sprints/day} = 180 \, \text{meters/day} \]

Step 3: Since he runs 3 times a week, the distance he runs in a week is:
\[ 180 \, \text{meters/day} \times 3 \, \text{days/week} = 540 \, \text{meters/week} \]

Therefore, the total number of meters James runs in a week is 540 meters."
"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she gives her flock in the morning and afternoon.

Wendi gives each chicken 3 cups of feed per meal. She has a flock of 20 chickens.

In the morning, she gives 15 cups of feed. Since each chicken gets 3 cups, the number of chickens fed in the morning is:
\[ \frac{15 \text{ cups}}{3 \text{ cups per chicken}} = 5 \text{ chickens} \]

In the afternoon, she gives 25 cups of feed. The number of chickens fed in the afternoon is:
\[ \frac{25 \text{ cups}}{3 \text{ cups per chicken}} = 8.33 \text{ chickens} \]

Since the number of chickens must be a whole number, we can infer that 8 chickens are fed 24 cups and the remaining 2 chickens are fed 1 cup (since 8 chickens * 3 cups/chicken = 24 cups and 2 chickens * 1 cup/chicken = 2 cups, totaling 26 cups).

Now, we need to find out how much feed is left for the final meal. The total feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Since the total feed required for 20 chickens is:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups per chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

The amount of feed needed for the final meal is:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Thus, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:
\[ 20 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of 16 glasses, considering the pricing structure.

1. The first glass costs $5.
2. Every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $5 * 0.60 = $3.

So, for every pair of glasses, the cost is $5 (first glass) + $3 (second glass) = $8.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can pair them up into 8 pairs (16 glasses / 2 glasses per pair = 8 pairs).

The total cost for 8 pairs of glasses is 8 pairs * $8 per pair = $64.

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses."
"To solve this problem, we will first determine the number of sheep in each city based on the given relationships and the number of sheep in Seattle.

1. Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. Therefore, Charleston has \(4 \times 20 = 80\) sheep.
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Therefore, Toulouse has \(2 \times 80 = 160\) sheep.

Now, we will sum the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle to find the total number of sheep.

\[
\text{Total number of sheep} = \text{Number of sheep in Toulouse} + \text{Number of sheep in Charleston} + \text{Number of sheep in Seattle}
\]
\[
\text{Total number of sheep} = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260
\]

The final numerical answer is 260."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the time taken for each part of the download.

1. **First 40% of the file:**
   - The file size is 200 GB.
   - 40% of 200 GB is \(0.40 \times 200 = 80\) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \(80 \div 2 = 40\) minutes.

2. **Windows update installation:**
   - This takes 20 minutes.

3. **Restarting the download:**
   - After the update, Carla has to start the download from the beginning.
   - The remaining 60% of the file is \(0.60 \times 200 = 120\) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 120 GB is \(120 \div 2 = 60\) minutes.

Now, we sum up the time for each part:
- Time for the first 40%: 40 minutes
- Time for the update installation: 20 minutes
- Time for the remaining 60%: 60 minutes

Total time = \(40 + 20 + 60 = 120\) minutes.

The final numerical answer is 120 minutes."
"To determine how far John is from home at the end of 4 hours, we need to break down his journey into segments and calculate the distance for each segment.

1. **First Segment:**
   - Time: 3 hours
   - Speed: 60 mph
   - Distance: \(3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ mph} = 180 \text{ miles}\)

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Time: 2 hours (in traffic)
   - Speed: 0 mph
   - Distance: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 0 \text{ mph} = 0 \text{ miles}\)

3. **Third Segment:**
   - Time: 0.5 hours
   - Speed: 30 mph
   - Distance: \(0.5 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ miles}\)

4. **Fourth Segment:**
   - Time: 3.5 hours (since the total time is 4 hours and the first 2.5 hours are accounted for)
   - Speed: 80 mph
   - Distance: \(3.5 \text{ hours} \times 80 \text{ mph} = 280 \text{ miles}\)

Now, we sum up the distances from all segments to find the total distance traveled:
\[180 \text{ miles} + 0 \text{ miles} + 15 \text{ miles} + 280 \text{ miles} = 475 \text{ miles}\]

Therefore, at the end of those 4 hours, John is \(\boxed{475}\) miles from home."
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break it down into regular hours and overtime hours.

First, we calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours at her regular rate:
\[ \text{Regular earnings} = 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \]

Next, we calculate her earnings for the 5 overtime hours at her overtime rate. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate:
\[ \text{Overtime rate} = 1.2 \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$12/\text{hour} \]
\[ \text{Overtime earnings} = 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

Now, we add the regular earnings and the overtime earnings to find her total earnings for the week:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \]

So, Eliza's total earnings for the week are:
\[ \boxed{460} \]"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the number of downloads for each month and then sum them up.

1. **First Month:**
   The number of downloads in the first month is given as 60.

2. **Second Month:**
   The number of downloads in the second month is three times the number of downloads in the first month.
   \[
   \text{Downloads in the second month} = 3 \times 60 = 180
   \]

3. **Third Month:**
   The number of downloads in the third month is 30% less than the number of downloads in the second month.
   \[
   \text{Downloads in the third month} = 180 - (0.30 \times 180) = 180 - 54 = 126
   \]

4. **Total Downloads Over Three Months:**
   \[
   \text{Total downloads} = \text{Downloads in the first month} + \text{Downloads in the second month} + \text{Downloads in the third month}

The total number of downloads over the three months is 366."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts:
- Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
- Each dozen of donuts costs $68.
- Therefore, the cost for the donuts is \(3 \times 68 = 204\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:
- Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
- Each dozen of mini cupcakes costs $80.
- Therefore, the cost for the mini cupcakes is \(2 \times 80 = 160\) dollars.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes:
- Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
- Each dozen of mini cheesecakes costs $55.
- Therefore, the cost for the mini cheesecakes is \(6 \times 55 = 330\) dollars.

Now, we sum up the costs of all the pastries:
- Total cost = cost of donuts + cost of mini cupcakes + cost of mini cheesecakes
- Total cost = \(204 + 160 + 330 = 694\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
694"
"To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money from the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point at which this profit becomes positive.

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:
- Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons.
- Each lemon is sold for $1.5.
- Therefore, the annual revenue from lemons is \(7 \times 1.5 = 10.5\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the annual cost of maintaining the tree:
- The cost to water and feed the tree is $3 per year.

Now, we can find the net profit each year by subtracting the annual cost from the annual revenue:
- Net profit per year = Annual revenue - Annual cost
- Net profit per year = \(10.5 - 3 = 7.5\) dollars.

Since the initial cost to plant the tree is $90, we need to determine how many years it will take for the net profit to cover this initial cost.

Let \(n\) be the number of years it takes to start earning money. The total net profit after \(n\) years is \(7.5n\). We need this to be at least equal to the initial cost of $90:
\[7.5n \geq 90\]

Solving for \(n\):
\[n \geq \frac{90}{7.5} = 12\]

Therefore, it will take at least 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree. The final numerical answer is:
\[12\]"
"Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had as \( x \).

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

3. She then sold half of what was left at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]

4. According to the problem, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

Let's simplify the equation step by step:
\[
\frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
\]
\[
\frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2x}{3} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 = 5
\]
\[
\frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{x}{3} + 1 = 5
\]
\[
\frac{2x - x}{3} - 1 = 5
\]
\[
\frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5
\]
\[
\frac{x}{3} = 6
\]
\[
x = 18
\]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{18}

"First, let's determine the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \]

So, 4 students are enrolled in contemporary dance. This leaves:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \]

students remaining. Next, we calculate the number of students enrolled in jazz dance, which is 25% of the remaining 16 students:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \]

So, 4 students are enrolled in jazz dance. This leaves:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \]

students enrolled in hip-hop dance. To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance, we calculate:

\[ \frac{12}{20} \times 100\% = 0.60 \times 100\% = 60\% \]

Thus, the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance is 60%."
"To determine which purchase plan will maximize the profit, we need to calculate the future value of each item based on the expected market growth and then compare the profit from each plan.

For the jewelry:
- Current value: $5,000
- Expected growth: 2.5%

The future value of the jewelry can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Future Value of Jewelry} = \text{Current Value} \times (1 + \text{Growth Rate}) \]
\[ \text{Future Value of Jewelry} = 5000 \times (1 + 0.025) \]
\[ \text{Future Value of Jewelry} = 5000 \times 1.025 \]
\[ \text{Future Value of Jewelry} = 5125 \]

For the electronic gadgets:
- Current value: $8,000
- Expected growth: 1.2%

The future value of the electronic gadgets can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Future Value of Gadgets} = \text{Current Value} \times (1 + \text{Growth Rate}) \]
\[ \text{Future Value of Gadgets} = 8000 \times (1 + 0.012) \]
\[ \text{Future Value of Gadgets} = 8000 \times 1.012 \]
\[ \text{Future Value of Gadgets} = 8096 \]

Now, we calculate the profit for each plan:
- Profit from jewelry: \( \text{Future Value of Jewelry} - \text{Current Value} \)
\[ \text{Profit from Jewelry} = 5125 - 5000 = 125 \]

- Profit from electronic gadgets: \( \text{Future Value of Gadgets} - \text{Current Value} \)
\[ \text{Profit from Gadgets} = 8096 - 8000 = 96 \]

Comparing the profits:
- Profit from jewelry: $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets: $96

The merchant would maximize profit by choosing to purchase the jewelry, which would yield a profit of $125. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 125 \]"

2. The second day, the train travels 150 miles north.

The total distance covered by each train is the sum of these two distances:
\[ 80 \text{ miles} + 150 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 230 \]"
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to break down her earnings from both teaching and coaching and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her annual earnings from teaching:
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual teaching hours = 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year
Annual teaching earnings = 1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her annual earnings from coaching:
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual coaching hours = 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year
Annual coaching earnings = 750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year

Now, we sum up her annual earnings from both teaching and coaching:
Annual salary = Annual teaching earnings + Annual coaching earnings
Annual salary = $35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

The final numerical answer is $57,500."
"To determine how many dozens of eggs Claire will consume in 4 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs Claire uses per day.
2. Calculate the number of eggs Claire uses per week.
3. Calculate the number of eggs Claire uses in 4 weeks.
4. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.

Step 1: Claire uses 3 eggs per day.

Step 2: There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Step 3: Over 4 weeks:
\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Step 4: Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, we convert 84 eggs into dozens:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour over the entire 12-mile trail.

First, let's calculate the total time Marissa has already spent hiking:
- She spent 1 hour on the first 4 miles.
- She spent another 1 hour on the next 2 miles.
So, she has already spent 2 hours hiking.

Let's denote the remaining distance as \( x \) miles. The time taken to walk the remaining distance is \( \frac{x}{v} \) hours, where \( v \) is the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance.

The total distance is 12 miles, and she has already covered 6 miles (4 miles + 2 miles). Therefore, the remaining distance is \( 12 - 6 = 6 \) miles.

The total time for the entire hike should be such that the average speed is 4 miles per hour. The formula for average speed is:
\[ \text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} \]

Given that the average speed is 4 miles per hour, we can set up the equation:
\[ 4 = \frac{12}{\text{Total time}} \]

Solving for the total time:
\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already spent 2 hours, so the remaining time she needs to spend hiking is:
\[ 3 - 2 = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Now, we need to find the speed \( v \) for the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour:
\[ v = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Thus, Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles at a speed of 6 miles per hour to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour over the entire 12-mile trail.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \]"
"First, let's determine the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the amount of water in the orange drink is:

\[ \text{Water in orange drink} = 10 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ liters} \]

Next, let's determine the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is:

\[ \text{Water in pineapple drink} = 15 \times \frac{3}{5} = 9 \text{ liters} \]

After adding the orange drink to the pineapple drink, we have a total of 24 liters of mixture. However, we spill one liter of the orange drink, so the total volume of the mixture is:

\[ 24 - 1 = 23 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we need to find the total amount of water in the 23 liters of mixture. The total amount of water from the orange drink and the pineapple drink is:

\[ \text{Total water} = \frac{20}{3} + 9 = \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3} \text{ liters} \]

To find the percentage of water in the 23 liters of mixture, we calculate:

\[ \text{Percentage of water} = \left( \frac{\frac{47}{3}}{23} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{47}{3 \times 23} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{47}{69} \right) \times 100 = \frac{4700}{69} \approx 68.02 \text{ percent} \]

Therefore, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is approximately 68.02 liters. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 68.02 \]"
"First, let's determine Raymond's current age. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha and Samantha is currently 31 years old, Raymond is currently \(31 - 6 = 25\) years old.

Raymond had a son at the age of 23. Therefore, his son was born when Raymond was 23 years old. Since Raymond is currently 25 years old, his son was born \(25 - 23 = 2\) years ago.

"To determine the total number of DVDs Billy sold on Tuesday, we need to sum the number of DVDs bought by each group of customers.

- The first 3 customers each bought 1 DVD, so that's \(3 \times 1 = 3\) DVDs.
- The next 2 customers each bought 2 DVDs, so that's \(2 \times 2 = 4\) DVDs.
- The last 3 customers did not buy any DVDs, so that's \(3 \times 0 = 0\) DVDs.

Adding these together, the total number of DVDs sold is \(3 + 4 + 0 = 7\).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 7."
"To determine how many centimeters shorter the candle will be after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, we need to calculate the total burning time and then use the rate of melting to find the total decrease in length.

The time from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is 4 hours. Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, the total decrease in length over 4 hours is:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} \times 2 \text{ cm/hour} = 8 \text{ cm} \]

So, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"To find the original price of the book, we can set up an equation based on the information given. If the book was bought for $19.50 with a 25% discount, this means Kyle paid 75% of the original price (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \). According to the problem, 75% of \( P \) is $19.50. This can be written as:

\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we need to solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's perform the division:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 26 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered except for the boxes of pizza.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
The cost of 4 apples is \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Adding these costs together, we get:
\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\] dollars.

Marie paid a total of $50. If we subtract the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples from the total amount paid, we can find out how much she spent on the boxes of pizza:
\[50 - 33 = 17\] dollars.

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, we can determine the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered by dividing the amount spent on pizza by the cost per box:
\[17 \div 8.50 = 2\] boxes.

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza. The final numerical answer is:
\[2\]"
"To find out how much Mishka spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of each type of clothing item separately and then sum them up.

3 pairs * $16.50 per pair = $59.50

For the pants:
3 pairs * $22.50 per pair = $67.50

For the shoes:
3 pairs * $42 per pair = $126.00

Now, we add the costs together:
$59.50 + $67.50 + $126.00 = $253.00

So, Mishka spent $253.00 on all the clothing items."
"To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.
2. Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need to buy.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.**

Cynthia eats 1 serving of ice cream every night. There are 60 days in the period, so the total number of servings is:
\[ 1 \text{ serving/day} \times 60 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ servings} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need to buy.**

Each carton contains 15 servings. To find out how many cartons are needed for 60 servings, we divide the total servings by the servings per carton:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.**

Each carton costs $4.00. Therefore, the total cost for 4 cartons is:
\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To determine how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to calculate the distance from his first stop to his second stop.

Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, so the distance from the start to his first stop is 20 miles.

His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip is 60 miles, the distance to his second stop is:
\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \text{ miles} \]

The distance between his first and second stops is the difference between the distance to his second stop and the distance to his first stop:
\[ 45 - 20 = 25 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the number of miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops is:
\[ 25 \]"
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

The cost of the first pair of high heels is $33. The cost of the second pair of high heels is twice the cost of the first pair, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = 104 \]

So, the cost of the boots is \( 104 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{104} \]"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen based on the given ratio and total age.

Given:
- The ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11.
- The total age of Darrell and Allen is 162.

Let's denote Darrell's age as \(7x\) and Allen's age as \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The sum of their ages is:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]
\[18x = 162\]
\[x = \frac{162}{18}\]
\[x = 9\]

Now, we can find their current ages:
- Darrell's age: \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\)
- Allen's age: \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\)

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is:
\[109\]"
"To find the average guess, we first need to determine each friend's guess and then calculate the average of these guesses.

1. The first friend's guess is 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half the first friend's guess:
   \[
   \text{Second friend's guess} = \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60
   \]
3. The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess:
   \[
   \text{Third friend's guess} = 80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100
   \]

Now, we calculate the average of these guesses:
\[
\text{Average guess} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[

   0.5 \text{ hours/dog/day}
   \]

2. Calculate the total hours John spends on all 10 dogs per day:
   \[
   0.5 \text{ hours/dog/day} \times 10 \text{ dogs} = 5 \text{ hours/day}
   \]

3. Calculate the total hours John spends on all 10 dogs per week:
   \[
   5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week}
   \]

So, the total number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs in a week is:

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these as the following equations:
\[ G + S = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins \( S \) is 40, we can find the number of gold coins \( G \) using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 70 \]"
"First, let's determine how many jewels Aaron has. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Since Raymond has 40 jewels, we can calculate half of Raymond's jewels as follows:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Now, we add 5 to this number to find out how many jewels Aaron has:

\[
20 + 5 = 25
\]

Next, we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. The problem states that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Since Aaron has 25 jewels, we subtract 2 from this number to find out how many jewels Siobhan has:

\[
25 - 2 = 23
\]

Therefore, the number of jewels Siobhan has is:

\[
\boxed{23}

"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points he scores in the second 20 minutes, we calculate 25% of 4 points and add it to the original 4 points:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]
So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \text{ points} \]

Adding the points from both periods, the total number of points Mike scores is:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 9 \]"
"First, we need to determine the cost of one yogurt. Since 4 yogurts cost $5.00, the cost of one yogurt is:

\[
\text{Cost of one yogurt} = \frac{5.00}{4} = 1.25 \text{ dollars}
\]

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so the cost of 2 yogurts per day is:

\[
\text{Cost of 2 yogurts per day} = 2 \times 1.25 = 2.50 \text{ dollars}
\]

Over 30 days, the total cost for Terry to buy 2 yogurts each day is:

\[
\text{Total cost over 30 days} = 2.50 \times 30 = 75.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John makes from selling his lego sets. He has 13 lego sets and sells each for $15.

\[
\text{Total money from lego sets} = 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money John spends on the video games. He buys 8 video games for $20 each.

\[
\text{Total money spent on video games} = 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we can determine how much money John has left after buying the video games. We know he has $5 left after these purchases.

\[
\text{Money left} = 195 - 160 = 35 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since the problem states that John has $5 left after buying the video games, we can confirm that the calculation is consistent with the given information.

Since John started with 13 lego sets and he has not sold or bought any additional lego sets, the number of lego sets he still has is:

\[
\text{Number of lego sets still} = 13
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{13}
\]"
"To find John's running speed, we first need to determine the total distance he runs in those 3 days and then divide that by the total time he spends running.

John runs 3 days a week, and the distances are as follows:
- First day: 3 hours
- Second day: Half the distance of the first day
- Third day: Half the distance of the first day

Let's denote the distance John runs on the first day as \(D_1\). Therefore:
- \(D_1 = 3\) hours
- Distance on the second day, \(D_2 = \frac{D_1}{2} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5\) hours
- Distance on the third day, \(D_3 = \frac{D_1}{2} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5\) hours

The total distance John runs in those 3 days is:
\[D_{total} = D_1 + D_2 + D_3 = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \text{ hours}\]

John runs a total of 60 miles in 6 hours. Therefore, his running speed \(V\) is:
\[V = \frac{D_{total}}{time} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}\]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[10\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how far Dana can travel in six hours given her running, walking, and skipping speeds, and the time she spends on each activity.

First, let's find Dana's walking speed. We know that her skipping speed is half her running speed, and she skips at 3 miles per hour. Therefore, her running speed is twice her skipping speed:
\[ \text{Running speed} = 2 \times 3 \text{ miles per hour} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine the time she spends running and walking. Since she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, and the total time is six hours, we can calculate the time spent on each activity:
\[ \text{Time spent running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Time spent walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the distance she covers while running and walking:
\[ \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time spent running} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time spent walking} \]

We need to find her walking speed. Since her running speed is four times her walking speed, we can denote her walking speed as \( v \). Therefore, her running speed is \( 4v \). We already know her running speed is 6 miles per hour:
\[ 4v = 6 \]
\[ v = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now we can calculate the distance she walks:
\[ \text{Distance walking} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, we add the distances she covers while running and walking to find the total distance she travels in six hours:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance walking} = 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"

2. Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone. Therefore, Ben's iPhone is \(2 \times 1 = 2\) years old.
3. Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) years old.

The final numerical answer is 8."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone.

1. First, we know that Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone.
2. When holding the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin three times farther than without the gemstone.

Let's calculate the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone:
\[ \text{Distance with gemstone} = 3 \times \text{Distance without gemstone} \]
\[ \text{Distance with gemstone} = 3 \times 400 \text{ feet} \]
\[ \text{Distance with gemstone} = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's reach is 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone:
\[ \text{Distance outside reach} = \text{Distance with gemstone} - \text{Dragon's reach} \]
\[ \text{Distance outside reach} = 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} \]
\[ \text{Distance outside reach} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 200 \]"

"First, let's determine the number of calories in one serving of the bag of chips. Given that a 300g bag has 5 servings and contains 250 calories per serving, we can calculate the total calories in the bag as follows:

\[ \text{Total calories in the bag} = 5 \text{ servings} \times 250 \text{ calories/serving} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories are left for the day. The daily calorie target is 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories:

\[ \text{Calories left for the day} = 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to determine how many servings of chips can be consumed with the remaining 200 calories. Since each serving contains 250 calories:

\[ \text{Servings that can be consumed} = \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories/serving}} = \frac{200}{250} = \frac{4}{5} = 0.8 \text{ servings} \]

Since each serving is 500g (300g / 5 servings), the amount of chips that can be consumed is:

\[ \text{Grams that can be consumed} = 0.8 \text{ servings} \times 500 \text{ grams/serving} = 400 \text{ grams} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 400 \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of making the candles. Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax and wicks for every 10 candles. For 20 candles, he will need 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks. Since the cost of 1 pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.00, the cost for 2 pounds is:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pound} = \$20.00 \]

Next, we calculate the revenue from selling the candles. If Charlie sells each candle for $2.00 and he makes 20 candles, the total revenue is:

\[ 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00 \text{ per candle} = \$40.00 \]

Now, to find the net profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00 \]

So, the net profit if Charlie makes and sells 20 candles is:

\[ \$20.00 \]"
"To calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of articles written on each day.
2. Calculate the total number of hours spent writing articles over the three days.

**Step 1: Determine the number of articles written on each day.**

- **Monday:** Meredith wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday:** She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. Therefore, the number of articles on Tuesday is:
  \[
  5 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 5 \right) = 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ articles}
  \]
- **Wednesday:** She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of articles on Wednesday is:
  \[
  2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ articles}
  \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of hours spent writing articles over the three days.**

- Each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write about.
- Total articles written over the three days:
  \[
  5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles}
  \]
- Total hours spent writing articles:
  \[
  26 \text{ articles} \times 4 \text{ hours/article} = 104 \text{ hours}
  \]

The total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days is \(\boxed{104}\)."
"To determine how many Post-it notes were in the package that Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of Post-it notes used at work.
2. Determine the initial number of Post-it notes before the purchase.
3. Calculate the number of Post-it notes purchased.
4. Add the number of Post-it notes purchased to the initial number to find the total number in the package.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Candice placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee. Therefore, she used 220 Post-it notes at work.

2. Initially, Candice had 80 Post-it notes in her purse. After using 220 Post-it notes at work, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining. We can calculate the number of Post-it notes she had before purchasing the new package by adding the 220 used and the 23 remaining to the initial 80:

\[ \text{Initial number of Post-it notes} + \text{Post-it notes used} + \text{Post-it notes remaining} = 80 + 220 + 23 \]

\[ 80 + 220 + 23 = 323 \]

So, Candice had 323 Post-it notes before purchasing the new package.

3. To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package she purchased, we subtract the initial number of Post-it notes from the total number of Post-it notes she had before the purchase:

\[ \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package} = \text{Total number of Post-it notes} - \text{Initial number of Post-it notes} \]

\[ \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package} = 323 - 80 \]

\[ \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package} = 243 \]

Therefore, the number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is 243."
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Given that each blue tie costs $40 and he spent a total of $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of each red tie. Since red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, the cost of each red tie is:

\[ \text{Cost per red tie} = \text{Cost per blue tie} + 0.5 \times \text{Cost per blue tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60 \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

Finally, the total amount John spent on ties is the sum of the cost of the blue ties and the cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total spent on ties} = \text{Total spent on blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{800} \]"

Next, we need to determine how many 6-inch pieces can be cut from the 48-inch wire. This can be calculated by dividing the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"First, we need to determine the total number of units in the building. Since there are 15 floors and each floor contains 8 units, the total number of units is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Total units} = 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units/floor} = 120 \text{ units} \]

Next, we need to find out how many units are occupied. Given that 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is:

\[ \text{Occupied units} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ units} \]

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

\[ \text{Unoccupied units} = 120 - 90 = 30 \]

So, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is:

\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"To determine how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs produced per week.
2. Convert the weekly egg count into dozens.
3. Calculate the weekly revenue from selling the eggs.

First, let's calculate the number of eggs produced per week:
- Eggs produced per day = 252
- Days in a week = 7
- Eggs produced per week = 252 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 1764 eggs/week

Next, we convert the weekly egg count into dozens:
- There are 12 eggs in a dozen.
- Dozens of eggs produced per week = 1764 eggs/week / 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozens/week

Finally, we calculate the weekly revenue:
- Price per dozen = $2
- Weekly revenue = 147 dozens/week * $2/dozen = $294/week

Therefore, Lloyd makes $294 on eggs per week."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Tom to travel back from his destination. However, the question does not specify the distance he traveled to get to his destination. Without this information, we cannot calculate the time it takes for him to travel back.

If we assume that the distance to his destination is \(D\) miles, then the time it takes to travel to the destination is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the trip to the destination, the time taken is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{to}} = \frac{D}{10} \text{ hours} \]

For the trip back, the time taken is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{back}} = \frac{D}{6} \text{ hours} \]

"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, and he removes 30 comic books.

\[ \text{Total weight of comic books} = 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds in comic books, the remaining weight that needs to be removed is:

\[ \text{Remaining weight to be removed} = 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove to make up the remaining 7.5 pounds, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[ \text{Number of toys to be removed} = \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 15 \]"
"To determine the revenue for each day, we need to calculate the total charges for the truck and car tires repaired.

**Thursday:**
- Revenue from truck tires: \(6 \text{ tires} \times \$60/\text{tire} = \$360\)
- Revenue from car tires: \(4 \text{ tires} \times \$40/\text{tire} = \$160\)
- Total revenue on Thursday: \(\$360 + \$160 = \$520\)

**Friday:**
- Revenue from car tires: \(12 \text{ tires} \times \$40/\text{tire} = \$480\)
- Revenue from truck tires: \(0 \text{ tires} \times \$60/\text{tire} = \$0\)
- Total revenue on Friday: \(\$480 + \$0 = \$480\)

Now, we compare the total revenues:

\[ \text{Number of boxes} = \frac{\text{Maximum additional weight}}{\text{Weight of each box}} \]
\[ \text{Number of boxes} = \frac{1245}{15} = 83 \]

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes which can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83."
"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries after all the additional fees, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the original total of $40.00.
2. Add the 25% delivery fee to the original total.
3. Add the $3.00 delivery fee.
4. Add the $4.00 tip.

First, calculate the 25% delivery fee on the original total:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } \$40.00 = 0.25 \times \$40.00 = \$10.00 \]

Now, add the 25% delivery fee to the original total:
\[ \$40.00 + \$10.00 = \$50.00 \]

Next, add the $3.00 delivery fee:
\[ \$50.00 + \$3.00 = \$53.00 \]

Finally, add the $4.00 tip:
\[ \$53.00 + \$4.00 = \$57.00 \]

So, the final price of Stephen's groceries is:

"First, let's break down the information given:

- Total number of oranges = 25
- Number of bad oranges = 1
- Number of unripe oranges = 20% of 25 = 0.20 * 25 = 5
- Number of sour oranges = 2

To find the number of good oranges, we need to subtract the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges from the total number of oranges.

Number of good oranges = Total number of oranges - (Number of bad oranges + Number of unripe oranges + Number of sour oranges)

Let's calculate this:

Number of good oranges = 25 - (1 + 5 + 2) = 25 - 8 = 17

So, the final numerical answer is 17."
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the brooch before insurance. The cost of the material is $500 and the cost of the jeweler is $800. Adding these together gives:

\[ 500 + 800 = 1300 \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost of insurance, which is 10% of the total cost of the brooch. We find 10% of $1300 by multiplying $1300 by 0.10:

\[ 1300 \times 0.10 = 130 \]

Now, we add the cost of insurance to the total cost of the brooch to find the final amount Janet paid:

\[ 1300 + 130 = 1430 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1430 \]"
"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of working, we need to consider the two different phases of her pension calculation:

1. For the first 20 years, she receives a fixed annual pension of $50,000.
2. After 20 years, she starts receiving 5% of the value of her pension each year.

First, we calculate the value of her pension after 20 years of work. Since she receives $50,000 annually, after 20 years, the total value of her pension is:
\[ 50,000 \times 20 = 1,000,000 \]

After 20 years, her pension changes to 5% of this value. So, the annual pension after 20 years is:
\[ 0.05 \times 1,000,000 = 50,000 \]

Since Marcy quits after 30 years, she will receive the 5% of the value pension for the next 10 years. Therefore, her annual pension after 30 years will still be:
\[ 50,000 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 50,000 \]"
"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payment into two halves of the year and then sum them up.

First, let's determine the cost for the first half of the year. Since there are 6 months in a half-year, and the service charges $140 per month, the cost for the first half of the year is:
\[ 140 \times 6 = 840 \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost for the second half of the year. The service charges 10% less in the second half of the year, so the monthly charge is:
\[ 140 \times (1 - 0.10) = 140 \times 0.90 = 126 \]
The cost for the second half of the year is:
\[ 126 \times 6 = 756 \]

Now, we sum the costs of the two halves of the year to find the total amount paid by the end of the year:
\[ 840 + 756 = 1596 \]

Therefore, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is:

"First, let's determine how many hours Jim spends on TV and reading in one session.

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV. He then reads for half as long as he watches TV, which is:
\[ \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, in one session, he spends:
\[ 2 \text{ hours (TV)} + 1 \text{ hour (reading)} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total time spent in one week is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week} \]

To find out how many hours he spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly total by 4:
\[ 9 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 36 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

  \[
  \text{Number of rubies} = 175 - 35 = 140
  \]
- The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies, so:
  \[
  \text{Number of emeralds} = 2 \times 140 = 280
  \]

Now, let's find the total number of gems by summing the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds:
\[
\text{Total number of gems} = 175 + 140 + 280 = 595
\]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much money Judy makes in one week, we need to calculate her earnings from both weekdays and Saturday.

First, let's calculate her earnings from weekdays:
- Judy teaches 5 classes each weekday.
- There are 5 weekdays in a week.
- Each class has 15 students.
- She charges $15.00 per student.

The number of students she teaches in one weekday is:
\[ 5 \text{ classes/day} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 75 \text{ students/day} \]

The total number of students she teaches in one week (5 weekdays) is:
\[ 75 \text{ students/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 375 \text{ students} \]

Her earnings from one weekday are:
\[ 375 \text{ students} \times \$15.00/\text{student} = \$5625.00 \]

Since she teaches 5 weekdays, her total earnings from weekdays are:
\[ \$5625.00 \times 5 = \$28125.00 \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from Saturday:
- Judy teaches 8 classes on Saturday.
- Each class has 15 students.
- She charges $15.00 per student.

The number of students she teaches on Saturday is:
\[ 8 \text{ classes} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 120 \text{ students} \]

Her earnings from Saturday are:
\[ 120 \text{ students} \times \$15.00/\text{student} = \$1800.00 \]

Now, we add her earnings from weekdays and Saturday to find her total weekly earnings:
\[ \$28125.00 + \$1800.00 = \$29925.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Judy makes in one week is:

"To determine how much Shiela will pay each month for the cell phones, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the cell phones before interest.
2. Calculate the total interest on the cell phones.
3. Add the total interest to the total cost to get the total installment amount.
4. Divide the total installment amount by the number of months to find the monthly payment.

Let's start with step 1:
The cost of one cell phone is $150, and Shiela bought five cell phones.
\[ \text{Total cost before interest} = 5 \times 150 = 750 \]

Next, step 2:
The interest rate is 2% per unit. Since Shiela bought five cell phones, the total interest is:
\[ \text{Total interest} = 5 \times 150 \times 0.02 = 15 \]

Now, step 3:
The total installment amount is the sum of the total cost before interest and the total interest:
\[ \text{Total installment amount} = 750 + 15 = 765 \]

Finally, step 4:
Shiela will pay this total amount over 3 months. Therefore, the monthly payment is:
\[ \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{765}{3} = 255 \]

So, Shiela will pay \(\boxed{255}\) each month for 3 months."

Given:
- The top level (level 4) has a square footage of 16.
- Each level below has half the square footage of the level above it.

Let's calculate the square footage for each level:

- Level 4 (top level): 16 square feet.
- Level 3: \(16 \div 2 = 8\) square feet.
- Level 2: \(8 \div 2 = 4\) square feet.

"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food required for the first 180 days and then for the rest of the puppy's life within the first year.

First, calculate the amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days:
\[ 1 \text{ cup/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to determine how many days are left in the first year after the first 180 days. Since a year has 365 days:
\[ 365 \text{ days} - 180 \text{ days} = 185 \text{ days} \]

Now, calculate the amount of dog food needed for the remaining 185 days:
\[ 2 \text{ cups/day} \times 185 \text{ days} = 370 \text{ cups} \]

Add the amounts of dog food needed for the first 180 days and the remaining 185 days to find the total amount of dog food used in the first year:
\[ 180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups} \]

Finally, determine how many bags of dog food are needed. Since each bag contains 110 cups:

"First, let's determine how much laundry Sarah does. According to the problem, Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.

Next, we need to find out how much laundry David does. The problem states that Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. Therefore, we can calculate the amount of laundry David does by dividing the amount Sarah does by 4:

\[
\text{Laundry done by David} = \frac{400 \text{ pounds}}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to find out how much laundry Raymond does. The problem states that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. Therefore, we can calculate the amount of laundry Raymond does by dividing the amount Sarah does by 2:

\[
\text{Laundry done by Raymond} = \frac{400 \text{ pounds}}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we subtract the amount of laundry David does from the amount of laundry Raymond does:

\[
\text{Difference} = 200 \text{ pounds} - 100 \text{ pounds} = 100 \text{ pounds}

"To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in both scenarios and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost if Vincent buys flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50:
- Each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50.
- To find out how many packages of 3 flowers are needed to get 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 3: \(18 \div 3 = 6\).
- Therefore, the cost for 18 flowers in packages of 3 is \(6 \times 2.50 = 15\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Vincent buys flowers in packages of 2 for $1:
- Each package of 2 flowers costs $1.
- To find out how many packages of 2 flowers are needed to get 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 2: \(18 \div 2 = 9\).
- Therefore, the cost for 18 flowers in packages of 2 is \(9 \times 1 = 9\) dollars.

Now, we compare the two costs:
- The cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 is $15.
- The cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 is $9.
- The difference in cost is \(15 - 9 = 6\) dollars.

"Let's denote the number of games they lost as \( L \) and the number of games they won as \( W \). According to the problem, the team won 8 more games than they lost, so we can write the equation:

\[ W = L + 8 \]

We also know that the total number of games played is 22, so:

\[ W + L = 22 \]

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ 2L = 14 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the number of games they lost, we can find the number of games they won by substituting \( L \) back into the first equation:

\[ W = 7 + 8 \]

So:

\[ W = 15 \]

The number of games they won is 15."

"To determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Salary**: Sylvie's initial salary is $600 per month.

2. **Salary Increase**: The company increases the salary by 10% after five years of service. Since Sylvie has just completed five years of service, her salary will be increased by 10%.

3. **Calculate the Increase**: 
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 600 \times 0.10 = 60
   \]

4. **New Salary After Five Years**: 
   \[
   \text{New Salary} = 600 + 60 = 660

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic."
"First, let's determine the number of pets each person has based on the information provided.

Cindy has 4 pets.

Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has:
\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pets} \]

Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has:
\[ 3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ pets} \]

Now, to find the total number of pets that Jan, Marcia, and Cindy have together, we add the number of pets each has:
\[ 4 + 6 + 18 = 28 \]

So, the total number of pets the three have is:
\[ 28 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's define the ages of the kids using variables:

- Let \( J \) be Jackson's age.
- Then Amy's age is \( J + 5 \) (since Amy is 5 years older than Jackson).
- Corey's age is \( J + 5 + 2 = J + 7 \) (since Amy is 2 years younger than Corey).
- James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey's age is \( 10 + 1 = 11 \).

Since Corey's age is \( J + 7 \) and we know Corey's age is 11, we can set up the equation:
\[ J + 7 = 11 \]

Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 11 - 7 \]
\[ J = 4 \]

So, Jackson is 4 years old.

"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in Grade 5.

Given that 2/5 of the 200 students are boys, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:
\[ \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

Since the total number of students is 200, the number of girls can be calculated by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. According to the problem, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout:
\[ \text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find the number of girls who are not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[ \text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 40 \]"
"To find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we first need to determine how many hours James slept. Since James slept only \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what Harry slept, we can calculate the number of hours James slept as follows:

\[ \text{Hours James slept} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 \]

\[ \text{Hours James slept} = 6 \]

Now, to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we subtract the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Harry's sleep} - \text{James's sleep} \]

\[ \text{Difference} = 9 - 6 \]

\[ \text{Difference} = 3 \]

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the volume of tomatoes before cooking:**
   - The final volume of the sauce is 32 ounces.
   - Since the volume of the tomatoes loses half during cooking, the original volume of the tomatoes must be twice the volume of the sauce.
   - Therefore, the original volume of the tomatoes is \( 32 \times 2 = 64 \) ounces.

2. **Determine the number of tomatoes:**
   - Each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes.
   - To find out how many 16-ounce cans are needed to get 64 ounces of tomatoes, we divide the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of one can:
     \[
     \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
     \]
   - Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes is:
     \[
     4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes/can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}
     \]

Therefore, Freda used 12 tomatoes."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Initially, there were 30 cars on the motorway.
- 5 cars exited the motorway, so the number of cars remaining on the motorway after the exits is \(30 - 5 = 25\).
- In the first 15 minutes, some cars drove through the traffic jam.
- In the remaining 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through the traffic jam.
- The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as \(x\). Therefore, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \(x + 20\).

Since the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is also equal to the number of cars remaining on the motorway after the exits, we have:
\[x + 20 = 25\]

To find \(x\), we solve the equation:
\[x = 25 - 20\]
\[x = 5\]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine the total number of potted plants Mary currently has. She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so:

\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Next, Mary plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family. Therefore, she will give away:

\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

To find out how many potted plants Mary will remain with, we subtract the number of plants she plans to give away from the total number of plants she currently has:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

So, the final number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:

The total number of doorbell rings is \(\boxed{175}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of pages Solo needs to read:

- Science: 4 pages
- Social Studies: 20 pages
- History: 7 pages
- Geography: 8 pages

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday. Therefore, the remaining pages he needs to read are:

Remaining pages = Total pages - Pages read on Monday
Remaining pages = 39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read, on average, in one day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days left:

Pages per day = Remaining pages / Number of days left
Pages per day = 24 / 4 = 6 pages

- John drinks 1 glass of water with breakfast.
- John drinks 1 glass of water with lunch.
- John drinks 1 glass of water with dinner.
- John drinks 1 glass of water before bed.

So, on a weekday, John drinks \(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4\) glasses of water.

Since there are 5 weekdays in a week, the total number of glasses of water John drinks on weekdays is:
\[ 4 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ glasses} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of glasses of water John drinks on a weekend day:
- John drinks 1 glass of water with dinner.

So, on a weekend day, John drinks \(1\) glass of water.

Since there are 2 weekend days in a week, the total number of glasses of water John drinks on weekends is:
\[ 1 \text{ glass/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 2 \text{ glasses} \]

Finally, to find the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we add the glasses consumed on weekdays and weekends:

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we can first calculate the total hours he watched TV from Monday to Friday and then subtract the hours he watched on the other days.

From Monday to Tuesday, he watched:
\[ 1 \text{ hour/night} \times 2 \text{ nights} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

On Wednesday, he watched:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \]

On Thursday, he watched:
\[ 1 \text{ hour} + 0.5 \text{ hours} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \]

On Friday, he watched:
\[ 1 \text{ hour/episode} \times 2 \text{ episodes} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we sum up the hours watched from Monday to Friday:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} + 0.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. Therefore, the hours he watched on Wednesday are:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} - 6 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is:

So, the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday is 2."
"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry intended to bake as \( x \). According to the problem, he actually baked twice as many as he intended, plus 15 more cookies. This can be expressed as:
\[ x + 15 \]

After baking, he drops 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has left is:
\[ (x + 15) - 5 = x + 10 \]

We are given that after dropping 5 cookies, he has a total of 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x + 10 = 110 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation by subtracting 10 from both sides:
\[ x = 110 - 10 \]
\[ x = 100 \]

Thus, Henry baked \( 100 \) cookies last year. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the leftover lumber Sasha has.

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 10 boards.
- Each board cost her $10.
- Total cost for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $10/board = $100.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 5 boards.
- Each board cost her $16.
- Total cost for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $16/board = $80.

The total cost of the leftover lumber is:
- Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the leftover lumber.

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 10 boards.
- She sells each board for the same price as when she bought them, which is $10.
- Total revenue from 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $10/board = $100.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 5 boards.
- She sells each board for the same price as when she bought them, which is $16.
- Total revenue from 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $16/board = $80.

The total revenue from selling the leftover lumber is:
- Total revenue = $100 + $80 = $180.

Finally, the profit Sasha makes is the total revenue minus the total cost:
- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $180 - $180 = $0.

1. **Determine Adrien's initial salary:**
   Adrien's initial salary was $40,000.

2. **Determine Lylah's initial salary:**
   Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. Let \( L \) be Lylah's initial salary. Therefore, we have:
   \[
   40,000 = L + 0.3L = 1.3L
   \]
   Solving for \( L \):
   \[
   L = \frac{40,000}{1.3} = \frac{40,000}{1.3} = 30,769.23 \approx 30,769.23

3. **Wednesday**: She also slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.
4. **Thursday**: She slept 1 hour more than she did on Tuesday, so she slept \(6 + 1 = 7\) hours.
5. **Friday**: She slept 1 hour more than she did on Wednesday, so she slept \(6 + 1 = 7\) hours.
6. **Saturday**: She slept 1 hour more than she did on Thursday, so she slept \(7 + 1 = 8\) hours.
7. **Sunday**: She slept 1 hour more than she did on Friday, so she slept \(7 + 1 = 8\) hours.

Now, we sum up the hours for each day of the week:
\[ 8 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 7 + 8 + 8 \]

Let's add these step by step:
\[ 8 + 6 = 14 \]
\[ 14 + 6 = 20 \]
\[ 20 + 7 = 27 \]
\[ 27 + 7 = 34 \]
\[ 34 + 8 = 42 \]
\[ 42 + 8 = 50 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the first part where Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours, and the second part where she runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining time.

First, calculate the distance Rosie covers in the first part:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time}_1 = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, determine the remaining time after the first part:
\[ \text{Remaining time} = 7 \, \text{hours} - 3 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{hours} \]

Now, calculate the distance Rosie covers in the second part:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed}_2 \times \text{Remaining time} = 5 \, \text{mph} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, add the distances from both parts to find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} = 50 \, \text{miles} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 50 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many letters were already stamped when Jennie began her work.

Jennie has a pile of 60 letters needing stamps. She puts stamps on one-third of these letters. Therefore, the number of letters she stamps is:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
\]
This means that 20 letters were stamped by Jennie. After stamping these 20 letters, there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. This implies that the number of letters already stamped before Jennie began was:
\[
30 - 20 = 10
\]
Thus, the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began is 10. The final numerical answer is:
\[

"To determine the hospital's profit from these visits, we need to calculate the revenue and the cost, and then find the difference between them.

First, let's calculate the total number of patient hours seen per day:
- The hospital sees 500 people a day.
- Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes, which is equivalent to 0.4 hours (since 24 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 0.4 hours).

Total patient hours per day = 500 people * 0.4 hours/person = 200 hours.

Next, let's calculate the revenue generated by the hospital:
- Doctors charge $150 per hour to the hospital.
- Total revenue from doctors = 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000.

Now, let's calculate the cost incurred by the hospital:
- The hospital charges patients $200 per hour.
- Total revenue from patients = 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000.

The profit is the total revenue from patients minus the total revenue from doctors:
- Profit = Total revenue from patients - Total revenue from doctors = $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

Thus, the hospital's profit from these visits is $10,000."

1. Determine how many miles Walt walked on Tuesday.
2. Calculate the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday.
3. Subtract the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday from the total miles walked from Monday to Wednesday to find the miles walked on Wednesday.

First, we know that Walt walked 4 miles on Monday. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he did on Monday. Therefore, the miles walked on Tuesday are:
\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday:
\[ 4 \text{ miles (Monday)} + 24 \text{ miles (Tuesday)} = 28 \text{ miles} \]

We are given that the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we subtract the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday from the total miles walked from Monday to Wednesday:

"First, let's calculate how many questions Mark completed on each test based on the time he had to complete them.

For the first test:
- Mark had 8 hours to complete the test.
- He completed 5 questions per hour.
- Therefore, the number of questions he completed on the first test is \(8 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ questions/hour} = 40 \text{ questions}\).
- Since the first test had 75 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete is \(75 - 40 = 35 \text{ questions}\).

For the second test:
- Mark had 6 hours to complete the test.
- He completed 5 questions per hour.
- Therefore, the number of questions he completed on the second test is \(6 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ questions/hour} = 30 \text{ questions}\).
- Since the second test had 100 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete is \(100 - 30 = 70 \text{ questions}\).

"Let's denote the number of queens as \( Q \), the number of baby bees as \( B \), and the number of worker bees as \( W \).

According to the problem:
1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so \( W = 2B \).
2. There are twice as many baby bees as queens, so \( B = 2Q \).
3. The total number of bees is 700, so \( W + B + Q = 700 \).

First, we can express \( W \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Q \):
- Since \( B = 2Q \), and \( W = 2B \), we can substitute \( B \) to get \( W = 2(2Q) = 4Q \).

Now, substituting \( W \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Q \) into the total number of bees equation:
\[ 4Q + 2Q + Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now that we know the number of queens \( Q \), we can find the number of baby bees \( B \) and worker bees \( W \):
- \( B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200 \)
- \( W = 4Q = 4(100) = 400 \)

Therefore, the number of worker bees is \( 400 \).

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the nonfood items before tax:

- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

Total cost of nonfood items = $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $15

Next, we calculate the tax on the nonfood items. The tax rate is 10%, so the tax amount is:

Tax amount = 10% of $15 = 0.10 * $15 = $1.50

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of the nonfood items to get the final cost:

Final cost of nonfood items = $15 + $1.50 = $16.50

The cost of food items (milk, eggs, light bulbs, cups, and roach traps) is $15, and there is no tax on food items. Therefore, the total cost including tax is:

Total cost = Cost of nonfood items + Cost of food items = $16.50 + $15 = $31.50

"To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of harvests John can have in a year.
2. Determine the total number of pineapples harvested based on the number of harvests.

First, since John harvests his pineapples every 3 months, we need to find out how many 3-month periods there are in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so:

\[ \text{Number of harvests in a year} = \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests} \]

Next, we know that John has 100 pineapples per hectare and he has 10 hectares of pineapple field. Therefore, the total number of pineapples per harvest is:

\[ \text{Total pineapples per harvest} = 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} \times 10 \text{ hectares} = 1000 \text{ pineapples} \]

Since John can harvest 4 times in a year, the total number of pineapples he can harvest in a year is:

"To determine the number of bees that Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours, we need to break down the information given and calculate step by step.

1. **Bees leaving the hive in the first 6 hours:**
   Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.

2. **Bees returning in the next 6 hours:**
   Debra sees \(\frac{1}{2}\) of the 30 bees return, which is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \text{ bees}
   \]

3. **Bees leaving the hive in the next 6 hours:**
   Debra sees twice as many bees leave as those that left in the first 6 hours. Since 30 bees left in the first 6 hours, twice that number is:

"Let's denote the initial number of french fries in the pack as \( x \).

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
4. After the pigeons, the number of fries left is \( x - 14 - 7 - 9 = x - 20 \).
5. The raccoon then ate two thirds of the remaining fries, so it ate \( \frac{2}{3}(x - 20) \) fries.
6. After the raccoon, the number of fries left is \( (x - 20) - \frac{2}{3}(x - 20) = \frac{1}{3}(x - 20) \).
7. Ants carried off a final french fry, leaving 5 fries. So, we have \( \frac{1}{3}(x - 20) - 1 = 5 \).

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[
\frac{1}{3}(x - 20) - 1 = 5

"To calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly class schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has three 1-hour classes each day. So, the total number of hours he spends on these days is:
\[ 3 \text{ days/week} \times 3 \text{ classes/day} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} = 9 \text{ hours/week} \]

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes each day. So, the total number of hours he spends on these days is:
\[ 2 \text{ days/week} \times 2 \text{ classes/day} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 8 \text{ hours/week} \]

Adding the hours from both sets of days gives the total number of hours he spends on classes each week:
\[ 9 \text{ hours/week} + 8 \text{ hours/week} = 17 \text{ hours/week} \]

Since there are 16 weeks in the semester, the total number of hours he spends attending classes in one semester is:
\[ 17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 272 \]"
"First, we need to convert all the lengths to the same unit for easier calculation. We will use inches for this purpose.

- Each roll is 4 inches long, and Bill bakes 300 rolls, so the total length of the rolls is:
  \[
  300 \text{ rolls} \times 4 \text{ inches/roll} = 1200 \text{ inches}
  \]

- Each croissant is 6 inches long, and Bill bakes 120 croissants, so the total length of the croissants is:
  \[
  120 \text{ croissants} \times 6 \text{ inches/croissant} = 720 \text{ inches}
  \]

- Each baguette is 2 feet long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is:
  \[
  2 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 24 \text{ inches}
  \]
  Bill bakes 60 baguettes, so the total length of the baguettes is:
  \[
  60 \text{ baguettes} \times 24 \text{ inches/baguette} = 1440 \text{ inches}
  \]

Now, we add up the total lengths of all the baked goods in inches:
\[
1200 \text{ inches} + 720 \text{ inches} + 1440 \text{ inches} = 3360 \text{ inches}
\]

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[
3360 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 280 \text{ feet}
\]

So, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is:
\[
\boxed{280 \text{ feet}}

"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order to last for 2 months, we first need to calculate the total number of bananas required by all the apes in one month and then multiply that by 2.

- Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
- Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
- Baboons need 100 bananas per month.

So, the total number of bananas needed per month is:
\[ 200 \text{ (monkeys)} + 400 \text{ (gorillas)} + 100 \text{ (baboons)} = 700 \text{ bananas per month} \]

For 2 months, the total number of bananas needed is:
\[ 700 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 1400 \text{ bananas} \]

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order \(\boxed{1400}\) bananas to last for 2 months."
"To determine how far Blake and Kelly each run, we need to calculate the total distance each of them covers.

First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs:
- Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field.
- Each round trip is 200 yards (100 yards out and 100 yards back).
- Therefore, the total distance Blake runs is \(15 \times 200 = 3000\) yards.

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs:
- Kelly runs back and forth once to the 40-yard line and back, which is a total of 80 yards.
- She does this 34 times.
- Therefore, the total distance Kelly runs is \(34 \times 80 = 2720\) yards.

Now, we compare the distances:
- Blake runs 3000 yards.
- Kelly runs 2720 yards.

The difference in the distance they run is:
\[3000 - 2720 = 280\] yards.

The winner runs 280 yards farther than the loser. Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[280\]"

"To find the water depth on Wednesday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the depth of the water on Tuesday.
2. Calculate the depth of the water on Wednesday based on the depth on Tuesday.

First, we know the depth of the water on Monday is 17 feet. On Tuesday, the depth increased by 7 feet:
\[ \text{Depth on Tuesday} = 17 + 7 = 24 \text{ feet} \]

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday:
\[ \text{Depth on Wednesday} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ feet} \]

So, the tank’s water depth on Wednesday is:
\[ 16 \text{ feet} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of each type of fish caught by Locsin:

- Starfish: Anakin caught 10 starfish, so Locsin caught \(10 - 5 = 5\) starfish.
- Sea horses: Anakin caught 6 sea horses, so Locsin caught \(6 - 3 = 3\) sea horses.
- Clownfish: Anakin caught 3 clownfish, so Locsin caught \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin:

- Total starfish: \(10 + 5 = 15\)
- Total sea horses: \(6 + 3 = 9\)
- Total clownfish: \(3 + 5 = 8\)

Adding these together gives the total number of fish caught:

\[15 + 9 + 8 = 32\]

So, the final numerical answer is 32."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the price increase step by step over the 36 months. The price increases by 20% every two months. Let's break it down:

1. **Initial Price**: $20
2. **Price after 2 months**: The price increases by 20% of $20.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 20 + 4 = 24
   \]
3. **Price after 4 months**: The price increases by 20% of $24.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 20\% \times 24 = 0.20 \times 24 = 4.80
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 24 + 4.80 = 28.80
   \]
4. **Price after 6 months**: The price increases by 20% of $28.80.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 20\% \times 28.80 = 0.20 \times 28.80 = 5.76
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 28.80 + 5.76 = 34.56
   \]
5. **Price after 8 months**: The price increases by 20% of $34.56.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 20\% \times 34.56 = 0.20 \times 34.56 = 6.912
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 34.56 + 6.912 = 41.472
   \]
6. **Price after 10 months**: The price increases by 20% of $41.472.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 20\% \times 41.472 = 0.20 \times 41.472 = 8.2944
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 41.472 + 8.2944 = 49.7664
   \]
7. **Price after 12 months**: The price increases by 20% of $49.7664.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 20\% \times 49.7664 = 0.20 \times 49.7664 = 9.95328
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 49.7664 + 9.95328 = 59.71968
   \]

We can see that the price increases by 20% every two months. Since 36 months is equivalent to 18 two-month periods, we can generalize the price after 36 months as follows:

\[
\text{Price after 36 months} = 20 \times (1 + 0.20)^{18}
\]

Calculating the exponent:

\[
(1 + 0.20)^{18} = 1.20^{18}
\]

Using a calculator to find \(1.20^{18}\):

\[
1.20^{18} \approx 10.60252
\]

Now, multiply this by the initial price:

\[
\text{Price after 36 months} = 20 \times 10.60252 \approx 212.0504
\]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the final price is:

\[
\boxed{212.05}
\]"
"First, let's determine the cost of one red car. According to the problem, one red car costs $4. Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and an action figure costs $5, the cost of 3 action figures is:

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Therefore, the doll costs $15.

Now, we know that one red car costs $4, and the doll costs $15. We need to find the total value of all the toys in the room. The room contains 5 red cars, 3 action figures, and 1 doll. The total value of the red cars is:

\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \]

The total value of the action figures is:

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

The value of the doll is $15. Adding these values together gives the total value of all the toys:

\[ 20 + 15 + 15 = 50 \]

So, the total value of all the toys is $50."
"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the missed income from doing her taxes herself and then compare it to the cost of hiring the accountant.

Jackie loses $35/hour for each hour she does not do freelance work. If we let \( h \) represent the number of hours she would have done freelance work, then the missed income from doing her taxes herself is \( 35h \).

The cost of hiring the accountant is a flat rate of $90. To find out how much more money she will have if she hires the accountant, we need to compare the missed income to the cost of hiring the accountant. Since the missed income is \( 35h \) and the cost of hiring the accountant is $90, we need to determine the value of \( h \).

However, the problem does not specify the number of hours \( h \). Assuming the question is asking for the difference in terms of the cost of hiring the accountant, we can directly compare the cost of hiring the accountant to the missed income, which is \( 35h \).

If we assume \( h = 3 \) (since the problem states she would do 3 fewer hours of freelance work), then the missed income is:
\[ 35 \times 3 = 105 \]

The cost of hiring the accountant is $90. Therefore, the difference (or the additional money she will have if she hires the accountant) is:
\[ 105 - 90 = 15 \]

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the computer accessories Elvira bought:

- Screen: €157
- Keyboard and mouse: €74
- Scanner: €102
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Total cost of accessories = €157 + €74 + €102 + €74 + €102 = €509

Elvira's total budget is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost of the accessories from her budget:

Money left for clothing = €1500 - €509 = €991

So, the final numerical answer is €991."
"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit to make 15 Spanish flans, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs needed to make 15 flans.
   - Each flan requires 3 eggs.
   - Therefore, for 15 flans, the total number of eggs needed is \( 15 \times 3 = 45 \) eggs.

2. Determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit to collect 45 eggs.
   - Each babysitting session provides 9 eggs.
   - To find the number of babysitting sessions required, divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs provided per babysitting session: \( \frac{45}{9} = 5 \).

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit 5 times to collect enough eggs to make 15 Spanish flans.

The final numerical answer is:
5"
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \). According to the problem, Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write the first equation as:

\[ S = 2B \]

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write the second equation as:

\[ (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \]

Simplifying the second equation:

\[ B + S + 4 = 28 \]
\[ B + S = 24 \]

Now we substitute the first equation \( S = 2B \) into the second equation:

\[ B + 2B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's current age \( B = 8 \), we can find Seth's current age using \( S = 2B \):

\[ S = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is currently 16 years old. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"

"To calculate the total number of miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to consider his daily walking distance and the number of days he walks that distance.

- From Monday to Friday, he walks 20 miles each day. So, for 5 days, he walks \(20 \times 5 = 100\) miles.
- On Saturday and Sunday, he walks 10 miles each day. So, for 2 days, he walks \(10 \times 2 = 20\) miles.

Adding these together, the total number of miles he walks in a week is \(100 + 20 = 120\) miles.

The final numerical answer is 120."
"First, let's determine the cost of each item:
- The cost of the hat is $25.
- The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat, so it is \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.
- The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket. The average is calculated as \(\frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50\) dollars.

Now, to find the total cost of each uniform, we add the cost of the hat, the jacket, and the pants:
\[ 25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \]

So, the total cost of each uniform is $150.

\[
\boxed{150}

\[ 80 \text{ spiders} \times 8 \text{ legs per spider} = 640 \text{ legs} \]

For the insects:
\[ 90 \text{ insects} \times 6 \text{ legs per insect} = 540 \text{ legs} \]

For the rare mutant invertebrates:
\[ 3 \text{ invertebrates} \times 10 \text{ legs per invertebrate} = 30 \text{ legs} \]

Now, we sum the legs from all groups:
\[ 640 \text{ legs} + 540 \text{ legs} + 30 \text{ legs} = 1210 \text{ legs} \]

So, the total number of legs Jake sees is:

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

1. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, we can calculate the total age of the four birds:

\[
\text{Total age} = \text{Sally Two} + \text{Granny Red} + \text{Sally Four} + \text{Sally Thirtytwo} = 19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 51

"First, let's calculate the amount Jessica needs to pay each month if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum.

For the student loans:
Minimum payment = $300
50% more than the minimum = $300 * 0.50 = $150
Total payment for student loans = $300 + $150 = $450

For the credit card:
Minimum payment = $200
50% more than the minimum = $200 * 0.50 = $100
Total payment for credit card = $200 + $100 = $300

For the mortgage:
Minimum payment = $500
50% more than the minimum = $500 * 0.50 = $250
Total payment for mortgage = $500 + $250 = $750

Now, let's add up the total monthly payments:
Total monthly payment = $450 (student loans) + $300 (credit card) + $750 (mortgage) = $1500

To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we multiply the total monthly payment by 12:
Total annual payment = $1500 * 12 = $18000

The final numerical answer is:
18000"
"To determine how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel and cut each potato and then multiply by the total number of potatoes.

First, let's calculate the time to peel and cut one potato:
- Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
- Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

Convert the time to peel one potato to seconds for easier calculation:
- 1.5 minutes = 1.5 * 60 seconds = 90 seconds

Now, add the time to peel and cut one potato:
- Total time for one potato = 90 seconds (peeling) + 5 seconds (cutting) = 95 seconds

Next, calculate the total time for 60 potatoes:
- Total time for 60 potatoes = 60 * 95 seconds

Perform the multiplication:
- Total time for 60 potatoes = 5700 seconds

Finally, convert the total time back to minutes:
- Total time in minutes = 5700 seconds / 60 seconds per minute = 95 minutes

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes."
"First, let's determine the total revenue from selling lemonade. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, so the revenue per gallon is:
\[ 20 \text{ glasses/gallon} \times \$0.50/\text{glass} = \$10/\text{gallon} \]

Given that their profit is $25, we can use the profit formula to find the total cost. The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. Let's denote the total cost as \( C \). The total revenue is \( 10 \) dollars per gallon, and they made a profit of \( 25 \) dollars, so:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} \]
\[ 25 = 10 - C \]
\[ C = 10 - 25 \]
\[ C = -15 \]

This negative value indicates an error in the interpretation of the problem. Let's re-evaluate the cost structure. The total cost \( C \) includes the cost of lemons and sugar. The cost of lemons is $3 per gallon and the cost of sugar is $2 per gallon, so the total cost per gallon is:
\[ C = 3 + 2 = 5 \text{ dollars/gallon} \]

Now, using the profit formula again:
\[ 25 = 10 - 5 \]
\[ 25 = 5 \]
This indicates that the total cost is $5 per gallon, and the profit is $25, which means the total revenue is $30 (since profit = revenue - cost and profit = $25, so revenue = cost + profit = $5 + $25 = $30).

Since the revenue per gallon is $10, the number of gallons sold is:
\[ \text{Number of gallons} = \frac{30}{10} = 3 \text{ gallons} \]

The cost of lemons per gallon is $3, so the total cost of lemons is:
\[ \text{Total cost of lemons} = 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the amount spent on lemons is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"

"First, let's calculate how much Zaid spends on rent, car fuel, and the remaining amount after these expenses.

Zaid's monthly salary is $6000.

1. Rent: \( \frac{1}{4} \) of $6000 = \( \frac{6000}{4} = 1500 \) dollars.
2. Car fuel: \( \frac{1}{3} \) of $6000 = \( \frac{6000}{3} = 2000 \) dollars.

Total spent on rent and car fuel:
\[ 1500 + 2000 = 3500 \] dollars.

Remaining amount after rent and car fuel:
\[ 6000 - 3500 = 2500 \] dollars.

Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \] dollars.

Remaining amount after the donation:
\[ 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \] dollars.

Zaid gives his daughter $200 and his wife $700 for their weekly expenses:
\[ 200 + 700 = 900 \] dollars.

Remaining amount after giving money to his daughter and wife:
\[ 1250 - 900 = 350 \] dollars.

Therefore, the final amount of money Zaid will still have is:

"To determine the number of votes the loser received, we first need to calculate the number of votes the winner received. The winner got \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total votes.

Given that the total number of votes cast is 80, we can calculate the number of votes the winner received as follows:
\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80
\]

Let's perform the multiplication:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 3 \times 20 = 60
\]

So, the winner received 60 votes. Since the total number of votes cast is 80, the number of votes the loser received is:
\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20
\]

Thus, the number of votes the loser got is:
\[

"Let's denote the number of white carnations Sandra ordered as \( w \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, so the number of red roses is \( 4w \).
2. Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which are five times the number of white carnations, so \( 200 = 5w \).

First, we solve for \( w \) using the equation \( 200 = 5w \):
\[
w = \frac{200}{5} = 40
\]

Now that we know \( w = 40 \), we can find the number of red roses:
\[
4w = 4 \times 40 = 160
\]

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

The final numerical answer is:

   - Two years ago, Jan's age was \(30 - 2 = 28\).
   - Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time.
   - Half of Jan's age two years ago was \(\frac{28}{2} = 14\).
   - Therefore, Mark's age two years ago was \(14 + 5 = 19\).

2. **Determine Mark's current age:**
   - Since Mark was 19 two years ago, his current age is \(19 + 2 = 21\).

For the second team, the first runner takes 60 seconds, the second runner takes 57 seconds (3 seconds faster than the first), the third runner takes 54 seconds (3 seconds faster than the second), and the fourth runner takes 51 seconds (3 seconds faster than the third). The total time for the second team is:
\[ 60 \text{ seconds} + 57 \text{ seconds} + 54 \text{ seconds} + 51 \text{ seconds} = 222 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, we find the difference in the total times taken by the two teams:
\[ 222 \text{ seconds} - 220 \text{ seconds} = 2 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, the faster team will win by:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then compare them.

First, let's determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers on a six-sided die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability \( P(\text{number} > 3) \) is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Next, let's determine the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:
\[
P(\text{even on first roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll, given that the first roll was even, is also:
\[
P(\text{even on second roll} \mid \text{even on first roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

The combined probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[
P(\text{even on first roll and even on second roll}) = P(\text{even on first roll}) \times P(\text{even on second roll} \mid \text{even on first roll}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25
\]

Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row. This is given by the ratio of the probabilities:
\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{even on first roll and even on second roll})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
\]

To express this ratio as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
2 \times 100 = 200\%
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{200}

\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ apples} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 30 \]"
"Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as \( r \).

From the information given:
- There are 3 cages of rats, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is \( 3r \times 6 = 18r \).
- There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \).
- There are 20 pieces of straw given to the rabbits.

The total number of pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents is the sum of the pieces of straw given to the rats, the hamsters, and the rabbits. According to the problem, this total is 160 pieces. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 18r + 50 + 20 = 160 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 18r + 70 = 160 \]
\[ 18r = 160 - 70 \]
\[ 18r = 90 \]
\[ r = \frac{90}{18} \]
\[ r = 5 \]

So, the number of rats in each cage is \( 5 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"To determine how much Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to calculate the interest accrued over that period and then add it to the original amount owed.

The original amount owed is $100, and the monthly interest rate is 2%, or 0.02 in decimal form.

First, calculate the interest for one month:
\[ \text{Interest per month} = 100 \times 0.02 = 2 \]

Since the interest is compounded monthly, the interest for 3 months is:
\[ \text{Total interest for 3 months} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

Now, add the total interest to the original amount to find the total amount Mandy should pay:
\[ \text{Total amount to pay} = 100 + 6 = 106 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 106 \]"
"Let's denote the number of bags of wheat as \( n \).

The cost per bag includes the purchase price and the transportation cost, which is \( 20 + 2 = 22 \) dollars per bag.

The total cost for \( n \) bags is \( 22n \) dollars.

The selling price per bag is $30, so the total revenue from selling \( n \) bags is \( 30n \) dollars.

The trader made a total profit of $400, so the profit can be expressed as the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ 30n - 22n = 400 \]
\[ 8n = 400 \]
\[ n = \frac{400}{8} \]
\[ n = 50 \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 50 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food:

- The cost of the tickets is $20.25.
- The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, so it is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

Next, we add the cost of the food to the cost of the tickets to find the total cost of the tickets and food:

- Total cost of tickets and food = $20.25 + $15.75 = $36.00.

Now, we add the cost of the rides to the total cost of the tickets and food:

- The cost of the rides is $33 for each ride, and they went on 2 rides, so the total cost for the rides is $33 * 2 = $66.00.
- Total cost including rides = $36.00 + $66.00 = $102.00.

Since they agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:

- Each person's share = $102.00 / 3 = $34.00.

So, the final numerical answer is $34.00."

"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ten ducks needs per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of insects needed per day for one duck.
2. Multiply the daily amount needed for one duck by the number of ducks in the flock.

First, we know that the total amount of insects needed per week for one duck is 3.5 pounds. There are 7 days in a week, so the amount of insects needed per day for one duck is:
\[ \frac{3.5 \text{ pounds}}{7 \text{ days}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Now, for a flock of ten ducks, the total amount of insects needed per day is:
\[ 0.5 \text{ pounds/day/duck} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the net increase in the number of trees each year.
2. Determine the number of trees after 10 years, considering the net increase.
3. Account for the 30% of the trees that die after 10 years.

**Step 1: Net increase in trees each year**
Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year.
Net increase = 10 - 2 = 8 trees per year.

**Step 2: Number of trees after 10 years**
Starting with 50 trees, the number of trees after 10 years, considering the net increase, is:
\[ 50 + 8 \times 10 = 50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees} \]

**Step 3: Trees that die after 10 years**
30% of the trees die after 10 years.
Number of trees that die = 30% of 130 = 0.30 * 130 = 39 trees.

**Step 4: Number of trees left after the 30% die**
\[ 130 - 39 = 91 \text{ trees} \]

So, the final number of trees Tom has left after 10 years is:
\[ \boxed{91} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Placement on Friday:**
   - Sue's front yard starts with 18 pink plastic flamingos.

2. **Action on Saturday:**
   - The neighbors take back one third of the flamingos.
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
   - So, 6 pink flamingos are taken back.
   - The remaining flamingos are \( 18 - 6 = 12 \).
   - The neighbors paint these 6 flamingos white and put them back out.
   - Now, there are 6 white flamingos and 12 pink flamingos.

3. **Action on Sunday:**
   - The neighbors add another 18 pink flamingos.
   - The total number of flamingos now is \( 6 \text{ (white)} + 12 \text{ (pink)} + 18 \text{ (new pink)} = 36 \).

4. **Counting the Flamingos:**
   - Pink flamingos: 12 (initial) + 18 (added) = 30.
   - White flamingos: 6.

5. **Difference Calculation:**
   - The difference between the number of pink flamingos and white flamingos is \( 30 - 6 = 24 \).

Therefore, at noon on Sunday, there are 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.

"To determine how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we first need to calculate the total amount of carrots that will be distributed to the 40 restaurants.

Each restaurant receives 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. Therefore, the total amount of carrots distributed is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds/restaurant} \times 40 \text{ restaurants} = 80 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of carrots available is 200 pounds. To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we subtract the total amount distributed from the total amount available:
\[ 200 \text{ pounds} - 80 \text{ pounds} = 120 \text{ pounds} \]

"To find out how many Pokemon cards Elaine has now, we need to calculate the number of cards she collected each month and then sum them up.

1. **First Month:**
   Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards. After a month, she collected three times that number.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ cards}
   \]
   So, after the first month, she has:
   \[
   20 + 60 = 80 \text{ cards}
   \]

2. **Second Month:**
   In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40 \text{ cards}
   \]
   So, after the second month, she has:
   \[
   80 + 40 = 120 \text{ cards}
   \]

3. **Third Month:**
   In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months.
   \[
   2 \times (60 + 40) = 2 \times 100 = 200 \text{ cards}

"First, let's determine how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher each week. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers and a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B.

Next, we calculate the payment from Publisher A. Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, the payment from Publisher A is:
\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

Since Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, Publisher B pays Mark:
\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10 \text{ cents/sentence} \]

Therefore, the payment from Publisher B is:
\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we add the payments from both publishers:
\[ 2500 \text{ cents} + 5000 \text{ cents} = 7500 \text{ cents} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to break down the problem into parts and sum them up.

1. **Sandwiches for lunch:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 5 days.
   - Each sandwich uses 2 slices of cheese.
   - Total slices of cheese used for sandwiches = 5 days * 2 slices/day = 10 slices.

2. **Omelets for breakfast:**
   - Carl ate omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week.
   - He used 1 more slice of cheese per omelet than he did per sandwich.
   - Since each sandwich uses 2 slices, each omelet uses 2 + 1 = 3 slices of cheese.
   - Total slices of cheese used for omelets = 3 days * 3 slices/day = 9 slices.

3. **Macaroni and cheese dish:**
   - Carl used 8 slices of cheese for the big dish.

"To determine the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then sum them up.

Given:
- Each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams.
- Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple.

First, we find the weight of each candied apple:
\[ \text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{\text{Weight of each chocolate bar}}{2} = \frac{40 \text{ grams}}{2} = 20 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars:

"First, let's break down the information given in the question:

- Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
- Each plate costs $6000.
- We need to find the total cost of buying each cup.

Let's start by calculating the total cost of half a dozen plates:
- Half a dozen plates mean 6 plates.
- Each plate costs $6000.
- Therefore, the total cost for 6 plates is \(6 \times 6000 = 36000\) dollars.

According to the question, the cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than this total cost:
- The cost of twenty dozen cups is \(36000 - 1200 = 34800\) dollars.

Now, we need to find the cost of one cup. Since twenty dozen cups mean \(20 \times 12 = 240\) cups, we can find the cost of one cup by dividing the total cost of twenty dozen cups by 240:
- The cost of one cup is \(\frac{34800}{240}\).

Let's calculate this value:
\[
\frac{34800}{240} = 145
\]

So, the total cost of buying each cup is \(\boxed{145}\) dollars."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, let's determine how much money Sara earns from babysitting and mowing the lawn:
- Sara earns $5 each time she babysits, and she babysits 4 times, so she earns \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars from babysitting.
- Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, and we need to find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to afford the $70.

Let's denote the number of times Sara needs to mow the lawn as \(x\). The total amount of money Sara earns from mowing the lawn is \(4x\) dollars. Adding the $10 she already has, the total amount of money Sara will have is \(10 + 4x\).

We need this total amount to be at least $70:
\[10 + 4x \geq 70\]

Subtract 10 from both sides of the inequality:
\[4x \geq 60\]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[x \geq 15\]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn at least 15 times to afford the jacket and shoes. The final numerical answer is:
\[15\]"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \). According to the problem, the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day. Additionally, it is given that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which can be expressed as:

\[ w = r + 2 \]

The total number of eggs collected each day can be expressed as:

\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation \( 3r + 5w = 42 \):

\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens. To verify, we can calculate the number of white chickens and the total eggs collected:

\[ w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \]
\[ 3r + 5w = 3(4) + 5(6) = 12 + 30 = 42 \]

The calculations confirm that the solution is correct. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

1. Determine the number of customers on the second day.
2. Calculate the total number of customers over the three days.
3. Find the number of customers on the third day by subtracting the total number of customers on the first and second days from the total number of customers over the three days.

First, we know that on the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than on the first day. Therefore, the number of customers on the second day is:
\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \]

Next, we know the total number of customers over the three days is 500. To find the number of customers on the third day, we subtract the number of customers on the first and second days from the total number of customers over the three days:
\[ 500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250 \]

So, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is:
\[ 250 \]"
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons.

From the problem, we know that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Since each pool loses 4 gallons per minute due to the leak, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
Simplifying this equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ B = 2S + 16 \]

Now, we know that the current amount of water in the big pool is four times the current amount of water in the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have two equations:
1. \( B = 2S + 16 \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

We can set these two equations equal to each other:
\[ 2S + 16 = 4S \]
Solving for \( S \):
\[ 16 = 2S \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool currently has 8 gallons of water. Let's verify this by finding the current amount of water in the big pool:
\[ B = 4S = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( 32 - 4 \times 4 = 32 - 16 = 16 \) gallons, and the small pool had \( 8 - 4 \times 4 = 8 - 16 = -8 \) gallons, which is not possible, so we need to recheck the consistency. The correct interpretation is that the big pool had \( 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( 8 \) gallons, which satisfies the condition that 4 minutes ago the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.

Thus, the current amount of water in the small pool is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to make her purchase, we first need to calculate the total cost of the pair of shoes and the matching belt.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

So, the total cost of the purchase is $352.00. Lori earns $8.00 per hour at her part-time job. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44.00 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 44 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She promised to return the original $2000 plus an additional 10% of that amount.

The additional amount is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she promised to return is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Janeth is paying $165 per month for 12 months. The total amount she will pay over 12 months is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she promised to return to find her remaining balance:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance by the end of 12 months will be:
\[ 220 \]"
"There are 4 roses in the vase. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, there are 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias. The total number of flowers in the vase is the sum of the roses and dahlias, which is 4 + 11 = 15.

The final numerical answer is 15."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack, and then calculate their ages in three years. Finally, we will find the average of their ages at that time.

1. **Determine Harriet's current age:**
   Harriet is currently 21 years old.

2. **Determine Zack's current age:**
   Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, we can calculate Zack's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. **Determine Adrian's current age:**
   Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age:
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years old}
   \]

4. **Calculate their ages in three years:**
   - Harriet's age in three years: \(21 + 3 = 24\)
   - Zack's age in three years: \(42 + 3 = 45\)
   - Adrian's age in three years: \(63 + 3 = 66\)

5. **Calculate the average age of the three in three years:**
   \[
   \text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Harriet's age in three years} + \text{Zack's age in three years} + \text{Adrian's age in three years}}{3} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna, and then subtract the points scored by Naomi and Yuri from the total points.

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. So, Yuri's score is:
   \[
   \text{Yuri's score} = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44
   \]
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna's score is:
   \[
   \text{Brianna's score} = 68 + 17 = 85
   \]

Now, we add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[
\text{Total points by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna} = 68 + 44 + 85 = 197
\]

The total points scored by all four students is 251. Therefore, Jojo's score is:
\[
\text{Jojo's score} = 251 - 197 = 54

"To determine the total time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles and the time spent on sudoku puzzles separately, and then sum these times.

First, we calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
- It takes Carmen 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles.
- Therefore, the total time spent on crossword puzzles is \(10 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 3 \text{ puzzles} = 30 \text{ minutes}\).

Next, we calculate the time spent on sudoku puzzles:
- It takes Carmen 5 minutes to finish one sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 sudoku puzzles.
- Therefore, the total time spent on sudoku puzzles is \(5 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 8 \text{ puzzles} = 40 \text{ minutes}\).

Finally, we sum the time spent on both puzzles:
- Total time spent = time on crossword puzzles + time on sudoku puzzles
- Total time spent = \(30 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 70 \text{ minutes}\).

The final numerical answer is 70 minutes."
"Initially, the tank has 120 liters of water. Celine used 90 liters to water her garden, so the amount of water left in the tank is:

\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters} \]

Celine then collected rainwater that is twice the amount left in the tank. Since there were 30 liters left, the amount of rainwater collected is:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters} \]

Adding the collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank gives:

\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final amount of water in the tank is:

\[ 90 \text{ liters} \]"
"First, we need to determine the number of petunias Andy plants. Since he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, and he plants 90 geraniums, we can calculate the number of petunias as follows:

Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
Number of petunias = 90 - 40
Number of petunias = 50

Next, we calculate the total number of flowers by adding the number of geraniums and the number of petunias:

Total number of flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
Total number of flowers = 90 + 50
Total number of flowers = 140

So, the total number of flowers Andy plants is 140."
"To find the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years, we need to calculate the amount spent in the second year and then add it to the amount spent in the first year.

The amount spent on advertising in the first year is $15000.

The amount spent on advertising in the second year is a third of the first year's amount, which is:
\[ \frac{15000}{3} = 5000 \]

Now, we add the amounts spent in both years:
\[ 15000 + 5000 = 20000 \]

So, the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20000."
"To calculate the total cost of their rentals, we need to multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours each person rents the equipment for and then sum the two amounts.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Travel by Bus:**
   - Andrew takes 6 days to travel by bus from New Jersey to Rochester.

2. **Travel by Car:**
   - It takes half as many days to travel by car from New Jersey to Rochester.
   - Therefore, the travel time by car is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) days.

3. **Return Trip:**
   - Andrew plans to return from Rochester to New Jersey by car.
   - The travel time for the return trip by car is also 3 days.

4. **Total Travel Time:**
   - The total travel time for the round trip (New Jersey to Rochester by bus and back by car) is the sum of the travel times for each leg of the trip.
   - Total travel time = 6 days (bus) + 3 days (car) + 3 days (car) = 12 days.

Thus, the total number of days Andrew will travel is 12 days."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cards James has after the changes:

- Initial fire type cards: 30
- Initial grass type cards: 20
- Initial water type cards: 40

After losing 8 water type cards:
- Water type cards left: 40 - 8 = 32

After buying 14 new grass type cards:
- Grass type cards now: 20 + 14 = 34

Now, the total number of cards James has is:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 34
- Water type: 32

The total number of cards is:
30 + 34 + 32 = 96

The number of water type cards left is 32. To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 = \frac{1}{3} \times 100 \approx 33.33\% \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33%.

- Base burrito: $6.50
- Extra meat: $2.00
- Extra cheese: $1.00
- Avocado: $1.00
- 2 sauces at $0.25 each: $0.25 * 2 = $0.50

Adding these together:
\[ 6.50 + 2.00 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 0.50 = 11.00 \]

Next, we add the extra $3.00 for chips and a drink:
\[ 11.00 + 3.00 = 14.00 \]

Chad has a gift card worth $5.00, which he uses to reduce the total cost:

"First, let's determine how many pieces Kalinda and her mom can place together per minute.

Kalinda places 4 pieces per minute.
Her mom places half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

Together, they can place \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces per minute.

The puzzle has 360 pieces. To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can place together per minute:

\[ \text{Time in minutes} = \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \text{Time in hours} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1 \text{ hour} \]"
"First, let's determine how many watermelons were ready for harvest after the first two months. Since 30% of the 120 watermelons were ready, we calculate:

\[ 120 \times 0.30 = 36 \]

So, Ashlyn took home 36 watermelons. This means the number of watermelons remaining after she took home the first batch is:

\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest two weeks later. Since 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready, we calculate:

\[ 84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 63 \]

This means 63 watermelons were ready for harvest two weeks later. Therefore, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:

\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

\[ 21 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the cars before tax and registration fees. Each car costs $20,000, and Mark buys 12 cars.

\[ \text{Total cost of cars} = 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000 \]

Next, we calculate the tax on the cars. The tax rate is 10%.

\[ \text{Tax on cars} = 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000 \]

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of the cars to get the total cost before registration fees.

\[ \text{Total cost before registration} = 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000 \]

Then, we calculate the registration fees. Each car has a registration fee of $1,000, and Mark has 12 cars.

\[ \text{Total registration fees} = 12 \times 1,000 = 12,000 \]

Finally, we add the total registration fees to the total cost before registration fees to get the final amount Mark pays.

\[ \text{Total amount paid} = 264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many penguins are left after some of them have moved from the snow to the ocean and the cave.

1. First, calculate the number of penguins that jump into the ocean. Since one-third of the 36 penguins do this, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
   \]
   So, 12 penguins jump into the ocean.

2. Next, calculate the number of penguins that go into the cave. Again, one-third of the 36 penguins do this, so:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
   \]
   So, 12 penguins go into the cave.

3. Now, we need to find out how many penguins are left in the snow. We start with 36 penguins and subtract the 12 that went to the ocean and the 12 that went to the cave:
   \[
   36 - 12 - 12 = 12

Therefore, the number of penguins still left sunbathing in the snow is 12."
"First, let's determine how much Steve's girlfriend eats. Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, and Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, his girlfriend eats:

\[ \text{Steve's girlfriend's consumption} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ tomatoes per day} \]

Next, we calculate the total consumption per week. Since there are 7 days in a week, Steve eats:

\[ \text{Steve's weekly consumption} = 6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ tomatoes per week} \]

And his girlfriend eats:

\[ \text{Girlfriend's weekly consumption} = 3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ tomatoes per week} \]

So, the total weekly consumption for both of them is:

\[ \text{Total weekly consumption} = 42 + 21 = 63 \text{ tomatoes per week} \]

Given that a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, the number of vines needed to produce 63 tomatoes per week is:

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the process Ram uses to make new pens from the empty ones. Ram can make one full pen by mixing the ink from five empty pens. This means that for every five empty pens, he gets one new pen.

Ram initially buys 25 pens. Since he can make one new pen from five empty pens, we can determine how many new pens he can make from the 25 empty pens he has after using them:

\[ \text{Number of new pens} = \frac{25}{5} = 5 \]

After making these 5 new pens, Ram will have 5 empty pens left (since he used 25 pens to make 5 new ones). Now, he can use these 5 empty pens to make another new pen:

\[ \text{Number of additional new pens} = \frac{5}{5} = 1 \]

So, the total number of pens Ram gets is the original 25 pens plus the 5 new pens he made and the 1 additional new pen he made from the 5 empty pens:

\[ \text{Total pens} = 25 + 5 + 1 = 31 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the number of students who went out through exit A. Since 30% of the students went out through exit A, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Students through exit A} = 1000 \times \frac{30}{100} = 300 \]

After students have left through exit A, the remaining number of students is:

\[ \text{Remaining students} = 1000 - 300 = 700 \]

Next, we calculate the number of students who went out through exit B. According to the problem, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining students went out through exit B:

\[ \text{Students through exit B} = 700 \times \frac{3}{5} = 420 \]

The number of students who went out through exit C is the rest of the students after those who went through exits A and B have left. Therefore, we subtract the number of students who went through exits A and B from the total number of students:

\[ \text{Students through exit C} = 1000 - 300 - 420 = 280 \]

So, the number of students who went out through exit C is:

"To solve this problem, let's start by determining how many candies Robert has. We know that John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find out how many candies Robert has:

\[ \text{John's candies} = 2 \times \text{Robert's candies} \]
\[ 54 = 2 \times \text{Robert's candies} \]
\[ \text{Robert's candies} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Now that we know Robert has 27 candies, we can find out how many candies James has. We know that James has 6 more candies than Robert:

\[ \text{James's candies} = \text{Robert's candies} + 6 \]
\[ \text{James's candies} = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Next, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's candies} - \text{James's candies} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

So, John has 21 more candies than James. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of pen pals Mike has left after stopping being pen pals with 2 of them. Initially, he had 5 pen pals, so after stopping being pen pals with 2, he has:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals} \]

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each pen pal sends:

\[ 2 \text{ letters/week} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 10 \text{ pages/week} \]

Since there are 3 pen pals, the total number of pages sent by all pen pals in a week is:

\[ 3 \text{ pen pals} \times 10 \text{ pages/pen pal/week} = 30 \text{ pages/week} \]

Mike responds to each of these 30 pages in kind, so he also writes 30 pages a week. Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, so the time he spends writing 30 pages is:

\[ 30 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin initially had 24 fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin had \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Now Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin as \(x\). After receiving \(x\) fries from Ginger, Griffin had \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took, so Colby took \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. After Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries left.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27

7. Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20

- The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is \( 32 - 4 = 28 \).
- This difference is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums.

Let's denote the total number of fish in both aquariums as \( 2F \) (since there are \( F \) fish in each aquarium).

According to the problem, the difference in the number of snails is twice the total number of fish:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2F \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ F = 7 \]

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 7 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist spends on the makeup over the 5 weeks.

The makeup artist requires 6 hours each day and needs the makeup done 4 times a week. Therefore, the total hours required per week is:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ hours/week} \]

Since the movie lasts for 5 weeks, the total hours required over the 5 weeks is:
\[ 24 \text{ hours/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ hours} \]

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 120 \text{ hours} \times 250 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30000 \text{ dollars} \]

After the movie is done, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount. The discount amount is:
\[ 30000 \text{ dollars} \times 0.10 = 3000 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final amount Jean pays after the discount is:
\[ 30000 \text{ dollars} - 3000 \text{ dollars} = 27000 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 27000 \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total amount Isabelle spent on the party supplies. We do this by adding up all the individual expenses:

\[

Therefore, each person paid \(\boxed{32}\) dollars."
"First, we need to find the total weight of the onions. The chef bought 4 bags, and each bag weighs 50 pounds. So, the total weight is:

\[ 4 \text{ bags} \times 50 \text{ pounds per bag} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total cost. A pound of onions costs $1.50, so for 200 pounds, the cost is:

\[ 200 \text{ pounds} \times 1.50 \text{ dollars per pound} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the chef spent \(\boxed{300}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine how many cookies Sue's sister ate each day.

On Monday, her sister ate 5 cookies.

On Tuesday, her sister ate 13 cookies.

Next, we calculate the number of cookies Sue ate each day based on the information given.

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cookies} \]

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister:
\[ 2 \times 13 = 26 \text{ cookies} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of cookies Sue ate over the two days:
\[ 20 + 26 = 46 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of cookies her sister ate over the two days:
\[ 5 + 13 = 18 \text{ cookies} \]

Each cookie has 200 calories. Therefore, we calculate the total calories consumed by Sue and her sister.

Total calories consumed by Sue:
\[ 46 \times 200 = 9200 \text{ calories} \]

Total calories consumed by her sister:
\[ 18 \times 200 = 3600 \text{ calories} \]

Finally, we find the difference in calories consumed by Sue and her sister:
\[ 9200 - 3600 = 5600 \text{ calories} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5600} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of students in the school. Since each class has 20 students and there are 3 classes, the total number of students is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

Given that the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the number of boys and girls in the school is:
\[ \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ boys and } 30 \text{ girls} \]

For the first class, there are 15 girls, so the number of boys in the first class is:
\[ 20 - 15 = 5 \text{ boys} \]

For the second class, there are 12 girls, so the number of boys in the second class is:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ boys} \]

Now, let's find out how many boys are in the third class. The total number of boys in the school is 30, and we already know the number of boys in the first and second classes:
\[ 5 \text{ boys in the first class} + 8 \text{ boys in the second class} = 13 \text{ boys} \]

Therefore, the number of boys in the third class is:
\[ 30 - 13 = 17 \text{ boys} \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

From the information given:
- Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.
- Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars.
- Today, Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night (15 cougars).

First, let's determine the number of wolves and cougars Rick killed today:
- Let the number of cougars killed today be \( c \).
- According to the problem, the number of wolves killed today is \( 3c \).
- We also know that the number of cougars killed today is three fewer than the number killed last night, which was 15. Therefore, \( c = 15 - 3 = 12 \).

Now we can calculate the number of wolves killed today:
- Since \( c = 12 \), the number of wolves killed today is \( 3c = 3 \times 12 = 36 \).

Next, we sum up the total number of animals killed:
- Wolves killed last night: 10
- Wolves killed today: 36
- Cougars killed last night: 15
- Cougars killed today: 12

The total number of animals killed is:

"First, let's determine how many times Anne went down the water slide. If Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Anne's rides} = \text{Mitchel's rides} - (\text{Mitchel's rides} \times 0.30) \]
\[ \text{Anne's rides} = 30 - (30 \times 0.30) \]
\[ \text{Anne's rides} = 30 - 9 \]
\[ \text{Anne's rides} = 21 \]

Next, we need to find out how many times Robert went down the water slide. Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne:

\[ \text{Robert's rides} = \text{Anne's rides} \times 4 \]
\[ \text{Robert's rides} = 21 \times 4 \]
\[ \text{Robert's rides} = 84 \]

So, Robert went down the water slide 84 times. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the total number of cows after Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows. Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, which totals:

\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows/stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows, so the total number of cows becomes:

\[ 200 \text{ cows} + 40 \text{ cows} = 240 \text{ cows} \]

Next, Mr. Sylas divides these 40 new cows equally among the 20 stalls. Each stall will get:

\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows/stall} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. Since each stall has 2 cows, 8 stalls will have:

"To determine the total amount of money Brady has in his piggy bank, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and bill separately and then sum them up.

1. **Pennies**: Each penny is worth $0.01. Brady has 100 pennies.
   \[
   100 \text{ pennies} \times 0.01 \text{ dollars/penny} = 1 \text{ dollar}
   \]

2. **Nickels**: Each nickel is worth $0.05. Brady has 40 nickels.
   \[
   40 \text{ nickels} \times 0.05 \text{ dollars/nickel} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Dimes**: Each dime is worth $0.10. Brady has 20 dimes.
   \[
   20 \text{ dimes} \times 0.10 \text{ dollars/dime} = 2 \text{ dollars}

"First, we need to determine the total length of the redwood tree in feet, which is given as 200 feet.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the entire redwood tree before any damage. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can find the total weight by dividing the total length of the tree by the length of each section and then multiplying by the weight of each section:

\[
\text{Total weight} = \left(\frac{\text{Total length of the tree}}{\text{Length of each section}}\right) \times \text{Weight per section}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\text{Total weight} = \left(\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}}\right) \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 20 \times 400 = 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to account for the fact that termites ate 30% of the redwood's wood. This means that 70% of the tree remains. We calculate the remaining weight as follows:

\[
\text{Remaining weight} = \text{Total weight} \times (1 - \text{Percentage eaten})
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Remaining weight} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \times (1 - 0.30) = 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70 = 5600 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total amount Nancy has to pay, we need to consider both the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee.

First, calculate the cost of the overdue books:
- Nancy has 8 books overdue.
- Each book costs $0.50.
- Therefore, the total cost for the books is \(8 \times 0.50 = 4.00\) dollars.

Next, add the flat fee for having at least one book over a week overdue:
- The flat fee is $2.00.

Now, add the cost of the books to the flat fee:

- Total cost = $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00

So, the total amount Nancy has to pay is $6.00."
"Let's denote the number of apples Jamal has as \( J_a \) and the number of bananas Jamal has as \( J_b \).

From the information given:
1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, so if Andrea has 52 apples, then Jamal has \( 52 - 8 = 44 \) apples.
2. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so \( J_b = J_a + 4 \).
3. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so if Jamal has \( J_b \) bananas, then Andrea has \( \frac{J_b}{2} \) bananas. Since Andrea has 52 apples, we can use this to find the number of bananas Jamal has.

First, we know Jamal has 44 apples, so:
\[ J_b = 44 + 4 = 48 \]
This means Jamal has 48 bananas.

Now, we can find out how many bananas Andrea has:
\[ \text{Andrea's bananas} = \frac{J_b}{2} = \frac{48}{2} = 24 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits:
- Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas, so Andrea has \( 52 + 24 = 76 \) fruits.
- Jamal has 44 apples and 48 bananas, so Jamal has \( 44 + 48 = 92 \) fruits.

The total number of fruits is:
\[ 76 + 92 = 168 \]

"To determine how many cups of flour Carla will need, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she plans to make and then determine the total amount of flour required based on the given ratio.

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, so the total number of cookies is:
\[ 36 + 30 = 66 \]

We know that 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies. To find out how many cups of flour are needed for 66 cookies, we can set up a proportion based on the given ratio:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{66 \text{ cookies}} \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 66 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} \]
\[ x = \frac{132}{12} \]
\[ x = 11 \]

Therefore, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow. The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we first need to calculate how many pennies are in two thirds of the total pennies.

Given that there are 9,300 pennies in the cup, we calculate two thirds of 9,300 as follows:

\[
\text{Number of pennies in the stack} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9300
\]

Let's perform the multiplication:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9300 = 2 \times \frac{9300}{3} = 2 \times 3100 = 6200
\]

So, there are 6,200 pennies in the stack.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, the total dollar amount in the stack is:

\[
\text{Total dollar amount} = 6200 \times 0.01 = 62

"First, let's calculate the total price of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

The selling price of the house is $350,000.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price:
\[ \text{Brokerage Fee} = 350,000 \times \frac{5}{100} = 350,000 \times 0.05 = 17,500 \]

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price:
\[ \text{Transfer Fee} = 350,000 \times \frac{12}{100} = 350,000 \times 0.12 = 42,000 \]

Now, let's calculate the total price of the house including both the brokerage fee and the transfer fee:
\[ \text{Total Price} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500 \]

Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. To find out how much more the total price of the house is than her budget, we subtract her budget from the total price:
\[ \text{Difference} = 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500 \]

So, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 9500 \]"
"First, we need to calculate the transfer fees, which are 3% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Transfer fees} = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000 \]

Next, we calculate the brokerage fee, which is 5% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Brokerage fee} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000 \]

Now, we add the transfer fees and the brokerage fee to find the total fees paid.

\[ \text{Total fees} = 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000 \]

Mr. Tan also paid $250,000 towards the remaining loan amount of the house. To find the net proceeds, we subtract the total fees and the loan payment from the selling price.

\[ \text{Net proceeds} = 400,000 - 32,000 - 250,000 = 118,000 \]

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is $118,000."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes for the oil to heat up to 400 degrees. We know it takes 20 minutes to heat the oil to 300 degrees, and it then takes 40% longer to heat it to 400 degrees.

40% of 20 minutes is:
\[ 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the additional time needed to heat the oil to 400 degrees is 8 minutes. Therefore, the total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that it takes 5 minutes less time to cook the chicken than it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees. So, the cooking time is:
\[ 28 - 5 = 23 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees and the time it took to cook the chicken:
\[ 28 + 23 = 51 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken is:

So, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"To determine the total number of windows in John's houses, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum the results.

1. **Windows in Bedrooms:**
   - Each house has 3 bedrooms.
   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.
   - Therefore, the number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is \(3 \text{ bedrooms} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows}\).
   - Since John has 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms of both houses is \(6 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 12 \text{ windows}\).

2. **Additional Windows:**
   - Each house has an additional 4 windows not connected to bedrooms.
   - Therefore, the total number of additional windows in one house is 4.
   - For both houses, the total number of additional windows is \(4 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 8 \text{ windows}\).

3. **Total Windows:**
   - Adding the windows from the bedrooms and the additional windows gives us the total number of windows.

"First, let's determine the number of stitches for the collar and the rosette.

The collar takes a tenth of the stitches for the body of the sweater:
\[ \text{Collar stitches} = \frac{900}{10} = 90 \]

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar:
\[ \text{Rosette stitches} = 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette:
\[ \text{Total stitches for collar and rosette} = 90 + 180 = 270 \]

The total number of stitches for the whole sweater is 1800. Therefore, the number of stitches used for the body and the sleeves is:
\[ \text{Stitches for body and sleeves} = 1800 - 270 = 1530 \]

Since there are two sleeves, we need to find out how many stitches each sleeve takes. Let's denote the number of stitches for each sleeve as \( S \). Therefore:
\[ 2S = 1530 \]
\[ S = \frac{1530}{2} = 765 \]

So, each sleeve takes 765 stitches. The final numerical answer is:

Next, we find out how many cards remained after removing the cards with the letter A:

\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 80 - 32 = 48 \]

Then, we calculate how many of these remaining cards had the letter B on them. Since \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the remaining cards had the letter B, we have:

\[ \text{Cards with letter B} = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]

Now, we find out how many cards remained after removing the cards with the letter B:

\[ \text{Remaining cards after B} = 48 - 24 = 24 \]

Next, we calculate how many of these remaining cards had the letter C on them. Since \( \frac{5}{8} \) of the remaining cards had the letter C, we have:

\[ \text{Cards with letter C} = \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \]

Finally, we find out how many cards remained after removing the cards with the letter C:

\[ \text{Remaining cards after C} = 24 - 15 = 9 \]

These remaining cards had the letter D on them. Therefore, the number of cards that had the letter D on them is:

\[ \text{Cards with letter D} = 9 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 9 \]"
"To determine the total time Matthew will take to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we need to calculate the time for each type of hole separately and then sum them up.

First, calculate the time for the small holes:
- Time to dig one small hole = 3 minutes
- Number of small holes = 30
- Total time for small holes = 3 minutes/hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes

Next, calculate the time for the large holes:
- Time to dig one large hole = 10 minutes
- Number of large holes = 15
- Total time for large holes = 10 minutes/hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes

Now, sum the total time for both types of holes:
- Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

Finally, convert the total time from minutes to hours:
- Total time in hours = 240 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours

The final numerical answer is 4 hours."
"To determine the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we can start by defining their current ages as \( M \) and \( C \) respectively. According to the problem, the sum of their current ages is 20, which can be written as:

\[ M + C = 20 \]

In 10 years, Mico's age will be \( M + 10 \) and Marco's age will be \( C + 10 \). The sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

\[ (M + 10) + (C + 10) \]

Simplifying the expression, we get:

\[ M + C + 10 + 10 = M + C + 20 \]

Since we know from the problem statement that \( M + C = 20 \), we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[ 20 + 20 = 40 \]

Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

\[ 40 \]"
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, which translates to \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. This can be written as \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old. To verify, if Sam is 6 years old, then Ruby is \( 6 \times 6 = 36 \) years old. In 9 years, Sam will be \( 6 + 9 = 15 \) years old, and Ruby will be \( 36 + 9 = 45 \) years old. Indeed, 45 is 3 times 15, confirming our solution.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, we calculate the cost of the popsicles. Peter bought 20 popsicles at $0.25 each, so the total cost for the popsicles is:
\[ 20 \times 0.25 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the ice cream bars. Peter bought 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each, so the total cost for the ice cream bars is:
\[ 4 \times 0.50 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the total amount Peter paid, we add the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars:
\[ 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Peter paid is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of spots a mamba has. Since a cobra has 70 spots and a mamba has half as many spots as a cobra, a mamba has:

\[ \text{Spots per mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and all the mambas. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, so the total number of spots for the cobras is:

\[ \text{Total spots for cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots, so the total number of spots for the mambas is:

\[ \text{Total spots for mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Now, we find the combined total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas:

\[ \text{Total spots} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of this total:

\[ \text{Half the total spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 2450 \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of people who will be eating the pizza.

- There are 12 team members.
- There are 3 coaches.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so \(12 \text{ team members} \times 2 \text{ guests/team member} = 24 \text{ guests}\).

Adding these together, the total number of people is:
\[ 12 \text{ team members} + 3 \text{ coaches} + 24 \text{ guests} = 39 \text{ people} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Each pizza serves 3 people, so we divide the total number of people by the number of people each pizza can serve:
\[ \frac{39 \text{ people}}{3 \text{ people/pizza}} = 13 \text{ pizzas} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Each pizza costs $15, so:
\[ 13 \text{ pizzas} \times 15 \text{ dollars/pizza} = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Maddy will spend \(\boxed{195}\) dollars."
"To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to calculate the total length used by the topaz gemstones and then find out how much space is left for the sterling silver beads.

First, calculate the total length used by the topaz gemstones:
- Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long.
- Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace.
- Therefore, the total length used by the topaz gemstones is \(8 \times 1 = 8\) inches.

Next, determine the remaining length for the sterling silver beads:
- The total length of the necklace is 25 inches.
- The length used by the topaz gemstones is 8 inches.
- Therefore, the remaining length for the sterling silver beads is \(25 - 8 = 17\) inches.

Now, calculate the number of sterling silver beads used:
- Each sterling silver bead is 0.25 inches long.
- The remaining length for the sterling silver beads is 17 inches.
- Therefore, the number of sterling silver beads used is \(\frac{17}{0.25} = 68\).

"To find the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot altogether, we need to calculate the number of stories each wrote in both weeks and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of stories each wrote in the second week:
- Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week and doubled that in the second week, so she wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories in the second week.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week and doubled that in the second week, so he wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories in the second week.
- Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week and doubled that in the second week, so she wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories in the second week.

Next, we sum up the total number of stories written by each of them over the two weeks:
- Alani wrote \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories in total.
- Braylen wrote \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories in total.
- Margot wrote \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories in total.

Finally, we add up the total number of stories written by all three:
\[60 + 120 + 180 = 360\]

So, the total number of stories they wrote altogether is \(\boxed{360}\)."

"To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we first need to calculate the total number of stars accounted for by the rows of 8 and 6 stars, and then subtract this from the total number of stars to find the number of 5-star rows.

The total number of stars on the flag is 76. There are three rows of 8 stars and two rows of 6 stars. Let's calculate the total number of stars in these rows:

- Three rows of 8 stars: \(3 \times 8 = 24\)
- Two rows of 6 stars: \(2 \times 6 = 12\)

Adding these together gives the total number of stars in the rows of 8 and 6 stars:
\[24 + 12 = 36\]

Now, we subtract the number of stars in the rows of 8 and 6 stars from the total number of stars to find the number of stars in the rows of 5 stars:
\[76 - 36 = 40\]

Since each row of 5 stars contains 5 stars, we divide the number of stars in the 5-star rows by 5 to find the number of rows:
\[40 \div 5 = 8\]

Therefore, the number of rows of 5 stars is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"First, we need to calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight of 80 flagstones is:

\[ 80 \times 75 = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how many trucks are required to transport 6000 pounds, given that each truck can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds. We do this by dividing the total weight by the capacity of one truck:

\[ \frac{6000}{2000} = 3 \]

Since the division results in a whole number, 3 trucks are needed to transport the 80 flagstones in one trip. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since it is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, we calculate:

\[ \text{Speed of car in the slow lane} = \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it took the car in the fast lane to travel 480 miles. We use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the fast lane:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{fast lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at a constant speed of 30 miles/hour and it is covering the same distance of 480 miles, we calculate the time it took for the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{slow lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

\[ 16 \text{ hours} \]"

"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available:

- Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars.
- There are 8 packets.

So, the total number of chocolate bars is:
\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars/packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Next, let's determine how many chocolate bars the adults will get:

- There are 4 adults.
- Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars.

So, the total number of chocolate bars for the adults is:
\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars/adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, we can find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children:

\[ 40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

There are 8 children, and these 16 chocolate bars need to be shared equally among them:

\[ \frac{16 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars/child} \]

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the total time Susan works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total time in minutes is:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Susan takes a 30-minute break, so the actual time she spends working is:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} - 30 \text{ minutes} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how much money Susan earns in 150 minutes. She earns $5 every 10 minutes. To find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes, we divide 150 by 10:

\[ 150 \text{ minutes} \div 10 \text{ minutes/interval} = 15 \text{ intervals} \]

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, the total amount of money she earns is:

\[ 15 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ dollars/interval} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the initial points for each player:

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Next, we check if any of the players get an extra point in the fourth round. According to the rules, a player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points.

- Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so Mike gets an extra point.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so Jim does not get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so Tony gets an extra point.

Now, we add the extra points to their initial points:

- Mike's new total is \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
- Jim's total remains \(18\) points.
- Tony's new total is \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

Finally, we calculate the total points for all three players:

\[22 + 18 + 43 = 83\]

So, the total number of points all three players have after the extra points had been distributed is 83."

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day by the household.
2. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week by the household.
3. Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

First, let's calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day by the household. Since each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal and there are 5 members, and they eat rice at lunch and dinner, the total consumption per day is:
\[ 5 \text{ people} \times 0.2 \text{ kg/meal/person} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 2 \text{ kg/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week:

"To determine how much John pays a year for driving, we need to calculate the total miles driven in a year, the cost of the miles driven, and the total bonus given to the driver.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven in a year:
- John drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back home each day, so he drives 60 miles per day.
- He goes to work 5 days a week, so he drives 60 miles * 5 days = 300 miles per week.
- He works 50 weeks a year, so he drives 300 miles * 50 weeks = 15,000 miles per year.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the miles driven:
- He is charged $2 per mile, so the cost for the miles driven is 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000.

Now, let's calculate the total bonus given to the driver:
- He gives a $150 bonus per month, and there are 12 months in a year, so the total bonus is $150 * 12 = $1,800.

Finally, let's calculate the total amount John pays a year for driving:
- The total amount is the cost of the miles driven plus the total bonus, which is $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

The final numerical answer is $31,800."

"To determine how much money Watson made in April, we need to calculate his earnings from his hourly wage and his weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate Watson's daily earnings:
- Watson works 10 hours a day.
- He earns $10 per hour.

\[ \text{Daily earnings} = 10 \, \text{hours/day} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$100/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate his weekly earnings:
- Watson works 5 days a week.
- He earns $100 per day.

\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 5 \, \text{days/week} \times \$100/\text{day} = \$500/\text{week} \]

Since Watson gets a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well, his total weekly earnings when the company performs well are:

\[ \text{Total weekly earnings} = \$500 + \$300 = \$800/\text{week} \]

Now, we need to determine how many weeks are in April. April typically has 30 days.

\[ \text{Number of weeks in April} = \frac{30 \, \text{days}}{7 \, \text{days/week}} \approx 4.29 \]

Since Watson earns his weekly bonus for each full week, we consider only the full weeks in April:

\[ \text{Number of full weeks in April} = 4 \]

Finally, we calculate his total earnings for the month of April:

\[ \text{Total earnings for April} = 4 \, \text{weeks} \times \$800/\text{week} = \$3200 \]

Thus, the total amount of money Watson made in April, given that the company performed very well for the whole month, is:

John beats 80% of the 20 people he arm wrestled. To find out how many people he beat, we calculate 80% of 20:

\[ 0.80 \times 20 = 16 \]

This means John beat 16 people. Since he competed against 20 people in total, the number of people he lost to is:

\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 4."
"First, let's determine how many loaves of bread are sold in the morning. Since two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning, we calculate:

\[
\text{Morning sales} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
\]

Next, we find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales:

\[
\text{Loaves left after morning} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
\]

In the afternoon and evening, half of the remaining loaves are sold equally. Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening combined is:

\[
\text{Afternoon and evening sales combined} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
\]

Since the loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[
\text{Afternoon sales} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ loaves}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{5}
\]"
"First, we need to determine how much weight Joey loses in a single week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so the weight loss per week is:

\[ \text{Weight loss per week for Joey} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in 1 week, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds. Therefore, to lose the same amount of weight (2 pounds) that Joey loses in 1 week, Sandy will take:

\[ \text{Number of weeks for Sandy} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the savings on the ice cream. The original price of one tub of ice cream is $13, and it is now sold at $11. The discount per tub of ice cream is:

\[ 13 - 11 = 2 \]

So, the savings on one tub of ice cream is $2. Therefore, the savings on two tubs of ice cream would be:

\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \]

Next, let's calculate the savings on the milk. The discount on one packet of milk is $0.5. Therefore, the savings on four packets of milk would be:

\[ 0.5 \times 4 = 2 \]

Now, we add the savings from the ice cream and the milk to find the total savings:

\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \]

So, the total amount saved if you buy 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine the number of new limbs Helena's serum will cause a person to grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate how many times the person grows an extra arm and an extra leg within this period.

First, let's calculate the number of extra arms:
- The person grows an extra arm every 3 days.
- In 15 days, the number of times an extra arm is grown is \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \).

Next, let's calculate the number of extra legs:
- The person grows an extra leg every 5 days.
- In 15 days, the number of times an extra leg is grown is \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \).

Since the growth of arms and legs are independent events, we add the number of extra arms and extra legs to find the total number of new limbs:
- Total new limbs = Number of extra arms + Number of extra legs
- Total new limbs = 5 + 3 = 8

Therefore, after fifteen days, Helena's serum will cause a person to grow 8 new limbs."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
\[ 6 \text{ suits} \times \$100 \text{ per suit} = \$600 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
\[ 3 \text{ suitcases} \times \$50 \text{ per suitcase} = \$150 \]

Now, let's determine the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit:
\[ 5 \times \$100 + \$700 = \$500 + \$700 = \$1200 \]

Now, let's sum up all the expenses:
\[ \$600 \text{ (business suits)} + \$150 \text{ (suitcases)} + \$1200 \text{ (flight ticket)} = \$2050 \]

The total amount Theo has for the trip is $6000. He wants to save $2000, so the amount he can spend on the trip is:
\[ \$6000 - \$2000 = \$4000 \]

To find out how much he can spend on gifts for his business partners, we subtract the total expenses from the amount he can spend:
\[ \$4000 - \$2050 = \$1950 \]

Therefore, the amount Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa is:
\[ \$1950 \]"
"To determine the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum up the results.

First, let's identify the number of people in the family and their daily egg consumption:
- There are 5 people in the family.
- 3 people eat 3 eggs each day.
- The remaining 2 people eat 2 eggs each day.

Calculate the daily egg consumption for the 3 people:
\[ 3 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ eggs/person/day} = 9 \text{ eggs/day} \]

Calculate the daily egg consumption for the 2 people:
\[ 2 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ eggs/person/day} = 4 \text{ eggs/day} \]

Now, add the daily egg consumption of both groups to find the total daily egg consumption:
\[ 9 \text{ eggs/day} + 4 \text{ eggs/day} = 13 \text{ eggs/day} \]

To find the total egg consumption for a week (7 days), multiply the daily consumption by 7:
\[ 13 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 91 \text{ eggs} \]

Thus, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week."
"To find Trent's age, we need to first determine Jane's age and then use that to find Trent's age.

Given:
- Quinn is 30 years old.
- Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn.
- Trent is 5 years older than Jane.

First, calculate Jane's age:
\[ \text{Jane's age} = \text{Quinn's age} - 3 = 30 - 3 = 27 \]

Next, calculate Trent's age:
\[ \text{Trent's age} = \text{Jane's age} + 5 = 27 + 5 = 32 \]

So, Trent is 32 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 32 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera's current age is 46 years.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old six years ago.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since six years have passed, Noah's current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Let the current population of Chile be \(P\). Then, six years ago, the population was \(P / 2\).

4. **Use the given information about the population six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times the age of Noah.
   - Six years ago, Noah was 20 years old, so the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).
   - Therefore, \(P / 2 = 60000\).

5. **Calculate the current population of Chile:**
   - Solving for \(P\), we get \(P = 60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

The population of Chile now is \(\boxed{120000}\)."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players in the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining the terms on the left side:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 3D + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{6D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve for \( D \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 7:
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 30 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha initially invited:

- For the 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- For the 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we account for the people who couldn't come due to illness. This number is 8.

Then, we account for the people who couldn't come due to previous commitments. This number is \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the number of people who couldn't come due to illness, which is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \).

Therefore, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Finally, the number of people who show up for the party is the total number of people invited minus the number who couldn't come: \(24 - 10 = 14\).

The final numerical answer is:
14"
"First, let's determine the total number of marbles Solomon has after adding the marbles he bought from Johanna to the store.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and the store already had 50 marbles. So, the total number of marbles in the store after adding the bought marbles is:
\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \]

Next, we need to calculate the number of marbles Solomon received from his father. His father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as Solomon bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles, the number of marbles his father gave him is:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \]

Now, we add the marbles given by his father to the marbles already in the store:
\[ 70 + 8 = 78 \]

Each marble weighs 2 kg, so the total weight of the marbles is:
\[ 78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:
\[ \boxed{156} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is in the shape of a rectangular prism, and the volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 5 feet

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 5 \]

Now, let's calculate the volume:

\[ V = 24 \times 5 = 120 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is given as $0.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = \text{volume} \times \text{cost per cubic foot} \]

Substituting the volume and the cost per cubic foot:

\[ C = 120 \times 0.1 \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost:

\[ C = 12 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The number of girls is 3 times the number of boys.
2. The number of nongendered children is 1/10 the number of boys.
3. The classroom has 30 boys.

First, calculate the number of girls:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 3 \times \text{Number of boys} = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

Next, calculate the number of nongendered children:
\[ \text{Number of nongendered children} = \frac{1}{10} \times \text{Number of boys} = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3 \]

Now, add up all the children in the classroom:
\[ \text{Total number of children} = \text{Number of boys} + \text{Number of girls} + \text{Number of nongendered children} \]
\[ \text{Total number of children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 \]

So, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and there are 45 electric wires, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles.

Let \( P \) be the number of electric poles and \( W \) be the number of electric wires. According to the ratio, we have:
\[ \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Given \( W = 45 \), we can substitute this value into the proportion:
\[ \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \]

To find \( P \), we solve the equation by cross-multiplying:
\[ P = \frac{45}{3} \]
\[ P = 15 \]

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

\[
\boxed{15}

"First, let's determine the total number of people at the party at the beginning. There were 25 men and 15 women, so the total number of people was:

\[ 25 + 15 = 40 \]

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. Therefore, the number of people who left is:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

This means that the number of people remaining at the party is:

\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \]

We are also given that 22 men stayed at the party. Since the total number of people remaining is 30, the number of women remaining can be calculated by subtracting the number of men remaining from the total number of people remaining:

\[ 30 - 22 = 8 \]

So, the number of women left at the party is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, we need to determine the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book and the book costs $4, we can calculate the cost of the magazine as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of magazine} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cost of book} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of the pen, which is $1 less than the cost of the magazine. Therefore:

\[ \text{Cost of pen} = \text{Cost of magazine} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 \]

So, the cost of the pen is $1."
"First, let's determine the total number of pencils Jam has. We know that Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. Let's denote the number of pencils in each box as \( x \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]

To find the value of \( x \), we solve the equation step by step:

\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]
\[ 3x = 26 - 2 \]
\[ 3x = 24 \]
\[ x = \frac{24}{3} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, each box contains 8 pencils. Now, we can calculate the total number of pencils Jam has:

\[ 3 \times 8 + 2 = 24 + 2 = 26 \]

Jam has 26 pencils. Meg has 46 pencils. To find out how many boxes are needed to store all their pencils, we need to consider the number of pencils per box. Since each box holds 8 pencils, we need to determine how many boxes are required for 52 pencils (26 from Jam and 46 from Meg):

\[ \text{Total pencils} = 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Now, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the weakening of the coffee due to the cooling and the addition of cream.

First, let's determine how many ice cubes are used to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we can calculate the number of ice cubes used as follows:
\[ \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \]

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
\[ 5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters weaker per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker} \]

Next, we need to account for the addition of cream. The problem states that any added liquid also weakens the coffee. Since Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, this will also weaken the coffee by 15 milliliters.

Therefore, the total weakening of the coffee is the sum of the weakening due to the ice cubes and the weakening due to the cream:
\[ 60 \text{ milliliters weaker} + 15 \text{ milliliters weaker} = 75 \text{ milliliters weaker} \]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is \(\boxed{75}\) milliliters weaker when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream."
"If 5 people leave with 7 new records between them, and each person can trade 2 old records for 1 new record, then the total number of new records traded out is 7. Since each new record traded out comes from 2 old records, the total number of old records brought in by the 5 people is \(7 \times 2 = 14\).

The final numerical answer is 14."
"First, let's determine the number of junior and senior programmers.

Given that the total number of employees is 100 and the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:
\[ \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers is:
\[ \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Next, we know that each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total amount paid to junior programmers per month is:
\[ \text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

The senior programmers are paid $400 more than the junior programmers, so each senior programmer is paid:
\[ \text{Payment to each senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400 \]

Therefore, the total amount paid to senior programmers per month is:
\[ \text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

Finally, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers:
\[ \text{Total payment to all programmers} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{224000} \]"
"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the number of people on the bus became \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on, so the number of people on the bus became \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).

We are given that at the third stop, there were 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( 14 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 14 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school: \(24 - 2 = 22\) lollipops left.
3. He passes 14 lollipops to his friends: \(22 - 14 = 8\) lollipops left.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which means he buys \(2 \times 14 = 28\) lollipops: \(8 + 28 = 36\) lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night: \(36 - 3 = 33\) lollipops.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning: \(33 - 2 = 31\) lollipops.

So, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is 31."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much more the phone needs to be charged to reach 100% and then calculate the time required based on the charging rate.

The phone is currently at 60% charged and needs to reach 100%. Therefore, it needs to be charged by an additional 40 percentage points.

Given that the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time required to charge 40 percentage points as follows:

\[ \text{Time required} = 40 \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert this time into hours:

\[ \text{Time required in hours} = \frac{120 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \]"
"Erin initially has 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her an additional 10 lollipops, so she now has:

\[ 17 - 3 = 14 \text{ lollipops} \]

The final numerical answer is 14."
"To determine the final amount the customer paid, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip.
2. Apply the rewards to the current shopping trip.
3. Apply the coupon to the discounted price.

**Step 1: Calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip.**

The customer earns $1 off their next purchase for every $20 spent. They spent $80, so the rewards earned are:
\[ \text{Rewards} = \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Apply the rewards to the current shopping trip.**

The customer used their $4 rewards on the current shopping trip. So, the price after applying the rewards is:
\[ \text{Price after rewards} = 43 - 4 = 39 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Apply the coupon to the discounted price.**

The coupon takes twice the amount of rewards off the price. Since the rewards are $4, the coupon takes off:
\[ \text{Coupon discount} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final price after applying the coupon is:
\[ \text{Final price} = 39 - 8 = 31 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the customer paid \(\boxed{31}\) dollars on this shopping trip."
"First, let's calculate the net pay for Job A.

Job A pays $15 per hour for 2000 hours a year, so the gross pay is:
\[ 15 \times 2000 = 30000 \text{ dollars} \]

The state tax rate is 20%, so the tax Nick pays is:
\[ 30000 \times 0.20 = 6000 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the net pay for Job A is:
\[ 30000 - 6000 = 24000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the net pay for Job B.

Job B pays $42,000 a year, but there is a $6,000 property tax, so the net income after property tax is:
\[ 42000 - 6000 = 36000 \text{ dollars} \]

Job B has an additional 10% tax rate on the net income after property tax, so the tax Nick pays is:
\[ 36000 \times 0.10 = 3600 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the net pay for Job B is:
\[ 36000 - 3600 = 32400 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find the difference in net pay between the two jobs:
\[ 32400 - 24000 = 8400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Nick will make $8400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate compared to the other job. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 8400 \]"
"First, we need to find out how many castles are ruins. Since 40 percent of the 220 castles are ruins, we calculate:

Next, we need to find out how many of these ruined castles are unmanned. Since half of the ruined castles are unmanned, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of unmanned ruined castles} = 88 \times \frac{1}{2} = 44 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 44 \]"
"To determine the cost difference between the two offers, we first need to calculate the total cost for each offer.

For Furniture United:
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 installments of $350 each

The total cost for Furniture United is:
\[ \text{Total cost for Furniture United} = 1350 + (6 \times 350) \]

For Cozy Homes:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 installments of $250 each

The total cost for Cozy Homes is:
\[ \text{Total cost for Cozy Homes} = 1100 + (9 \times 250) \]

Let's calculate these values.
```python
# Calculating the total cost for each offer
total_cost_furniture_united = 1350 + (6 * 350)
total_cost_cozy_homes = 1100 + (9 * 250)

- DJ has 8 guns.
- Nick has 10 guns.
- RJ has 1 gun.
- Richard has 5 guns.

Adding these together:

\[ 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24 \]

So, they have a total of 24 paintball guns. 

To find out how many guns each person would have if they shared them equally, we divide the total number of guns by the number of people, which is 4.

\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \]

Therefore, if they share the guns equally, each person would have 6 guns. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \]"

"First, let's calculate the value of Maria's shares after the first year. She initially buys 8 shares at $8 each, so the initial total value of her shares is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8/\text{share} = \$64 \]

After the first year, the stock price increases by 50%. The new price per share after the increase is:

\[ \$8 \times (1 + 0.50) = \$8 \times 1.50 = \$12 \]

So, the value of her 8 shares after the first year is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12/\text{share} = \$96 \]

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. The new price per share after the decrease is:

\[ \$12 \times (1 - 0.25) = \$12 \times 0.75 = \$9 \]

So, the value of her 8 shares after the second year is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$9/\text{share} = \$72 \]

Therefore, the final value of all of Maria's shares is:

\[ \$72 \]"
"First, let's determine how many hot dogs Thomas ate. Since Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, we can calculate the number of hot dogs Thomas ate as follows:

\[ \text{Thomas's hot dogs} = 3 \times \text{Luke's hot dogs} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Next, we need to find out how many hot dogs John ate. John ate half the amount that Thomas ate, so:

\[ \text{John's hot dogs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Thomas's hot dogs} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \]

Now, to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's hot dogs} - \text{Luke's hot dogs} = 3 - 2 = 1 \]

So, John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 1 \]"
"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). Consequently, the number of students in the smallest group will be \( x - 10 \).

Given that the total number of students is 200, we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of students in all three groups:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two equal groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60."
"Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \) and the number of chickens as \( H \). According to the problem, the total number of animals is 60, so we have:
\[ C + H = 60 \]

It is also given that Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, so:
\[ H = 2C \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( C \):
\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:
\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of legs. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:
\[ \text{Total legs} = 2 \times H + 4 \times C = 2 \times 40 + 4 \times 20 = 80 + 80 = 160 \]

So, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week. After 4 weeks, he would have added \(4 \times 1 = 4\) balls. Therefore, he would have started juggling with \(3 + 4 = 7\) balls.

However, when he starts juggling on stage, he slips and drops 3 balls. This leaves him with \(7 - 3 = 4\) balls.

So, the final number of balls Josh starts juggling with on stage is 4."
"First, let's establish the weights of each animal based on the information given:

1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. A blue beetle weighs the same as a pink frog, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
3. A green toad weighs the same as a pink frog, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
4. A yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than a pink frog, so the yellow snake weighs \(50 + 10 = 60\) pounds.
5. A red bird weighs 20 pounds less than a pink frog, so the red bird weighs \(50 - 20 = 30\) pounds.

Now, let's calculate the total weight of one of each animal:
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds

Adding these weights together:
\[ 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 240 \text{ pounds} \]

The container itself weighs 20 pounds. Therefore, the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is:
\[ 240 + 20 = 260 \text{ pounds} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 260 \]"
"First, we calculate the number of outfits Laurel received at her baby shower. Since she received twice the amount she was given by her friend, we multiply 24 by 2:

\[ 24 \times 2 = 48 \]

Next, we add the outfits given by her friend and her mom to the outfits she received at her baby shower. She received 24 outfits from her friend and 15 from her mom, so we add these to the 48 outfits she received at her baby shower:

\[ 48 + 24 + 15 = 87 \]

Therefore, the total number of outfits Laurel has for her baby is:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many meters Tyson runs per day after taking his coach's advice.
2. Calculate the total distance he runs in a month.
3. Since June has 30 days, we will multiply the daily distance by 30.

First, let's find out how many meters Tyson runs per day after taking his coach's advice. The coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters than he currently runs. Since Tyson currently runs 5000 meters per day, the additional distance he should run is:

\[ \text{Additional distance} = 5000 \times \frac{1}{5} = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

So, the new daily distance Tyson runs is:

\[ \text{New daily distance} = 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters} \]

Next, we calculate the total distance Tyson runs in a month. Since June has 30 days, the total distance he runs in June is:

\[ \text{Total distance in June} = 6000 \times 30 = 180000 \text{ meters} \]

Therefore, the total distance Tyson covered in June is:

\[ \boxed{180000} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of each juice box:

- Juice Box A costs $4.
- Juice Box B costs $5 more than Juice Box A, so Juice Box B costs $4 + $5 = $9.
- Juice Box C costs $7 more than Juice Box A, so Juice Box C costs $4 + $7 = $11.

Now, to find out how much more Juice Box C costs than Juice Box B, we subtract the cost of Juice Box B from the cost of Juice Box C:

$11 - $9 = $2.

So, Juice Box C is $2 more expensive than Juice Box B. The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total number of legs, we need to consider the number of legs contributed by each type of table and then sum them up.

For the 40 tables with 4 legs each:
\[ 40 \times 4 = 160 \text{ legs} \]

For the 50 tables with 3 legs each:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \text{ legs} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of legs:
\[ 160 + 150 = 310 \]

So, the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is 310."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Jenny buys in a week:
\[ 1 \text{ bag/week} \times 36 \text{ cookies/bag} = 36 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cookies Jenny puts in her son's lunch box over the 5 days:
\[ 4 \text{ cookies/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 20 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Then, we calculate the number of cookies her husband eats over the 7 days:
\[ 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Now, we can find out how many cookies are left for Jenny to eat by subtracting the cookies put in the son's lunch box and the cookies eaten by her husband from the total number of cookies:
\[ 36 \text{ cookies/week} - 20 \text{ cookies/week} - 7 \text{ cookies/week} = 9 \text{ cookies/week} \]

So, Jenny eats 9 cookies a week."
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the 2 shirts without any discount. Since each shirt costs $30, the total cost for 2 shirts is:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Next, we need to apply the 40% discount. A 40% discount means Davos pays 60% of the original price. To find out how much he pays, we calculate 60% of $60:

\[ 60 \times 0.60 = 36 \]

So, the final amount Davos paid for the 2 shirts is:

\[ 36 \]"
"First, let's calculate the daily revenue from tractor sales:
- They sold 10 tractors a day.
- Each tractor was sold for $100.

So, the daily revenue from tractor sales is:
\[ 10 \text{ tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate the daily revenue from silo sales:
- They sell 5 silos a day.
- Each silo is sold for $220.

So, the daily revenue from silo sales is:
\[ 5 \text{ silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day} \]

Now, we need to find the percentage increase in daily revenue from tractors to silos:
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New revenue} - \text{Old revenue}}{\text{Old revenue}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\$1100 - \$1000}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{\$100}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage more they are making per day now is:
\[ \boxed{10\%} \]"
"To calculate how much money Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to first determine her monthly expenses and then multiply by 12 (the number of months in a year).

1. **Food Cost per Month:**
   - Food costs $25 per week.
   - There are 4 weeks in a month.
   - Therefore, the monthly cost for food is \( 25 \times 4 = 100 \) dollars.

2. **Treats Cost per Month:**
   - Treats cost $20 per month.
   - This amount remains the same.

3. **Medicine Cost per Month:**

"First, let's determine the number of plant pots needed for the roses. Since the number of plant pots needed for the roses is twice the number needed for the daisies, and 30 plant pots are needed for the daisies, the number of plant pots needed for the roses is:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of plant pots needed for both the daisies and the roses:

\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \]

April had already bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many plant pots she has left over, we subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number of plant pots she already bought:

\[ 100 - 90 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of plant pots April has left over is:

\[ 10 \]"
"Let's denote the amount of money Andrea saved as \( S \).

According to the problem, Andrea started with $36. She then spent some money on a sweater that cost $11 and gave her brother $4. The remaining money after these expenditures is what she had saved.

We can set up the following equation to represent the situation:

\[ S + 11 + 4 = 36 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ S + 15 = 36 \]

To find \( S \), we subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ S = 36 - 15 \]

\[ S = 21 \]

So, Andrea saved $21. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 21 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming.

John spends 6 hours boating. He spends half that time swimming, which is:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time spent on boating and swimming is:
\[ 6 + 3 = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total time he spent watching the shows. He watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is:
\[ 9 + 6 = 15 \text{ hours} \]

We know that this 15 hours represents 30% of the total time he spent on his vacation. Let \( T \) be the total time spent on the vacation. Then:
\[ 0.30T = 15 \]
\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John spent 40% of his total time sightseeing. Therefore, the time spent sightseeing is:
\[ 0.40 \times 50 = 20 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Annabelle will earn from her first job. She earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours, so her earnings from the first job are:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money she will earn from her second job. She earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours, so her earnings from the second job are:
\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's find the total amount of money Annabelle will have after working at both jobs. She already has $80 in her savings, so the total amount she will have after working is:
\[ 80 + 200 + 75 = 355 \text{ dollars} \]

\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the combined height of the shortest and the second tree:
\[ 6 + 11 = 17 \text{ feet} \]

The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and the second tree:
\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height of the tallest tree is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the toy cars Dean bought. Since each toy car costs $2 and he bought 6 of them, the total cost for the toy cars is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the teddy bears Dean bought. Since each teddy bear costs $1 and he bought 5 of them, the total cost for the teddy bears is:
\[ 5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's find the total amount Dean spent on the toy cars and teddy bears:
\[ 12 + 5 = 17 \text{ dollars} \]

Dean initially had $28, so after spending $17, the amount of money he has left is:
\[ 28 - 17 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

Dean's mother then gives him an extra $10. Adding this to the $11 he has left, the total amount of money Dean has now is:

"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we first need to calculate the total cost of the activities she wants to do for herself and her friends.

1. **Cost of mini-golf**: Since she wants to play one round of mini-golf, the cost is $5.
2. **Cost of arcade tokens**: She wants to have $5 in arcade tokens, so the cost is $5.
3. **Cost of go-karts**: She wants to ride the go-karts twice, and each ride costs $10, so the cost is $10 * 2 = $20.

Now, we add up all these costs:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of mini-golf} + \text{Cost of arcade tokens} + \text{Cost of go-karts} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 5 + 5 + 20 = 30 \]

Morgan's total budget is $90. After accounting for the costs of the activities, the remaining budget is:
\[ \text{Remaining budget} = 90 - 30 = 60 \]

Since each friend will get the same set of activities (one round of mini-golf, $5 in arcade tokens, and two rides on go-karts), the cost for each friend is $30 (same as Morgan's total cost). Therefore, the number of friends she can invite is:
\[ \text{Number of friends} = \frac{\text{Remaining budget}}{\text{Cost per friend}} \]
\[ \text{Number of friends} = \frac{60}{30} = 2 \]

So, Morgan can invite 2 friends. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate how much Marisa spends on lollipops each day. She buys 4 lollipops every day, and each lollipop costs 25 cents. Therefore, the cost of the lollipops each day is:

\[ 4 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 100 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, 100 cents is equivalent to 1 dollar. So, Marisa spends $1 on lollipops each day.

Next, we need to determine how much money Marisa saves each day. She gets $5 as pocket money every day and spends $1 on lollipops, so her savings each day are:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars} - 1 \text{ dollar} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much she saves over 5 days. Since she saves $4 each day, over 5 days she saves:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

"First, let's determine how much money Billy spent on gumballs. He bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, so the total cost for the gumballs is:
\[ 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Since he took half of his change and spent it on gumballs, the total amount of money he had initially was twice the amount he spent on gumballs:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Billy started with $10, so the amount of money he spent on candy is:
\[ 10 - 4 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of the candy is $1.5 per pound. To find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we divide the total amount spent on candy by the cost per pound:
\[ \frac{6}{1.5} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy. The final numerical answer is:

To find \( x \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the distance of the entire trip from the first city to the third city and back to the first city.

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city back to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the second and third city trip, which is \(100 - 50 = 50\) miles.

So, the total distance for one complete round trip (first to second, then second to third, and finally third to first) is:
\[75 + 100 + 50 = 225 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[225 \times 3 = 675 \text{ miles}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance traveled in one day by the service interval:
\[\frac{675}{18000} = \frac{675 \div 75}{18000 \div 75} = \frac{9}{240} = \frac{3}{80}\]

To find the number of days between services, we take the reciprocal of \(\frac{3}{80}\), which is \(\frac{80}{3}\). Calculating this gives:
\[\frac{80}{3} \approx 26.67\]

Since the train cannot go a fraction of a day between services, we round up to the next whole number. Therefore, the train goes between services every 27 days.

The final numerical answer is:
\[27\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of stuffing required for each type of dog bed and then calculate the total amount needed for the specified number of beds.

First, let's find out how much stuffing a collie bed requires. The collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. A Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds of stuffing, and a chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing. The average is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the 4 chihuahua beds:

\[
\text{Total stuffing for chihuahuas} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

Then, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the 3 collie beds:

\[
\text{Total stuffing for collies} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the stuffing needed for the chihuahuas and the collies to find the total amount of stuffing Mark needs:

\[
\text{Total stuffing} = 8 + 15 = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the time John spent driving to his friend's house. The distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, and he drives at a speed of 70 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time taken to drive to his friend's house is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} = \frac{200 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{200}{70} \text{ hours} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 2.857 \text{ hours} \]

Next, John took a detour that added 10 miles to his trip, making the total distance to his friend's house 210 miles. The time taken for this detour is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{210}{70} \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the time John spent driving back home. The distance home is 240 miles, and he drives at a speed of 80 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{back home}} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = \frac{240}{80} \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, the total time for the trip is the sum of the time taken to drive to his friend's house, the time taken for the detour, and the time taken to drive back home:

\[ \text{Total Time} = \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} + \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} + \text{Time}_{\text{back home}} \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{20}{7} + 3 + 3 \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{20}{7} + 6 \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{20}{7} + \frac{42}{7} \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{62}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 8.857 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time for the trip is:

\[ \frac{62}{7} \text{ hours} \]

To provide the final numerical answer:

\[ 8.857 \text{ hours} \]

However, if the question requires the answer in fractional form, the final answer is:

"Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as \( C \). According to the problem, \( C = 3 \).

The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is four times the number of customers minus 5, which can be expressed as \( 4C - 5 \). Substituting \( C = 3 \) into this expression, we get:
\[ 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7. \]
So, 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting.

The number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is three times the number of shoplifters, which can be expressed as \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \).

Now, we know the total number of customers and shoplifters:
\[ C + 7 = 3 + 7 = 10. \]

The total number of people kicked out of the Walmart is 50. Therefore, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:
\[ 50 - (C + 7) = 50 - 10 = 40. \]

So, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is 40."

Erin scored 14 points to reach her current total of 24 points. Therefore, the number of points Erin had before scoring the 14 points is:
\[ \text{Erin's points before} = \text{Erin's current points} - \text{points scored} = 24 - 14 = 10 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break down the expenses into different components and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of picture frames:**
   - Each picture frame costs $20.
   - Each frame needs to be etched at an additional 20% cost.
   - The total cost per frame is $20 + (20% of $20) = $20 + $4 = $24.
   - There are 44 seniors, so the total cost for the picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. **Cost of pins:**
   - 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each.
   - The total cost for the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

3. **Cost of cords for officers:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so there are 44 / 4 = 11 officers.
   - Each officer will receive a cord that costs $12.
   - The total cost for the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, we sum up all the costs:
- Cost of picture frames: $1056
- Cost of pins: $10
- Cost of cords: $132

Total cost = $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"To determine the total cost for Ethan if he makes his own hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the savings from the DIY option and then subtract that from the original cost.

The original cost of the wallpaper is $400. The DIY option saves 20% of this cost. First, we calculate 20% of $400:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.20 \times 400 = 80 \]

This means Ethan saves $80 by making his own wallpaper. Therefore, the total cost for Ethan if he makes his own wallpaper is:

\[ 400 - 80 = 320 \]

So, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"To find the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale, we need to calculate the number of pairs sold each day and then account for the returns.

1. **Friday Sales**: The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.
2. **Saturday Sales**: The store sold double the number of pairs sold on Friday. Therefore, the number of pairs sold on Saturday is:
   \[
   2 \times 14 = 28 \text{ pairs}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of pieces of equipment purchased and then calculate the cost of the functioning pieces.

First, let's denote the total number of pieces of equipment as \( N \). According to the problem, 40% of the total number of pieces were faulty. Therefore, the number of faulty pieces is \( 0.4N \).

The number of functioning pieces is the total number of pieces minus the number of faulty pieces:
\[ N - 0.4N = 0.6N \]

The cost of the equipment is $400,000. Since the faulty pieces are returned, the company only pays for the functioning pieces. The cost of the functioning pieces is:
\[ 0.6N \times \frac{400000}{N} = 0.6 \times 400000 = 240000 \]

Thus, the total amount of money spent on the functioning pieces of equipment is:

"To determine the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. **Determine the number of sheep that provide 1 kg of milk each:**
   - Mary has 30 sheep in total.
   - Half of the sheep provide 1 kg of milk each.
   - Therefore, the number of sheep providing 1 kg of milk is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \).

2. **Determine the number of sheep that provide 2 kg of milk each:**
   - The other half of the sheep provide 2 kg of milk each.
   - Therefore, the number of sheep providing 2 kg of milk is also \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \).

3. **Calculate the total milk from the sheep providing 1 kg of milk:**
   - Each of these 15 sheep provides 1 kg of milk.
   - Therefore, the total milk from these sheep is \( 15 \times 1 = 15 \) kg.

4. **Calculate the total milk from the sheep providing 2 kg of milk:**
   - Each of these 15 sheep provides 2 kg of milk.
   - Therefore, the total milk from these sheep is \( 15 \times 2 = 30 \) kg.

5. **Calculate the total milk collected every day:**
   - Add the milk from both groups of sheep.
   - Therefore, the total milk collected every day is \( 15 + 30 = 45 \) kg.

The final numerical answer is 45 kg."

"First, we need to determine how many pupils like blue. Since half of the class likes blue, we calculate:

\[
\text{Pupils who like blue} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Next, we find out how many pupils are left after accounting for those who like blue:

\[
\text{Remaining pupils} = 40 - 20 = 20
\]

One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green. So, we calculate:

\[
\text{Pupils who like green} = \frac{20}{4} = 5
\]

The rest of the pupils like yellow. Therefore, the number of pupils who like yellow is:

\[
\text{Pupils who like yellow} = 20 - 5 = 15

"First, we need to determine how many apples Lucy sold on Monday. Given that she sold all the apples she picked on Monday and received $56 from selling them at $4 per piece, we can calculate the number of apples sold on Monday as follows:

\[
\text{Number of apples sold on Monday} = \frac{\$56}{\$4/\text{apple}} = 14 \text{ apples}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many apples Lucy picked on Tuesday and Wednesday. According to the problem, on Tuesday, she picked 12 apples. On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday:

\[
\text{Number of apples picked on Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ apples}
\]

Now, we can calculate the total number of apples picked over the three days by summing the apples picked on each day:

\[
\text{Total number of apples} = \text{Apples picked on Monday} + \text{Apples picked on Tuesday} + \text{Apples picked on Wednesday}
\]

Since the number of apples picked on Monday is 14, and the apples picked on Tuesday and Wednesday are 12 and 24 respectively, we have:

\[
\text{Total number of apples} = 14 + 12 + 24 = 50
\]

"To determine how many socks Lindsay has missed, we first need to calculate the total number of socks she has washed.

A pair of socks consists of 2 socks. Lindsay washes 10 pairs, so the number of socks from the pairs is:
\[ 10 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ socks per pair} = 20 \text{ socks} \]

She also washes 15 loose socks. Therefore, the total number of socks she has washed is:
\[ 20 \text{ socks from pairs} + 15 \text{ loose socks} = 35 \text{ socks} \]

Lindsay started with 50 socks. To find out how many socks she has missed, we subtract the number of socks she has washed from the total number of socks:

"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we first need to calculate the total interest she will pay over the five months and then find the total amount she will repay. Finally, we will divide this total repayment amount by the number of months.

The formula to calculate the total amount to be repaid is:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + (\text{Principal} \times \text{Interest Rate} \times \text{Time}) \]

Given:
- Principal (\(P\)) = $3,650
- Interest Rate (\(r\)) = 10% = 0.10
- Time (\(t\)) = 5 months

First, calculate the interest:
\[ \text{Interest} = P \times r \times t = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 5 = 1825 \]

Next, calculate the total amount to be repaid:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = P + \text{Interest} = 3650 + 1825 = 5475 \]

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month over five months, we divide the total amount by the number of months:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{5475}{5} = 1095 \]

So, Karan has to pay $1095 per month.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we calculate the distance Cho hiked. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Cho, the speed is 14 kilometers per hour and the time is 8 hours. So, the distance Cho hiked is:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{h} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, we calculate the distance Chloe hiked. The speed for Chloe is 9 kilometers per hour and the time is 5 hours. So, the distance Chloe hiked is:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{h} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked, we subtract the distance Chloe hiked from the distance Cho hiked:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

"First, let's determine the number of silver and gold pesos Anna has.

Axel has 50 silver pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Axel has 80 gold pesos. Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so:
\[ 80 + 40 = 120 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of silver pesos they have together:
\[ 50 \text{ (Axel's silver pesos)} + 100 \text{ (Anna's silver pesos)} = 150 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of gold pesos they have together:
\[ 80 \text{ (Axel's gold pesos)} + 120 \text{ (Anna's gold pesos)} = 200 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Finally, to find the total number of pesos they have together, we add the total number of silver pesos and the total number of gold pesos:
\[ 150 \text{ (silver pesos)} + 200 \text{ (gold pesos)} = 350 \text{ pesos} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 350 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make with her supplies. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she can make 3 pitchers, the total number of cups is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups/pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to determine the revenue from selling all 36 cups of lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue is:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1/\text{cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to find out how much it costs her to make the lemonade. She spent $18 to buy the supplies, so the cost is:

\[ \$18 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Millie sells all of the lemonade, and she sells an average of 4 cups per hour. Therefore, the profit per hour is:

\[ \frac{\$18}{4 \text{ hours}} = \$4.50/\text{hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$4.50 \]"
"Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially as \( L \).

According to the problem, he sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. We know that this remaining amount is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5} L = 12.8
\]

To find the total amount of land \( L \), we need to solve for \( L \). We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
L = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, let's perform the multiplication:

\[
L = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
\]

So, Mr. Ruther initially had 32 hectares of land.

The final numerical answer is:

\[

"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 50\% \times 52 = 0.5 \times 52 = 26 \]

Since the choir is evenly split between boys and girls, the number of boys is also 26.

Next, we need to find out how many female members will perform. Since all female members are performing, the number of female members is:

\[ \text{Number of female members} = 26 \]

On the day of the performance, half of the female members can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of female members who can't make it is:

\[ \text{Number of female members who can't make it} = \frac{26}{2} = 13 \]

This means the number of female members who do make it to the performance is:

\[ \text{Number of female members who make it} = 26 - 13 = 13 \]

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many popsicles Betty and Sam each have based on the given ratio and total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. Together, they have a total of 165 popsicles.

First, we find the sum of the parts of the ratio:
\[ 5 + 6 = 11 \]

This means that the total number of popsicles (165) is divided into 11 equal parts. To find the number of popsicles in one part, we divide the total number of popsicles by 11:
\[ \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can find out how many popsicles Betty and Sam have individually:
- Betty has \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \) popsicles.
- Sam has \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

"First, let's convert all the time spent into the same unit. We'll use minutes for this calculation.

- Time spent writing a song: 4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes
- Time spent recording: half of the time spent writing = 240 / 2 = 120 minutes
- Time spent editing: 90 minutes

Now, let's calculate the total work time in minutes:
- Total work time = Time spent writing + Time spent recording + Time spent editing
- Total work time = 240 + 120 + 90 = 450 minutes

Next, we calculate the percentage of the total work time that was spent editing:
- Percentage spent editing = (Time spent editing / Total work time) * 100
- Percentage spent editing = (90 / 450) * 100 = 0.2 * 100 = 20%

Flour is sold in 2-cup bags:
- \( \frac{12 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups per bag}} = 6 \text{ bags} \)

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles:
- \( \frac{4 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups per bottle}} = 2 \text{ bottles} \)

Finally, to find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:
- \( 6 \text{ bags} - 2 \text{ bottles} = 4 \)

The final numerical answer is:
4"
"To determine the energy savings, we first need to calculate the energy consumption of the air conditioner under the original and reduced usage conditions.

1. **Original Usage:**
   - Power consumption: 900 watts
   - Usage time: 8 hours per day
   - Daily energy consumption: \( 900 \, \text{watts} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watt-hours} \)
   - Converting watt-hours to kilowatt-hours: \( 7200 \, \text{watt-hours} \div 1000 = 7.2 \, \text{kilowatt-hours} \)
   - Daily energy consumption in kilowatt-hours: 7.2 kWh

2. **Reduced Usage:**
   - Reduced usage time: 8 hours - 5 hours = 3 hours per day
   - Daily energy consumption: \( 900 \, \text{watts} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watt-hours} \)
   - Converting watt-hours to kilowatt-hours: \( 2700 \, \text{watt-hours} \div 1000 = 2.7 \, \text{kilowatt-hours} \)
   - Daily energy consumption in kilowatt-hours: 2.7 kWh

3. **Energy Savings per Day:**
   - Savings per day: \( 7.2 \, \text{kilowatt-hours} - 2.7 \, \text{kilowatt-hours} = 4.5 \, \text{kilowatt-hours} \)

4. **Energy Savings in 30 Days:**
   - Total savings in 30 days: \( 4.5 \, \text{kilowatt-hours/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kilowatt-hours} \)

The final numerical answer is 135 kilowatt-hours."
"First, let's calculate the total number of stripes on all the zebras Jane counted.

- Two zebras with 17 stripes each: \(2 \times 17 = 34\) stripes
- One zebra with 36 stripes: \(36\) stripes
- One zebra with half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes: \(36 / 2 = 18\) stripes

Now, let's add up all the stripes:
\[34 + 36 + 18 = 88\]

There are a total of 4 zebras, so to find the average number of stripes per zebra, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras:
\[88 / 4 = 22\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[22\]"

Therefore, the total amount of money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese is $50.00."
"First, let's determine the initial number of corns Allan has. According to the problem, there is twice as much corn as cannolis. Given that Allan initially has 40 cannolis, we can calculate the initial number of corns as follows:

\[ \text{Initial number of corns} = 2 \times \text{Initial number of cannolis} = 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

Next, Allan bought 60 more cannolis at the store. Therefore, the new number of cannolis is:

\[ \text{New number of cannolis} = \text{Initial number of cannolis} + 60 = 40 + 60 = 100 \]

Allan also bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought. Since he bought 60 more cannolis, the number of corns he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of corns bought} = 60 - 40 = 20 \]

Adding these 20 corns to the initial number of corns, the new total number of corns is:

\[ \text{New total number of corns} = \text{Initial number of corns} + \text{Number of corns bought} = 80 + 20 = 100 \]

Now, we can find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house:

\[ \text{Combined total} = \text{New total number of corns} + \text{New number of cannolis} = 100 + 100 = 200 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we can break down the information given:

1. Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day.
2. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Therefore, he walked 5,000 steps to and from school.
3. He also walked an additional 1,000 steps with his friend.
4. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps.

First, we calculate the total number of steps Elliott had taken before his jog:
\[ 5,000 \text{ (to and from school)} + 1,000 \text{ (with his friend)} = 6,000 \text{ steps} \]

Next, we know that after his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps. Therefore, the number of steps he took during his jog is:
\[ 10,000 - 6,000 - 2,000 = 2,000 \text{ steps} \]

So, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is:
\[ \boxed{2000} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total number of words in the book. The book is 45 pages long and averages 200 words per page. Therefore, the total number of words in the book is:

\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Toby to read the entire book. Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute. Therefore, the time it takes to read the book is:

\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby plans to leave as soon as he finishes the book and it takes him 10 minutes to get to the airport. Therefore, the total time Toby will spend from starting to read until he reaches the airport is:

\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby has 60 minutes until he needs to be at the airport. Therefore, the number of minutes early Toby will be is:

\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 40 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by employees in May:**
   - Number of employees in May: 40
   - Hours worked per employee per week: 40
   - Weeks in May: 4 (assuming May has 4 weeks)
   - Total hours worked by employees in May = 40 employees * 40 hours/employee * 4 weeks = 6400 hours

2. **Calculate the total amount of money paid to employees in May:**
   - Hourly wage per employee: $15
   - Total amount paid in May = 6400 hours * $15/hour = $96,000

3. **Calculate the number of employees whose contracts expired in June:**
   - Number of employees whose contracts expired = 1/4 of 40 = 10 employees

4. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by employees in June:**
   - Number of employees remaining in June = 40 - 10 = 30 employees
   - Hours worked per employee per week: 40
   - Weeks in June: 4 (assuming June has 4 weeks)

"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is sold in a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. Sally bought 2 pounds of taffy.

For the first pound, the cost is $3.
For the second pound, the cost is $3 - $1.50 = $1.50 (since it's half off).

So, the total cost for the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50 and the magnets cost $0.25 each. Sally bought 4 magnets.

The total cost for the seashells and magnets is $1.50 + 4 * $0.25 = $1.50 + $1.00 = $2.50.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items Sally bought:
Total cost = Cost of taffy + Cost of seashells and magnets
Total cost = $4.50 + $2.50 = $7.00.

Sally's parents gave her $10 to spend. So, the amount of money Sally has left is:
Money left = Initial amount - Total cost
Money left = $10 - $7.00 = $3.00.

The final numerical answer is $3.00."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the two packs of fireworks. The first pack costs $400, and the second pack costs twice as much, which is $800. Therefore, the total cost of the two packs before the discount is:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Next, Tim gets a 20% discount on these fireworks. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $1200:

\[ 0.20 \times 1200 = 240 \]

Subtracting the discount from the total cost of the fireworks gives:

\[ 1200 - 240 = 960 \]

Now, Tim also buys a finale firework that costs $150. Adding this to the discounted cost of the fireworks gives the total amount spent:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

So, the total amount Tim spent is:

\[ \boxed{1110} \]"
"Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies a night. Over 30 days, she will eat:
\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, the number of dozens she needs to make to have 60 cookies is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. We know that 5% of the candles are dangerous and have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. Additionally, 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode. Therefore, 1% of the candles are dangerous and do not have the defect.

First, let's find out how many candles are dangerous:
\[ \text{Number of dangerous candles} = 5\% \text{ of } 50000 = 0.05 \times 50000 = 2500 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these dangerous candles also have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. Since 5% of the candles are dangerous and have the defect, we calculate:
\[ \text{Number of dangerous candles with the defect} = 5\% \text{ of } 2500 = 0.05 \times 2500 = 125 \]

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is:

"First, we need to determine the discount price for each blouse. The regular price of each blouse is $20, and there is a 30% discount.

The discount amount per blouse is calculated as:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Regular Price} \times \text{Discount Rate} = 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]

So, the discounted price per blouse is:
\[ \text{Discounted Price} = \text{Regular Price} - \text{Discount Amount} = 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so the total cost for the discounted blouses is:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \text{Discounted Price} \times \text{Number of Blouses} = 14 \times 4 = 56 \]

"Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees as \( A \).

From the problem, we know:
- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples.
- Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
- Joanne's sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
- Joanne's sister doesn't take any apples from the average trees, so she contributes 0 apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is:
\[ 30 + 15 + A \]

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne's sister is:
\[ 60 + 45 + 0 = 105 \]

The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500:
\[ (30 + 15 + A) + (60 + 45) = 500 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 45 + A + 105 = 500 \]
\[ 150 + A = 500 \]
\[ A = 500 - 150 \]
\[ A = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of camels as \( C \) and the number of dromedaries as \( D \).

From the problem, we have two equations:
1. The total number of heads: \( C + D = 180 \)
2. The total number of humps: \( 2C + D = 304 \)

We can solve these equations simultaneously. First, we can express \( C \) from the first equation:
\[ C = 180 - D \]

Next, we substitute \( C \) in the second equation:
\[ 2(180 - D) + D = 304 \]
\[ 360 - 2D + D = 304 \]
\[ 360 - D = 304 \]
\[ -D = 304 - 360 \]
\[ -D = -56 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

"To find the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we need to break down the distances traveled each day and then sum them up.

1. **First 4 days:**
   - Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the first 4 days: \( 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \).

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - Tom traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days.
   - Distance traveled in the next 2 days: \( 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \).

3. **The next day:**
   - Tom didn't travel at all, so the distance for this day is 0 km.

4. **Second week:**
   - Tom traveled 300 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the second week: \( 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \).

Now, we sum up all the distances:
- First 4 days: 800 km
- Next 2 days: 240 km
- The next day: 0 km
- Second week: 2100 km

Total distance traveled: \( 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km} \).

"To determine how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to find the difference in elevation between Oliver and Stanley's comb.

Stanley's comb is at an elevation of 10,000 feet (where Stanley was standing initially) and then it fell 4,000 feet to a ledge below. Therefore, the comb is at an elevation of:
\[ 10,000 \text{ feet} - 4,000 \text{ feet} = 6,000 \text{ feet} \]

Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb at 6,000 feet, we subtract Oliver's elevation from the comb's elevation:
\[ 6,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 3,000 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb. The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine how much money Mr. Josue received from the second bank. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is $4000. Therefore, the amount from the second bank is:

\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Mr. Josue received from both banks by adding the amounts from each bank:

\[ 4000 + 8000 = 12000 \]

Now, we add the total amount of money he received from the banks to his initial capital. Mr. Josue initially had $5000 in capital. Therefore, the total capital he has now is:

"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:

\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of both pairs of jeans:

\[ 28 + 22 = 50 \]

Cole saved a total of $6. According to the problem, he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. Let's denote the total savings as \( S \). Since he saved $6 in total, we have:

\[ S = 6 \]

The savings from the jogger jeans is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]

The savings from the tattered jeans is:

"First, let's determine the total number of bird feeders Lillian has. She builds 3 and buys 3 more, so she has a total of 3 + 3 = 6 bird feeders.

Next, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted by the feeders. The feeders she made herself attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones. Since each store-bought feeder attracts 20 birds, each feeder she made attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds.

Now, we can calculate the total number of birds attracted by all the feeders. There are 3 store-bought feeders and 3 feeders she made, so the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders is 3 * 20 = 60 birds. The total number of birds attracted by the feeders she made is 3 * 30 = 90 birds.

Adding these together, the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is 60 + 90 = 150 birds.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the cost of the soup. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. Since the bagel costs $4, we can calculate the cost of the soup as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of soup} = \text{Cost of bagel} + 0.25 \times \text{Cost of bagel} \]
\[ \text{Cost of soup} = 4 + 0.25 \times 4 \]
\[ \text{Cost of soup} = 4 + 1 \]
\[ \text{Cost of soup} = 5 \]

Next, we know the cake costs half the price of the bagel. Since the bagel costs $4, the cake costs:

\[ \text{Cost of cake} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cost of bagel} \]
\[ \text{Cost of cake} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 \]
\[ \text{Cost of cake} = 2 \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the dinner by adding the cost of the soup, the bagel, and the cake:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of soup} + \text{Cost of bagel} + \text{Cost of cake} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 5 + 4 + 2 \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 11 \]

So, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for the dinner she ordered."
"Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( x \).

Kenny keeps \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his cards, so he sells \( \frac{2}{3} \) of them. The number of cards he sells is \( \frac{2}{3}x \).

He sells each card for $1.5, so the total amount of money he earns from selling the cards is \( 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}x = x \).

According to the problem, after spending $50 on the ticket, he has $50 left. This means the total amount of money he earned from selling the cards is $100 (the cost of the ticket plus the $50 he has left).

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ x = 100 \]

Therefore, Kenny started with 100 cards.

However, 40 guests showed up, and each guest wanted a second hotdog. The total number of hotdogs needed for 40 guests, each wanting a second hotdog, is:

\[
40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ hotdogs}
\]

The caterer only prepared 36 hotdogs. Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is the difference between the number of guests and the number of hotdogs:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- The pot and pans set cost $120.00.
- The set of mixing bowls cost $20.00.
- The 5 utensils cost $5.00 each, so the total for the utensils is $5.00 * 5 = $25.00.

Adding these together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[ 120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $165.00:
\[ 0.20 \times 165.00 = 33.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Charlotte has to pay:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Dora wants to buy:
- Skipping rope: $6
- Board game: $11
- Playground ball: $2

Total cost = $6 + $11 + $2 = $19

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Dora currently has:
- Money from allowance: $2
- Money from mother: $16

Total money Dora has = $2 + $16 = $18

Now, let's find out how much more money Dora needs:
- Total cost of items: $19
- Total money Dora has: $18

Money Dora still needs = $19 - $18 = $1

The final numerical answer is $1."
"First, let's determine how many dragons Prince Arthur slew. Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons, and Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many. Therefore, we calculate:

\[
\text{Dragons slain by Prince Arthur} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
\]

Next, we calculate how many dragons Prince Walter slew. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur:

\[
\text{Dragons slain by Prince Walter} = 2 \times 75 = 150
\]

Finally, we determine how many dragons Prince Bruce slew. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter:

\[
\text{Dragons slain by Prince Bruce} = \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30
\]

Thus, the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew is:

\[
\boxed{30}

"First, we need to determine how much gas is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we can calculate the amount of gas per container as follows:

\[ \text{Gas per container} = \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5 \text{ containers}} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Josey needed \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a container, so we calculate the amount of gas she needed in gallons:

\[ \text{Gas needed by Josey} = \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to convert gallons to pints. Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we can convert \( \frac{3}{4} \) gallons to pints as follows:

\[ \text{Gas needed by Josey in pints} = \frac{3}{4} \times 8 \text{ pints} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine how much money George spent on chips. We know that George got 3 bags of chips and each bag costs 40 cents. Therefore, the total cost for the chips is:
\[ 3 \times 40 \text{ cents} = 120 \text{ cents} \]

Since George spent $5, which is 500 cents, and he had 1% of his money left after buying the chips, we can calculate how much money he had left:
\[ 500 \text{ cents} - 120 \text{ cents} = 380 \text{ cents} \]
This 380 cents is 1% of his original $5, which confirms our calculation since 1% of 500 cents is indeed 50 cents, and 500 cents - 50 cents = 450 cents, but we are given that he had 380 cents left, which is consistent with the problem statement.

Now, we need to find out how much money George spent on candy bars. Since he spent 120 cents on chips, the remaining money he had was 380 cents, which means he spent:
\[ 500 \text{ cents} - 120 \text{ cents} = 380 \text{ cents} \]
on candy bars. Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, the number of candy bars he bought is:
\[ \frac{380 \text{ cents}}{75 \text{ cents per candy bar}} = \frac{380}{75} = \frac{76}{15} \approx 5.0667 \]

Since the number of candy bars must be a whole number, and 380 cents is exactly 5 candy bars with 25 cents left over (which is not enough to buy another candy bar), we conclude that George bought 5 candy bars.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Ray started with 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. Therefore, the number of lollipops he shared with his friends is:

\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \]

\[ \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Thus, each of his friends received 5 lollipops. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 5 \]"
"Rory and her mom each have a piece, which means they have 2 pieces in total. The cake originally weighs 20 ounces, and after Rory and her mom have taken their pieces, there are 20 - 2 = 18 ounces of cake remaining.

The remaining cake weighs 18 ounces."
"First, we need to find the total number of oranges that Sitti and Juris have together. Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges, so the total number of oranges is:

\[ 34 + 22 = 56 \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of people sharing the oranges. Sitti and Juris are sharing with their 6 other friends, so the total number of people is:

\[ 2 + 6 = 8 \]

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people:

\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

So, everyone will get 7 oranges. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 7 \]"
"First, let's determine the amount of onions Antoine uses. The recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, and he doubles that amount:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00 \text{ per pound} = \$8.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box is $2.00:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00 \text{ per box} = \$4.00 \]

The total cost for the ingredients is the sum of the cost of the onions and the beef stock:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is:

\[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00 \text{ per serving} \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is:

\[ \$2.00 \]

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's determine the time it takes for Wayne to drive to the theater. According to the problem, it takes Wayne 4 minutes to drive to the theater.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes for Bernadette to drive to the theater. The problem states that the drive from Bernadette’s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne’s hotel. Therefore, the time it takes for Bernadette to drive to the theater is:
\[ 4 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to drive to the theater, Bernadette should leave 5 minutes earlier than that to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Thus, Bernadette should leave:
\[ 4 \text{ minutes} - 5 \text{ minutes} = -1 \text{ minute} \]

However, since leaving 1 minute before Wayne would still mean she arrives 5 minutes before him, the correct time Bernadette should leave is:
\[ 4 \text{ minutes} - 5 \text{ minutes} = -1 \text{ minute} \]
But practically, she should leave 1 minute before Wayne to ensure she arrives 5 minutes before him.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 1 minute before Wayne to get to the theater first.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1 \]"
"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to determine the width of the room. We know the area of the rectangle and its length, so we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

Given:
- Area = 360 square feet
- Length = 3 yards

First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard = 3 feet, the length in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Now we can find the width using the area formula:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{Width} \]

Solving for the width:

\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can calculate the perimeter of the rectangle using the formula:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

So, the perimeter of the room is 98 feet."
"First, let's calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

So, the total number of beads Elizabeth bought is:
\[ 1 \text{ pack of red} + 2 \text{ packs of clear} = 1 \times 20 + 2 \times 20 = 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ beads} \]

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

So, the total number of beads Margareth bought is:
\[ 3 \text{ packs of blue} + 4 \text{ packs of red} = 3 \times 20 + 4 \times 20 = 60 + 80 = 140 \text{ beads} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:
\[ 140 \text{ beads} - 60 \text{ beads} = 80 \text{ beads} \]

So, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 80 \]"
"First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven. Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour. Therefore, the total temperature increase from the oven is:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, let's calculate the temperature decrease due to the window. Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Therefore, the total temperature decrease from the window is:

\[ \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 3 \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 6 \text{ degrees} \]

Now, we can find the final temperature by starting with the initial temperature and adding the temperature increase from the oven and then subtracting the temperature decrease from the window:

\[ 40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the house's final temperature is:

\[ 49 \text{ degrees} \]"
"First, let's convert all times to minutes for easier calculation:
- Jon's total time: \(40 + 100 + 50 = 190\) minutes.
- Time for the swim: 40 minutes.
- Time for the bike ride: 120 minutes.
- Time for the run: 50 minutes.

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. So, the time for the swim for James is:
\[ 40 \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. So, the time for the bike ride for James is:
\[ 120 + 5 = 125 \text{ minutes} \]

Let's denote the time for the run for James as \( x \) minutes. The total time for James is:
\[ 36 + 125 + x = 161 + x \text{ minutes} \]

Jon won the race by 10 minutes, so James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[ 161 + x = 190 + 10 \]
\[ 161 + x = 200 \]
\[ x = 200 - 161 \]
\[ x = 39 \]

So, the time it took James to do the run is 39 minutes. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{39} \]"
"First, let's convert the length of Movie C from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the length of Movie C in minutes as follows:

\[ 1.25 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, the length of Movie B in minutes is:

\[ 75 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, we can find the length of Movie A by dividing the length of Movie B by 4:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ minutes}}{4} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"First, we need to determine how many miles the horse runs. The horse runs at a speed of 32 miles per hour for 30 minutes, which is half an hour. Therefore, the distance covered is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 32 \, \text{MPH} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 16 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of hay the horse eats. Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, the total amount of hay eaten is:

\[ \text{Total Hay} = 16 \, \text{miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \, \text{bail/mile} = 8 \, \text{bails} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the hay. Since each bail of hay costs $3, the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 8 \, \text{bails} \times 3 \, \text{\$/bail} = 24 \, \text{\$} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which amount to:

\[ \text{Total Money} = 6 \times 5 \, \text{\$} = 30 \, \text{\$} \]

Finally, we calculate the change Michael has after buying the hay:

\[ \text{Change} = \text{Total Money} - \text{Total Cost} = 30 \, \text{\$} - 24 \, \text{\$} = 6 \, \text{\$} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

Difference in points = 240 - 235 = 5

Therefore, Joey is now winning by 5 points."
"First, let's calculate the cost price per sneaker:
\[ \text{Cost price per sneaker} = \frac{\$576}{48} = \$12 \]

Next, let's calculate the revenue from the 17 sneakers sold at $20 each:
\[ \text{Revenue from Monday sale} = 17 \times \$20 = \$340 \]

Now, let's determine the number of sneakers sold to the department store:
\[ \text{Number of sneakers sold to department store} = 48 - 17 = 31 \]

Then, let's calculate the revenue from the department store:
\[ \text{Revenue from department store} = 31 \times \$25 = \$775 \]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = \$340 + \$775 = \$1115 \]

Finally, let's calculate the profit:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = \$1115 - \$576 = \$539 \]

So, the salesman's profit is:

"Let's denote the regular price of the popcorn as \( P \).

The cost of the super ticket is $20, and the cost of the popcorn and soda with the super ticket is $20 + $1 = $21.

The cost of buying a movie ticket for $12 and a popcorn and soda at regular prices is $12 + \( P \) + $3 = $15 + \( P \).

According to the problem, you saved $2 by choosing the super ticket. Therefore, the cost of the super ticket minus the cost of buying a movie ticket and a popcorn and soda at regular prices is $2. We can set up the following equation:

\[ 21 - (15 + P) = 2 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 21 - 15 - P = 2 \]
\[ 6 - P = 2 \]
\[ P = 6 - 2 \]
\[ P = 4 \]

So, the regular price of the popcorn is $4.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the initial cost per balloon and then calculate the new cost per balloon after the price increase. Finally, we will use this new cost to find out how much Bentley paid for 170 balloons.

First, let's find the initial cost per balloon. The total cost for 20 balloons was $900. Therefore, the cost per balloon initially is:
\[ \text{Initial cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Two days later, the cost per balloon increased by $20. So, the new cost per balloon is:
\[ \text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost for 170 balloons at the new price:
\[ \text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = 170 \times 65 \]

Let's perform the multiplication:
\[ 170 \times 65 = 170 \times (60 + 5) = (170 \times 60) + (170 \times 5) \]
\[ 170 \times 60 = 10200 \]
\[ 170 \times 5 = 850 \]
\[ 10200 + 850 = 11050 \]

So, the total amount Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons is:
\[ \boxed{11050} \]"
"To find the average speed of the car during the entire trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

First, calculate the distance for each segment of the trip:
- For the first segment at 60 mph for 2 hours: \(60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}\).
- For the second segment at 30 mph for 1 hour: \(30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles}\).

The total distance traveled is the sum of the distances from both segments: \(120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles}\).

The total time taken is the sum of the times for both segments: \(2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours}\).

The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time: \(\frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{mph}\).

So, the car's average speed during the trip is \(50 \, \text{mph}\)."
"First, let's determine the value of the sapphires Jenna traded. Jenna traded 3 sapphires, and each sapphire is worth $800. Therefore, the value of the sapphires she traded is:

\[ 3 \text{ sapphires} \times \$800 \text{ per sapphire} = \$2400 \]

Next, we need to determine how many sapphires Jenna has left after the trade. Initially, she had 8 sapphires and traded 3, so she has:

\[ 8 - 3 = 5 \text{ sapphires} \]

Now, we calculate the total value of the sapphires Jenna has left:

\[ 5 \text{ sapphires} \times \$800 \text{ per sapphire} = \$4000 \]

Jenna also received 2 rubies in the trade. Each ruby is worth $1200, so the value of the rubies she received is:

\[ 2 \text{ rubies} \times \$1200 \text{ per ruby} = \$2400 \]

To find the total value of all her jewels, we add the value of the remaining sapphires and the value of the rubies:

"First, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the raised bed) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

For one raised bed, the dimensions are 8 feet long, 2 feet wide, and 2 feet tall. So the volume of one raised bed is:

\[ V = 8 \times 2 \times 2 = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:

\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320}{2} = 160 \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost for 160 bags is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \times 12 = 1920 \]

Thus, the total cost for the potting soil is:

\[ \boxed{1920} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of green cards. We know that there are 15 red cards and that the number of green cards is 60% more than the number of red cards. To find the number of green cards, we calculate 60% of 15 and add it to 15.

\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + (0.60 \times 15) = 15 + 9 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find the number of yellow cards. According to the problem, the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the number of red and green cards.

\[ \text{Number of yellow cards} = \text{Number of red cards} + \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + 24 = 39 \]

Now, we can find the total number of cards by adding the number of red, green, and yellow cards together.

\[ \text{Total number of cards} = \text{Number of red cards} + \text{Number of green cards} + \text{Number of yellow cards} = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of the feed.

1. **Sugar Cubes:**
   - Each box weighs 1 pound.
   - He buys 2 boxes.
   - Total weight of sugar cubes = 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

2. **Carrots:**
   - Each bag weighs 12 pounds.
   - He buys 4 bags.
   - Total weight of carrots = 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

3. **Hay:**
   - Each bale weighs 75 pounds.
   - He buys 42 bales.
   - Total weight of hay = 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

4. **Oats:**
   - Each sack weighs 65 pounds.
   - He buys 20 sacks.
   - Total weight of oats = 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

Now, we sum the weights of all the feed items to find the total weight:
\[ \text{Total weight} = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 \text{ pounds} \]

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find the number of trips needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since partial trips are not possible):
\[ \text{Number of trips} = \left\lceil \frac{4500}{2250} \right\rceil = \left\lceil 2 \right\rceil = 2 \]

Therefore, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate her weekly earnings and then multiply by four.

First, let's calculate her weekly earnings from aluminum cans:
- Each aluminum can is worth 2 cents.
- She drinks 3 aluminum cans a week.
- Therefore, her weekly earnings from aluminum cans = 3 cans * 2 cents/can = 6 cents.

Next, let's calculate her weekly earnings from plastic bottles:
- Each plastic bottle is worth 3 cents.
- She drinks 5 plastic bottles a week.
- Therefore, her weekly earnings from plastic bottles = 5 bottles * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents.

Now, let's find her total weekly earnings:
- Total weekly earnings = Earnings from aluminum cans + Earnings from plastic bottles
- Total weekly earnings = 6 cents + 15 cents = 21 cents.

Finally, let's calculate her earnings for a four-week month:
- Total earnings for four weeks = Total weekly earnings * 4 weeks
- Total earnings for four weeks = 21 cents/week * 4 weeks = 84 cents.

"First, we need to convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the shark's length is given in feet, we will convert the remoras' length from inches to feet.

There are 12 inches in a foot, so the length of each remora is:
\[ 6 \text{ inches} = \frac{6}{12} \text{ feet} = 0.5 \text{ feet} \]

Since there are 2 remoras, the combined length of the remoras is:
\[ 2 \times 0.5 \text{ feet} = 1 \text{ foot} \]

Now, we need to find what percentage of the shark's body length (10 feet) is the combined length of the remoras (1 foot). The formula to calculate the percentage is:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Length of remoras}}{\text{Length of shark}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1 \text{ foot}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

"To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion. First, we need to find out how many kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both.

The number of kids allergic to dairy is 9.
The number of kids allergic to peanuts is 6.
The number of kids allergic to both is 3.

Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion, the number of kids allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Allergic to dairy or peanuts} = \text{Allergic to dairy} + \text{Allergic to peanuts} - \text{Allergic to both} \]
\[ \text{Allergic to dairy or peanuts} = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both. Since there are 32 kids in total, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:
\[ \text{Not allergic to anything} = \text{Total kids} - \text{Allergic to dairy or peanuts} \]
\[ \text{Not allergic to anything} = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

- Paul drives in the morning twice a day.
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- He drives for 14 days.

The total number of morning rides in 14 days is:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ morning rides} \]

The total cost for the morning rides is:
\[ 28 \text{ rides} \times 6 \text{ dollars/ride} = 168 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the afternoon rides:
- Paul drives in the afternoon twice a day.
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- He drives for 14 days.

The total number of afternoon rides in 14 days is:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ afternoon rides} \]

The total cost for the afternoon rides is:
\[ 28 \text{ rides} \times 2 \text{ dollars/ride} = 56 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we sum the total costs of the morning and afternoon rides to find the total amount spent:
\[ 168 \text{ dollars} + 56 \text{ dollars} = 224 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is:
\[ \boxed{224} \]"
"First, let's determine how many oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box, so:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, let's find the total number of oranges they brought together:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Since one greek orange pie needs three oranges, the number of pies they can make is:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ oranges}}{3 \text{ oranges/pie}} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 40 \]"
"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let's denote the number of guests by \( n \).

**Cost at the first venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Cost of food per guest: $5
- Total cost at the first venue: \( 200 + 5n \)

**Cost at the second venue:**
- Cost per guest: $25
- Cost of food per guest: $0 (included in the price)
- Total cost at the second venue: \( 25n \)

We need to find the value of \( n \) for which the costs at both venues are equal. Therefore, we set the two cost equations equal to each other:

\[ 200 + 5n = 25n \]

Next, we solve for \( n \):

1. Subtract \( 5n \) from both sides of the equation:
   \[ 200 = 25n - 5n \]
   \[ 200 = 20n \]

2. Divide both sides by 20:
   \[ n = \frac{200}{20} \]
   \[ n = 10 \]

Thus, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \( 10 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \( D \). According to the problem, Lily found 7 more insects than David, so the number of insects found by Lily is \( D + 7 \). Additionally, David found half of what Bodhi found, so if Bodhi found \( B \) insects, then \( D = \frac{B}{2} \).

The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + B = 43 \]
Since \( D = \frac{B}{2} \), we can substitute \( B \) with \( 2D \) in the equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]
Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]
Divide both sides by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]
Now, we know that David found 9 insects. Since Lily found 7 more than David, the number of insects found by Lily is:
\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]
So, the number of insects found by Lily is 16.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{16}
\]"
"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to calculate the total amount of yarn used by both of them and then convert that into yards.

Mariah used \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a skein, and her grandma used \(\frac{1}{2}\) of a skein. Together, they used:

\[
\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4}
\]

of a skein.

Since there are 364 yards in a skein, the total number of yards they used is:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 364 = \frac{3 \times 364}{4} = \frac{1092}{4} = 273
\]

So, the total number of yards of yarn they used altogether is 273 yards."
"First, let's calculate the number of gifts Cherrie buys for her 5 friends. Two of her friends want 5 gifts each, and the other three friends want 2 gifts each.

For the two friends who want 5 gifts each:
\[ 2 \text{ friends} \times 5 \text{ gifts per friend} = 10 \text{ gifts} \]

For the three friends who want 2 gifts each:
\[ 3 \text{ friends} \times 2 \text{ gifts per friend} = 6 \text{ gifts} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of gifts for her friends:
\[ 10 \text{ gifts} + 6 \text{ gifts} = 16 \text{ gifts} \]

Cherrie also decides to buy 10 more random gifts as a surprise. So, we add these to the total:
\[ 16 \text{ gifts} + 10 \text{ gifts} = 26 \text{ gifts} \]

Therefore, the total number of gifts Cherrie bought is:
\[ 26 \]"
"First, let's determine the width of the rug. Since the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair and the chair is 3 feet wide, the width of the rug is:

\[ \text{Width of the rug} = \text{Width of the chair} + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the length of the couch. The problem states that the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Since the width of the rug is 8 feet, twice the width of the rug is:

\[ 2 \times \text{Width of the rug} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the length of the couch is:

\[ \text{Length of the couch} = 2 \times \text{Width of the rug} + 2 = 16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet} \]

So, the length of the couch is 18 feet."
"Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( S \). According to the problem, Suzie bought four packs of gum in total, with two packs being strawberry gum. She also bought one pack of grape gum for $2 and a small pack of green apple gum for half the price of the grape gum, which is $1.

The total cost of the gum can be expressed as:
\[ 2S + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many 2 x 4 pieces Frederick can buy with his $24. Each 2 x 4 costs $4.

\[ \text{Number of 2 x 4 pieces} = \frac{\$24}{\$4} = 6 \]

Next, let's determine how many 2 x 8 pieces Frederick can buy with his $24. Each 2 x 8 costs $6.

\[ \text{Number of 2 x 8 pieces} = \frac{\$24}{\$6} = 4 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of popsicle sticks he can get from each type of wood.

For 2 x 4 pieces:
\[ \text{Total sticks from 2 x 4} = 6 \times 200 = 1200 \]

For 2 x 8 pieces:
\[ \text{Total sticks from 2 x 8} = 4 \times 400 = 1600 \]

Since Frederick wants to buy the cheapest lumber, he should buy the 2 x 4 pieces. Therefore, the most popsicle sticks he can make is from the 2 x 4 pieces.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1200 \]"
"To determine the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his sled dogs, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
2. Determine how many pairs of snowshoes are needed.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of pairs of snowshoes.

First, since each dog has four legs and there are 6 dogs:
\[ \text{Total number of legs} = 6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Since each pair of snowshoes covers one dog, the number of pairs of snowshoes needed is equal to the number of dogs:
\[ \text{Number of pairs of snowshoes} = 6 \]

Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, so the total cost is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 6 \text{ pairs} \times \$12.00/\text{pair} = \$72.00 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$72.00 \]"
"To determine how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate her total weekly cost without the bus pass and then compare it to the cost of the bus pass.

First, let's calculate her total weekly cost without the bus pass:
- Janet takes two bus trips each day.
- She takes five bus trips per day.
- Therefore, her total number of bus trips per week is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) trips.
- Each bus trip costs her $2.20.
- So, her total weekly cost without the bus pass is \(10 \times 2.20 = 22.00\) dollars.

Next, we compare this to the cost of the weekly bus pass:
- The weekly bus pass costs $20.

Now, we calculate the savings by subtracting the cost of the bus pass from her total weekly cost without the bus pass:
- Savings = Total weekly cost without the bus pass - Cost of the bus pass
- Savings = $22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00

Therefore, Janet would save $2.00 by buying the weekly bus pass."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Farm's Cows and Sheep:**
   - The farm has 30 cows.
   - The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has \(2 \times 30 = 60\) cows.

2. **Zoo's Cows and Sheep:**
   - The zoo has 20 sheep.
   - The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has \(\frac{20}{2} = 10\) sheep.

3. **Total Animals:**
   - The farm has 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.
   - The zoo has 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.
   - Combined, the farm and zoo have 40 + 80 = 120 animals.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we start by understanding the relationship between the quantities bought by Sophia and Rose. According to the problem, Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.

Given:
- Rose bought 12 onions.
- Rose bought 4 potatoes.

Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as \( S_o \) and the number of potatoes Sophia bought as \( S_p \).

From the problem, we know:
\[ 4 \times (S_o + S_p) = 12 + 4 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[ 4 \times (S_o + S_p) = 16 \]

Next, we solve for \( S_o + S_p \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ S_o + S_p = \frac{16}{4} \]
\[ S_o + S_p = 4 \]

Therefore, Sophia bought a total of 4 onions and potatoes. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \]"
"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we first need to calculate the total number of calories he needs to burn to lose 30 pounds. Given that he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose one pound, the total calories he needs to burn to lose 30 pounds is:

\[ 3500 \text{ calories/pound} \times 30 \text{ pounds} = 105000 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to determine the number of days from December 31st to July 19th. We can break this down into months:

- December: 31 days
- January: 31 days
- February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
- March: 31 days
- April: 30 days
- May: 31 days
- June: 30 days
- July (up to July 19th): 19 days

Adding these together gives:

\[ 31 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 221 \text{ days} \]

Now, to find the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to maintain, we divide the total calories he needs to burn by the number of days:

\[ \frac{105000 \text{ calories}}{221 \text{ days}} \approx 475.64 \text{ calories/day} \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, Andy needs to maintain a daily calorie deficit of approximately 476 calories each day to reach his goal."

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, the house cost three times as much as the lot, so we can write:

\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]

Combining like terms, we have:

\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

To find \( L \), we divide both sides by 4:

\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000 \]

Now that we know the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house using the first equation:

\[ H = 3L = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000 \]

So, the cost of the house is $90,000.

The final numerical answer is:

Total cost = Number of packs × Cost per pack
Total cost = 8 × $4
Total cost = $32

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the canvas bags. Tara sold each of the 40 canvas bags (8 packs × 5 bags per pack) for $8 each.

Total revenue = Number of bags sold × Selling price per bag
Total revenue = 40 × $8
Total revenue = $320

Now, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $320 - $32
Profit = $288

"To determine the total number of skeins of wool Martha will need, we should first calculate the total number of each item she needs to knit for her 3 grandchildren. Then, we will multiply the number of each item by the number of skeins required to make one of that item, and finally sum these values.

- Hats: 3 grandchildren × 1 hat each = 3 hats
- Scarves: 3 grandchildren × 1 scarf each = 3 scarves
- Sweaters: 3 grandchildren × 1 sweater each = 3 sweaters
- Mittens: 3 grandchildren × 1 pair each = 3 pairs
- Socks: 3 grandchildren × 1 pair each = 3 pairs

Now, we calculate the total number of skeins needed for each item:
- Hats: 3 hats × 2 skeins per hat = 6 skeins
- Scarves: 3 scarves × 4 skeins per scarf = 12 skeins
- Sweaters: 3 sweaters × 12 skeins per sweater = 36 skeins
- Mittens: 3 pairs × 1 mitten pair × 1 mitten × 2 skeins per mitten = 6 skeins (since a pair of mittens is 2 mitten)
- Socks: 3 pairs × 2 socks per pair × 2 skeins per sock = 12 skeins (since a pair of socks is 2 socks)

Adding these together gives the total number of skeins needed:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the weekly electric bills for both scenarios: before and after adding the new device.

First, let's calculate the daily consumption:
- Ada's daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour
- New device's daily consumption: 2 kilowatts per hour
- Total daily consumption after adding the new device: 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour

Next, we calculate the weekly consumption:
- There are 7 days in a week.
- Total weekly consumption: 14 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 98 kilowatts per week

Now, we calculate the cost of the weekly consumption:
- The cost per kilowatt per hour is $1.50.
- Total weekly cost: 98 kilowatts per week * $1.50 per kilowatt per hour = $147

Now, let's calculate the weekly consumption before adding the new device:
- Total weekly consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 84 kilowatts per week

Next, we calculate the cost of the weekly consumption before adding the new device:
- Total weekly cost: 84 kilowatts per week * $1.50 per kilowatt per hour = $126

Finally, we find the difference between the two weekly costs:
- Difference: $147 - $126 = $21

The difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is $21."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which the painters work and then use that rate to find out how long it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house.

First, let's find out how much one person can paint in one day. Since one person can paint half a house in 5 days, in one day, one person can paint:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \text{ house} \div 5 \text{ days} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ house per day}
\]

Next, we need to determine how much one person can paint in one hour. Since there are 24 hours in a day, one person can paint:
\[
\frac{1}{10} \text{ house per day} \div 24 \text{ hours per day} = \frac{1}{240} \text{ house per hour}
\]

Now, if we have 5 people working together, the combined rate of painting is:
\[
5 \times \frac{1}{240} \text{ house per hour} = \frac{5}{240} \text{ house per hour} = \frac{1}{48} \text{ house per hour}
\]

To find out how many hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house, we take the reciprocal of the combined rate:
\[
\frac{1 \text{ house}}{\frac{1}{48} \text{ house per hour}} = 48 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house. The final numerical answer is:

2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. Therefore, Ophelia has \(20 + 2 = 22\) chairs.
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. So, Jenna has \(3 \times 22 = 66\) chairs.
4. Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, Ophelia also has 22 sofas (as calculated earlier).
5. Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so Jenna has \(66 - 2 = 64\) sofas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have together:

- Ophelia's total: \(20\) sofas + \(22\) chairs = \(42\)
- Jenna's total: \(64\) sofas + \(66\) chairs = \(130\)

Adding their totals together:

\[42 + 130 = 172\]

So, the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together is 172."
"To determine how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had not purchased the headphone set, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of the headphone set.
2. Determine the amount of money Tom would have had if he did not buy the headphone set.
3. Calculate how many CDs he could have bought with that amount of money.

First, we know that Tom paid $48 in total and that the CD cost $4. Therefore, the cost of the headphone set is:
\[ 48 - 4 = 44 \]

If Tom had not bought the headphone set, he would have had:
\[ 48 - 44 = 4 \]

With $4, we can determine how many CDs he could have bought. Since each CD costs $4, he could buy:
\[ \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

So, Tom would have been able to buy 1 more CD if he had not bought the headphone set. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we need to account for the hours he worked out each week, including the exceptions.

First, let's calculate the total hours for the weeks where he worked out 4 hours each week:
\[ 4 \text{ hours/week} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 24 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we add the hours for the two weeks where he worked out 5 hours each week:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

Then, we add the hours for the week where he worked out 6 hours:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/week} \times 1 \text{ week} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we sum all these hours together:
\[ 24 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:
\[ 40 \]"
"Initially, there are 48 people on the bus. After the first stop, 8 people get off, leaving 48 - 8 = 40 people on the bus. Then, 5 times as many people as those who got off (which is 5 * 8 = 40 people) get on the bus. So, the number of people on the bus after the first stop is 40 + 40 = 80 people.

At the second stop, 21 people get off, leaving 80 - 21 = 59 people on the bus. Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on compared to those who got off, which means 21 / 3 = 7 people get on the bus. Therefore, the number of people on the bus after the second stop is 59 + 7 = 66 people.

The final numerical answer is 66."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, his current age is \( 27 - 5 = 22 \) years.

2. **Determine the age of Jame's cousin in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 27 + 8 = 35 \) years old.
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \( 2 \times 35 = 70 \).
   - Therefore, Jame's cousin will be \( 70 - 5 = 65 \) years old in 8 years.

3. **Determine Jame's cousin's current age:**
   - If Jame's cousin will be 65 in 8 years, then his current age is \( 65 - 8 = 57 \) years.

4. **Calculate the age difference between Jame and his cousin:**
   - Jame is currently 22 years old.
   - Jame's cousin is currently 57 years old.
   - The age difference is \( 57 - 22 = 35 \) years.

The final numerical answer is 35."
"Let's denote the cost of the computer as \( C \), the cost of the printer as \( P \), and the cost of one monitor as \( M \).

From the problem, we know:
1. \( C = 1100 \)
2. \( P = C - 400 \)
3. The total cost of the computer, two monitors, and the printer is $2,400.

First, we calculate the cost of the printer:
\[ P = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

Next, we use the total cost equation:
\[ C + 2M + P = 2400 \]
Substituting the known values of \( C \) and \( P \):
\[ 1100 + 2M + 700 = 2400 \]
\[ 1800 + 2M = 2400 \]
\[ 2M = 2400 - 1800 \]
\[ 2M = 600 \]
\[ M = \frac{600}{2} \]
\[ M = 300 \]

So, the cost of one monitor is \( 300 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of seashells brought by each girl. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of boys and girls:**
   - There are 20 kids in total.
   - The number of boys and girls is equal, so each group has \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) kids.

2. **Calculate the number of seashells brought by each boy:**
   - Each boy brought back 60 seashells.

3. **Determine the total number of seashells brought by all boys:**
   - Since there are 10 boys, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is \( 10 \times 60 = 600 \) seashells.

4. **Calculate the number of seashells brought by each girl:**
   - Each girl brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.
   - The number of seashells brought by each boy is 60.
   - Four times the number of seashells brought by each boy is \( 4 \times 60 = 240 \).
   - Therefore, each girl brought \( 60 + 240 = 300 \) seashells.

So, the number of seashells brought by each girl is 300.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{300}

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and then sum them up.

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so its thickness is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so its thickness is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm.

Now, we sum the thicknesses of all four books:
\[31 + 50 + 45 + 62\]

Let's calculate the sum:
\[31 + 50 = 81\]
\[81 + 45 = 126\]
\[126 + 62 = 188\]

Therefore, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Sharing:**
   - The total amount is $18.
   - It is shared among 3 boys.
   - Each boy's initial share is \(\frac{18}{3} = 6\) dollars.

2. **Eldest Boy's Actions:**
   - The eldest boy adds $5 to his share: \(6 + 5 = 11\) dollars.
   - The next day, he adds another $10: \(11 + 10 = 21\) dollars.
   - He then spends $8: \(21 - 8 = 13\) dollars.

3. **Saving and Tripling:**
   - After spending $8, he has $13.
   - He triples the amount he has left: \(13 \times 3 = 39\) dollars.

So, the final amount the eldest boy has is \(\boxed{39}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable parts. First, we need to determine the total amount Elvis needs to save in April, which is $1125. Since April has 30 days, we can divide this amount by the number of days in April to find out how much he needs to save each day on average.

\[ \text{Average daily savings} = \frac{1125}{30} = 37.50 \]

This means Elvis needs to save $37.50 per day on average. However, he wants to save twice as much in the second half of the month as he does in the first half. Let's denote the amount he saves in the first half of the month as \( x \). Therefore, the amount he saves in the second half of the month will be \( 2x \).

The total amount saved in April is the sum of the savings in the first half and the second half:

\[ x + 2x = 3x \]

We know that the total amount saved in April is $1125, so:

\[ 3x = 1125 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{1125}{3} = 375 \]

So, Elvis needs to save $375 in the first half of the month. Since the second half of the month is also 15 days, the amount he needs to save each day in the second half of the month is:

\[ \frac{375}{15} = 25 \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save $25 for each day in the second half of the month.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 25 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the apples:

\[ 0.5 \times 20 = 10 \]

Now, to find out how much more Jairus earns than Jenny, we subtract Jenny's earnings from Jairus's earnings:

\[ 16 - 10 = 6 \]

So, Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars. The total amount of money is $100, so we can write the equation:

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets $20. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's amount as:

\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets $80. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 80 \]"

"To determine the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Rewriting**: Elise writes the entire alphabet twice.
   - The alphabet has 26 letters.
   - Therefore, writing it twice means \(26 \times 2 = 52\) letters.

2. **Second Rewriting**: Elise writes half of the alphabet once.
   - Half of the alphabet is \(26 / 2 = 13\) letters.
   - Therefore, writing half of the alphabet once means \(13\) letters.

3. **Third Rewriting**: Elise rewrites everything she has already written.
   - This includes the two full alphabets and the half alphabet.
   - The total number of letters already written is \(52 + 13 = 65\).
   - Rewriting everything she has already written means writing \(65\) letters again.

Now, we sum up all the letters written:
- First rewriting: \(52\) letters.
- Second rewriting: \(13\) letters.
- Third rewriting: \(65\) letters.

Adding these together:
\[ 52 + 13 + 65 = 130 \]

Thus, the total number of letters Elise has written is \(\boxed{130}\)."

"First, let's determine the daily recommended cups of coffee for Octavia. Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, if we denote the daily recommended cups of coffee as \( R \), then Octavia drinks \( \frac{R}{2} \) cups of coffee.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks. Therefore, Juan drinks \( 10 \times \frac{R}{2} = 5R \) cups of coffee.

According to Juan's doctor, Juan's coffee intake should be reduced to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. This means Juan needs to reduce his coffee intake from \( 5R \) cups to 4 cups.

To find out by how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we calculate the difference between his current intake and the recommended intake:
\[ 5R - 4 \]

Since the daily recommended cups of coffee for Octavia is \( R \), and Juan's current intake is \( 5R \), we need to express the reduction in terms of the daily recommended cups. The reduction in cups is:
\[ 5R - 4 \]

However, we need to express this reduction in terms of the daily recommended cups \( R \). Since \( 5R \) is 5 times the daily recommended cups, the reduction in terms of the daily recommended cups is:
\[ 5R - 4 = 5R - 4 \]

To find the exact reduction in terms of the daily recommended cups, we need to solve for \( R \) in the context of the problem. Since the problem does not provide the exact value of \( R \), we can express the reduction as a fraction of the daily recommended cups:
\[ \frac{5R - 4}{R} = 5 - \frac{4}{R} \]

Given that \( R \) is the daily recommended cups, the reduction in terms of the daily recommended cups is:
\[ 5R - 4 = 5R - 4 \]

Since the problem asks for the reduction in terms of the daily recommended cups, and we know that \( 5R \) is 5 times the daily recommended cups, the reduction is:
\[ 5R - 4 = 5R - 4 \]

To find the exact reduction, we need to solve for \( R \) in the context of the problem. Since the problem does not provide the exact value of \( R \), we can express the reduction as a fraction of the daily recommended cups:
\[ \frac{5R - 4}{R} = 5 - \frac{4}{R} \]

Given that \( R \) is the daily recommended cups, the reduction in terms of the daily recommended cups is:
\[ 5R - 4 = 5R - 4 \]

Since the problem does not provide the exact value of \( R \), we can express the reduction as:
\[ 5R - 4 = 5R - 4 \]

Therefore, the reduction in terms of the daily recommended cups is:
\[ 5R - 4 = 5R - 4 \]

The exact reduction in terms of the daily recommended cups is:
\[ 5R - 4 = 5R - 4 \]

Given that the problem does not provide the exact value of \( R \), the reduction in terms of the daily recommended cups is:
\[ 5R - 4 = 5R - 4 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5R - 4 = 5R - 4 \]

Since the problem does not provide the exact value of \( R \), the reduction in terms of the daily recommended cups is:
\[ 5R - 4 = 5R - 4 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5R - 4 = 5R - 4 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5R - 4 = 5R - 4 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then sum them up.

- There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each, so the total number of hamsters is \(3 \times 10 = 30\).
- There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each, so the total number of guinea pigs is \(3 \times 5 = 15\).

Adding the number of hamsters and guinea pigs together gives us the total number of rodents:

\[30 + 15 = 45\]

So, the pet shop had a total of 45 rodents."
"First, let's determine the weights of Susan and Bob.

Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark. Since Mark weighs 150 pounds, Susan's weight is:
\[ 150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds} \]

Bob weighs twice as much as Susan. Since Susan weighs 130 pounds, Bob's weight is:
\[ 2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we can find the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob. The average weight is calculated by summing their weights and dividing by the number of people (which is 3 in this case):
\[ \text{Average weight} = \frac{150 + 130 + 260}{3} = \frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the angle the sun makes with the ground after moving for 10 hours and the angle the pyramid makes with the ground.

Initially, the sun is at the tip of the pyramid, which is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground. The sun moves upward at a rate of 5 degrees per hour. Over 10 hours, the sun will move upward by:

\[ 5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the angle the sun makes with the ground after 10 hours will be the initial angle of the pyramid plus the angle the sun has moved upward:

\[ 32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much James spends on candles, we first need to find out how many candles he needs in total.

1. Determine the ages of the sons:
   - The older son is 12 years old.
   - The younger son is 4 years younger, so he is \(12 - 4 = 8\) years old.

2. Calculate the total number of candles needed:
   - James needs one candle for each son, so he needs \(12 + 8 = 20\) candles.

3. Determine how many packs of candles are needed:
   - Each pack contains 5 candles.
   - To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack: \(20 \div 5 = 4\) packs.

4. Calculate the total cost:
   - Each pack costs $3.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 4 packs is \(4 \times 3 = 12\).

James spends $12 on candles."
"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the pages read in the first week and add it to the pages read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week. She read for 15 minutes each night for 7 nights, so the total reading time in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pages she can read in 105 minutes. Since she can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, we first find out how many 1.5-minute intervals are in 105 minutes:
\[ \frac{105 \text{ minutes}}{1.5 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 70 \text{ intervals} \]

Since she reads 2 pages in each 1.5-minute interval, the total number of pages read in the first week is:
\[ 70 \text{ intervals} \times 2 \text{ pages/interval} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

Now, we know that in the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine how many sandwiches Cody ate. Since Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, we calculate:

\[
\text{Sandwiches eaten by Cody} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
\]

Next, we calculate how many sandwiches Trevor ate. Since Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, we calculate:

\[
\text{Sandwiches eaten by Trevor} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3
\]

Now, we add the sandwiches eaten by Cody and Trevor to find the total number of sandwiches they ate together:

\[
\text{Total sandwiches eaten} = 4 + 3 = 7
\]

Finally, we subtract the total number of sandwiches eaten from the original number of sandwiches to find out how many are left:

\[
\text{Sandwiches left} = 12 - 7 = 5
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
5

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equation based on the information given.

Let \( S \) be Shiloh's current age, and let \( N \) be his nephew's current age. According to the problem, Shiloh is currently 44 years old, so \( S = 44 \).

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( S + 7 \). At that time, his nephew's age will be \( N + 7 \). The problem states that in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Substituting \( S = 44 \) into the equation, we get:

\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Simplifying the left side:

\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Next, we divide both sides by 3:

\[ 17 = N + 7 \]

Then, we subtract 7 from both sides to solve for \( N \):

\[ N = 10 \]

So, his nephew is currently 10 years old. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to break down the payments Sharon received from the tooth fairy and sum them up.

1. For the first tooth, Sharon received $5.00.
2. For the next three teeth, Sharon received $1.00 each. So, for three teeth, she received \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount per tooth as she did for the previous three teeth. Since each of the previous three teeth was exchanged for $1.00, the tooth fairy gave $0.50 per tooth for the last two teeth. So, for two teeth, she received \(2 \times 0.50 = 1\) dollar.

Now, we sum up all the amounts:
\[5 + 3 + 1 = 9\]

Therefore, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"To find out how many goals all three teenagers scored, we need to determine the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna based on the information given about Richie.

Given:
- Richie scored 80 goals.
- Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark.
- Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna.

First, we calculate the number of goals scored by Mark:
\[ \text{Goals scored by Mark} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 20 = 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate the number of goals scored by Anna:
\[ \text{Goals scored by Anna} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 45 = 80 - 45 = 35 \]

Now, we sum the goals scored by all three teenagers:
\[ \text{Total goals} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} + \text{Goals scored by Mark} + \text{Goals scored by Anna} = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 \]

Therefore, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is:

\[ 21 \text{ lemonades} \times 4 \text{ dollars/lemonade} = 84 \text{ dollars} \]

Liam claimed to have made $63. To find out how many more dollars Mitchell made than Liam, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings:
\[ 84 \text{ dollars} - 63 \text{ dollars} = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 21 \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Peter spends on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. Since he spends an equal amount each day and there are 4 days (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday), we can calculate the total amount spent on wooden action figures as follows:

\[ \text{Total spent on wooden action figures} = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Peter started with $70, so after buying the wooden action figures, he has:

\[ \text{Remaining money} = 70 - 20 = 50 \]

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Sunday), he will buy plastic action figures. There are 3 days (Thursday, Friday, and Saturday) for which he will buy plastic action figures. Each plastic action figure costs $2, so the total number of plastic action figures he can buy is:

\[ \text{Number of plastic action figures} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week. He bought 4 wooden action figures and 25 plastic action figures, so the total number of action figures is:

\[ \text{Total number of action figures} = 4 + 25 = 29 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we first need to calculate the total number of roses he grows in a week and then compare it to the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops.

Ford grows 40 roses every week. The flower shops order a total of:
- 20 roses from the first shop
- 15 roses from the second shop
- 30 roses from the third shop

So, the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week is:
\[ 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \]

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops in a month is:
\[ 65 \times 4 = 260 \]

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so in a month, he grows:
\[ 40 \times 4 = 160 \]

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the number of roses he grows from the number of roses ordered:
\[ 260 - 160 = 100 \]

Therefore, the number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month is:

- Cost of bread for 10 sandwiches: $3.00
- Cost of cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches: $30.00

Total cost for 10 sandwiches = $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00

Next, let's calculate the revenue from selling 10 sandwiches:

- Revenue from selling 10 sandwiches at $7.00 each = 10 * $7.00 = $70.00

Now, we can calculate the net profit:

Net profit = Revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00

The final numerical answer is $37.00."

Next, we calculate the cost of the new carpet and padding:
\[ \text{Cost of new carpet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times \$12/\text{square foot} = \$2592 \]
\[ \text{Cost of padding} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times \$2/\text{square foot} = \$432 \]
\[ \text{Total cost of new carpet and padding} = \$2592 + \$432 = \$3024 \]

Now, we calculate the cost of removing the old carpet:
\[ \text{Cost of removing old carpet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times \$4/\text{square foot} = \$864 \]

Finally, we calculate the cost of installing the new carpet:
\[ \text{Cost of installing new carpet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times \$34/\text{square foot} = \$7344 \]

Adding all these costs together gives us the total cost:

   \]

3. **Second Operation**: The resulting value from the first operation was multiplied by the starting value minus 12. So, the second operation can be written as:
   \[
   \left( \frac{20 + \frac{N}{2}}{5} \right) \times (20 - 12)
   \]
   Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses:
   \[
   20 - 12 = 8
   \]
   Therefore, the expression becomes:
   \[
   \left( \frac{20 + \frac{N}{2}}{5} \right) \times 8
   \]

4. **Final Expression**: To find the final value, we need to simplify the expression:
   \[
   \left( \frac{20 + \frac{N}{2}}{5} \right) \times 8 = \frac{20 + \frac{N}{2}}{5} \times 8 = \frac{8 \left( 20 + \frac{N}{2} \right)}{5} = \frac{160 + 4N}{5}
   \]

Since the problem does not specify a particular value for \( N \), the final expression in terms of \( N \) is:
\[
\frac{160 + 4N}{5}
\]

However, if we assume \( N \) is the starting value (20), then the expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{160 + 4 \times 20}{5} = \frac{160 + 80}{5} = \frac{240}{5} = 48
\]

Thus, the final value of the number train is:
\[
\boxed{48}

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \text{ cards} \]

Next, we add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards the brother has to find the total number of cards they have together:

\[ 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ cards} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 7 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage error in Maggie's oven and then apply that same percentage error to the 520 degrees she needs for her recipe.

First, let's calculate the percentage error for the 450 degrees setting:
- The actual temperature when set to 450 is 468.
- The error is \(468 - 450 = 18\).
- The percentage error is \(\frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\%\).

Now, we apply this 4% error to the 520 degrees required for her recipe:
- The error in degrees for 520 degrees is \(520 \times 0.04 = 20.8\).
- The actual temperature she should set the oven to is \(520 + 20.8 = 540.8\).

Therefore, the temperature she should set the oven to is 540.8 degrees."
"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch both movies, we need to add the duration of the first movie to the duration of the second movie.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Converting this to minutes:
1 hour = 60 minutes
So, 1 hour and 30 minutes = 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting this to minutes:
2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes
So, 2 hours and 5 minutes = 120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes.

Now, we add the durations of both movies:
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is 215 minutes."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we first need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and then subtract that from Herb's price.

Herb's house price = $76,000

30% of Herb's house price = 0.30 * $76,000 = $22,800

Juan's house price = Herb's house price - 30% of Herb's house price
Juan's house price = $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

Now, we add the prices of both houses to find the combined value:

Combined value = Herb's house price + Juan's house price
Combined value = $76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200

The final numerical answer is $129,200."
"First, let's determine the number of cups and dishes Judy initially bought.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups.

She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.

At the event, her friend brought 40 cups. Since Judy initially bought 12 cups, her friend brought \(40 - 12 = 28\) more cups than Judy bought.

Her friend also brought 20 more dishes than Judy's initial purchase of 24 dishes. Therefore, her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend.

Judy's total cups: \(12 + 28 = 40\) cups.
Judy's total dishes: \(24 + 44 = 68\) dishes.

The total number of utensils (cups and dishes) brought by both is:
\[40 + 68 = 108\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"First, let's determine the cost of one box of contacts after the 10% discount. The original price of one box is $100.00. A 10% discount on $100.00 is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Discount} = 100.00 \times \frac{10}{100} = 10.00 \]

So, the discounted price of one box is:

\[ \text{Discounted Price} = 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

Since Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost for 2 boxes is:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost per pair of contacts. Since each box contains 90 single use contacts, 2 boxes will contain:

\[ \text{Total Contacts} = 90 \times 2 = 180 \]

Therefore, the cost per pair of contacts is:

\[ \text{Cost per Pair} = \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1.00} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total hours Jill worked. Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so the total hours Jill worked is:
\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the hours John worked. John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ hours on Saturday} \]
John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so:
\[ 3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ hours on Sunday} \]
Therefore, the total hours John worked is:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the total earnings for both Jill and John. Since they are paid $10 per hour, Jill's earnings are:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]
John's earnings are:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 70 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings:
\[ 70 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 40 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total calories burned by Hannah during her workout.

For the aerobics:
- She spends 2 hours doing aerobics.
- Aerobics burn 500 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from aerobics = 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.

For the running:
- She spends 1 hour running.
- Running burns 600 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from running = 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.

Now, let's add the calories burned from both activities to get the total calories burned:
- Total calories burned = 1000 calories (aerobics) + 600 calories (running) = 1600 calories.

Next, we need to determine how much water Hannah needs to drink. She needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned.

To find out how much water she needs to drink for 1600 calories:
- For 200 calories, she drinks 100 ml.
- For 1600 calories, she drinks \( \frac{1600 \text{ calories}}{200 \text{ calories}} \times 100 \text{ ml} = 8 \times 100 \text{ ml} = 800 \text{ ml} \).

"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the note, the number of red jelly beans is 1% less than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \). Similarly, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of the red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \), we find:
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
- Number of red jelly beans = \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \)
- Number of green jelly beans = \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \)

The difference between the number of green and red jelly beans is:
\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

The initial speed is 47 WPM, and after the first increase, it becomes 52 WPM. If he continues to increase his speed by 5 words per minute, the third test speed will be:

\[ 52 + 5 = 57 \text{ WPM} \]

Now, we have the three measurements: 47 WPM, 52 WPM, and 57 WPM. To find the average, we sum these values and divide by 3:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{47 + 52 + 57}{3} \]

First, we calculate the sum:

\[ 47 + 52 + 57 = 156 \]

Then, we divide by 3:

\[ \frac{156}{3} = 52 \]

So, the average of the three measurements is:

\[ 52 \]

The final numerical answer is:

2. The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs \(10 \times 2 = 20\) pounds.
3. The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs \(20 \div 4 = 5\) pounds.
4. The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs \(5 \times 44 = 220\) pounds.

Therefore, the weight of the Mastiff is 220 pounds."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the boots on Amazon.com:
- The cost of the boots on Amazon.com is $16.
- The shipping cost on Amazon.com is $4.
- Therefore, the total cost on Amazon.com is $16 + $4 = $20.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the boots on eBay:
- The cost of the boots on eBay is $13.
- The shipping cost on eBay is twice the shipping cost on Amazon.com. Since the shipping cost on Amazon.com is $4, the shipping cost on eBay is 2 * $4 = $8.

"To determine how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms every day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Calculate the total protein intake per week.

First, we know that 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein. Therefore, the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Protein per 200 grams} = \left(\frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams of mushrooms}}\right) \times 200 \text{ grams of mushrooms} = 6 \text{ grams of protein} \]

Next, we calculate the total protein intake per week. Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, the weekly protein intake is:
\[ \text{Weekly protein intake} = 6 \text{ grams/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work for George.

- The base price for each implant is $2000.
- George needs 2 implants, so the cost for the implants is \(2 \times 2000 = 4000\) dollars.
- One of the implants has an additional cost for a porcelain crown, which is $500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the dental work is \(4000 + 500 = 4500\) dollars.

Next, we need to determine how much more money George needs after his deposit. He has already put down a deposit of $600, so the remaining amount he needs to pay is \(4500 - 600 = 3900\) dollars.

George makes $15 per hour at work. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:

\[
\text{Hours needed} = \frac{3900}{15} = 260
\]

So, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees, and the other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees. The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees and \( 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees. The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The measure of the largest angle in the triangle is \(\boxed{90}\) degrees."
"First, we need to determine the total amount of money Colby has in cents. We can do this by converting each type of coin to cents and then summing them up.

"To determine the total number of legs in the pet store, we need to consider the number of legs each type of pet has and then multiply by the number of each type of pet.

- Dogs have 4 legs each.
- Cats have 4 legs each.
- Birds have 2 legs each.

Given:
- There are 5 dogs.
- There are 2 cats.
- There are 10 birds.

Now, we calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet:
- Total legs from dogs: \(5 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 20 \text{ legs}\)
- Total legs from cats: \(2 \text{ cats} \times 4 \text{ legs/cat} = 8 \text{ legs}\)
- Total legs from birds: \(10 \text{ birds} \times 2 \text{ legs/bird} = 20 \text{ legs}\)

Finally, we sum the legs from all the pets:

"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we can calculate the hourly rate for Ruiz as follows:

\[ \text{Ruiz's hourly rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. According to the problem, Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we can calculate the amount Marissa makes in one hour as follows:

\[ \text{Marissa's hourly rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 60 \text{ pounds per hour} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of chocolates made by Ruiz and Marissa in 12 hours. First, we calculate the total amount Ruiz makes in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Ruiz's total in 12 hours} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Marissa makes in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Marissa's total in 12 hours} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

"First, we need to determine the total number of rotations the tires go through in a month. Given that the car drives 400 miles a month and the tires rotate 725 times for every 2 miles, we can calculate the total rotations per month as follows:

\[ \text{Rotations per mile} = \frac{725}{2} \]
\[ \text{Rotations per month} = 400 \times \frac{725}{2} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of rotations per month:

\[ \text{Rotations per month} = 400 \times 362.5 = 145000 \]

Now, we need to find out how many months the tires can last before they need to be replaced. We know that each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations. Since there are four tires on the car, the total number of rotations the car can make before the tires need to be replaced is:

\[ \text{Total rotations per car} = 10,440,000 \times 4 = 41,760,000 \]

Now, we calculate the number of months the tires can last:

\[ \text{Months} = \frac{41,760,000}{145000} \]

Finally, we convert the number of months into years:

\[ \text{Years} = \frac{\text{Months}}{12} \]

Let's perform the calculations:

\[ \text{Months} = \frac{41,760,000}{145000} = 288 \]

"To find out how much each pump costs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of washes Jackie can get from one bottle of shampoo.
2. Calculate the cost per pump.

First, we know that the directions say 2 pumps give 120 washes. Therefore, each pump gives:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washes per pump} \]

Next, we know the total cost of the bottle is $24.00. To find the cost per pump in dollars, we divide the total cost by the number of pumps:
\[ \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 12.00 \text{ dollars per pump} \]

Since the question asks for the cost per pump in cents, we convert dollars to cents (1 dollar = 100 cents):
\[ 12.00 \text{ dollars} \times 100 \text{ cents/dollar} = 1200 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the cost per pump is:

"First, we need to calculate the discounted price of the shirt and the shorts. The shirt originally costs $25, and there is a 30% off sale.

The discount on the shirt is:
\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]

So, the discounted price of the shirt is:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

The shorts originally cost $35, and there is also a 30% off sale.

The discount on the shorts is:
\[ 35 \times 0.30 = 10.50 \]

So, the discounted price of the shorts is:
\[ 35 - 10.50 = 24.50 \]

Next, we add the discounted prices of the shirt and the shorts to find the total cost of the outfit:
\[ 17.50 + 24.50 = 42.00 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. After purchasing the outfit, the amount of money he will have left is:
\[ 50 - 42.00 = 8.00 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 8.00 \]"
"To determine how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a week.
2. Determine the total amount of butter required based on the number of dozens.

Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week. There are 7 days in a week, so the total number of dozens of croissants he wants to make is:
\[ 4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozen} \]

It takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. Therefore, to find out how many pounds of butter are needed for 28 dozen croissants, we multiply the number of dozens by the amount of butter needed per dozen:
\[ 28 \text{ dozen} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the funding into two parts: the initial 5 months and the extended 5 months.

1. **Initial 5 months funding:**
   - John receives $100,000 for the first 5 months.

2. **Extended 5 months funding:**
   - The research takes 10 times longer than the initial 5 months, so it takes \(5 \times 10 = 50\) months in total.
   - The first 5 months of the extended period cost $100,000.
   - The remaining 45 months (50 months - 5 months) cost 50% more per month than the initial $100,000 / 5 = $20,000 per month.
   - The new monthly cost for the extended period is \(20,000 \times 1.5 = 30,000\) dollars per month.
   - Therefore, the cost for the 45 months is \(45 \times 30,000 = 1,350,000\) dollars.

3. **Total cost:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the initial 5 months and the extended 45 months.
   - Total cost = $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000.

The final numerical answer is $1,450,000."
"To determine the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to calculate the meat consumption for each player and then sum these amounts.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each weighing 1 ounce, so the total weight of the beef tips is \(8 \times 1 = 8\) ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces of steak.
4. The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Now, we sum the meat consumption of the first three players:
\[6 \text{ ounces} + 8 \text{ ounces} + 16 \text{ ounces} = 30 \text{ ounces}\]

Therefore, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is \(\boxed{30}\)."

"First, let's determine how many pieces of gum Jim chews during the school day. Since he chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school and a school day lasts 8 hours, we can calculate the number of pieces he chews during school as follows:

\[ \text{Pieces chewed during school} = \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours/piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we account for the pieces he chews on the way home from school and after dinner:

\[ \text{Pieces chewed on the way home} = 1 \]
\[ \text{Pieces chewed after dinner} = 1 \]

Adding these together with the pieces chewed during school, we get:

\[ \text{Total pieces chewed} = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 \text{ pieces} \]

Initially, Jim has a 20-pack of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, the number of pieces remaining is:

\[ \text{Remaining pieces} = 20 - 6 = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

Jim then gives half of the remaining pieces to his sister right before bed:

\[ \text{Pieces given to sister} = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ pieces} \]

"To determine Ashley's internet connection speed in megabits per hour (Mb/h), we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the given speed from kilobits per second (kb/s) to megabits per second (Mb/s).
2. Convert the speed from megabits per second to megabits per hour.

First, we know that:
\[ 1 \text{ Mb} = 1000 \text{ kb} \]

Ashley's speed is 20 kb/s. To convert this to Mb/s, we divide by 1000:
\[ 20 \text{ kb/s} = \frac{20}{1000} \text{ Mb/s} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \]

Next, we need to convert this speed to Mb/h. There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so we multiply the speed in Mb/s by 3600:
\[ 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \times 3600 \text{ s/h} = 72 \text{ Mb/h} \]

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed in Mb per hour is:

"To calculate the total number of cars towed by the tow truck over the week, we can break down the problem into two parts: the first three days and the last four days.

For the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day. Therefore, the total number of cars pulled in the first three days is:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

For the remaining four days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day than it did on the first three days. Since it pulled 10 cars each day on the first three days, on the remaining days it pulled:
\[ 10 \text{ cars} - 4 \text{ cars} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]

Therefore, the total number of cars pulled in the last four days is:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Adding the number of cars pulled over the first three days and the last four days gives us the total number of cars towed that week:
\[ 30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to convert Adam's current height from inches to feet to compare it with the required height. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, Adam's height in feet is:

\[ 40 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{40}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The minimum height required to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. Therefore, Adam needs to grow:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Adam grows 2 inches per year, which is equivalent to \(\frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6}\) feet per year. To find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet, we divide \(\frac{2}{3}\) by \(\frac{1}{6}\):

\[ \frac{2}{3} \div \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = \frac{2 \times 6}{3 \times 1} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Therefore, Adam will be tall enough to ride the roller coaster in 4 years. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \text{Cost to acquire the cars} = 30\% \times \$250,000 = 0.30 \times \$250,000 = \$75,000 \]

Now, we find the total profit from selling the cars:
\[ \text{Total profit} = \text{Total cost of cars} - \text{Cost to acquire the cars} = \$250,000 - \$75,000 = \$175,000 \]

James gets a 10% commission on the profits:
\[ \text{James's commission} = 10\% \times \$175,000 = 0.10 \times \$175,000 = \$17,500 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$17,500 \]"

1. **Price of a diamond jewel**: Given as $2000.
2. **Price of a gold jewel**: The price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel.
   \[
   \text{Price of a gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600
   \]
3. **Price of a silver jewel**: The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel.
   \[
   \text{Price of a silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
   \]

Now, we sum the prices of the three jewels to find the total price:
\[
\text{Total price} = \text{Price of a diamond jewel} + \text{Price of a gold jewel} + \text{Price of a silver jewel}
\]
\[
\text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800

"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between him and Bob, given their respective speeds.

First, let's find the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap. Since Bob is driving at 55 mph and Tom is driving at 70 mph, Tom is closing the gap at a rate of:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is reducing the 75-mile gap by 15 miles every hour. To find out how long it will take for Tom to close the entire 75-mile gap, we divide the distance by the relative speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the maximum cost per class and then find out how many classes he can attend without exceeding this cost.

First, let's denote the total cost of the 10 classes as \( C \). The total cost is given as $60. If the cost per class exceeds $10, they won't sign him up again. Therefore, we need to find the maximum number of classes \( n \) such that the cost per class is not more than $10.

The cost per class if he attends \( n \) classes is:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{n} \]

We need this cost to be less than or equal to $10:
\[ \frac{60}{n} \leq 10 \]

Solving for \( n \):
\[ 60 \leq 10n \]
\[ n \geq 6 \]

This means Manny can miss up to \( 10 - 6 = 4 \) classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we first need to find out how many customers each of them processes in a day.

Given that Jewel processes 50 customers per day, and Julie processes twice as many customers as Jewel, we can calculate the number of customers Julie processes per day as follows:
\[ \text{Customers processed by Julie per day} = 2 \times \text{Customers processed by Jewel per day} = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of customers processed by each of them in a week (7 days):
\[ \text{Total customers processed by Jewel in a week} = 50 \times 7 = 350 \]
\[ \text{Total customers processed by Julie in a week} = 100 \times 7 = 700 \]

Finally, we add the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel in a week to find the total weekly production:
\[ \text{Total weekly production} = \text{Total customers processed by Jewel in a week} + \text{Total customers processed by Julie in a week} = 350 + 700 = 1050 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the hole:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 3 \]

Now, let's calculate the volume:

\[ V = 72 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to determine the total time it will take Bob to dig this volume of earth. We know that it takes him 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) in seconds is:

\[ T = \text{volume} \times \text{time per cubic foot} \]

Substituting the volume and the time per cubic foot:

\[ T = 72 \times 3 \]

Now, let's calculate the total time:

\[ T = 216 \text{ seconds} \]

To convert the time into minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):

\[ \text{Time in minutes} = \frac{216}{60} = 3.6 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer in seconds is:

\[ 216 \text{ seconds} \]"

"First, let's calculate the cost of the suits:
- James buys 10 suits.
- Each suit costs $750.
- Therefore, the total cost for the suits is \(10 \times 750 = 7500\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the dress pants:
- The cost of each dress pant is \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the cost of a suit.
- Since each suit costs $750, each dress pant costs \( \frac{750}{5} = 150 \) dollars.
- James buys 10 dress pants.
- Therefore, the total cost for the dress pants is \(10 \times 150 = 1500\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the dress shirts:
- James buys 3 dress shirts per suit.
- Since he buys 10 suits, he buys \(10 \times 3 = 30\) dress shirts.
- Each dress shirt costs $60.
- Therefore, the total cost for the dress shirts is \(30 \times 60 = 1800\) dollars.

Finally, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
- The total cost for the suits is $7500.
- The total cost for the dress pants is $1500.
- The total cost for the dress shirts is $1800.
- Therefore, the total cost is \(7500 + 1500 + 1800 = 10800\) dollars.

"To determine the total time Bill will take to dig the well, we need to calculate the time taken to dig through the soil and the time taken to dig through the clay separately, and then sum these times.

First, let's calculate the time to dig through the soil:
- Bill digs at a rate of 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He needs to dig 24 feet of soil.

\[
\text{Time to dig through soil} = \frac{\text{Distance through soil}}{\text{Rate through soil}} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, let's calculate the time to dig through the clay:
- Bill digs at a rate of half the rate through soil, which is 2 feet per hour through clay.
- He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.

\[
\text{Time to dig through clay} = \frac{\text{Distance through clay}}{\text{Rate through clay}} = \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours}
\]

Now, we sum the times to get the total time to dig the well:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time to dig through soil} + \text{Time to dig through clay} = 6 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours}

"First, let's calculate the final price Clara paid for the pomegranates on Tuesday.

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

She got a $2 discount, so the final price Clara paid is:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the final price Sheila paid for the pomegranates on Wednesday.

The price per pomegranate on Wednesday is $30, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount is:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final price Sheila paid is:
\[ 600 - 60 = 540 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we find the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila:
\[ 540 - 398 = 142 \text{ dollars} \]

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:

"Let's denote the total amount Ariadne earned from selling green hats in the first month as \( G \). According to the problem, the sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount earned from selling green hats. Therefore, we can write:

\[ 400 = \frac{1}{2} G \]

From this equation, we can solve for \( G \):

\[ G = 400 \times 2 = 800 \]

So, Ariadne earned $800 from selling green hats in the first month. The total sales in the first month are the sum of the sales from red and green hats:

\[ \text{Total sales in the first month} = 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

In the second month, her sales were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales of the first month:

\[ \text{Total sales in the second month} = \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \]

To find the total amount she made in two months, we add the total sales of the first month and the total sales of the second month:

\[ \text{Total sales in two months} = 1200 + 900 = 2100 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the total number of deviled egg halves Lori needs. Since each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves and she is inviting 16 guests, the total number of deviled egg halves required is:

\[ 16 \text{ guests} \times 3 \text{ deviled egg halves/guest} = 48 \text{ deviled egg halves} \]

Next, we need to find out how many whole eggs are required. Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, the number of whole eggs needed is:

\[ \frac{48 \text{ deviled egg halves}}{2 \text{ deviled egg halves/whole egg}} = 24 \text{ whole eggs} \]

Now, we need to convert the number of whole eggs into dozens. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, the number of dozens of eggs Lori needs is:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's denote:
- \( s \) as the number of sheep,
- \( g \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we know:
1. Each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, and the total number of legs is 70.
2. Each sheep and each goose has one head, and the total number of heads is 20.

This gives us the following equations:
\[ 4s + 2g = 70 \]
\[ s + g = 20 \]

We can solve this system of equations step by step. First, we can simplify the first equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2s + g = 35 \]

Now we have the simplified system:
\[ 2s + g = 35 \]
\[ s + g = 20 \]

Next, we can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate \( g \):
\[ (2s + g) - (s + g) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2s + g - s - g = 15 \]
\[ s = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep is \( s = 15 \).

To verify, we can substitute \( s = 15 \) back into the second equation:
\[ 15 + g = 20 \]
\[ g = 5 \]

Now we can check the number of legs:
\[ 4s + 2g = 4(15) + 2(5) = 60 + 10 = 70 \]

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is:

"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the candies Adam bought.

The cost of one candy of type A is $0.5, and Adam bought 7 of them. Therefore, the total cost for type A candies is:
\[ 7 \times 0.5 = 3.5 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of one candy of type B is $0.75, and Adam bought 10 of them. Therefore, the total cost for type B candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.75 = 7.5 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we add the costs of the candies to find the total amount Adam spent:
\[ 3.5 + 7.5 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

Adam paid the cashier $15. To find the change he received, we subtract the total cost from the amount he paid:
\[ 15 - 11 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \]"
"To determine the number of good days left in the month, we need to first verify the total number of good, bad, and neutral days based on the information provided.

Christina had twelve good days in total over the thirty days. The first eight days were good, the next eight days were bad, and the last eight days were neutral. This means that the first eight days accounted for 8 good days, and the last eight days accounted for 0 good days. Therefore, the number of good days in the middle eight days is:

\[ 12 - 8 = 4 \]

So, the total number of good days is confirmed to be 12. Now, we need to account for the next three days: the first of these is good, the second is neutral, and the third is good. This means that the next three days add 2 more good days to the total. Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is:

\[ 12 + 2 = 14 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 14 \]"
"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Number of books Janey has} = 2S + 3 \]

We are given that Janey has 21 books. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 21 \]

To find \( S \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 18 \]

Next, divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 9 \]"
"First, we need to convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can calculate the current height in inches as follows:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine the difference in height needed for the bamboo to reach 600 inches:

\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

Given that the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, we can calculate the number of days required to grow 360 inches:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 12 days."
"First, let's determine the number of toys James needs initially. He currently has 4 toys for 4 dogs, so each dog has one toy. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so he needs 8 more toys to have one for each of these 8 dogs. Therefore, after the first purchase, he will have:

\[ 4 \text{ (current toys)} + 8 \text{ (new toys)} = 12 \text{ toys} \]

Next, James went back to see that there are now twice as many more dogs than when he left. Since he had 4 dogs initially and 8 more dogs came in, he had 12 dogs in total when he left. Now, there are \(12 \times 2 = 24\) dogs in the shelter. So, he needs:

\[ 24 \text{ toys} \]

After buying these toys, 3 dogs were gone, so he no longer needed those toys. Therefore, he had 21 dogs left (24 - 3 = 21), and he needed 21 toys for these dogs. Adding the toys he already had after the first purchase:

\[ 12 \text{ (toys after first purchase)} + 21 \text{ (toys for 21 dogs)} = 33 \text{ toys} \]

Thus, the total number of toys James needs is:

\[ \boxed{33} \]"
"First, let's determine how much Dylan invested. Dylan invested \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total amount of $1200.

\[ \text{Dylan's investment} = \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = \frac{2 \times 1200}{5} = \frac{2400}{5} = 480 \]

After Dylan's investment, the remaining amount in the account is:

\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

Next, Frances invested \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the remaining $720.

\[ \text{Frances's investment} = \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = \frac{2 \times 720}{3} = \frac{1440}{3} = 480 \]

After Frances's investment, the remaining amount in the account is:

\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 720 - 480 = 240 \]

Skyler's investment accounted for the rest of the remaining amount, which is $240.

\[ \text{Skyler's investment} = 240 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{240} \]"

"First, let's determine how much Karen earns per hour. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much Karen earns in one day if she works 3 hours. This can be calculated as:

\[ 20 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ dollars per day} \]

Now, to find out how much Karen earns in two days, we multiply her daily earnings by 2:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a proportion based on the given information. If 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, then we can find out how many hash browns (let's call this number \( x \)) can be made from 96 potatoes by setting up the following equation:

\[
\frac{6 \text{ potatoes}}{36 \text{ hash browns}} = \frac{96 \text{ potatoes}}{x \text{ hash browns}}
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{96 \text{ potatoes} \times 36 \text{ hash browns}}{6 \text{ potatoes}}
\]

\[
x = \frac{3456 \text{ hash browns}}{6}
\]

\[
x = 576 \text{ hash browns}
\]

So, you can make 576 hash browns out of 96 potatoes."
"First, we need to calculate the total weight that Jack and the 8 other adults will be carrying in the elevator.

The weight of Jack is 80 kg.
The weight of each of the 8 other adults is also 80 kg.

So, the total weight of the 8 adults is:
\[ 8 \times 80 \, \text{kg} = 640 \, \text{kg} \]

Adding Jack's weight to the total weight of the 8 adults:
\[ 640 \, \text{kg} + 80 \, \text{kg} = 720 \, \text{kg} \]

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg. To find out by how much they will exceed the maximum load, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight:
\[ 720 \, \text{kg} - 700 \, \text{kg} = 20 \, \text{kg} \]

So, they will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"
"Let's denote the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has as \( C \).

According to the problem:
- Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so if Max has \( M \) cookies, then \( K = M - 5 \).
- Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so \( M = C + 12 \).
- Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so if Summer has \( S \) cookies, then \( S = M + 23 \).
- Katarina has 68 cookies, so \( K = 68 \).

From the first equation, we can substitute \( K = 68 \) to find \( M \):
\[ 68 = M - 5 \]
\[ M = 68 + 5 \]
\[ M = 73 \]

Now, we can find the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has using the second equation:
\[ M = C + 12 \]
\[ 73 = C + 12 \]
\[ C = 73 - 12 \]
\[ C = 61 \]

Next, we find the number of cookies Summer has using the third equation:
\[ S = M + 23 \]
\[ S = 73 + 23 \]
\[ S = 96 \]

Now, we can find the total number of cookies they all have:
\[ \text{Total} = K + M + C + S \]
\[ \text{Total} = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 \]
\[ \text{Total} = 298 \]

So, the total number of cookies they have is 298."
"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) centimeters.

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, so the extension is \( 0.5x \).

She also adds 20 cm to the bottom of the dress with a lace trim.

The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides:

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Now, divide both sides by 1.5:

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} \]

\[ x = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 80 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time Chris spent mowing half of his lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half in ""rabbit"" mode.

First, let's convert the times to a consistent unit. Since the final answer needs to be in minutes, we'll keep the times in minutes:
- ""Turtle"" mode: 60 minutes
- ""Rabbit"" mode: 40 minutes

Chris mows half of his lawn in each mode. Therefore, the time spent mowing half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Similarly, the time spent mowing half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode is:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

To find the total time spent mowing the entire lawn, we add the time spent in each mode:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time it takes for John and Jack to get to the fire station, which is the sum of the time it takes to get to the corner and the time it takes to get to the fire station from there.

Time to get to the corner = 6 minutes
Time to get to the fire station from the corner = 13 minutes

Total time to get to the fire station = 6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes

They have 30 minutes in total to get to school. To find out how much longer they have to get to school without being late, we subtract the time it takes to get to the fire station from the total time they have.

Time remaining = Total time - Time to get to the fire station
Time remaining = 30 minutes - 19 minutes = 11 minutes

So, the final numerical answer is 11 minutes."

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( Tr \). According to the problem, one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so we can write the first equation as:

\[ T = Tr + 7 \]

We also know that the combined ages of the twins and the triplets are 44, so we can write the second equation as:

\[ T + T + Tr + Tr + Tr = 44 \]

Simplifying the second equation, we get:

\[ 2T + 3Tr = 44 \]

Now, we substitute the expression for \( T \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[ 2(Tr + 7) + 3Tr = 44 \]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[ 2Tr + 14 + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr = 30 \]
\[ Tr = 6 \]

Now that we know the age of one of the triplets (\( Tr = 6 \)), we can find the age of one of the twins (\( T \)) using the first equation:

\[ T = Tr + 7 \]
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, the age of one of the twins is \( 13 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total time John spends on his homework. He has:

- 20 minutes of math homework
- 40 minutes of reading homework
- 20 minutes of history homework

Adding these together:

\[ 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, 3 hours is equal to:

\[ 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the time John spends on his homework from the total time he has before dinner:

\[ 180 - 80 = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

So, John has 100 minutes to nap. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the cost of the lollipops and candies Manolo bought.

Given that each lollipop costs $0.40, the cost of five lollipops is:
\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

The total cost of the five lollipops and four candies is $3.20. Therefore, the cost of the four candies is:
\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

Now, we can find the cost of one candy:
\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of 10 lollipops:
\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

And the cost of 10 candies:
\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Finally, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:
\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of coins each person has saved over a period of ten years and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the number of coins Rong has saved in ten years:
- Rong saves 20 coins per month.
- There are 12 months in a year, so in ten years, there are \(10 \times 12 = 120\) months.
- Therefore, the total number of coins Rong has saved is \(20 \times 120 = 2400\) coins.

Next, let's calculate the number of coins Neil has saved in ten years:
- Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong per month. This means Neil saves \(20 + \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 20 + 8 = 28\) coins per month.
- In ten years, Neil saves \(28 \times 120 = 3360\) coins.

Finally, we sum the coins saved by Rong and Neil over the ten years:
- Total coins saved by Rong and Neil together is \(2400 + 3360 = 5760\) coins.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{5760}

"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Since each vaccine costs $20 and John needs 2 vaccines, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \]

Next, let's denote the cost of the heartworm check as \( H \). According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as \( T \). Therefore, we have:
\[ H = 0.6T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + H \]

Since \( H = 0.6T \), we can substitute \( H \) in the total bill equation:
\[ T = 40 + 0.6T \]

To find \( T \), we need to solve the equation:
\[ T - 0.6T = 40 \]
\[ 0.4T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.4} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To find the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum these costs.

First, let's determine the cost of each type of fruit:
- The price of one apple is $0.5.
- The price of one banana is twice the price of one apple, so it is \(2 \times 0.5 = $1.0\).
- The price of one orange is three times the price of one banana, so it is \(3 \times 1.0 = $3.0\).

Next, we calculate the total cost for each type of fruit in the crate:
- The cost of 5 bananas is \(5 \times 1.0 = $5.0\).
- The cost of 12 apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = $6.0\).
- The cost of 7 oranges is \(7 \times 3.0 = $21.0\).

"First, let's determine the total number of chairs needed for the function. We know that there are 42 adults and 15 babies, so the total number of people attending is:

\[ 42 + 15 = 57 \]

Next, we need to find out how many chairs are currently available. We know that the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs. Therefore, the number of regular chairs is:

\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

So, the total number of chairs currently available is:

\[ 40 \text{ (regular chairs)} + 8 \text{ (high chairs)} = 48 \text{ chairs} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more chairs are needed. Since 57 chairs are required and only 48 chairs are available, the number of additional chairs needed is:

"First, let's determine the total number of people in the group. Aiden and his 12 friends are going to the cinema, and they meet up with 7 more friends. So the total number of people is:

\[ 1 + 12 + 7 = 20 \]

Each person gets one seat, two drinks, and three snacks. Since each drink and each snack costs $2, we can calculate the cost for each person:

- Cost of drinks per person: \(2 \text{ drinks} \times \$2/\text{drink} = \$4\)
- Cost of snacks per person: \(3 \text{ snacks} \times \$2/\text{snack} = \$6\)

So, the total cost per person for drinks and snacks is:

\[ \$4 + \$6 = \$10 \]

Since there are 20 people in the group, the total cost for all the drinks and snacks is:

"First, let's determine the capacity of Gordy's truck. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, we can calculate Gordy's truck capacity as follows:

\[ \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = \text{Gissela's truck capacity} + 800 \]
\[ \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = 4000 + 800 = 4800 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that the combined capacity of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks is 11,600 pounds. Let's denote Gary's truck capacity by \( G \). Therefore, we can write the equation for the total capacity as:

\[ \text{Gissela's truck capacity} + \text{Gordy's truck capacity} + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11600 \]
\[ 4000 + 4800 + G = 11600 \]

Now, we solve for \( G \):

\[ 8800 + G = 11600 \]
\[ G = 11600 - 8800 \]

"First, we need to determine the speed of Martha's turtle. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, we can find the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5.

The cat's speed is 15 feet/second. Therefore, the turtle's speed is:
\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Next, we need to find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. We do this by multiplying the turtle's speed by the time:
\[ \text{Distance the turtle can crawl} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 120 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money the firefighters have left to raise and then calculate how many additional hours they need to work to reach their goal.

1. The total goal is $6300.
2. After 3 hours, they have raised $2100.
3. Therefore, the amount left to raise is $6300 - $2100 = $4200.
4. They need to raise this remaining amount at a rate of $2100 in 3 hours, which means they raise $700 per hour (since $2100 / 3 hours = $700 per hour).
5. To find out how many hours they need to raise the remaining $4200 at this rate, we divide $4200 by $700 per hour.

\[ \text{Hours needed} = \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

So, they need to raise for a total of 3 hours (already raised) + 6 hours (remaining) = 9 hours.

The final numerical answer is 9."
"To find the percent of the river's total water that is used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the percentage of water used by the city for industrial purposes.
2. Subtract this percentage from 100% to find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes.

First, we know that Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. Out of this 40%, 80% is used for industrial purposes. Therefore, the percentage of water used by the city for industrial purposes is:
\[ 40\% \times 80\% = 40\% \times 0.80 = 32\% \]

Next, to find the percentage of water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the industrial usage percentage from the total usage percentage:
\[ 40\% - 32\% = 8\% \]

So, the percent of the river's total water that is used by the city for non-industrial purposes is:
\[ 8\% \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the production rate for each type of ice cream.

For chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for chocolate ice cream is \( \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

For vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for vanilla ice cream is \( \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Next, we calculate the total production for 48 hours.

For chocolate ice cream:
- At a rate of 50 quarts per hour, in 48 hours, the factory would produce \( 50 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts} \).

For vanilla ice cream:
- At a rate of 12.5 quarts per hour, in 48 hours, the factory would produce \( 12.5 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts} \).

Finally, we add the total production of both types of ice cream:
- Total quarts made in 48 hours = 2400 quarts (chocolate) + 600 quarts (vanilla) = 3000 quarts.

The final numerical answer is:
3000"
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of baked good:

- Croissants: 5 croissants * $3.00 each = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls * $2.50 each = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches * $4.00 each = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 blueberry muffins * $1.00 each = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost before the discount:

Total cost before discount = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Marcus gets a 10% discount on his purchase. To find the discount amount:

Discount amount = 10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final bill:

Final bill = $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

So, Marcus' total bill is $45.00."
"First, let's determine the cost of the deal. For every 2 scoops bought, Erin gets 1 scoop free. Since each scoop costs $1.50, the cost of 2 scoops is:

\[ 2 \times 1.50 = 3.00 \]

With the deal, for every $3.00 spent, Erin gets 3 scoops (2 bought + 1 free). Now, let's see how many sets of $3.00 Erin can spend with her $6.00:

\[ 6.00 \div 3.00 = 2 \]

Erin can get 2 sets of 3 scoops with her $6.00. Therefore, the total number of scoops she can buy is:

\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

"To determine how much more candy Amy has after two weeks compared to Ginger, we need to calculate the amount of candy each of them eats over that period and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the number of days in two weeks:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ days} \]

Next, we calculate how much candy Ginger eats in 14 days:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Then, we calculate how much candy Amy eats in 14 days:
\[ 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we find out how much candy Ginger has left after 14 days:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces} \]

And how much candy Amy has left after 14 days:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces} \]

Finally, we find the difference in the amount of candy Amy has compared to Ginger:

"First, let's calculate the total cost James incurred for picking the blueberries. The cost to go picking is $20, and the cost per pound is $1.5. He picked 30 pounds, so the cost for the blueberries is:

\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.5 \text{ per pound} = \$45 \]

Adding the initial cost to go picking, the total cost for James is:

\[ \$20 + \$45 = \$65 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the same 30 pounds of blueberries at the store. The store price is $2.5 per pound, so the total cost at the store is:

\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.5 \text{ per pound} = \$75 \]

To find out how much James saved compared to buying at the store, we subtract the total cost James incurred from the total cost at the store:

\[ \$75 - \$65 = \$10 \]

So, James saved $10 by picking the blueberries himself compared to buying them at the store. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the original price of each computer. The company planned to buy each computer for $700, but the actual price was 10% higher than this amount.

To find the new price of each computer:
\[ \text{New Price} = \text{Original Price} + (\text{Original Price} \times 10\%) \]
\[ \text{New Price} = 700 + (700 \times 0.10) \]
\[ \text{New Price} = 700 + 70 \]
\[ \text{New Price} = 770 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of money paid for 500 computers at the new price of $770 each:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Number of Computers} \times \text{New Price} \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 500 \times 770 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 385,000 \]

So, the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices is $385,000."
"To calculate the total calories in the omelet, we need to consider the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham.

- John uses 6 eggs, and each egg is 75 calories. Therefore, the total calories from eggs are \(6 \times 75 = 450\) calories.
- The cheese is 2 oz, and each ounce of cheese is 120 calories. Therefore, the total calories from cheese are \(2 \times 120 = 240\) calories.
- The ham is also 2 oz, and each ounce of ham is 40 calories. Therefore, the total calories from ham are \(2 \times 40 = 80\) calories.

Adding these together, the total calories in the omelet are \(450 + 240 + 80 = 770\) calories.

The final numerical answer is 770 calories."

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of taps Helga makes with both her feet over the 5-minute period, considering the different tap rates for different parts of her dance.

First, let's calculate the number of taps when her arms are at her sides:
- Right foot tap rate: 300 taps per minute
- Left foot tap rate: 250 taps per minute
- Combined tap rate: 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute

For 3 minutes (since she raises her arms for 2 minutes, she dances with her arms at her sides for 5 - 2 = 3 minutes):
\[ 550 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 1650 \text{ taps} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of taps when her arms are raised:
- Right foot tap rate: 200 taps per minute
- Left foot tap rate: 200 taps per minute
- Combined tap rate: 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute

For 2 minutes:
\[ 400 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 800 \text{ taps} \]

Now, we add the taps from both parts of the dance:
\[ 1650 \text{ taps} + 800 \text{ taps} = 2450 \text{ taps} \]

The combined total number of times that Helga taps both of her feet is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost for Ron if he decides to fix the pothole himself.

1. The cost of fixing the pothole is $450.
2. The fine for unauthorized road maintenance is $120.
3. The cost of 3 buckets of asphalt is $25 per bucket, so for 3 buckets, it is \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.

Now, let's add up all these costs:
\[ 450 + 120 + 75 = 645 \]

So, the total cost for Ron if he fixes the pothole himself is $645.

Since the pothole will cause $450 worth of damage to his car if it doesn't get fixed, the amount of money Ron saves by fixing the pothole is:
\[ 450 - 645 = -295 \]

However, since the question asks for the amount of money saved, and Ron would actually lose $295, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{-295} \]"

"First, let's determine the total number of slices of pizza ordered. Since there are 5 people (Bryce and his four friends) and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate how many slices Bryce and two of his friends ate. They ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizzas:
\[ 2 \times 12 \times \frac{2}{3} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Then, we calculate how many slices the remaining two friends ate. They ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizzas:
\[ 2 \times 12 \times \frac{3}{4} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Now, we find the total number of slices eaten by all five people:
\[ 16 + 18 = 34 \]

Finally, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices ordered to find out how many slices are left:
\[ 60 - 34 = 26 \]

"First, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 8 feet and 4 inches to inches as follows:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} + 4 \text{ inches} = 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, Topher's shoe is 100 inches long. According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( x \) inches. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many packs of gum Parker will need for 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will chew in 30 days.
2. Determine how many packs of gum are required based on the total number of pieces calculated in step 1.

First, we calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will chew in 30 days:
\[ \text{Total pieces of gum} = \text{Pieces per day} \times \text{Number of days} \]
\[ \text{Total pieces of gum} = 4 \times 30 = 120 \]

Next, we determine how many packs of gum are needed. Since each pack contains 15 pieces of gum:
\[ \text{Number of packs} = \frac{\text{Total pieces of gum}}{\text{Pieces per pack}} \]
\[ \text{Number of packs} = \frac{120}{15} = 8 \]

Therefore, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

\[ 50\% \text{ more than candidate A's votes} = 20 + (0.50 \times 20) = 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ votes} \]

Now, we can find out how many votes candidate C received by subtracting the votes of candidates A and B from the total number of votes.

Total votes:
\[ 100 \]

Votes for candidate C:
\[ 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \text{ votes} \]

So, candidate C received 50 votes. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many apples Beck has initially. Since Boris has 100 apples and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, we can calculate the number of apples Beck has as follows:

\[ \text{Beck's initial apples} = \text{Boris's apples} - 23 = 100 - 23 = 77 \]

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. So, we need to update the number of apples each person has after this transaction:

\[ \text{Boris's apples after giving 10 to Beck} = 100 - 10 = 90 \]
\[ \text{Beck's apples after receiving 10 from Boris} = 77 + 10 = 87 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after this transaction:

\[ \text{Difference in apples} = \text{Boris's apples} - \text{Beck's apples} = 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of water used for the giant cubes. Peter makes 3 giant cubes, and each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water. Therefore, the total water used for the giant cubes is:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of water used for the medium cubes. Peter makes 7 medium cubes, and each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water. Therefore, the total water used for the medium cubes is:
\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ ounces} \]

Then, let's calculate the total amount of water used for the small cubes. Peter makes 8 small cubes, and each small cube uses 0.5 ounces of water. Therefore, the total water used for the small cubes is:
\[ 8 \times 0.5 = 4 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, let's add up the total amount of water used for all the cubes:
\[ 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. After using 30 ounces, the amount of water left is:
\[ 32 - 30 = 2 \text{ ounces} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's start by determining how many books Steven has. We know that Clara has two times as many books as Steven and Clara has 20 books. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find out how many books Steven has:

\[ 2 \times \text{Steven's books} = 20 \]

Solving for Steven's books:

\[ \text{Steven's books} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Now, we know Steven has 10 books. Since Alice has 6 more books than Steven, we can calculate the number of books Alice has:

\[ \text{Alice's books} = \text{Steven's books} + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16 \]

Next, we need to find out how many more books Clara has than Alice. Clara has 20 books and Alice has 16 books, so:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Clara's books} - \text{Alice's books} = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, Clara has 4 more books than Alice. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. Since a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar and a gallon jar costs $5, we can calculate the cost of a half-gallon jar as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of gallon jar} - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars:

\[ \text{Total cost for 10 gallon jars} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \]

Then, we calculate the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars:

\[ \text{Total cost for 16 half-gallon jars} = 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

Finally, we add the two amounts to find the total amount of money Cecelia spent:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 50 + 48 = 98 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total number of students**: 50
2. **Students who like to bake**: 10
3. **Students who like to play basketball**: 5
4. **Students who like to play video games or play music**: The rest of the students, which is \(50 - 10 - 5 = 35\).

Let's denote the number of students who like to play music as \(M\) and the number of students who like to play video games as \(V\). According to the problem, \(M = 2 \times 5 = 10\).

Since the total number of students who like to play video games or play music is 35, we can write the equation:
\[V + M = 35\]

Substituting the value of \(M\):
\[V + 10 = 35\]

Solving for \(V\):
\[V = 35 - 10 = 25\]

So, the number of students who like to play video games is 25.

"To find the number of boys in each class, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of students in each class.
2. Calculate the number of girls in each class.
3. Subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class to find the number of boys.

First, since the total number of students in both classes is 80 and each class has the same number of students, each class has:
\[ \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ students} \]

Next, since 40% of the students in each class are girls, the number of girls in each class is:
\[ 40 \times 0.40 = 16 \text{ girls} \]

Therefore, the number of boys in each class is:
\[ 40 - 16 = 24 \text{ boys} \]

"To determine how many animals Melissa will groom each day, we first need to calculate the total number of animals she has to groom this week. We can do this by adding the number of each type of animal:

- Dogs: 8
- Cats: 5
- Birds: 3
- Horses: 12

Total number of animals = 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28

Melissa has 7 days in a week to complete this grooming. To find out how many animals she will groom each day, we divide the total number of animals by the number of days:

"First, let's determine how many marbles Carl has. According to the problem, Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. Since Sean has 56 marbles, we can calculate the number of marbles Carl has as follows:

\[ \text{Number of marbles Carl has} = 4 \times \text{Number of marbles Sean has} = 4 \times 56 \]

Next, we calculate the number of marbles Sean has, which is given as 56. Now, we calculate the number of marbles Carl has:

\[ 4 \times 56 = 224 \]

So, Carl has 224 marbles. Now, we need to find out how many marbles Cal has. The problem states that Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. Therefore, we can express the number of marbles Cal has as twice the number of marbles Sean has:

\[ \text{Number of marbles Cal has} = 2 \times \text{Number of marbles Sean has} = 2 \times 56 \]

Now, we calculate the number of marbles Cal has:

\[ 2 \times 56 = 112 \]

So, Cal has 112 marbles. To find the total number of marbles that Carl and Cal have combined, we add the number of marbles Carl has to the number of marbles Cal has:

\[ \text{Total number of marbles} = \text{Number of marbles Carl has} + \text{Number of marbles Cal has} = 224 + 112 \]

Finally, we calculate the total:

\[ 224 + 112 = 336 \]

Therefore, the total number of marbles that Carl and Cal have combined is 336."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many students would be in each group if the activity is divided into 12 groups of equal size.

Given:
- Total number of students = 54
- Total number of groups required = 12

To find the number of students per group when divided into 12 groups:
\[ \text{Number of students per group} = \frac{\text{Total number of students}}{\text{Total number of groups}} = \frac{54}{12} = 4.5 \]

Since the number of students per group must be a whole number, it's clear that 12 groups of equal size are not possible with 54 students. However, the question asks how many more groups are needed to form if the activity is to be divided into 12 groups, which we have already determined is not feasible with the given number of students.

The question seems to be asking for the number of additional groups needed to reach 12 groups, but since 12 groups are not possible with 54 students, the number of additional groups needed is not a practical or meaningful number in this context.

Therefore, the number of additional groups needed to form 12 groups is:
\[ \text{Additional groups needed} = 12 - \text{Number of groups that can be formed} \]

Since 12 groups are not possible with 54 students, the number of additional groups needed is:
\[ \text{Additional groups needed} = 12 - 6 = 6 \]

So, the number of additional groups needed to form 12 groups is 6. However, this is not a practical solution given the initial conditions. The final numerical answer, based on the given conditions, is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine the total number of chairs Candy can rent out in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the weekly rental numbers and then extend that to the two 4-week months.

- Weekends: 2 days a week, 100 chairs rented each day.

For a single week:
- Weekday rental: \(5 \times 60 = 300\) chairs.
- Weekend rental: \(2 \times 100 = 200\) chairs.
- Total weekly rental: \(300 + 200 = 500\) chairs.

Now, let's calculate the total rental for two 4-week months:
- Total rental for one 4-week month: \(4 \times 500 = 2000\) chairs.
- Total rental for two 4-week months: \(2 \times 2000 = 4000\) chairs.

Therefore, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is 4000."

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - Number of small stickers traded: \( 0.9 \times 30 = 27 \) small stickers.
   - Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she trades 27 small stickers for 27 large buttons.

3. **Remaining Small Stickers:**
   - Remaining small stickers: \( 30 - 27 = 3 \) small stickers.

4. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - Number of large stickers traded: \( 0.5 \times 40 = 20 \) large stickers.
   - Since each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons, trading 20 large stickers for large buttons gives her 20 large buttons.

5. **Remaining Large Stickers:**
   - Remaining large stickers: \( 40 - 20 = 20 \) large stickers.

6. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons.
   - Since each large sticker is worth three small buttons, she trades 20 large stickers for \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) small buttons.

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, so it is \( 2x \).

The total number of votes cast is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is \( x + 2x = 3x \).

We know the total number of people on the council is 33, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x \):
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Thus, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 22 \).

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Extra-small (XS) shirts**: 11 students need size extra-small.
2. **Small (S) shirts**: Twice as many students need size small as extra small. Therefore, the number of students needing size small is \(2 \times 11 = 22\).
3. **Medium (M) shirts**: Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size medium is \(22 - 4 = 18\).
4. **Large (L) shirts**: Half as many students need size large as size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size large is \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\).
5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts**: Six more students need size extra-large than large. Therefore, the number of students needing size extra-large is \(9 + 6 = 15\).

Now, we sum up the number of students needing each size to find the total number of shirts ordered:

\[
11 \text{ (XS)} + 22 \text{ (S)} + 18 \text{ (M)} + 9 \text{ (L)} + 15 \text{ (XL)} = 75

"Let's denote the total number of puppies Jana has as \( P \).

According to the problem, two thirds of the puppies are Pomeranians. So, the number of Pomeranian puppies is \( \frac{2}{3}P \).

It is also given that one third of the Pomeranian puppies are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3}P \right) = 6 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{9}P = 6 \]

To find \( P \), we solve for \( P \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \( \frac{9}{2} \):
\[ P = 6 \times \frac{9}{2} = 27 \]

So, Jana has 27 puppies in total. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The first house needs \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the second house, so the first house needs \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases.
- The third house needs double the first house, so the third house needs \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) cases.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{5}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{5} \):
\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{5} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

Since the third house needs \( x \) cases, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

So, Ahmed read 150 books in one hour.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of books Ezra has read after deciding to read 150 more books. Initially, Ezra read 300 books, and he decided to read 150 more:

\[ \text{Ezra's total books} = 300 + 150 = 450 \]

Now, we add the number of books Ahmed and Ezra have read to find the total number of books read altogether:

\[ \text{Total books} = \text{Ahmed's books} + \text{Ezra's total books} = 150 + 450 = 600 \]

Therefore, the total number of books they have read altogether is:

\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"To calculate Tanya's earnings for the two days, we need to break down her earnings for each day and then sum them up.

**Monday:**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She also earns an additional $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Monday:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} \times 5 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 20 \times 5 \times 15 = \$1500 \]

Next, calculate the additional earnings for Monday:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} > 3 \text{ classes} \]
\[ 4 \text{ classes} - 3 \text{ classes} = 1 \text{ extra class} \]
\[ 1 \text{ extra class} \times \$5 = \$5 \]

So, the total earnings for Monday are:
\[ \$1500 + \$5 = \$1505 \]

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She does not earn the additional $5 per day since she does not teach more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Wednesday:
\[ 2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 2 \times 2 \times 15 = \$60 \]

Since she does not teach more than 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5 per day.

So, the total earnings for Wednesday are:
\[ \$60 \]

Now, sum up the earnings for both days:
\[ \$1505 + \$60 = \$1565 \]

Therefore, Tanya earned a total of \$1565 for these two days of teaching."
"To determine how many more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of vanilla scents sold and the total number of fruity scents sold, and then find the difference between these two quantities.

The perfume company sold 5 vanilla scents and 2 fruity scents by the end of the day.

Total vanilla scents sold = 5
Total fruity scents sold = 2

Difference in sales = Total vanilla scents sold - Total fruity scents sold
Difference in sales = 5 - 2 = 3

Therefore, 3 more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents.

The final numerical answer is:
3"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Bennet makes from selling the eggplants.

He sells 20 eggplants at $3 each, so the total from the eggplants is:
\[ 20 \text{ eggplants} \times \$3/\text{eggplant} = \$60 \]

Bennet wants to make a total of $135. To find out how much more he needs to make from selling the corn, we subtract the amount he already has from the total he wants to make:
\[ \$135 - \$60 = \$75 \]

Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for to make the additional $75, we divide the remaining amount by the number of ears of corn:
\[ \frac{\$75}{25 \text{ ears}} = \$3/\text{ear} \]

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$3 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours Tatiana has available over the weekend:

\[ 7 \text{ hours (Saturday)} + 5 \text{ hours (Sunday)} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we determine the remaining time after she reads for 3 hours:

\[ 12 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Tatiana plays video games for \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the remaining time:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the time she spends playing soccer. Subtract the time spent on video games and reading from the total available time:

\[ 12 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours (video games)} - 3 \text{ hours (reading)} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

To find the percentage of the weekend Tatiana spends playing soccer, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent playing soccer}}{\text{Total weekend hours}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{12 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the percentage of her weekend Tatiana spends playing soccer is:

\[ \boxed{50\%} \]"
"First, let's determine how many pencils Anthony gave to Brandon. Since he gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon, we calculate:

\[ \text{Pencils given to Brandon} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \]

After giving 25 pencils to Brandon, Anthony has:

\[ \text{Remaining pencils} = 50 - 25 = 25 \]

Next, Anthony gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Pencils given to Charlie} = \frac{3}{5} \times 25 = 15 \]

After giving 15 pencils to Charlie, the number of pencils Anthony kept is:

\[ \text{Pencils Anthony kept} = 25 - 15 = 10 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how long Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time he spends driving to the museum, the time he spends at the museum, and the time he spends driving back home.

First, let's calculate the time spent driving to the museum. The distance to the museum is 150 miles and Jack drives at a speed of 75 mph. The time spent driving to the museum is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time spent driving to the museum is:

\[ \text{Time to museum} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Since the distance and speed for the return trip are the same, the time spent driving back home is also 2 hours.

Next, we add the time spent at the museum, which is 6 hours, to the time spent driving to the museum and the time spent driving back home:

\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time to museum} + \text{Time at museum} + \text{Time back home} \]
\[ \text{Total time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total time Jack is gone from home is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total number of wheels required for the cars and motorcycles.

For the cars:
\[ 57 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ wheels per car} = 228 \text{ wheels} \]

For the motorcycles:
\[ 73 \text{ motorcycles} \times 2 \text{ wheels per motorcycle} = 146 \text{ wheels} \]

Now, we add the wheels required for the cars and motorcycles to find the total number of wheels needed:
\[ 228 \text{ wheels} + 146 \text{ wheels} = 374 \text{ wheels} \]

Henry has 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left after assembling all the toys, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the number of wheels Henry has:

"To calculate the price after a 20% discount, first find the amount of the discount and then subtract it from the original price.

The discount amount is 20% of $1000, which can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 1000 \times \frac{20}{100} = 1000 \times 0.20 = 200 \]

Subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the final price:
\[ \text{Final Price} = 1000 - 200 = 800 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of movies that are in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of series movies} = \frac{600}{3} = 200 \]

This means the number of non-series movies is:

\[ \text{Number of non-series movies} = 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Next, we calculate the number of older movies among the non-series movies. Since 40% of the non-series movies are older movies, we have:

\[ \text{Number of older movies} = 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \]

The remaining non-series movies are not older movies:

\[ \text{Number of non-series movies that are not older} = 400 - 160 = 240 \]

Now, we calculate the cost of replacing the movies. The cost for the series movies is $6 each, and the cost for the non-series movies (both older and not older) is $10 each.

The total cost for the series movies is:

\[ \text{Cost for series movies} = 200 \times 6 = 1200 \]

The total cost for the non-series movies is:

\[ \text{Cost for non-series movies} = (160 + 240) \times 10 = 400 \times 10 = 4000 \]

Adding these costs together gives the total cost to replace the movies:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 1200 + 4000 = 5200 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{5200} \]"
"To calculate how much Winston spent on fruit, we need to multiply the number of pounds of each type of fruit by their respective prices and then sum the totals.

For peaches:
6 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $12.00

For plums:
8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = $8.00

For apricots:
6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Now, we sum these amounts to find the total cost:
$12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

So, Winston spent $38.00 on fruit."
"First, let's calculate the distance the Llesis family drove. They drove for 6 hours at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.

\[ \text{Distance driven} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 50 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to determine the hiking speed. The problem states that the hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half the driving speed.

\[ \text{Hiking speed} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 \, \text{miles/hour} - 5 \, \text{miles/hour} = 25 \, \text{miles/hour} - 5 \, \text{miles/hour} = 20 \, \text{miles/hour} \]

Given that they hiked for 1.5 hours at this speed, we can calculate the distance they hiked.

\[ \text{Distance hiked} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 20 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, to find the total distance to their vacation spot, we add the distance driven and the distance hiked.

\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance driven} + \text{Distance hiked} = 300 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 330 \, \text{miles} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumps on as \( E_e \) and the number of berries she collects as \( B_e \). Ava jumps on \( E_a = E_e + 8 \) enemies and collects \( B_a = B_e + 3 \) berries. Emma's score can be represented as \( S_e = 10E_e + 5B_e \), and Ava's score can be represented as \( S_a = 10E_a + 5B_a + 30 \times 4 \).

Substituting the values for \( E_a \) and \( B_a \) into Ava's score equation, we get:
\[ S_a = 10(E_e + 8) + 5(B_e + 3) + 120 \]
\[ S_a = 10E_e + 80 + 5B_e + 15 + 120 \]
\[ S_a = 10E_e + 5B_e + 215 \]

Since Emma's score is \( S_e = 10E_e + 5B_e \), the difference in their scores is:
\[ S_a - S_e = (10E_e + 5B_e + 215) - (10E_e + 5B_e) \]
\[ S_a - S_e = 215 \]

Therefore, the difference between their two scores is 215 points."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each. Then, we subtract this amount from the total cost to find the combined cost of the other two pizzas. Finally, we divide this amount by 2 to find the cost of each of the other two pizzas.

The total cost of the four pizzas is 64 dollars. The cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each is:
\[ 30 + 30 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting this from the total cost gives the combined cost of the other two pizzas:
\[ 64 - 60 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the combined cost of these two pizzas by 2:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, each of the other two pizzas cost 2 dollars. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of rides on usual days:**
   - Chase and Rider ride their bikes thrice a day.
   - They do this for 5 days.
   - Therefore, the number of rides on usual days is \(3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides}\).

2. **Determine the number of rides on special days:**
   - On two other days, they ride twice the usual number of times.
   - The usual number of rides per day is 3, so twice that is \(2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ rides/day}\).
   - They do this for 2 days.
   - Therefore, the number of rides on special days is \(6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides}\).

3. **Calculate the total number of rides in a week:**
   - The total number of rides is the sum of the rides on usual days and the rides on special days.
   - Total rides = \(15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides}\).

The final numerical answer is 27."
"Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as \( w \) and the number of orange fish he bought as \( o \). We know that the total number of fish he bought from the pet store is \( o + w = 17 \).

After adding these fish to his pond, the total number of orange fish became \( 3 + o \) and the total number of white fish became \( 4 + w \). According to the problem, after adding the new fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish. This gives us the equation:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( o + w = 17 \)
2. \( 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \)

Let's solve the second equation first:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]
\[ 3 + o = 8 + 2w \]
\[ o - 2w = 5 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( o + w = 17 \)
2. \( o - 2w = 5 \)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use elimination. First, we can eliminate \( o \) by subtracting the second equation from the first:
\[ (o + w) - (o - 2w) = 17 - 5 \]
\[ o + w - o + 2w = 12 \]
\[ 3w = 12 \]
\[ w = 4 \]

Now that we have \( w = 4 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( o \):
\[ o + 4 = 17 \]
\[ o = 13 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish and 13 orange fish. The number of white fish Bob bought at the store is \( \boxed{4} \)."
"First, let's calculate the total distance Andy travels in a week. Since he goes to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days. The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, so the round trip distance is \(5 \times 2 = 10\) miles per day. Therefore, the total distance he travels in a week is \(10 \times 5 = 50\) miles.

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of gas Andy consumes in a week. Given that his car's fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon, the number of gallons consumed for 50 miles is \(50 \div 10 = 5\) gallons.

Finally, we calculate the cost of the gas consumed in a week. If the price of gas is $3 per gallon, then the cost for 5 gallons is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie received from her aunt.

Carrie received ten twenties, which means she received:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Carrie also received 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount from the quarters is:
\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie spent. She spent all the quarters, which is $35, and 3/5 of the twenties. The amount spent on the twenties is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = \frac{3 \times 200}{5} = \frac{600}{5} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

The total amount of money spent is the sum of the money spent on quarters and the money spent on twenties:

Therefore, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is:
\[ \boxed{155} \]"
"To determine the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to calculate the yield from the tomato plants and the eggplant plants separately, and then sum these yields.

First, we calculate the yield from the tomato plants:
- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo planted 5 tomato plants.

\[
\text{Total tomatoes} = 5 \text{ plants} \times 22 \text{ tomatoes/plant} = 110 \text{ tomatoes}
\]

Next, we calculate the yield from the eggplant plants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo planted 8 eggplant plants.

\[
\text{Total eggplants} = 8 \text{ plants} \times 4 \text{ eggplants/plant} = 32 \text{ eggplants}
\]

Now, we sum the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits:

"To find out how many OLED TVs were sold, we first need to determine the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold, and then subtract these from the total sales.

Given:
- One-fourth of the sales are smart TVs.
- One-eighth of the sales are analog TVs.
- The rest are OLED TVs.
- Total sales = 40 TVs.

First, calculate the number of smart TVs sold:
\[ \text{Number of smart TVs} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

Next, calculate the number of analog TVs sold:
\[ \text{Number of analog TVs} = \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5 \]

Now, calculate the number of OLED TVs sold by subtracting the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total sales:
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (\text{Number of smart TVs} + \text{Number of analog TVs}) \]
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (10 + 5) \]
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - 15 \]
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 25 \]

So, the number of OLED TVs sold is 25."
"To determine how much money John is missing, we first need to calculate the total cost of the trip and then subtract the amount of money he already has.

The total cost of the trip is $300. The school has decided to cover half of this cost, so the school will cover:

"First, we need to determine the temperature difference that needs to be prevented. The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. During the night, the temperature is 33 degrees colder than during the day, so the night temperature is:

\[ 45 \text{ degrees} - 33 \text{ degrees} = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

Since the night temperature is 12 degrees, we need to calculate how many degrees above 32 degrees the temperature needs to be to prevent the pipes from freezing. This is:

\[ 32 \text{ degrees} - 12 \text{ degrees} = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs are needed to raise the temperature by 20 degrees, we divide the required temperature increase by the temperature increase per log:

Jamie's regular hourly rate is $20 per hour.

Her special hourly rate, which is 150% of her regular hourly rate, can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Special hourly rate} = 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much Jamie was paid for her regular hours and her additional hours.

Jamie worked 11 hours in total. Since her regular workday is 8 hours, she worked:
\[ 11 - 8 = 3 \text{ additional hours} \]

Now, we calculate the total payment:
\[ \text{Payment for regular hours} = 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]
\[ \text{Payment for additional hours} = 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total payment for the day:

"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of employees after three months.
2. Calculate the total salary paid to all employees each month.
3. Multiply the total salary per month by the number of months (three months).

**Step 1: Determine the number of employees after three months.**

The company hires 20 new employees every month. After three months, the number of new hires is:
\[ 20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees} \]

Adding these to the initial 200 employees:
\[ 200 \text{ initial employees} + 60 \text{ new employees} = 260 \text{ employees} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total salary paid to all employees each month.**

Each employee is paid $4000 per month. Therefore, the total salary paid to 260 employees each month is:
\[ 260 \text{ employees} \times 4000 \text{ dollars/employee} = 1040000 \text{ dollars/month} \]

**Step 3: Multiply the total salary per month by the number of months (three months).**

The total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the hourly wages for both Billy and Sally, and then determine the total earnings for 20 hours for each. Finally, we will find the difference in their earnings.

First, let's determine Billy's hourly wage at each stage:
- Initial hourly wage: $10 per hour.
- After 2 months, the hourly wage increases by $0.50, so it becomes $10.50 per hour.
- On his first anniversary, the hourly wage increases by another $1.00, so it becomes $11.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate Billy's total earnings for 20 hours:
- For the first 2 months (20 hours), his wage is $10 per hour.
- For the remaining 20 hours, his wage is $11.50 per hour.
- Total earnings for Billy = (20 hours * $10/hour) + (20 hours * $11.50/hour) = $200 + $230 = $430.

Next, let's determine Sally's hourly wage:
- Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's initial salary.
- Billy's initial salary is $10 per hour, so Sally's starting salary is $10.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate Sally's total earnings for 20 hours:
- Sally's hourly wage is $10.50 per hour.
- Total earnings for Sally = 20 hours * $10.50/hour = $210.

Finally, we find the difference in their earnings:
- Difference = Billy's total earnings - Sally's total earnings = $430 - $210 = $220.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{220}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of 3 loaves of bread:
- The cost of one loaf of bread is $2.
- Therefore, the cost of 3 loaves of bread is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of 2 bagels:
- The cost of one bagel is $1.
- Therefore, the cost of 2 bagels is \(2 \times 1 = 2\) dollars.

Now, to find out how much more 3 loaves of bread cost than 2 bagels, we subtract the cost of 2 bagels from the cost of 3 loaves of bread:
- The difference is \(6 - 2 = 4\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is:
4"
"To find the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita, we first need to determine how many points Nikita scored. According to the problem, Nikita scored 11 more than half as many points as Pierson.

Pierson's score is 278 points. Half of Pierson's score is:
\[ \frac{278}{2} = 139 \]

Nikita's score is 11 more than this value:
\[ 139 + 11 = 150 \]

Now, to find the total points scored by both Pierson and Nikita, we add their individual scores together:
\[ 278 + 150 = 428 \]

So, the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita is:
\[ \boxed{428} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of students and teachers in the school.

The school has 40 classes, with an average of 25 students per class:
\[ \text{Total students} = 40 \text{ classes} \times 25 \text{ students/class} = 1000 \text{ students} \]

The school also has 40 classes, with an average of 3 teachers per class:
\[ \text{Total teachers} = 40 \text{ classes} \times 3 \text{ teachers/class} = 120 \text{ teachers} \]

Each child plants 1 tree, and each teacher plants 2 trees. Therefore, the total number of trees planted by the students is:
\[ \text{Trees planted by students} = 1000 \text{ students} \times 1 \text{ tree/student} = 1000 \text{ trees} \]

The total number of trees planted by the teachers is:
\[ \text{Trees planted by teachers} = 120 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ trees/teacher} = 240 \text{ trees} \]

Adding the trees planted by students and teachers together gives the total number of trees planted:
\[ \text{Total trees planted} = 1000 \text{ trees} + 240 \text{ trees} = 1240 \text{ trees} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 1240 \]"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has. She has:

- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

Adding these together, we get:
\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

Let's denote the number of stuffed goats Bubbles wants to buy as \( x \). After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \). We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30%, so we can set up the following equation:
\[ \frac{x}{14 + x} = 0.30 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by \( 14 + x \):
\[ x = 0.30(14 + x) \]

Next, we distribute the 0.30 on the right side:
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

To isolate \( x \), we subtract \( 0.30x \) from both sides:
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 0.70:
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours Kris has already played.

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks have \(2 \times 7 = 14\) days. Therefore, the total number of hours she has played in the first 2 weeks is:
\[ 14 \text{ days} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/day} = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Next, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of hours she has played in the last week is:
\[ 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/day} = 14 \text{ hours} \]

Adding the hours from both periods, the total number of hours Kris has played so far is:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} + 14 \text{ hours} = 21 \text{ hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. Therefore, the number of hours she still needs to play is:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} - 21 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 9 \]"
"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled by the first car:
- The first car travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance traveled by the first car is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled by the second car:
- The second car travels at an average speed of 70 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance traveled by the second car is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_2 = 70 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled by the two cars:
\[
\text{Separation distance} = \text{Distance}_2 - \text{Distance}_1 = 140 \, \text{miles} - 120 \, \text{miles} = 20 \, \text{miles}
\]

Thus, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car. The final numerical answer is:
\[

"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the ring before the premium is added. The cost of the diamond is $600 and the cost of the gold is $300. Therefore, the total cost before the premium is:

\[ 600 + 300 = 900 \]

Next, we need to calculate the premium. The premium is 30% of the total cost before the premium. To find 30% of $900, we multiply $900 by 0.30:

\[ 900 \times 0.30 = 270 \]

Now, we add the premium to the total cost before the premium to find the final amount James paid:

\[ 900 + 270 = 1170 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1170 \]"
"To find the overall pass rate for the school, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students tested.

First, let's calculate the pass rates for each grade:

- For third graders: \( \frac{340}{500} = 0.68 \) or 68%
- For fourth graders: \( \frac{40}{100} = 0.40 \) or 40%
- For fifth graders: The pass rate is twice that of fourth graders, so \( 2 \times 0.40 = 0.80 \) or 80%

Next, we calculate the total number of students who passed:

- Third graders: 340
- Fourth graders: 40
- Fifth graders: \( 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \)

Total number of students who passed = 340 + 40 + 320 = 700

Total number of students tested = 500 (third graders) + 100 (fourth graders) + 400 (fifth graders) = 1000

The overall pass rate is calculated as:

\[ \text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{\text{Total number of students who passed}}{\text{Total number of students tested}} = \frac{700}{1000} = 0.70 \]

So, the school's overall pass rate is 70%.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 70 \]"
"To determine how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has.
2. Determine the total area of the mosaic he can create with the chips he has.
3. Calculate the length of the mosaic based on the area and height.

First, let's find out how many glass chips Milo has:
- Each bag contains 72 chips.
- Milo has two bags.
- Therefore, the total number of chips is \( 72 \times 2 = 144 \) chips.

Next, we need to find out how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips:
- It takes 12 chips to make every square inch.
- Therefore, the total area in square inches is \( \frac{144}{12} = 12 \) square inches.

Now, we know the height of the mosaic is 3 inches. To find the length, we use the area formula for a rectangle (Area = Length × Height):
- The area is 12 square inches.
- The height is 3 inches.
- Therefore, the length is \( \frac{12}{3} = 4 \) inches.

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long. The final numerical answer is:

4"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

Each of the 4 students drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea consumed by these students is:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Each of the 16 students drank 2 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea consumed by these students is:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of tea consumed:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

We know that there are 10 quarts of tea left. Therefore, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we convert the total quarts to gallons:
\[ \frac{48}{4} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"Dale initially had 100 candies and sold 150, which means he is short by 50 candies (150 - 100 = 50). After ordering 100 more candies, the total number of candies he has is 100 (initial) + 100 (new order) = 200 candies. To find out how many candies he still needs to sell, we subtract the total number of candies he has from the number of candies he needs to sell, which is 200 (total he has) - 150 (already sold) = 50 candies.

Therefore, Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students on campus at the end of each month and then determine the total number of additional students who joined by the end of May.

Starting with 10 students at the beginning of the year, the number of students doubles every month.

- At the end of January: \(10 \times 2 = 20\) students
- At the end of February: \(20 \times 2 = 40\) students
- At the end of March: \(40 \times 2 = 80\) students
- At the end of April: \(80 \times 2 = 160\) students
- At the end of May: \(160 \times 2 = 320\) students

Now, we calculate the total number of additional students who joined by the end of May:

- Additional students in January: \(20 - 10 = 10\)
- Additional students in February: \(40 - 20 = 20\)
- Additional students in March: \(80 - 40 = 40\)
- Additional students in April: \(160 - 80 = 80\)
- Additional students in May: \(320 - 160 = 160\)

Summing these additional students:

\[10 + 20 + 40 + 80 + 160 = 310\]

Thus, the number of additional students who would have joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year, is 310."
"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we first need to determine the total number of branches he climbed during the week.

Given that Felix charges $0.25 per branch and he made $105 during the week, we can calculate the total number of branches he climbed by dividing the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\text{Total money made}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} \]

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = 420 \]

Since this total was made over the course of a week (7 days), we can find the average number of branches climbed per day by dividing the total branches by the number of days:

\[ \text{Branches climbed per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches climbed}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{420}{7} \]

\[ \text{Branches climbed per day} = 60 \]

So, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 60 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose initially picks:

- For the first 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals.
- For the next 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals.
- For the next 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals.
- For the last 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals.

Adding these together gives the total number of petals initially picked:
\[15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\] petals.

Next, Rose drops 1 of each type of flower:
- She drops 1 of the 5-petal flowers, which means she drops \(1 \times 5 = 5\) petals.
- She drops 1 of the 6-petal flowers, which means she drops \(1 \times 6 = 6\) petals.
- She drops 1 of the 4-petal flowers, which means she drops \(1 \times 4 = 4\) petals.
- She drops 1 of the 7-petal flowers, which means she drops \(1 \times 7 = 7\) petals.

The total number of petals dropped is:
\[5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\] petals.

Subtracting the dropped petals from the initial total gives the number of petals remaining in the vase:
\[101 - 22 = 79\] petals.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[79\]"
"First, let's determine the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean to make S'mores. John makes 9 S'mores and DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so together they make:

\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \text{ S'mores} \]

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they use 18 marshmallows in total. They started with 35 marshmallows and dropped 3 on the ground, so the number of marshmallows left is:

\[ 35 - 18 - 3 = 14 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Now, we need to determine how many S'mores they can make with the remaining 14 marshmallows. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they can make:

\[ 14 \text{ S'mores} \]

Since John and DeSean are sharing the remaining marshmallows equally, each of them can have:

\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ S'mores} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 7 \]"
"First, let's determine the total playtime for each person. Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter. His two friends who are significantly worse can play for 10 minutes each (half of 20 minutes), and his friend who is significantly better can play for 30 minutes (1.5 times 20 minutes).

The total playtime for Jack and his three friends is 4 hours, which is equivalent to 240 minutes. We can set up the equation as follows:

- Jack's playtime: 20 minutes
- Playtime for the first friend (worse): 10 minutes
- Playtime for the second friend (worse): 10 minutes
- Playtime for the third friend (better): 30 minutes

Let's add these up to see if they sum to 240 minutes:
\[ 20 + 10 + 10 + 30 = 70 \text{ minutes} \]

It seems there is a discrepancy because the total playtime is 240 minutes, not 70 minutes. Let's assume the playtime for the third friend (the better one) is actually 20 minutes instead of 30 minutes, as this would make the total playtime 240 minutes:
\[ 20 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

This still doesn't add up to 240 minutes. Let's assume the playtime for the third friend is 40 minutes instead of 20 minutes:

"Let's denote the amount of each ingredient Tanya uses as follows:
- Let \( S \) be the amount of salt.
- Let \( O \) be the amount of oil.
- Let \( F \) be the amount of fragrance.
- Let \( C \) be the amount of citrus zest.
- Let \( G \) be the amount of sugar.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S = G \) (same amount of salt as sugar)
2. \( O = 2S \) (twice as much oil as salt)
3. \( F = C \) (same amount of fragrance as citrus zest)
4. \( S = C \) (same amount of salt as citrus zest)

Since \( S = C \) and \( F = C \), we can say \( S = F = C \).

The total amount of ingredients in the jar is 10 ounces. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total amount of ingredients as:
\[ S + O + F + C + G = 10 \]

Substituting the relationships into the equation:
\[ S + 2S + S + S + S = 10 \]
\[ 6S = 10 \]
\[ S = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \]

Since \( O = 2S \):
\[ O = 2 \times \frac{5}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \]

Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \( \frac{10}{3} \) ounces. Converting this to a decimal, we get approximately 3.33 ounces, but the exact answer is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{10}{3}} \]"

"First, let's determine how many cars Joe initially has. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. The number of cars he sells is:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

After selling 8 cars, the number of cars Joe has left is:

\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \text{ cars} \]

Then, Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

After giving away 16 cars, the number of cars Joe has left is:

\[ 32 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, the final number of cars Joe remains with is:

"First, we need to determine how much money the students raised. The total amount raised by the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of this amount comes from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much each student raised. There are 20 students, and the total amount raised by the students is $125,000. So, the amount each student raised is:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

Thus, each student raised \(\boxed{6250}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine the total time Sandy walked on the first day. She walked for 8 hours on the first day.

Next, we calculate the time she walked on the second day. She walked half as many hours on the second day as she did on the first day. Therefore, the time she walked on the second day is:
\[ \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add the time from both days to find the total time in hours:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we use the conversion factor that 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes:
\[ 12 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is:
\[ \boxed{720} \]"
"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of cars in the parking lot after the first break.
2. Calculate how many cars left the parking lot during the lunch break.
3. Find out how many cars remained in the parking lot after the lunch break.

Initially, Hunter counted 50 cars. During the first break, he counted 20 more cars. Therefore, the total number of cars in the parking lot after the first break is:
\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \]

During the lunch break, half of the cars left the parking lot. So, the number of cars that left is:
\[ \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

The number of cars remaining in the parking lot after the lunch break is:
\[ 70 - 35 = 35 \]

Thus, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is:

"First, let's determine the points scored by Sasha and Julie in the first game.

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, so:
\[ \text{Julie's points in the first game} = 14 - 4 = 10 \]

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie did in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored:
\[ \text{Sasha's points in the second game} = 10 - 6 = 4 \]

Now, we can calculate the total points Sasha scored during both games:
\[ \text{Total points for Sasha} = 14 + 4 = 18 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 18 \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total number of tins of cat food Kimberly bought. Since she bought 8 packages of cat food and each package contains 11 tins, the total number of tins of cat food is:

\[ 8 \times 11 = 88 \text{ tins} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of tins of dog food Kimberly bought. Since she bought 6 packages of dog food and each package contains 6 tins, the total number of tins of dog food is:

\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \text{ tins} \]

To find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we subtract the total number of tins of dog food from the total number of tins of cat food:

\[ 88 - 36 = 52 \]

So, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 52 \]"
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now we can find out how many cards Becca has:
\[ 3P + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

So, Becca has 153 cards. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 153 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of each color of eggs Cindy has:

- Cindy has 5 green eggs.
- She has twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she has \(2 \times 5 = 10\) blue eggs.
- She has one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so she has \(10 - 1 = 9\) pink eggs.
- She has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she has \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\) yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs:

- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: 10
- Pink eggs: 9
- Yellow eggs: 3

Total number of eggs = \(5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27\)

So, the final numerical answer is 27."
"First, let's calculate the shipping cost. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound plus $0.08 per mile. The book weighs 4 pounds and needs to be shipped 20 miles away.

The cost for the weight of the book is:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.35/\text{pound} = \$1.40 \]

The cost for the distance is:
\[ 20 \text{ miles} \times \$0.08/\text{mile} = \$1.60 \]

So, the total shipping cost is:
\[ \$1.40 + \$1.60 = \$3.00 \]

Next, we need to calculate the refundable amount from Amazon. Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price. The book cost $32, so the refundable amount is:
\[ 0.75 \times \$32 = \$24.00 \]

Now, we can determine how much money Milly will lose. She will lose the cost of the book plus the shipping cost, but only get a refund of 75% of the book's cost. Therefore, the loss is:
\[ \$32 + \$3.00 - \$24.00 = \$11.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Mulan has after receiving money from her father:

Mulan's initial amount: $40

"To determine the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then sum them up.

1. **Time spent on TikTok videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week.
   - Each video is 4 minutes long.
   - Therefore, the time spent on TikTok videos each week is \(18 \times 4 = 72\) minutes.
   - For a month with four weeks, the time spent on TikTok videos is \(72 \times 4 = 288\) minutes.

2. **Time spent writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Since 1 hour equals 60 minutes, 2 hours equal \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes.
   - For a month with four weeks, the time spent writing songs is \(120 \times 4 = 480\) minutes.

3. **Time spent on makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup.
   - For a week, the time spent on makeup is \(15 \times 6 = 90\) minutes.
   - For a month with four weeks, the time spent on makeup is \(90 \times 4 = 360\) minutes.

Now, we sum up the time spent on all activities:
\[ 288 \text{ minutes} + 480 \text{ minutes} + 360 \text{ minutes} = 1128 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
\[ \frac{1128}{60} = 18.8 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the cost for Angela, we need to break down the costs step by step.

First, let's calculate the cost for the additional items Angela needs:
- Angela needs 6 mirrors, and the base installation includes 4 mirrors. Therefore, she needs 2 additional mirrors.
- Angela needs 2 chandeliers, and the base installation includes 1 chandelier. Therefore, she needs 1 additional chandelier.
- Angela needs 20 pictures, and the base installation includes 10 pictures. Therefore, she needs 10 additional pictures.

The cost for the additional mirrors, chandeliers, and pictures is:
- Additional mirrors: 2 * $15.00 = $30.00
- Additional chandeliers: 1 * $15.00 = $15.00
- Additional pictures: 10 * $15.00 = $150.00

Adding these together gives the total cost for the additional items:
$30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00

Next, we add the base installation cost to the cost of the additional items:
Base installation cost: $129.00
Additional items cost: $195.00

Total cost:
$129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{324.00}

"First, let's determine how much money Anthony has saved. Since Eva has saved $20.00 and Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, we can calculate Anthony's savings as follows:

\[ \text{Anthony's savings} = \text{Eva's savings} + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money Roy has saved. We know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we calculate:

\[ 40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 0.40 \times 30 = 12 \]

So, Roy's savings are:

\[ \text{Roy's savings} = \text{Anthony's savings} + 40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 30 + 12 = 42 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{42} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from Pompei's lifting capacity to Naruto's.

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain \(12 \times 1 = 12\) inches high.
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain \(4 \times 12 = 48\) inches high.
4. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain \(10 \times 48 = 480\) inches high.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert 480 inches to feet:

\[ 480 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 40 \text{ feet} \]"
"To find the total distance Mason has traveled, we can use the formula for distance, which is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

First, we calculate the distance traveled during the first part of the journey:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance traveled during the second part of the journey:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we add the distances from both parts of the journey to find the total distance:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the total distance Mason has traveled is:
\[ 80 \, \text{miles} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total distance traveled by the kangaroos:**
   - Let the distance across the highway be \( D \).
   - Let the speed of each kangaroo be \( v \).
   - Since it takes 3 kangaroos 18 hours to travel the distance \( D \), the total distance \( D \) can be calculated as:
     \[
     D = 3v \times 18 = 54v
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of each turtle:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of each turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).

3. **Calculate the time it takes for four turtles to travel the distance \( D \):**
   - Let \( t \) be the time it takes for four turtles to travel the distance \( D \).
   - The total distance \( D \) can also be expressed as:
     \[
     D = 4 \times \left(\frac{v}{2}\right) \times t = 2vt
     \]
   - Since we know \( D = 54v \), we can set the two expressions for \( D \) equal to each other:
     \[
     54v = 2vt
     \]
   - Solving for \( t \):
     \[
     t = \frac{54v}{2v} = 27
     \]

Therefore, it will take four turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{27}

"First, let's determine the final price of the laptop after the trade-in discount. The original price of the laptop is $600, and the trade-in discount is $200. Therefore, the final price is:

\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means she currently has:

\[ 400 - 50 = 350 \]

Erika has received money from three sources: her part-time job, her mom, and her savings in her purse. Let's denote the amount of money she has in her purse as \( x \). According to the problem, the total amount of money she has is:

\[ x + 150 + 80 = 350 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 230 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

So, Erika has $120 in her purse. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of slices Adam gets from the large apples. Since each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces and Adam slices 3 large apples, the total number of slices from the large apples is:
\[ 3 \text{ apples} \times 5 \text{ slices/apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of slices Adam gets from the small apples. Since each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces and Adam slices 5 small apples, the total number of slices from the small apples is:
\[ 5 \text{ apples} \times 3 \text{ slices/apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we add the slices from the large apples and the small apples to find the total number of slices Adam has:

"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to have to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to calculate the current daily milk production and then find out how much additional milk is needed.

The current daily milk production from 3 cows is:
\[ 3 \text{ cows} \times 5 \text{ liters/cow} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The additional milk needed is:
\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed to produce the additional 10 liters of milk is:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs to have 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years with simple interest, we can use the formula for simple interest:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Given:
- Principal (\(P\)) = $300
- Rate (\(R\)) = \(\frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225\%\)
- Time (\(T\)) = 3 years

First, we calculate the simple interest:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 225\% \times 3 \]

Since the rate is given as a percentage, we need to convert it to a decimal by dividing by 100:

\[ 225\% = \frac{225}{100} = 2.25 \]

Now, we can calculate the simple interest:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 2.25 \times 3 = 2025 \]

The total amount after 3 years is the sum of the principal and the simple interest:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Simple Interest} = 300 + 2025 = 2325 \]

So, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:

- Therefore, the total discount for the red food is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) dollars.
- The total cost for the red food after the discount is \( 3 \times 18 - 6 = 54 - 6 = 48 \) dollars.

Finally, we add the total cost of the green food and the total cost of the red food to find the overall total cost:
- Total cost = Cost of green food + Cost of red food after discount
- Total cost = \( 75 + 48 = 123 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
123"
"To find out how many hours it would take to clean one-half of the rooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of rooms to be cleaned: \( \frac{90}{2} = 45 \) rooms.
2. Calculate the total time required to clean these rooms in minutes: \( 45 \times 20 = 900 \) minutes.
3. Convert the total time from minutes to hours: \( \frac{900}{60} = 15 \) hours.

"To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built each year and then sum them up.

1. In the first year, the town builds 12 homes.
2. In the second year, they build three times the number of homes built in the first year. So, they build \(3 \times 12 = 36\) homes.
3. In the third year, they double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total number of homes built in the first two years is \(12 + 36 = 48\). Therefore, in the third year, they build \(2 \times 48 = 96\) homes.

Now, we sum the homes built over the three years:
\[12 + 36 + 96 = 144\]

The total number of homes built over the next three years is \(\boxed{144}\)."
"Let's denote the ages of the individuals as follows:
- Let \( S \) be my age.
- Let \( B \) be my brother's age.
- Let \( M \) be my mom's age.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. I am three years younger than my brother: \( S = B - 3 \).
2. I am two years older than my sister: \( S = T + 2 \), where \( T \) is my sister's age.
3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age: \( M = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all our ages is 87: \( S + B + M + T = 87 \).

Since \( S = T + 2 \), we can substitute \( T \) with \( S - 2 \). Now, we can rewrite the sum of our ages equation as:
\[ S + B + (3B - 1) + (S - 2) = 87. \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2S + 4B - 3 = 87. \]
Adding 3 to both sides, we get:
\[ 2S + 4B = 90. \]
Dividing the entire equation by 2, we get:
\[ S + 2B = 45. \]
From the first relationship \( S = B - 3 \), we can substitute \( S \) in the equation \( S + 2B = 45 \):
\[ (B - 3) + 2B = 45. \]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3B - 3 = 45. \]
Adding 3 to both sides, we get:
\[ 3B = 48. \]
Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
\[ B = 16. \]
Now, we can find \( S \) using \( S = B - 3 \):
\[ S = 16 - 3 = 13. \]
So, I am 13 years old. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{13} \]"
"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first calculate the total number of glue sticks required. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks needed is:

\[ 27 \times 2 = 54 \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of glue sticks are required to get at least 54 glue sticks. Since glue sticks come in packs of 8, we divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:

\[ \frac{54}{8} = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks. To ensure he has enough, we calculate the total number of glue sticks in 7 packs:

\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 \]

Since 56 is more than the 54 glue sticks needed, Mr. Jackson will have 2 extra glue sticks. Thus, the number of packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"Initially, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons. After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles, so it becomes:
\[ 4000 \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons} \]

On the third day, the volume of water increases by 6000 gallons from the amount it had on the second day. Therefore, the amount of water on the third day is:
\[ 8000 + 6000 = 14000 \text{ gallons} \]

Thus, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point on the third day is:
\[ 14000 \text{ gallons} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of new infections each day and add them to the total number of infected people.

- **Day 0**: Initially, there are 10 infected people.
- **Day 1**: Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others, so the number of new infections is \(10 \times 6 = 60\). Therefore, the total number of infected people after Day 1 is \(10 + 60 = 70\).
- **Day 2**: Now there are 70 infected people, and each of them infects 6 others. So, the number of new infections is \(70 \times 6 = 420\). Therefore, the total number of infected people after Day 2 is \(70 + 420 = 490\).
- **Day 3**: Now there are 490 infected people, and each of them infects 6 others. So, the number of new infections is \(490 \times 6 = 2940\). Therefore, the total number of infected people after Day 3 is \(490 + 2940 = 3430\).

So, the total number of people infected after three days is \(\boxed{3430}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Rafaela received as tips. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate the total as follows:

\[ \text{Total tips for Rafaela} = 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Julieta received as tips. According to the problem, Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To find out how much Julieta received, we calculate 10% of Rafaela's total tips and subtract it from Rafaela's total tips:

\[ \text{10% of Rafaela's total tips} = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]

\[ \text{Total tips for Julieta} = 800 - 80 = 720 \]

Now, to find out the total amount of money both Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether, we add their individual totals:

\[ \text{Total tips for both} = 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1520 \]"
"Jennifer initially had 12 oranges. She gave 2 oranges to each of her 3 daughters, which totals 2 * 3 = 6 oranges given to her daughters. Additionally, she gave her only son 3 oranges. Therefore, the total number of oranges given away is 6 + 3 = 9 oranges. To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we subtract the total number of oranges given away from the initial number of oranges: 12 - 9 = 3 oranges.

The final numerical answer is 3."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Claire's Badge Earnings:**
   - Claire earns 1 badge per month.
   - In a year (12 months), Claire earns \(12\) badges.

2. **Amber's Badge Earnings:**
   - It takes Amber twice as long to earn a badge as Claire.
   - Since Claire takes 1 month to earn 1 badge, Amber takes \(2\) months to earn 1 badge.
   - In a year, Amber earns \(\frac{12}{2} = 6\) badges.

3. **Wendy's Badge Earnings:**
   - Wendy earns 3 times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame.
   - In a year, Wendy earns \(3 \times 12 = 36\) badges.

4. **Difference in Badges Earned by Wendy and Amber:**
   - Wendy earns \(36\) badges.
   - Amber earns \(6\) badges.
   - The difference is \(36 - 6 = 30\) badges.

Therefore, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame. The final numerical answer is:

1. Calculate the total number of hours Paige baked.
2. Determine the total number of banana bread loaves baked.
3. Calculate the total number of slices.
4. Find out the total revenue from selling the slices.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours Paige baked.**
Paige baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a span of 5 hours.

**Step 2: Determine the total number of banana bread loaves baked.**
Since Paige can bake 2 loaves per hour, in 5 hours she can bake:
\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of slices.**
Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so for 10 loaves:
\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

**Step 4: Find out the total revenue from selling the slices.**
Each slice is sold for 50 cents, so for 80 slices:

"First, let's determine the number of green cars. Since there are 2 fewer green cars than red cars, and there are 12 red cars:

\[ \text{Number of green cars} = 12 - 2 = 10 \]

Next, we calculate the number of blue cars. The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars:

\[ \text{Number of blue cars} = 3 \times 10 = 30 \]

Now, we can find the total number of red, green, and blue cars:

\[ \text{Total of red, green, and blue cars} = 12 + 10 + 30 = 52 \]

Given that the total number of cars in the rink is 75, we can find the number of yellow cars by subtracting the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:

"Let's denote the number of books that Anne has as \( A \). According to the problem, Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has \( A + 25 \) books. Additionally, Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Fawn has \( A + 12 \) books.

The total number of books that Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have together is 85. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (A + 25) + A + (A + 12) = 85 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ A + 25 + A + A + 12 = 85 \]
\[ 3A + 37 = 85 \]

Next, we solve for \( A \):

\[ 3A = 85 - 37 \]
\[ 3A = 48 \]
\[ A = \frac{48}{3} \]
\[ A = 16 \]

So, Anne has 16 books. Since Fawn has 12 more books than Anne, we calculate the number of books Fawn has as follows:

\[ Fawn = A + 12 = 16 + 12 = 28 \]

Therefore, Fawn has 28 books. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to calculate how much Madeline and Keenan each pay per month, and then find out how much Keenan pays per week.

1. Calculate Madeline's monthly payment:
   Madeline pays 60% of the $400 monthly cost.
   \[
   \text{Madeline's monthly payment} = 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Calculate Keenan's monthly payment:
   Since the total monthly cost is $400 and Madeline pays $240, Keenan pays the remaining amount.
   \[
   \text{Keenan's monthly payment} = 400 - 240 = 160 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Calculate Keenan's weekly payment:
   There are approximately 4 weeks in a month, so we divide Keenan's monthly payment by 4 to find his weekly payment.

"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of item Kelly is buying:

1. **Bacon:**
   - Kelly has 5 packs of bacon.
   - The total cost for the bacon is $10.
   - Therefore, the cost per pack of bacon is \( \frac{10}{5} = $2 \).

2. **Chicken:**
   - Kelly has 6 packets of chicken.
   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - Since a pack of bacon costs $2, a packet of chicken costs \( 2 \times 2 = $4 \).
   - Therefore, the total cost for the chicken is \( 6 \times 4 = $24 \).

3. **Strawberries:**
   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries.
   - Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the strawberries is \( 3 \times 4 = $12 \).

4. **Apples:**
   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples.
   - Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   - Since a pack of strawberries costs $4, a pack of apples costs \( \frac{4}{2} = $2 \).
   - Therefore, the total cost for the apples is \( 7 \times 2 = $14 \).

Now, let's sum up the total cost of all the items:
- Total cost of bacon: $10
- Total cost of chicken: $24
- Total cost of strawberries: $12
- Total cost of apples: $14

The total cost of all items is \( 10 + 24 + 12 + 14 = $60 \).

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget:
- Money left = $65 - $60 = $5.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the usual runtime of Elaina's concerts as \( x \) minutes. According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, so the final concert is \( 2x \) minutes long. Additionally, at the end of the final concert, she performs a 15-minute encore. Therefore, the total runtime of the final concert, including the encore, is \( 2x + 15 \) minutes.

We are given that the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. So, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual runtime of Elaina's concerts is 25 minutes. The final numerical answer is:

- On Friday, they make twice as many as on Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 125 = 250\) chimichangas.

Now, we sum the chimichangas made on these three days:
\[ 125 + 125 + 250 = 500 \]

So, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many microphones are left after accounting for the 20% that won't fit in pairs. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Calculate the number of microphones that won't fit in pairs:
   \[
   20\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \text{ microphones}
   \]

2. Subtract the number of microphones that won't fit from the total number of microphones to find out how many microphones can be paired:
   \[
   50 - 10 = 40 \text{ microphones}
   \]

3. Determine how many pairs of microphones can be arranged with the remaining 40 microphones:
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ pairs}
   \]

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage. The final numerical answer is:
\[
20

"First, let's determine the number of birds flying overhead. Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes. According to the problem, 2/3 of that number of birds are flying overhead. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of birds flying overhead} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of birds feeding. Jerry counts 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of birds feeding} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, we sum up all the birds Jerry counts:

\[ \text{Total number of birds} = \text{Number of birds nesting} + \text{Number of birds flying overhead} + \text{Number of birds feeding} \]
\[ \text{Total number of birds} = 6 + 4 + 24 = 34 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 34 \]"
"Lani started with 55 cookies and ate 5, so she had \(55 - 5 = 50\) cookies left. She then placed these 50 cookies equally into 5 jars. Therefore, the number of cookies in each jar is \(50 \div 5 = 10\).

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of petals for the orchids. Joelle has 5 orchids, and each orchid has 5 petals. Therefore, the total number of petals for the orchids is:

\[ 5 \text{ orchids} \times 5 \text{ petals/orchid} = 25 \text{ petals} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals for the African daisies. Joelle has 4 African daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals. Therefore, the total number of petals for the daisies is:

\[ 4 \text{ daisies} \times 10 \text{ petals/daisy} = 40 \text{ petals} \]

Now, to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we subtract the total number of petals of the orchids from the total number of petals of the daisies:

\[ 40 \text{ petals} - 25 \text{ petals} = 15 \text{ petals} \]

So, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 15 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants, so we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. We find the number of flowering plants by subtracting the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:

\[ \text{Number of flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25 \]

To find what percent of the total plants are flowering plants, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 25 \]"
"To find out how fast a whirligig spins, we need to first determine the speed of the thingamabob. We know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, we can calculate the speed of the thingamabob as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{\text{Speed of whatchamacallit}}{11} = \frac{121 \text{ meters/second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters/second} \]

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can determine the speed of the whirligig. We know that a whirligig spins five times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of the whirligig is:

\[ \text{Speed of whirligig} = 5 \times \text{Speed of thingamabob} = 5 \times 11 \text{ meters/second} = 55 \text{ meters/second} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much Ellen pays for one carrot every day, we need to first calculate the total cost of the salad and yogurt she consumes daily.

The salad costs $6.
The yogurt costs half the price of the salad, which is $6 / 2 = $3.

So, the total cost for the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.

Ellen pays a total of $11 for her goods every day. Therefore, the cost for the two carrots she eats every day is $11 - $9 = $2.

Since she eats two carrots every day, the cost for one carrot is $2 / 2 = $1.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine Mark's new hourly wage after the raise. His original hourly wage was $10, and it was raised by $2 per hour. Therefore, his new hourly wage is:

\[ 10 + 2 = 12 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we calculate the number of hours Mark works in a week. He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so:

\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ hours per week} \]

Now, to find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week:

\[ 12 \times 40 = 480 \text{ dollars per week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 480 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Tasha made from mowing lawns and then subtract that amount from her total earnings to find out how much she made from lemonade sales.

First, let's determine how many times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn. Since Joe paid her $6 and she mowed his lawn once, we can assume that she mowed Joe's lawn once.

Next, we calculate how many times she mowed Kamala's lawn. According to the problem, she mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as she did Joe's. Since she mowed Joe's lawn once, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times.

Then, we calculate how many times she mowed Alba's lawn. The problem states that she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's. Since she mowed Joe's lawn once, she mowed Alba's lawn 5 times.

Now, we can calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns:
- Joe's lawn: 1 time * $6 = $6
- Kamala's lawn: 3 times * $6 = $18
- Alba's lawn: 5 times * $6 = $30

Adding these amounts together gives the total earnings from mowing lawns:
$6 + $18 + $30 = $54

Tasha's total earnings for the month were $80. To find out how much she made from lemonade sales, we subtract the earnings from mowing lawns from her total earnings:
$80 - $54 = $26

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[

"First, let's determine Carl's weight. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, we can calculate Carl's weight as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's weight} = \text{Martin's weight} + 16 \]
\[ \text{Carl's weight} = 55 \, \text{kg} + 16 \, \text{kg} \]
\[ \text{Carl's weight} = 71 \, \text{kg} \]

Next, we calculate Christian's weight, which is 8 kg more than Carl's weight:

\[ \text{Christian's weight} = \text{Carl's weight} + 8 \]
\[ \text{Christian's weight} = 71 \, \text{kg} + 8 \, \text{kg} \]
\[ \text{Christian's weight} = 79 \, \text{kg} \]

Finally, we determine Harry's weight, which is 5 kg less than Christian's weight:

\[ \text{Harry's weight} = \text{Christian's weight} - 5 \]
\[ \text{Harry's weight} = 79 \, \text{kg} - 5 \, \text{kg} \]
\[ \text{Harry's weight} = 74 \, \text{kg} \]

So, the weight of Harry is 74 kg."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours John rents his car out in a month. He rents his car 10 times a month, and each time for 3 hours. Therefore, the total number of hours rented in a month is:

\[ 10 \text{ times/month} \times 3 \text{ hours/time} = 30 \text{ hours/month} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money John earns from renting his car in a month. He gets paid $25 per hour, so:

\[ 30 \text{ hours/month} \times 25 \text{ dollars/hour} = 750 \text{ dollars/month} \]

Now, we need to find out the profit John makes. To do this, we subtract his monthly car payment from his monthly earnings:

\[ 750 \text{ dollars/month} - 500 \text{ dollars/month} = 250 \text{ dollars/month} \]

So, the profit John makes on his car each month is:

\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"First, let's determine how many notebooks Martha originally had. We know that after buying 5 more notebooks, Martha has a total of 7 notebooks. Therefore, we can calculate the number of notebooks Martha originally had as follows:

\[ \text{Martha's original notebooks} = 7 - 5 = 2 \]

Next, we know that Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha originally had. So, we can calculate the number of notebooks Joseph had as follows:

\[ \text{Joseph's notebooks} = 3 \times \text{Martha's original notebooks} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. We do this by subtracting the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number of notebooks Martha has:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Martha's total notebooks} - \text{Joseph's notebooks} = 7 - 6 = 1 \]

So, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph. The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total distance Dijana and Anis rowed on that Sunday, we first need to determine how far Anis rowed.

Dijana rowed 50 miles.

Anis rowed \(\frac{1}{5}\) times more miles than Dijana. This means Anis rowed \(50 + \frac{1}{5} \times 50\) miles.

Let's calculate the distance Anis rowed:
\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles}
\]
\[
50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles}
\]

Now, we add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis to find the total distance:

"First, let's determine how many pages each person read over the two days.

Yesterday:
- Denise read 10 pages.
- Daniel read 13 pages.

Today:
- Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.
- Daniel was not able to read any pages today, so he read 0 pages today.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages each person read over the two days:
- Denise's total: \(10 + 18 = 28\) pages.
- Daniel's total: \(13 + 0 = 13\) pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total number of pages Daniel read from the total number of pages Denise read:
\[ 28 - 13 = 15 \]

So, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup, we need to first understand the capacity of the pot in terms of adult and child bowls.

The pot can fill:
- 4 adult's bowls
- 8 child's bowls

Since Calvin is an adult, he will have one bowl of soup. His wife is also an adult, so she will have one bowl of soup as well. This accounts for 2 adult bowls. The remaining bowls will be for the two children.

The pot can fill 8 child's bowls, and we have already used 2 adult bowls (1 for Calvin and 1 for his wife). Therefore, the remaining number of bowls is:
\[ 8 - 2 = 6 \text{ child's bowls} \]

Since there are 2 children and each child will have one bowl, the 6 remaining bowls can be divided among the 2 children. Thus, each child can have:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ bowls} \]

So, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch 3 times. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the amount of material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we first need to calculate the material required for each type of mask.

For small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \) yards.
- For 20 small masks, the material needed is \( 20 \times 0.5 = 10 \) yards.

For large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25}{3} = 0.75 \) yards.
- For 8 large masks, the material needed is \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \) yards.

Adding the material needed for both types of masks:
- Total material needed = material for small masks + material for large masks
- Total material needed = 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards.

The final numerical answer is 16 yards."
"To find the average price per ticket, we first need to determine the total number of tickets Fast and the Furious movies that Deepa has seen. Since there are 9 movies and she has seen each one three times, the total number of tickets is:

\[ 9 \text{ movies} \times 3 \text{ times per movie} = 27 \text{ tickets} \]

Deepa has spent a total of $216 on these tickets. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets:

\[ \text{Average price per ticket} = \frac{216}{27} \]

Now, let's perform the division:

\[ \frac{216}{27} = 8 \]

So, the average price Deepa paid per ticket is $8."
"To determine Harold's free time, we need to calculate the total time he spends on activities and then subtract that from the total hours in a day.

1. Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. He works for 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.
3. He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, let's add up the time spent on these activities:
\[ \text{Total time spent on activities} = \text{Sleep} + \text{Work} + \text{Dog walking} = 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 \text{ hours} \]

A day has 24 hours, so the free time Harold has left is:
\[ \text{Free time} = \text{Total hours in a day} - \text{Total time spent on activities} = 24 - 19 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( D \) be Duncan's age eight years ago and \( A \) be Adam's age four years ago.

From the problem, we know:
1. Duncan's current age is 60.
2. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( 60 - 8 = 52 \).
3. Eight years ago, Duncan's age (\( D \)) was two times Adam's age four years ago (\( A \)).
4. Therefore, we can write the equation: \( D = 2A \).

Substituting the value of \( D \) from the first piece of information:
\[ 52 = 2A \]

Solving for \( A \):
\[ A = \frac{52}{2} = 26 \]

So, four years ago, Adam was 26 years old. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his age four years ago:
\[ 26 + 8 = 34 \]

Therefore, Adam will be 34 years old in 8 years.

"First, we need to determine the size of Farmer Smith's farm. According to the problem, Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

Let's calculate twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm:
\[ 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ acres} \]

Now, we add 100 acres to this amount to find the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \text{ acres} \]

Next, we need to find the total number of acres for both farms combined. We add the size of Farmer Brown's farm to the size of Farmer Smith's farm:

This means Colby completes 40 packages per hour. To find out how many packages he completes in an eight-hour workday, we multiply the number of packages he completes per hour by the number of hours in an eight-hour workday:

\[ 40 \times 8 = 320 \]

Since Colby gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes, we calculate his total earnings for the day by multiplying the number of packages he completes by the amount he earns per package:

\[ 320 \times 0.20 = 64 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of red balloons as \( R \) and the number of yellow balloons as \( Y \). According to the problem, \( R = 20 \).

Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon, so the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is \( 2R \). Given that \( R = 20 \), the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \).

The total number of pieces of bologna thrown at all balloons is 58. Therefore, the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons is \( 58 - 40 = 18 \).

Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, the number of yellow balloons \( Y \) can be found by dividing the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons by 3. So, \( Y = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).

Thus, the number of yellow balloons is \( 6 \).

"To determine how much Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount spent and then divide it by 2.

First, let's calculate the cost of the cake:
\[ \text{Cost of the cake} = \$11 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the balloons. They bought 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons. The balloons cost $0.5 for 2 balloons:
\[ \text{Cost per 2 balloons} = \$0.5 \]
\[ \text{Number of sets of 2 balloons} = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]
\[ \text{Cost of the balloons} = 6 \times \$0.5 = \$3 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the ice cream. They bought 2 tubs of ice cream, each costing $7:
\[ \text{Cost of 2 tubs of ice cream} = 2 \times \$7 = \$14 \]

Now, let's find the total amount spent:
\[ \text{Total amount spent} = \text{Cost of the cake} + \text{Cost of the balloons} + \text{Cost of the ice cream} \]
\[ \text{Total amount spent} = \$11 + \$3 + \$14 = \$28 \]

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to spend this total amount, we need to divide the total amount by 2 to find out how much each of them received:
\[ \text{Amount each received} = \frac{\$28}{2} = \$14 \]

Thus, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"

"First, let's calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class. Since there are 30 students and each student sold an average of 10 lollipops, the total number of lollipops sold is:

\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops. Each lollypop was sold for $0.8, so the total revenue is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollypop} = \$240 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops. Each lollypop was bought for $0.5, so the total cost is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollypop} = \$150 \]

Finally, the profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ \$240 - \$150 = \$90 \]

So, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many slices Josh can eat in a day. Since Josh can eat twice as much as Abby, and Abby can eat 2 slices a day, Josh can eat:

\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ slices a day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many slices Abby and Josh eat together in one day. Abby eats 2 slices and Josh eats 4 slices, so together they eat:

\[ 2 + 4 = 6 \text{ slices a day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days the loaf of bread will last. The loaf has 24 slices, and they eat 6 slices per day. Therefore, the number of days the loaf will last is:

\[ \frac{24}{6} = 4 \text{ days} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"Martha collects shells every month. She started collecting at age 5 and her 10th birthday marks the end of her collection period. To find out how many months she collected shells, we calculate the difference in age and then convert that into months.

From age 5 to 10, she has 5 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of months is:
\[ 5 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 60 \text{ months} \]

Since she collects one shell per month, the total number of shells she will have collected by her 10th birthday is:
\[ 60 \text{ shells} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 60 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cups of chamomile and mint tea Lana brews in each row, and then find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row.

First, let's determine how many cups of chamomile and mint tea Lana brews in total. Since she has 27 cups and she uses 15 of them for cinnamon tea, the remaining cups are:
\[ 27 - 15 = 12 \]
These 12 cups are divided equally between chamomile and mint tea. Therefore, the number of cups of chamomile tea and mint tea is:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]
So, she brews 6 cups of chamomile tea and 6 cups of mint tea in total.

Next, we need to determine how many cups of chamomile and mint tea are in each row. Since she divides the 27 cups into 3 rows, the number of cups in each row is:
\[ \frac{27}{3} = 9 \]
Since the cups in each row are divided equally between chamomile and mint tea, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is:
\[ \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \]

Therefore, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is:
\[ \boxed{4.5} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which the sloth picks berries and then use that rate to find out how many berries he can pick up in the given time.

First, let's break down the information:
- The sloth takes 4 hours to make a trip down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up.
- The sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

Since the sloth takes 4 hours to pick up berries, we can calculate the number of berries he picks up in 4 hours. Let's denote the number of berries he picks up per trip as \( x \).

Given that he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 2 \times x = 24 \]
This is because in 8 hours, the sloth makes 2 trips (since 8 hours / 4 hours per trip = 2 trips).

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{24}{2} = 12 \]

Therefore, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip is 12.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"First, we need to determine the amount of water in the tank. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons of water, the tank will have:

\[ \text{Tank capacity} = \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much water will be left in the tank after 6 days, given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. The total amount of water removed from the tank over 6 days is:

\[ \text{Total water removed} = 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[ \text{Remaining water} = 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2000 \]"
"To determine how many more movies Colby can see, we need to calculate his remaining budget after accounting for the items he has already purchased.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items he has already bought:
- 2 tubs of popcorn: \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars
- 4 boxes of candy: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars
- 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday: \(5 \times 10 = 50\) dollars
- 8 movies on other days: \(8 \times 7 = 56\) dollars

Adding these together gives the total amount spent:
\[16 + 8 + 50 + 56 = 120\]

Colby starts with $150, so his remaining budget is:
\[150 - 120 = 30\]

Now, we need to determine how many more movies he can see with the remaining $30. Each movie ticket costs $7, so we divide the remaining budget by the cost of one movie ticket:
\[30 \div 7 = 4 \text{ R } 2\]

This means he can see 4 more full movies with the remaining $30, and he will have $2 left over.

The final numerical answer is:
\[4\]"
"First, we need to determine the number of calories in a mini cinnamon roll and a mini blueberry muffin.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, so a mini cinnamon roll, which has 1/3rd of the calories, will have:
\[ \frac{600}{3} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Similarly, a normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, so a mini blueberry muffin, which has 1/3rd of the calories, will have:
\[ \frac{450}{3} = 150 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we calculate the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins.

The total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls are:
\[ 200 \text{ mini cinnamon rolls} \times 200 \text{ calories per mini cinnamon roll} = 40000 \text{ calories} \]

The total calories from the mini blueberry muffins are:
\[ 300 \text{ mini blueberry muffins} \times 150 \text{ calories per mini blueberry muffin} = 45000 \text{ calories} \]

Adding these together gives the total calories from all the pastries:
\[ 40000 \text{ calories} + 45000 \text{ calories} = 85000 \text{ calories} \]

So, the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked is:
\[ \boxed{85000} \]"
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the five days and then divide that total by the number of days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, so she removed \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs each day.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days:
\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

First, add the Junebugs removed on Monday and Tuesday:
\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]

Next, add the Junebugs removed on Wednesday:
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]

Then, add the Junebugs removed on Thursday:
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]

Finally, add the Junebugs removed on Friday:
\[
243 + 57 = 300
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days is 300.

To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days (5):
\[
\frac{300}{5} = 60
\]

Thus, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"First, we calculate the distance traveled by the bus. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For the bus:
\[ \text{Speed} = 60 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, the distance traveled by the bus is:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \times 5 = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance traveled by the car:
\[ \text{Speed} = 30 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

So, the distance traveled by the car is:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 30 \times 8 = 240 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 300 - 240 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the bus went 60 miles farther than the car. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 60 \]"
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to determine the total number of toys Sophie had before buying the bouncy balls and then subtract that from the total number of toys she has now.

The total number of toys Sophie had before buying the bouncy balls is the sum of the building blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings:
\[ 31 \text{ (building blocks)} + 8 \text{ (stuffed animals)} + 9 \text{ (stacking rings)} = 48 \text{ toys} \]

Sophie now has a total of 62 toys. To find out how many bouncy balls were in the tube, we subtract the number of toys she had before from the total number of toys she has now:
\[ 62 \text{ (total toys now)} - 48 \text{ (toys before)} = 14 \text{ bouncy balls} \]

So, the number of bouncy balls that came in the tube is 14."
"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old:
   \[
   P + Pa + J = 100
   \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   Pa = J + 10
   \]

3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = Pa + J
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now, we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, we can find Paul's age using \( Pa = J + 10 \):
\[
Pa = 20 + 10 = 30
\]

Finally, we can find Peter's age using \( P = Pa + J \):
\[
P = 30 + 20 = 50
\]

So, Peter's age is \( 50 \) years old. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"Initially, Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons, which totals to \(4 \times 2 = 8\) water balloons. Maria also received 2 water balloons, so the total number of water balloons at this point is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Then, her mom gave each person 3 more water balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional water balloons is \(5 \times 3 = 15\).

Adding these to the previous total, the girls had \(10 + 15 = 25\) water balloons in total.

The final numerical answer is 25."
"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes of stuff available for the yard sale.

1. The charity group has 10 people who each donate 5 boxes of stuff. So, the total number of boxes donated is:
   \[
   10 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ boxes/person} = 50 \text{ boxes}
   \]

2. They also have 10 boxes of stuff already. So, the total number of boxes available is:
   \[
   50 \text{ boxes donated} + 10 \text{ boxes already owned} = 60 \text{ boxes}
   \]

Next, we need to determine how many tables are needed to fit all the boxes. They can fit 2 boxes per table.

3. The number of tables needed to fit 60 boxes is:
   \[
   \frac{60 \text{ boxes}}{2 \text{ boxes/table}} = 30 \text{ tables}
   \]

They already own 15 tables.

4. The number of new tables needed is:
   \[
   30 \text{ tables needed} - 15 \text{ tables owned} = 15 \text{ new tables}
   \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to calculate the total distance each person spits the seeds.

For Zoey:
- Number of seeds = 40
- Distance per seed = 10 feet
- Total distance = 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet

For Sydney:
- Number of seeds = 35
- Distance per seed = 12 feet
- Total distance = 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet

Next, we find the total distance both spitted:
- Total distance = Zoey's total distance + Sydney's total distance
- Total distance = 400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance by the number of people (2):
- Average total distance = Total distance / Number of people
- Average total distance = 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet

The final numerical answer is 410 feet."
"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the daily, monthly, and total earnings for each machine.

First, let's calculate the daily production and earnings for the Widgeteer 3000:
- The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour.
- It runs 24 hours a day.
- Therefore, the daily production is \(60 \times 24 = 1440\) widgets.
- Each widget sells for $6.
- Therefore, the daily earnings from the Widgeteer 3000 are \(1440 \times 6 = 8640\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the daily production and earnings for the WidgetMaster 9000:
- The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour.
- It also runs 24 hours a day.
- Therefore, the daily production is \(45 \times 24 = 1080\) widgets.
- Each widget sells for $6.
- Therefore, the daily earnings from the WidgetMaster 9000 are \(1080 \times 6 = 6480\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the monthly earnings for each machine:
- There are 30 days in the month.
- The Widgeteer 3000's monthly earnings are \(8640 \times 30 = 259200\) dollars.
- The WidgetMaster 9000's monthly earnings are \(6480 \times 30 = 194400\) dollars.

Finally, to find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we subtract the WidgetMaster 9000's monthly earnings from the Widgeteer 3000's monthly earnings:
- The difference is \(259200 - 194400 = 64800\) dollars.

Therefore, Fern will make \(\boxed{64800}\) dollars more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000."
"To determine how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the total cost of his stay under both options and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost if Cameron pays for a 24-hour stay:
- The initial 12-hour stay costs 1600 pesos.
- The additional 12 hours cost 12 * 70 pesos = 840 pesos.
- Therefore, the total cost for a 24-hour stay is 1600 + 840 = 2440 pesos.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Cameron pays for a 12-hour stay plus additional hours:
- The initial 12-hour stay costs 1600 pesos.
- Cameron stays from 5 pm to 10 am the next morning, which is 17 hours in total.
- The first 12 hours cost 1600 pesos.
- The additional 5 hours cost 5 * 70 pesos = 350 pesos.
- Therefore, the total cost for this option is 1600 + 350 = 1950 pesos.

Now, we find the difference between the two options to determine how much Cameron would save:
- The savings would be 2440 - 1950 = 490 pesos.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Therefore, the amount of hay each sheep needs is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Hay per sheep} = 2 \times \text{Hay per goat} - 3 = 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep. There are 15 goats, and each needs 5 pounds of hay:

\[ \text{Total hay for goats} = 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

There are 12 sheep, and each needs 7 pounds of hay:

\[ \text{Total hay for sheep} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the total hay needed for the goats and the sheep gives us the total amount of hay Nate needs:

\[ \text{Total hay needed} = 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 159 \]"
"First, let's calculate John's total earnings for the week:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Hourly wage} \times \text{Hours worked} = 50 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the cost of gas from his total earnings:
\[ \text{Remaining money after gas} = \text{Total earnings} - \text{Cost of gas} = 300 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 250 \, \text{dollars} \]

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so we subtract that from his remaining money:
\[ \text{Money left after deposit} = \text{Remaining money after gas} - \text{Deposit} = 250 \, \text{dollars} - 100 \, \text{dollars} = 150 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, we need to account for the cost of the pencils. Each pencil costs 10 dollars and he buys 5 pencils:
\[ \text{Cost of pencils} = \text{Number of pencils} \times \text{Cost per pencil} = 5 \times 10 \, \text{dollars} = 50 \, \text{dollars} \]

Subtract the cost of the pencils from the money left after the deposit:
\[ \text{Money left after pencils} = \text{Money left after deposit} - \text{Cost of pencils} = 150 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 100 \, \text{dollars} \]

Finally, we need to determine how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with the remaining money:
\[ \text{Number of pens} = \frac{\text{Money left after pencils}}{\text{Cost per pen}} = \frac{100 \, \text{dollars}}{25 \, \text{dollars/pen}} = 4 \, \text{pens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

2. The labor cost is $35 per hour. Since the job took 2.25 hours, the labor cost is \(2.25 \times 35\).
3. The cost of parts is $60.

Let's calculate the labor cost first:
\[ 2.25 \times 35 = 78.75 \]

Now, we add the visit fee, the labor cost, and the cost of parts:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount. James gets 10 new CDs, and each CD costs $15. Therefore, the total cost before the discount is:

\[ 10 \times 15 = 150 \]

Next, we apply the 40% discount to the total cost. A 40% discount means he pays 60% of the original price. So, the total cost after the discount is:

\[ 150 \times 0.60 = 90 \]

James then decides to sell 5 of the CDs he doesn't like for $40. The total amount he receives from selling these 5 CDs is $40. To find out how much money he is out, we subtract the amount he received from the amount he spent:

\[ 90 - 40 = 50 \]

6 yams * $1.5/yam = $9.00

For the sweet potatoes:
10 sweet potatoes * $2/sweet potato = $20.00

For the carrots:
4 carrots * $1.25/carrot = $5.00

Now, we sum up the earnings from each type of root crop:
$9.00 + $20.00 + $5.00 = $34.00

So, Jen will earn $34.00 if she sells everything."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   \[
   \text{Distance swum} = 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time it takes to swim 12 miles:**
   James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time to swim 12 miles} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the resting time:**
   James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   \[
   \text{Resting time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance to be swum:**
   The total distance is 20 miles, and James has already swum 12 miles.
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the speed for the remaining distance:**
   James swims at half the initial speed, which is 1 mile per hour.
   \[
   \text{Speed for remaining distance} = \frac{2 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile/hour}
   \]

6. **Calculate the time it takes to swim the remaining 8 miles:**
   \[
   \text{Time to swim remaining 8 miles} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

7. **Calculate the total time taken:**
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{Time to swim 12 miles} + \text{Resting time} + \text{Time to swim remaining 8 miles}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, the total time it took James to get across the lake is 17 hours."

"To calculate the total commission Cayley will earn, we need to calculate the commission for each newspaper separately and then sum them up.

For the New York Times:
- Commission rate: 10%
- Cost per copy: $5
- Number of copies: 6

The commission for the New York Times is calculated as:
\[ \text{Commission for NYT} = 6 \times 5 \times \frac{10}{100} = 6 \times 5 \times 0.10 = 30 \times 0.10 = 3 \]

For the Wall Street Journal:
- Commission rate: 8%
- Cost per copy: $15
- Number of copies: 10

The commission for the Wall Street Journal is calculated as:
\[ \text{Commission for WSJ} = 10 \times 15 \times \frac{8}{100} = 10 \times 15 \times 0.08 = 150 \times 0.08 = 12 \]

Now, we sum the commissions from both newspapers to get the total commission:
\[ \text{Total Commission} = \text{Commission for NYT} + \text{Commission for WSJ} = 3 + 12 = 15 \]

So, the total commission Cayley will earn is $15."
"To find Leo's age, we can start by determining Marcus's age since we know Deanna's age and the relationship between Marcus and Deanna.

Given:
- Deanna's age = 26
- Marcus is five years younger than Deanna.

So, Marcus's age = Deanna's age - 5 = 26 - 5 = 21.

Next, we know that Marcus is half of Leo's age. Therefore, Leo's age = 2 * Marcus's age = 2 * 21 = 42.

Thus, the final numerical answer is 42."
"Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as \( A \), by Bahati as \( B \), and by Dinar as \( D \).

From the problem, we know:
1. \( B = A + 20 \)
2. \( B = D + 10 \)
3. \( B + A + D = 45 \)

First, we can express \( D \) in terms of \( A \) using the first two equations:
\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]
Since \( B = A + 20 \), we can substitute \( B \) in the second equation:
\[ A + 20 = D + 10 \]
Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = A + 10 \]

Now we substitute \( B \) and \( D \) in terms of \( A \) into the third equation:
\[ (A + 20) + A + (A + 10) = 45 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]
Subtract 30 from both sides:
\[ 3A = 15 \]
Divide by 3:
\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine the total number of pages in the book, we need to consider the thickness of the book and the number of pages per inch.

Given:
- The book is 1.5 inches thick.
- For every inch, there are 100 pages.

First, calculate the number of pages in 1 inch:
\[ \text{Pages per inch} = 100 \]

Next, calculate the number of pages in 1.5 inches:
\[ \text{Pages in 1.5 inches} = 1.5 \times 100 \]

Now, perform the multiplication:
\[ \text{Pages in 1.5 inches} = 150 \]

Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is:
\[ \boxed{150} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of minutes Vince worked and then calculate how many reports he can staple in that time.

First, let's calculate the total time Vince worked:
- Vince started at 8:00 AM and worked until 11:00 PM.
- From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.
- Converting hours to minutes: \(15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes}\).

Next, we know that Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:
- \(900 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 60 \text{ intervals}\).

Since Vince staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, the total number of reports he staples is:
- \(60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports}\).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
1800"
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up early.

1. **Total sleep time**: Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Converting this to minutes:
   \[
   8 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Time spent sleepwalking**: Kim sleepwalked from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. The duration of sleepwalking is:
   \[
   2:38 \text{ a.m.} - 2:15 \text{ a.m.} = 23 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Time woke up early**: Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. This means she woke up at 5:55 a.m. instead of 6 a.m. The duration of this early wake-up is:
   \[
   6:00 \text{ a.m.} - 5:55 \text{ a.m.} = 5 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Total time not spent sleeping on her bed**: The total time not spent sleeping on her bed is the sum of the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up early:
   \[
   23 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 28 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Time spent sleeping on her bed**: Subtract the total time not spent sleeping from the total sleep time:
   \[
   480 \text{ minutes} - 28 \text{ minutes} = 452 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Therefore, the number of minutes Kim slept on her bed that day is 452 minutes."
"First, let's determine the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has initially. Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has two dozen measuring cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons as follows:

- Two dozen measuring cups is equal to \(2 \times 12 = 24\) measuring cups.
- Therefore, the number of measuring spoons is \(\frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16\) measuring spoons.

Next, we account for the 6 measuring spoons that Jonathan gifts to Pedro:

- The number of measuring spoons remaining after giving 6 to Pedro is \(16 - 6 = 10\) measuring spoons.

Now, we add the remaining measuring spoons to the number of measuring cups to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining:

- Jonathan has 24 measuring cups and 10 measuring spoons remaining.
- Therefore, the total number of utensils is \(24 + 10 = 34\).

The final numerical answer is:
34"
"First, let's determine the initial number of occupied beds in the hospital. Given that the hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied, we can calculate the initial number of occupied beds as follows:

\[ \text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of patients admitted over 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, the total number of patients admitted over 2 weeks (14 days) is:

\[ \text{Total patients admitted} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

Now, we can find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks by adding the initial number of occupied beds to the total number of patients admitted:

\[ \text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Finally, to find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the total number of occupied beds from the total capacity of the hospital:

\[ \text{Unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 900 = 100 \]

So, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100."
"First, let's determine the number of emails Robyn sends to her family. We know that out of the sixteen emails, seven are work emails. Therefore, the number of non-work emails is:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these non-work emails are sent to her family. According to the problem, two-thirds of the non-work emails are sent to her family. So, the number of emails sent to her family is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

Now, we need to find out how many emails are left after sending emails to her family. This is:

\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

These remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. According to the problem, one-third of these remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. So, the number of emails sent to her boyfriend is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

Therefore, the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"First, let's determine Shawna's age. We know that Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, and Aliya is 3 years old. Therefore, Shawna's age is:

\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we need to find out how old Shawna's father is. We know that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. Therefore, Shawna's father's age is:

\[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 45 \]"
"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate the number that is 20% less than the number reported by Courtney.

Courtney reported that there were 48 people in attendance. If this number is 20% more than the actual number, we can set up the following equation to find the actual number of people, which we'll call \( x \):

\[ 48 = x + 0.20x \]
\[ 48 = 1.20x \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.20:

\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \). According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls. We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so we can set up the equation \( 2J = 2 \). Solving for \( J \), we get \( J = 1 \). Therefore, Jeffrey carried 1 ball, Jason carried \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) balls, and Jordan carried \( 4 \times 1 = 4 \) balls. The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey, which is \( 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 \) balls. Since the three boys picked up and carried all the balls in one trip, the total number of balls the coach brought to practice is 7.

The final numerical answer is:
7"
"To determine how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the number of holes at the end of the first day.
3. Calculate the number of holes at the end of the third day.
4. Use the information about the number of holes at the end of the third day to find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
- Holes dug on the first day: 10
- Holes dug on the second day: 13
- Holes dug on the third day before filling: 8

Total holes dug by the end of the third day = 10 + 13 + 8 = 31

Next, we know that the island had four times as many holes by the end of the third day as it did at the end of the first day. Let's denote the number of holes at the end of the first day as \( H_1 \). According to the problem, \( 31 = 4 \times H_1 \).

Solving for \( H_1 \):
\[ H_1 = \frac{31}{4} = 7.75 \]

Since the number of holes must be a whole number, and the problem implies a whole number of holes, we can infer that the number of holes at the end of the first day is 7 (as the problem setup likely implies rounding down to the nearest whole number).

Now, we need to find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day. By the end of the third day, the number of holes was 31. On the fourth day, they filled in 2 holes, so the number of holes at the end of the fourth day is:
\[ 31 - 2 = 29 \]

Since the number of holes at the end of the first day was 7, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[ 29 - 7 = 22 \]

Thus, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day is:
\[ \boxed{22} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of corn chips given the conditions.

1. Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips.
2. Collins received 15 more corn chips than the number Amora and Lainey received, which means Collins received \(70 + 15 = 85\) corn chips.
3. The total number of corn chips is the sum of the corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins.

Let's calculate the total number of corn chips:

\[
\text{Total corn chips} = \text{Amora's chips} + \text{Lainey's chips} + \text{Collins's chips}
\]

\[
\text{Total corn chips} = 70 + 70 + 85
\]

\[
\text{Total corn chips} = 225
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
225

"First, we need to calculate the cost of the travel tickets. The problem states that the travel tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. The supplies cost $400 in total.

To find 50% of $400, we calculate:
\[ 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the additional cost for the travel tickets is $200. Adding this to the original cost of the supplies gives us the total cost of the travel tickets:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the travel is $600."
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( X = S + 5 \)
2. \( S = 4A - 13 \)
3. \( X + S + A = 339 \)

First, we substitute the expressions for \( X \) and \( S \) from the first two equations into the third equation.

Substituting \( X = S + 5 \) and \( S = 4A - 13 \) into \( X + S + A = 339 \):

\[ (4A - 13) + 5 + (4A - 13) + A = 339 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 4A - 13 + 5 + 4A - 13 + A = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Add 21 to both sides:

\[ 9A = 360 \]

Divide both sides by 9:

\[ A = 40 \]

Now, we can find \( S \) using \( S = 4A - 13 \):

\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 147 \]"

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance flown in each segment of the journey and then sum these distances.

1. **First Segment:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Direction: Norttherly
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \)

3. **Third Segment:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \)

Now, we sum the distances of all segments to find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes:
\[ 300 \text{ miles} + 36 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 446 \text{ miles} \]

The distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is \( 446 \) miles."
"First, let's determine the total number of brownies Greta had initially:

- For herself, she made 1 dozen brownies.
- At her office party, she received 1/2 dozen brownies.
- At her friends' surprise party, she received 4 dozen brownies.

So, the total number of brownies she received is:
\[ 1 \text{ dozen} + \frac{1}{2} \text{ dozen} + 4 \text{ dozen} = 1 + \frac{1}{2} + 4 = 5.5 \text{ dozen} \]

Since 1 dozen equals 12 brownies, we convert the total number of brownies to individual pieces:
\[ 5.5 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ brownies/dozen} = 66 \text{ brownies} \]

Next, we account for the brownies eaten during the party:
- During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.
- Converting 1 1/2 dozen to individual pieces:
\[ 1.5 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ brownies/dozen} = 18 \text{ brownies} \]

Now, we subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies:
\[ 66 \text{ brownies} - 18 \text{ brownies} = 48 \text{ brownies} \]

Therefore, the number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is:
\[ \boxed{48} \]"
"First, let's determine the ages of Nani's brother and sister.

Nani's age is 8 years.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so:
\[ \text{Brother's age} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ years} \]

Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. So:
\[ \text{Sister's age} = 0.75 \times 8 = 6 \text{ years} \]

Now, let's calculate the total age of all three family members:
\[ \text{Total age} = \text{Nani's age} + \text{Brother's age} + \text{Sister's age} \]
\[ \text{Total age} = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 \text{ years} \]

For the racquets strung with polyester string:
\[ 5 \text{ racquets} \times 22 \text{ minutes per racquet} = 110 \text{ minutes} \]

For the racquets strung with a hybrid set:
\[ 4 \text{ racquets} \times 18 \text{ minutes per racquet} = 72 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we sum these times to get the total time:

3. Each subsequent phone (the third and fourth) costs half of $600, which is $300.

So, the total cost can be calculated as follows:
- Cost of the first phone: $600
- Cost of the second phone: $600
- Cost of the third phone: $300
- Cost of the fourth phone: $300

Adding these together:
\[ 600 + 600 + 300 + 300 = 1800 \]

Therefore, the total amount John paid for the phones is $1800."
"To find the total number of players in both teams combined, we first need to determine the number of players on Zeke's team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team as follows:

Number of players on Zeke's team = Number of players on Carlton's team + 7
Number of players on Zeke's team = 13 + 7
Number of players on Zeke's team = 20

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams combined, we add the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team:

Total number of players = Number of players on Zeke's team + Number of players on Carlton's team
Total number of players = 20 + 13
Total number of players = 33

So, the final numerical answer is 33."
"To determine the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the total length of the fence. Since the fence is rectangular, the total length of the fence is the perimeter of the rectangle.

The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the fence:
- Length = 15 feet
- Width = 10 feet

Substituting these values into the formula:
\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Robert needs 2 wooden slats for every foot of fencing. Therefore, the total number of wooden slats required is:
\[ \text{Number of slats} = 2 \times \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington initially had and how many she gave away:

- Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges.
- She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which totals to \(2 + 2 = 4\) boxes.

So, the number of boxes she kept is:
\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of oranges she kept:
- Each box contains 20 oranges.
- Therefore, the number of oranges in the 8 boxes she kept is:
\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \]

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges, so we need to find out how many oranges she originally had:
- Since 8 boxes represent 1/4 of the total oranges, the total number of oranges is:
\[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \]

Now, we calculate the number of oranges she sold:
- The total number of oranges is 32.
- The number of oranges she kept is 160.
- Therefore, the number of oranges she sold is:
\[ 32 - 160 = 160 \]

However, this calculation seems incorrect because it implies she sold more oranges than she had. Let's recheck the steps:

- She originally had 32 oranges.
- She kept 160 oranges, which is not possible since she only had 32 oranges. This indicates a misunderstanding in the problem statement or a need to re-evaluate the given conditions.

Given the problem constraints, the correct interpretation should be that she kept 1/4 of the total oranges, which is 32 oranges. Therefore, the number of oranges she sold is:
\[ 32 - 32 = 0 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( x \). According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. Therefore, the number of states in India can be expressed as \( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \).

We need to find the total number of states in both countries together. This can be calculated by adding the number of states in the USA (\( x \)) and the number of states in India (\( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \)).

The total number of states in both countries is:
\[ x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{3x}{2} + 4 \]

To find the specific numerical answer, we need to know the value of \( x \). However, the problem does not provide the exact number of states in the USA. Without this information, we can only express the total number of states in both countries in terms of \( x \).

The final expression for the total number of states in both countries together is:
\[ \frac{3x}{2} + 4 \]

If we assume the problem intends for a specific numerical answer and the number of states in the USA is a common known value (like 50), we can substitute \( x = 50 \) into the expression:
\[ \frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79 \]

Thus, the total number of states in both countries together is:
\[ \boxed{79} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Tyler wants to buy. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. Adding these together gives:

\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \]

Next, we need to determine how much more money Tyler needs to buy these items. He has already saved $14, so the additional amount he needs is:

\[ 39 - 14 = 25 \]

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $25, we divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage:

\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

Therefore, Tyler needs to work for 5 hours to afford his books. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 5 \]"
"First, let's determine how many cherries Richard has. We know that Robert has 30 cherries and that he has 10 more cherries than Richard. Therefore, Richard has:

\[ \text{Cherries Richard has} = \text{Cherries Robert has} - 10 = 30 - 10 = 20 \]

Next, we know the total number of cherries is 60. We can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting the number of cherries Richard and Robert have from the total:

\[ \text{Cherries Jerry has} = \text{Total cherries} - (\text{Cherries Richard has} + \text{Cherries Robert has}) \]
\[ \text{Cherries Jerry has} = 60 - (20 + 30) = 60 - 50 = 10 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Cherries Robert has} - \text{Cherries Jerry has} = 30 - 10 = 20 \]

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of boxes sold on each day:**
   - **Saturday:**
     - Gingerbread: 10 boxes
     - Apple pie: 10 - 4 = 6 boxes
   - **Sunday:**
     - Gingerbread: 10 + 5 = 15 boxes
     - Apple pie: 15 boxes

2. **Calculate the total number of boxes sold:**
   - **Saturday:**
     - Total boxes = 10 (gingerbread) + 6 (apple pie) = 16 boxes
   - **Sunday:**
     - Total boxes = 15 (gingerbread) + 15 (apple pie) = 30 boxes
   - **Total for two days:**
     - Total boxes = 16 (Saturday) + 30 (Sunday) = 46 boxes

3. **Calculate the earnings from each type of baked good:**
   - **Gingerbread:**
     - Cost per box = $6
     - Total earnings from gingerbread = 10 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 25 boxes
     - Total earnings from gingerbread = 25 boxes * $6/box = $150
   - **Apple pie:**
     - Cost per box = $15
     - Total earnings from apple pie = 6 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 21 boxes
     - Total earnings from apple pie = 21 boxes * $15/box = $315

"To determine how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela needs to pack, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours Pamela will be outside over 8 days.
2. Determine the total amount of sunscreen she will need for those hours.
3. Calculate how many 8-ounce bottles are required to cover that amount of sunscreen.

First, calculate the total number of hours Pamela will be outside:
\[ 4 \text{ hours/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ hours} \]

Next, calculate the total amount of sunscreen she will need:
\[ 32 \text{ hours} \times 1 \text{ ounce/hour} = 32 \text{ ounces} \]

Finally, determine how many 8-ounce bottles are needed:
\[ \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces/bottle}} = 4 \text{ bottles} \]

So, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \]"
"To find the cost of the red car, we first need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car. The price of the blue car is $100.

\[ 40\% \text{ of } \$100 = 0.40 \times 100 = \$40 \]

So, the red car is $40 cheaper than the blue car. Therefore, the price of the red car is:

\[ \$100 - \$40 = \$60 \]

Now, to find the total cost of both cars, we add the price of the red car and the price of the blue car:

\[ \$60 + \$100 = \$160 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \$160 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's define the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother as \( D \) and \( B \) respectively.

Given:
- Emil is currently 19 years old.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.

First, let's determine how many years it will be until Emil turns 24:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \text{ years} \]

When Emil turns 24, his dad's age will be:
\[ D + 5 \]

According to the problem, at that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad:
\[ 24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5) \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ 24 = \frac{D + 5}{2} \]
\[ 48 = D + 5 \]
\[ D = 43 \]

So, Emil's dad is currently 43 years old.

Next, we know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother:
\[ 24 = 2B \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{24}{2} \]
\[ B = 12 \]

So, Emil's brother is currently 12 years old.

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother:
\[ D + B = 43 + 12 = 55 \]

The sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is:
\[ \boxed{55} \]"
"First, let's determine how many beads Adrianne received from each source:

- Adrianne's mother gave her 20 beads.
- Adrianne's sister gave her ten more beads than her mother, which is \(20 + 10 = 30\) beads.
- Adrianne's friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother gave, which is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) beads.

Now, we add up all the beads Adrianne received:

\[ 20 \text{ (from mother)} + 30 \text{ (from sister)} + 40 \text{ (from friend)} = 90 \]

So, the total number of beads Adrianne has altogether is 90."
"First, let's determine the amount of crawfish Joe caught each day:

- On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
- On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.
- On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, which is \(\frac{12}{2} = 6\) pounds.

Next, we'll calculate the total amount of crawfish Joe caught over the three days:

\[ 3 \text{ pounds (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ pounds (Friday)} + 6 \text{ pounds (Saturday)} = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to determine how many servings of crawfish he has, given that 1 serving is 3 pounds:

\[ \frac{21 \text{ pounds}}{3 \text{ pounds per serving}} = 7 \text{ servings} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 7 \]"
"First, we need to determine the number of football players in Mr. Roper's class. Given that 20% of the 30 students are football players, we calculate:

\[ 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 football players. This means the remaining number of students is:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining 24 students are cheerleaders or part of the band. Since 25% of the remaining students are cheerleaders or part of the band, we calculate:

\[ 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are either cheerleaders or part of the band. Adding the football players to these students, we get the total number of students leaving early:

\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we first need to determine the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie's boots are size 5, Charlie's boots are size \(5 \times 5 = 25\).

Next, we calculate the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie. The average is found by adding the sizes of their boots and then dividing by 2:

\[
\text{Average size} = \frac{\text{Charlie's size} + \text{Sophie's size}}{2} = \frac{25 + 5}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15

"First, we need to determine how many additional plants Pat needs to fill her flower bed. The flower bed is 111 feet long. Each plant is 12 inches wide, which is equivalent to 1 foot (since 12 inches = 1 foot). Therefore, the number of plants that can fit in the flower bed is:

\[ \text{Number of plants} = \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{1 \text{ foot/plant}} = 111 \text{ plants} \]

Next, we need to account for the space between the plants. Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant. The total space taken by the plants and the spaces between them can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Total space taken} = 111 \text{ plants} \times 1 \text{ foot/plant} + (111 - 1) \times 1.5 \text{ feet} \]
\[ \text{Total space taken} = 111 \text{ feet} + 110 \times 1.5 \text{ feet} \]
\[ \text{Total space taken} = 111 \text{ feet} + 165 \text{ feet} \]
\[ \text{Total space taken} = 276 \text{ feet} \]

Since the flower bed is only 111 feet long, it is clear that Pat cannot fit 111 plants with 1.5 feet between each plant. We need to find the maximum number of plants that can fit in the 111 feet, considering the 1.5 feet spacing.

Let \( n \) be the number of plants. The total space taken by \( n \) plants and the spaces between them is:

\[ \text{Total space taken} = n \text{ feet/plant} + (n - 1) \times 1.5 \text{ feet} \]
\[ \text{Total space taken} = n + 1.5(n - 1) \]
\[ \text{Total space taken} = n + 1.5n - 1.5 \]
\[ \text{Total space taken} = 2.5n - 1.5 \]

We need this to be less than or equal to 111 feet:

\[ 2.5n - 1.5 \leq 111 \]
\[ 2.5n \leq 112.5 \]
\[ n \leq \frac{112.5}{2.5} \]
\[ n \leq 45 \]

So, the maximum number of plants Pat can fit is 45. Now, we need to calculate the cost of these plants. Pat already owns 17 plants, so she needs to buy:

\[ 45 - 17 = 28 \text{ plants} \]

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost is:

\[ 28 \times 6 = 168 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{168} \]"
"To determine how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we first need to find out how many pretzels his brother eats in a day. Since Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, we calculate:

\[ \text{Pretzels eaten by Edgar's brother per day} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many pretzels his brother eats in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of pretzels his brother eats in a day by 7:

\[ \text{Pretzels eaten by Edgar's brother in a week} = 9 \times 7 = 63 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 63 \]"
"To determine how much Katherine will spend, we need to calculate the cost of the plants for one basket and then multiply by the number of baskets.

First, let's calculate the cost of the plants for one basket:
- Cost of petunias: 3 petunias * $3.00/petunia = $9.00
- Cost of sweet potato vines: 2 sweet potato vines * $2.50/vine = $5.00

Total cost for one basket:
$9.00 (petunias) + $5.00 (sweet potato vines) = $14.00

Now, we need to find the total cost for 5 baskets:
$14.00/basket * 5 baskets = $70.00

Therefore, the total amount Katherine will spend is $70.00."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

For the sunflowers:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

For the carnations:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of soil they have is 30 pounds. So, the remaining soil for roses is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. Therefore, the number of roses they can plant is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to calculate how much Jessica sets aside each month for fancy shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly paycheck.

\[ \text{Monthly savings for shoes} = 25\% \times \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times \$2,000.00 = \$500.00 \]

Next, we need to determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy with her monthly savings. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes per month} = \frac{\$500.00}{\$1,000.00} = 0.5 \]

Since Jessica can only buy whole pairs of shoes, she can buy 0 pairs of shoes per month.

To find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year, we need to consider the number of months in a year, which is 12.

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes per year} = 0.5 \times 12 = 6 \]

However, since she can only buy whole pairs, the number of pairs she can buy in a year is 0.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 0 \]"
"First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, the time required to peel 90 shrimp is:

\[ \text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to saute 30 shrimp. Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, the time required to saute 90 shrimp (which is three times 30 shrimp) is:

\[ \text{Time to saute 90 shrimp} = 3 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Since the tasks of peeling and sauteing are independent, the total time required to peel and saute 90 shrimp is the sum of the two times:

\[ \text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net change in temperature over the given time periods.

1. **Low setting for 3 hours:**
   - Temperature change per hour: -2 degrees
   - Total change: -2 degrees/hour * 3 hours = -6 degrees

2. **High setting for 4 hours:**
   - Temperature change per hour: -3 degrees
   - Total change: -3 degrees/hour * 4 hours = -12 degrees

3. **No air conditioner for 2 hours:**
   - Temperature change per hour: +2 degrees
   - Total change: +2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = +4 degrees

Now, we sum up all the temperature changes:
- Total change = -6 degrees + (-12 degrees) + 4 degrees = -14 degrees

Therefore, the room is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time:**
   - Bill's father saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill saw the comet for the second time when he was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old.

2. **Determine the time interval between the first and second sightings:**
   - The comet Halley has an orbital period of 75 years.
   - Bill saw the comet for the second time at 90 years old.
   - The time interval between the first and second sightings is \(90 - \text{Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time}\).
   - Since the comet's orbital period is 75 years, the time interval between the first and second sightings must be a multiple of 75 years. The only multiple of 75 that fits between 0 and 90 is 75 years.
   - Therefore, Bill saw the comet for the first time when he was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to break down the information given and calculate each category of checks separately.

1. **Electric Bill**: Buford writes a check once per month for the electric bill. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes 12 electric bill checks per year.
2. **Gas Bill**: Buford writes a check once per month for the gas bill. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes 12 gas bill checks per year.
3. **Church**: Buford writes a check twice per month to the church. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes \(2 \times 12 = 24\) church checks per year.
4. **Pest and Lawn Service**: Buford writes a check quarterly (every 3 months) to the pest and lawn service. There are 4 quarters in a year, so he writes 4 pest and lawn service checks per year.

Now, we sum up all the checks:
- Electric bill checks: 12
- Gas bill checks: 12
- Church checks: 24
- Pest and lawn service checks: 4

Total number of checks per year = \(12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52\).

The final numerical answer is 52."
"Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as \( F \). According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4}F \). The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany, so the number of flights to France is \( \frac{1}{4}F \) and the number of flights to Germany is also \( \frac{1}{4}F \).

The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, which is half the number of flights the first plane makes in a day. Therefore, we can write:
\[ \frac{1}{2}F = 44 \]
Solving for \( F \):
\[ F = 44 \times 2 = 88 \]

Now, we need to find the number of flights to France made by the first plane. Since the first plane makes 88 flights in a day and \( \frac{1}{4} \) of these flights are to France, the number of flights to France is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 88 = 22 \]

Thus, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the duration of each wolf's howl and then sum them up.

1. **Tobias's howl duration**: 20 seconds
2. **Chikote's howl duration**: Since Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, Chikote's howl duration is \(20 \times 2 = 40\) seconds.
3. **Igneous's howl duration**: Igneous howls for as long as Tobias and Chikote combined. Therefore, Igneous's howl duration is \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.

Now, we sum up the durations of all three wolves' howls:
\[ 20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} + 60 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ seconds} \]

To convert the total duration from seconds to minutes, we use the conversion factor \(1 \text{ minute} = 60 \text{ seconds}\):
\[ 120 \text{ seconds} \div 60 = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is:

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Adam received from his mother and father:

\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \]

Adam spent $30 on the trousers. To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount he received from his mother and father from the cost of the trousers:

\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

So, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the age of Wilfred. Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \(A\), \(B\), \(H\), and \(W\) respectively. We know the following:

1. \(A = 3\)
2. \(B = 4\)
3. The total age of the children is 20, so \(A + B + H + W = 20\).
4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is \(\frac{20}{4} = 5\). Therefore, \(H = 2 \times 5 = 10\).

Now we can substitute the known values into the total age equation:
\[3 + 4 + 10 + W = 20\]
\[17 + W = 20\]
\[W = 20 - 17\]
\[W = 3\]

So, the age of Wilfred is 3. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount Walter has collected from his neighbors and the online fund:

- From neighbors: $500
- From online fund: $1500

Total collected so far: $500 + $1500 = $2000

Next, we need to determine how much Walter's friend will contribute. The friend is going to give Walter $200.

Now, let's calculate the total amount collected after the friend's contribution:
Total collected after friend's contribution: $2000 + $200 = $2200

The lawyer will donate three times as much as everyone else donates. To find out how much the lawyer will donate, we need to determine the total amount collected from everyone else (excluding the lawyer's donation).

Let's denote the amount collected from everyone else (excluding the lawyer's donation) as \( x \). The lawyer will donate \( 3x \).

The total amount collected is the sum of the amount collected from everyone else and the lawyer's donation:
\[ x + 3x = 2200 \]
\[ 4x = 2200 \]
\[ x = \frac{2200}{4} \]
\[ x = 550 \]

The lawyer's donation is \( 3x \):

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the distribution of the watermelon slices among the family members. Let's denote the total volume of the watermelon as \( V \).

Given that there are 2 adults and 4 kids, and each adult's slice is twice as big as each kid's slice, we can represent the volume of each adult's slice as \( 2x \) and the volume of each kid's slice as \( x \).

The total volume of the watermelon is the sum of the volumes of all the slices:
\[ V = 2(2x) + 4(x) = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

Each adult's slice is \( 2x \), so the total volume of the slices for the adults is:
\[ 2(2x) = 4x \]

The total volume of the slices for the kids is:
\[ 4(x) = 4x \]

Since the total volume of the watermelon is \( 8x \), the volume of each adult's slice is \( \frac{4x}{2} = 2x \).

To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Volume of each adult's slice}}{\text{Total volume of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on inpatient rounds. He has 9 inpatients, and each round takes 20 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent on inpatient rounds is:
\[ 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes per inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time spent on appointments. He has 10 appointments, and each appointment takes 30 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent on appointments is:
\[ 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes per appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's add the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments to find the total time spent on these activities:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 480 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Doctor Jones works for 9 hours at the clinic, we need to convert this time into minutes to compare it with the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments:
\[ 9 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 540 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments from the total time Doctor Jones works:
\[ 540 \text{ minutes} - 480 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we convert the remaining time from minutes to hours:

"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to complete all the steps involved in making the cake.

1. Making the cake batter: 20 minutes
2. Baking the cake: 30 minutes
3. Cooling the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
4. Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

Adding these times together:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Since 180 minutes is equivalent to 3 hours, Jordan needs 3 hours to complete the cake from start to finish.

If the cake needs to be ready by 5:00 pm, we subtract the 3 hours from 5:00 pm to find the latest start time:
\[ 5:00 \text{ pm} - 3 \text{ hours} = 2:00 \text{ pm} \]

Therefore, the latest time of day that Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes.

First, let's find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's boxes. Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars. Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes is:
\[ \text{Chocolate bars per box (Peter)} = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]

Next, let's find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Martha's boxes. Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars. Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes is:
\[ \text{Chocolate bars per box (Martha)} = \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha. This can be calculated as:

"First, let's determine the number of female porcupines in the park. Given that the population of porcupines is 50 and the number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population, we can calculate the number of female porcupines as follows:

\[ \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the number of babies born each month is:

\[ \text{Number of babies born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120 \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[ \text{Total number of babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440 \]

The initial population of porcupines is 50. After a year, the total number of porcupines in the park will be the initial population plus the total number of babies born in a year:

\[ \text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1490 \]"
"To determine the cost to fill the swimming pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet.
2. Multiply the volume by 5.9 to convert it to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost to fill the pool at $0.10 per gallon.

First, let's calculate the volume of the pool. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:
\[ V = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions:
- Width = 14 feet
- Length = 25 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

Substituting these values into the formula:
\[ V = 14 \times 25 \times 4 \]

Now, let's perform the multiplication:
\[ V = 14 \times 25 = 350 \]
\[ V = 350 \times 4 = 1400 \]

So, the volume of the pool is 1400 cubic feet.

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. We know that 1 cubic foot is approximately 7.48 gallons. Therefore, the volume in gallons \( V_{\text{gallons}} \) is:
\[ V_{\text{gallons}} = 1400 \times 7.48 \]

Let's calculate this:
\[ V_{\text{gallons}} = 1400 \times 7.48 = 10472 \]

Now, we need to find the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon, so:
\[ \text{Cost} = 10472 \times 0.10 \]

Let's calculate the cost:
\[ \text{Cost} = 10472 \times 0.10 = 1047.20 \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is $1047.20."
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to calculate the number of each color of stick and then sum them up.

1. The number of red sticks is given as 9.
2. The number of blue sticks is 5 more than the number of red sticks. Therefore, the number of blue sticks is \(9 + 5 = 14\).
3. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. Therefore, the number of yellow sticks is \(14 - 3 = 11\).

Now, we sum the number of sticks of each color to find the total number of sticks:
\[ \text{Total number of sticks} = \text{Number of red sticks} + \text{Number of blue sticks} + \text{Number of yellow sticks} \]
\[ \text{Total number of sticks} = 9 + 14 + 11 \]
\[ \text{Total number of sticks} = 34 \]

The final numerical answer is 34."
"First, we calculate the distance Matteo traveled. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Matteo:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 55 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance Shandy traveled:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} = 45 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the distance Matteo traveled from the distance Shandy traveled:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 230 \]"
"To find the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. **Total number of students**: 3000

2. **Students over 16 years old**: Half of the total students.
   \[
   \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
   \]

3. **Students under 16 years old**: The other half of the total students.
   \[
   \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
   \]

4. **Male students over 16 years old**: One-fourth of the students over 16 years old.
   \[
   \frac{1500}{4} = 375
   \]

5. **Female students over 16 years old**: The remaining three-fourths of the students over 16 years old.
   \[
   1500 - 375 = 1125
   \]

6. **Male students under 16 years old**: One-half of the students under 16 years old.
   \[
   \frac{1500}{2} = 750
   \]

7. **Female students under 16 years old**: The remaining half of the students under 16 years old.
   \[
   1500 - 750 = 750
   \]

8. **Total female students**: Sum of female students over 16 and under 16.
   \[
   1125 + 750 = 1875
   \]

Thus, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is 1875."
"First, let's determine how many laps each person can run:

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) laps.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps.

Now, to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run:

\[10 - 5 = 5\]

So, Bethany can run 5 more laps than Quinn. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{5}

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days and then subtract this from the tank's total capacity.

First, let's determine the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day:

- Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity on the first day.
- The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, so Wanda pumped \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons on the first day.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda, so she pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons on the first day.

Next, let's determine the amount of water pumped on the second day:

- Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day, so she pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons on the second day.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day, so she pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons on the second day.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank over the two days:

- Total water pumped by Wanda: \( 4500 + 3000 = 7500 \) gallons.
- Total water pumped by Ms. B: \( 3375 + 1125 = 4500 \) gallons.
- Total water pumped into the tank: \( 7500 + 4500 = 12000 \) gallons.

Finally, we subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity to find out how much water is remaining:

- Remaining water: \( 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \) gallons.

The final numerical answer is 6000 gallons."
"Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as \( C \).

First, we know that the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour for the first 5 hours. This means that after 5 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ C \times (1 - 0.09)^5 = C \times 0.91^5 \]

Next, for the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour. So, after the next 3 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ C \times 0.91^5 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = C \times 0.91^5 \times 0.93^3 \]

We are given that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ C \times 0.91^5 \times 0.93^3 = 0.28 \times C \]

We can cancel \( C \) from both sides of the equation (assuming \( C \neq 0 \)):
\[ 0.91^5 \times 0.93^3 = 0.28 \]

Now, we need to calculate the values:
\[ 0.91^5 \approx 0.656 \]
\[ 0.93^3 \approx 0.817 \]
\[ 0.91^5 \times 0.93^3 \approx 0.656 \times 0.817 \approx 0.535 \]

Since we know that:
\[ 0.535 \approx 0.28 \]

This approximation shows that the initial charge \( C \) must be such that the equation holds true. Given the values, we can conclude that the initial charge \( C \) is approximately 100% (or 1 in numerical terms).

Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was:
\[ \boxed{100\%} \]"
"First, let's calculate Janet's total weekly earnings. She earns $10 per hour from her job and $15 per hour from tips, so her total weekly earnings are:

\[ 10 + 15 = 25 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are:

\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ dollars per week} \]

Next, we need to determine how much she needs to save to buy the car. The downpayment for the car is $10,000. She wants to save 20% of this amount:

\[ 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take for her to save $2000 at a rate of $1000 per week. We can calculate this by dividing the total amount she needs to save by her weekly savings:

\[ \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

So, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment for the car. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased:

- Peaches: 3 peaches * $0.50/peach = $1.50
- Pears: 4 pears * $0.50/pear = $2.00
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00/kiwi = $2.00
- Apples: 5 apples * $0.75/apple = $3.75

Now, let's sum these amounts to find the total cost of the fruits he has already bought:

Total cost of purchased fruits = $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar has $10 to spend, so the amount left for plums is:

Amount left for plums = $10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums he can buy is:

Number of plums = $0.75 / $0.25/plum = 3 plums

So, the final numerical answer is 3."
"First, we need to determine the total number of pieces of sweets Anne purchased. Since she bought a box containing 15 packs and each pack has 60 pieces, the total number of pieces is calculated as follows:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept 2 packs for herself. The number of pieces in these 2 packs is:

\[ 2 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

The number of pieces of sweets that Anne gave to her friends is the total number of pieces minus the number of pieces she kept:

\[ 900 \text{ pieces} - 120 \text{ pieces} = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne gave these 780 pieces to her 10 friends equally. Therefore, the number of pieces each friend received is:

\[ \frac{780 \text{ pieces}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 78 \text{ pieces/friend} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 78 \]"
"To find the price of carrots after three years, given that the price increases by 5% annually, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating the price increase over time. The formula is:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the price after \( n \) years.
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price.
- \( r \) is the annual increase rate (expressed as a decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) dollars.
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% expressed as a decimal).
- \( n = 3 \) years.

Substituting the given values into the formula:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]

First, calculate \( (1.05)^3 \):

\[ (1.05)^3 = 1.157625 \]

Now, multiply this by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ P = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ P \approx 139 \]

So, the price of carrots after three years would be approximately $139."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many selfies and portraits Olivia uploaded to her albums. We know that she uploaded a total of 72 pictures into 8 albums, with 3 albums dedicated to selfies and 2 albums dedicated to portraits. This means the remaining albums are for other types of pictures, but we don't need to know the exact number of those for this calculation.

First, let's find out how many pictures were placed in each album. Since the total number of pictures is 72 and they are distributed equally among 8 albums, we can calculate the number of pictures per album as follows:

\[ \text{Number of pictures per album} = \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Now, we know that 3 albums are for selfies and 2 albums are for portraits. Therefore, the total number of selfies and portraits combined is:

\[ \text{Total selfies and portraits} = 3 + 2 = 5 \]

Since each album contains 9 pictures, the total number of selfies and portraits is:

\[ \text{Total selfies and portraits} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \]

Thus, the total number of selfies and portraits Olivia uploaded is:

\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"To determine how long James spends reading, we first need to find out how many minutes it takes him to read one page. Since it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can calculate the time it takes to read one page by dividing 10 minutes by 3 pages:

\[ \text{Time per page} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} \approx 3.33 \text{ minutes per page} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages. We do this by multiplying the time it takes to read one page by 18:

\[ \text{Time to read 18 pages} = 18 \text{ pages} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, James spends 60 minutes reading. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 60 \]"
"To determine the current number of guests in the hotel, we need to account for the changes in the number of guests over the course of the day.

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.

- 24 guests checked out early, so the number of guests decreased by 24.
- 15 guests checked out late, so the number of guests decreased by 15.
- In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, twice this number is \(2 \times 15 = 30\). So, 30 new guests checked in.
- After dinner, 7 more guests checked in.

Let's calculate the number of guests step by step:

1. Initial number of guests: 100
2. After 24 guests checked out early: \(100 - 24 = 76\)
3. After 15 guests checked out late: \(76 - 15 = 61\)
4. After 30 new guests checked in: \(61 + 30 = 91\)
5. After 7 more guests checked in: \(91 + 7 = 98\)

Therefore, the final number of guests in the hotel is 98."

On Thursday, John picks 6 bananas.
On Friday, John picks triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) bananas.

Now, we sum the bananas picked over the three days:
\[ 4 + 6 + 12 = 22 \]

So, the total number of bananas John has is 22."
"First, let's determine the number of easy, average, and difficult questions in the quiz.

- Total number of questions: 60
- Easy questions: 40% of 60 = 0.40 * 60 = 24 questions
- Average and difficult questions combined: 60 - 24 = 36 questions
- Since the average and difficult questions are equally divided, there are 36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct. Therefore, the number of easy questions she is sure to get correct is:
\[ 75\% \text{ of } 24 = 0.75 \times 24 = 18 \]

For the average and difficult questions, Aries is sure to get half of them correct. Therefore, the number of average and difficult questions she is sure to get correct is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \text{ of } 18 = 9 \]

Adding the number of questions she is sure to get correct from all categories:
\[ 18 \text{ (easy)} + 9 \text{ (average)} + 9 \text{ (difficult)} = 36 \]

"First, let's determine the price of a large stuffed animal. Since each small stuffed animal costs $4 and large stuffed animals cost three times as much, the price of a large stuffed animal is:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( L \). According to the problem, the number of small stuffed animals sold is twice the number of large stuffed animals sold, so the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2L \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as the sum of the earnings from the large stuffed animals and the small stuffed animals. The earnings from the large stuffed animals are \( 12L \) dollars, and the earnings from the small stuffed animals are \( 4 \times 2L = 8L \) dollars. The total earnings are given as $120, so we can set up the following equation:
\[ 12L + 8L = 120 \]
\[ 20L = 120 \]
\[ L = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

Since the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2L \), we have:
\[ 2L = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"

"First, let's calculate Suzanne's earnings from selling the cookies and cupcakes.

She sold 80 cookies at $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are:
\[ 80 \text{ cookies} \times \$1/\text{cookie} = \$80 \]

She sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are:
\[ 60 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$4/\text{cupcake} = \$240 \]

Now, let's add the earnings from cookies and cupcakes to find her total earnings:
\[ \$80 + \$240 = \$320 \]

Next, we need to account for the money she gave to her two sisters. She gave each sister $10, so the total amount given to her sisters is:
\[ 2 \times \$10 = \$20 \]

Finally, to find out how much money Suzanne has left, we subtract the amount given to her sisters from her total earnings:
\[ \$320 - \$20 = \$300 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$300 \]"

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the ore mining rate with a steel pickaxe:**
   - A dwarf with an iron pickaxe mines 12 pounds per day.
   - A dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 50% more than a dwarf with an iron pickaxe.
   - 50% of 12 pounds is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6\) pounds.
   - Therefore, a dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines \(12 + 6 = 18\) pounds per day.

2. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in one day:**
   - Each dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 18 pounds per day.
   - 40 dwarves would mine \(18 \times 40 = 720\) pounds per day.

3. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month:**
   - There are 30 days in the month.

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to use the information that the prices are proportional. We can set up a proportion based on the given information:

- 2 sandwiches cost $3.
- 4 sandwiches cost $6.
- 8 sandwiches cost \( x \) dollars.

First, let's find the cost per sandwich for the first two packages:

- For 2 sandwiches at $3, the cost per sandwich is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) dollars.
- For 4 sandwiches at $6, the cost per sandwich is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) dollars.

Since the prices are proportional, the cost per sandwich remains the same. Therefore, the cost per sandwich is $1.5. Now, we can calculate the cost for 8 sandwiches:

"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst due to the gust of wind. Sally initially had 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst.

\[ \text{Red balloons that burst} = 25 \times \frac{40}{100} = 25 \times 0.4 = 10 \]

So, the number of red balloons remaining is:

\[ \text{Remaining red balloons} = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Next, Sally accidentally released half of the yellow balloons. She initially had 12 yellow balloons.

\[ \text{Yellow balloons released} = 12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons remaining is:

\[ \text{Remaining yellow balloons} = 12 - 6 = 6 \]

Sally found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining balloons.

\[ \text{Blue balloons added} = 8 \times \frac{75}{100} = 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \]

So, the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school is the sum of the remaining red, yellow, and the added blue balloons.

\[ \text{Total balloons} = \text{Remaining red balloons} + \text{Remaining yellow balloons} + \text{Blue balloons added} \]
\[ \text{Total balloons} = 15 + 6 + 6 = 27 \]

"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of the different scenarios and their outcomes.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of the substitute teacher collecting the homework: 50% or 0.50
   - Therefore, the probability of the substitute teacher not collecting the homework: 50% or 0.50

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having the normal teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension: 40% or 0.40
   - Therefore, the probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension: 60% or 0.60
   - If the normal teacher does not give an extension, Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment with a 20% chance or 0.20
   - Therefore, the probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension and Marcus not getting an extension: 60% or 0.60 * 0.80 = 0.48
   - The probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension and Marcus getting an extension: 60% or 0.60 * 0.20 = 0.12

Now, we sum up the probabilities of all scenarios where Marcus will have to turn in his homework:

- Substitute teacher not collecting the homework: 50% or 0.50
- Normal teacher not giving an extension and Marcus not getting an extension: 48% or 0.48
- Normal teacher not giving an extension and Marcus getting an extension: 12% or 0.12

Total probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework:
\[ 0.50 + 0.48 + 0.12 = 1.10 \]

Since probabilities cannot exceed 100%, we need to re-evaluate the calculation. The correct approach is to consider the complementary probability (i.e., the probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework) and subtract it from 100%.

The probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework is:
\[ 0.50 + 0.48 = 0.98 \]

Therefore, the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is:
\[ 1 - 0.98 = 0.02 \]

Converting this to a percentage:
\[ 0.02 \times 100 = 2\% \]

So, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:
\[ \boxed{2\%} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of seats that are not occupied by graduates or faculty. The total capacity of the Fine Arts Center is 6000 seats. After accounting for the 950 seats for graduates and the 300 seats for faculty, the number of seats available for distribution to graduates' friends and family is calculated as follows:

\[ 6000 - 950 - 300 = 5750 \]

Next, we need to find out how many tickets each graduate will receive if the 5750 seats are split equally among the 950 graduates. This is done by dividing the number of available seats by the number of graduates:

\[ \frac{5750}{950} = 6.052631578947368 \]

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we first need to calculate the number of soda bottles he will place along the driveway.

The width of the driveway is 24 feet, and he wants to place a bottle every 3 feet. Therefore, the number of bottles is calculated as follows:
\[
\frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet per bottle}} + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9 \text{ bottles}
\]
This calculation includes the first bottle at the start of the driveway and the last bottle at the end of the driveway.

Next, we need to determine the total time it will take Richard to go from one bottle to the next and drop the candy in. Since it takes 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, the time to go from the first bottle to the second, the second to the third, and so on, up to the eighth to the ninth bottle is:
\[
5 \text{ seconds per bottle} \times 8 \text{ intervals} = 40 \text{ seconds}

"First, let's calculate the total amount Jim borrowed during his college years. Since it took him 4 years to finish college and he received $50,000 in loans per year, the total amount of loans he took out is:

\[ 4 \text{ years} \times \$50,000 \text{ per year} = \$200,000 \]

Next, let's determine his income after graduating from college. His income tripled, so his new income is:

\[ \$50,000 \times 3 = \$150,000 \]

Now, let's calculate the income he would have earned if he had not gone to college. His original income was $25,000 per year, so the income he missed out on over the 4 years is:

\[ 4 \text{ years} \times \$25,000 \text{ per year} = \$100,000 \]

The total amount of money Jim would need to earn to cover both the loans and the income he missed out on is the sum of the loans and the missed income:

\[ \$200,000 + \$100,000 = \$300,000 \]

Now, we need to determine how long it would take for Jim to earn $300,000 at his new income of $150,000 per year. We can calculate this by dividing the total amount by his new annual income:

\[ \frac{\$300,000}{\$150,000 \text{ per year}} = 2 \text{ years} \]

So, it would take Jim 2 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the income he lost while in school. The final numerical answer is:

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 160 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered on Tuesday and Wednesday based on the information given, and then sum the letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday.

First, let's find out how many letters were delivered on Tuesday. According to the problem, Tuesday's delivery was 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery. Monday's delivery was 425 letters.

One-fifth of Monday's delivery is:
\[ \frac{425}{5} = 85 \]

So, Tuesday's delivery was:
\[ 85 + 17 = 102 \]

Next, we need to find out how many letters were delivered on Wednesday. The problem states that Wednesday's delivery was 5 more than twice Tuesday's delivery.

Twice Tuesday's delivery is:
\[ 2 \times 102 = 204 \]

So, Wednesday's delivery was:
\[ 204 + 5 = 209 \]

Now, we sum the letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:
\[ 425 \text{ (Monday)} + 102 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 209 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 736 \]

"To find out how much Johnny's dad lost on average that day, we need to calculate the total amount lost and then divide it by the number of races.

1. **First Race:**
   - Johnny's dad lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost.
   - Amount lost in the first race = $5.
   - Twice the amount lost in the first race = $5 * 2 = $10.
   - Amount won in the second race = $10 + $1 = $11.
   - Since he won, this is a positive amount, but for the purpose of calculating loss, we consider the negative of this amount.
   - Amount lost in the second race = -$11.

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Amount won in the second race = $11.
   - 1.5 times the amount won in the second race = $11 * 1.5 = $16.5.
   - Amount lost in the third race = $16.5.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost:
- Total amount lost = Amount lost in the first race + Amount lost in the second race + Amount lost in the third race.
- Total amount lost = $5 + (-$11) + $16.5 = $5 - $11 + $16.5 = $10.5.

Finally, to find the average amount lost per race, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races:
- Average amount lost per race = Total amount lost / Number of races.
- Average amount lost per race = $10.5 / 3 = $3.5.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{3.5}

"Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

"To determine the number of hours each painter worked, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of days the painters worked:**
   - There are 3 weeks of work.
   - Each week has 7 days.
   - Therefore, the total number of days is \(3 \times 7 = 21\) days.

2. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by the team:**
   - Each day, the team worked \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day.
   - Therefore, the total number of hours worked by the team is \( 21 \times \frac{3}{8} \).

3. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by the team:**
   \[
   21 \times \frac{3}{8} = \frac{21 \times 3}{8} = \frac{63}{8} = 7.875 \text{ hours}

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, Rory retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now that we know \( x = 6 \), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

So, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to apply the depreciation rate of 21% per year to the initial price of $20,000 for the three years between 2007 and 2010.

The formula for depreciation is:
\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^{\text{Number of Years}} \]

Here, the initial price is $20,000, the depreciation rate is 21% (or 0.21), and the number of years is 3 (from 2007 to 2010).

Let's calculate the final price:
\[ \text{Final Price} = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 20000 \times 0.493039 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 9860.78 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price of the car in 2010 is $9860.78."

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 80 = \frac{20}{100} \times 80 = 0.2 \times 80 = 16 \]

So, James does not respond to 16 emails a day. This means he responds to the remaining emails:

\[ 80 - 16 = 64 \]

James responds to 64 emails each day. To find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of emails he responds to in a day by 5:

\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 320."
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to calculate the number of classes for each day and then sum them up.

- On Monday, 32 classes visited.
- On Tuesday, twice as many visited as on Monday, so \(2 \times 32 = 64\) classes.
- On Wednesday, three times as many visited as on Monday, so \(3 \times 32 = 96\) classes.
- On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
- On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, we sum the number of classes for each day:

\[
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25
\]

Let's add these step by step:

\[
32 + 64 = 96
\]
\[
96 + 96 = 192
\]
\[
192 + 30 = 222
\]
\[
222 + 25 = 247
\]

So, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is 247."
"To find John's average score across the 4 tests, we need to follow these steps:

1. Sum up all the scores.
2. Divide the total sum by the number of tests.

First, let's sum up the scores:
- Scores from the first 3 tests: 100 + 100 + 100 = 300
- Score from the 4th test: 80

Total sum of scores = 300 + 80 = 380

Next, we divide the total sum by the number of tests (which is 4):
\[ \text{Average score} = \frac{380}{4} = 95 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 95 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club. They ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them.

\[ \text{Pizzas eaten by glee club} = 20 \times \frac{70}{100} = 20 \times 0.7 = 14 \]

So, the number of pizzas left for the glee club is:

\[ \text{Pizzas left for glee club} = 20 - 14 = 6 \]

Next, let's calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the football team. They ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

The football team ate 80% of these pizzas.

\[ \text{Pizzas eaten by football team} = 40 \times \frac{80}{100} = 40 \times 0.8 = 32 \]

So, the number of pizzas left for the football team is:

\[ \text{Pizzas left for football team} = 40 - 32 = 8 \]

Now, let's find the total number of pizzas left by adding the pizzas left for both the glee club and the football team:

\[ \text{Total pizzas left} = 6 + 8 = 14 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 14 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of big coupons Anthony wants to send out. Since he wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, and he plans to send out 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is:

\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, and he is sending out 700 small coupons:

\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, and he is sending out 1400 big coupons:

\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of mailing all the coupons, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the cost of mailing the big coupons:

\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:

\[ 24500 \text{ cents} = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:

\[ \boxed{245} \]"
"First, let's determine how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney ordered. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which means she ordered \(10 - 3 = 7\) meatball sub sandwiches.

Next, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. This leaves Sidney with \(7 - 4 = 3\) meatball sub sandwiches.

Then, Sidney ordered another three meatball sub sandwiches, so the total number of meatball sub sandwiches she has now is \(3 + 3 = 6\).

Since each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is \(6 \times 4 = 24\).

The final numerical answer is:
24"
"Initially, Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks, each carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. Therefore, the total amount of fertiliser dispatched was:

\[ 20 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 400 \text{ tons} \]

Two hours after departure, a quarter of the trucks experienced mechanical failures. The number of trucks that failed is:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks} \]

This means that the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks} \]

The total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:

\[ 15 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 300 \text{ tons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 300 \]"
"To determine the cost Dennis will incur to purchase 6 pounds of butter under the given promotion, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total amount of butter needed:**
   Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
   \[
   \text{Total butter needed} = 6 \text{ dozen} \times 1 \text{ pound/dozen} = 6 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Understand the promotion:**
   The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter get one half off."" This means for every 2 pounds of butter purchased, Dennis only pays for 1 pound.

3. **Calculate the number of sets of 2 pounds needed:**
   Since Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter, we divide by 2 to find the number of sets:
   \[
   \text{Number of sets} = \frac{6 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds/set}} = 3 \text{ sets}
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost for each set:**
   The cost of butter is $4.00 per pound. For each set of 2 pounds, Dennis pays for 1 pound:
   \[
   \text{Cost per set} = 1 \text{ pound} \times \$4.00/\text{pound} = \$4.00
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost for 3 sets:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 3 \text{ sets} \times \$4.00/\text{set} = \$12.00
   \]

Therefore, the total cost Dennis will incur to purchase 6 pounds of butter under the promotion is:
\[
\boxed{12}

"First, let's determine the total number of guests invited:

- Kayla invited her 25 classmates.
- She invited 7 girls from her dance class.
- She invited 13 family members.
- Total guests invited = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 guests.

Next, we need to account for the 4 people who could not come:

- Total guests who will attend = 45 - 4 = 41 guests.

The base rental fee for the theater is $125, and there is an additional fee of $6 for each additional guest beyond the initial 20 guests. Since 41 guests are attending, the number of additional guests is:

- Additional guests = 41 - 20 = 21 guests.

Now, we calculate the additional cost for the extra guests:

- Additional cost = 21 guests * $6/guest = $126.

Finally, we add the base rental fee to the additional cost to find the total cost of the party:

- Total cost = $125 + $126 = $251.

The final numerical answer is $251."
"Let's denote the amount of money Maggie had as \( M \) and the amount of money Riza had as \( R \). According to the problem, both Maggie and Riza had $60 initially, so \( M = 60 \) and \( R = 60 \).

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, so she spent \( \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \) dollars. Therefore, the amount of money Maggie has left is \( 60 - 15 = 45 \) dollars.

Riza spent one-third of her money, so she spent \( \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \) dollars. Therefore, the amount of money Riza has left is \( 60 - 20 = 40 \) dollars.

The total amount of money that Maggie and Riza have left together is \( 45 + 40 = 85 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats:
\[ 10 + 4 = 14 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Together, the first and second monkeys eat:
\[ 10 + 14 = 24 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. Therefore, the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day is:
\[ \frac{315}{7} = 45 \text{ bananas each day} \]

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we subtract the number of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys from the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day:
\[ 45 - 24 = 21 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Thus, the third monkey eats:
\[ \boxed{21} \text{ bananas each day} \]"
"Teddy finished half of the first 500-piece puzzle, which means he placed 500 / 2 = 250 pieces. He also finished the second 500-piece puzzle. Therefore, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is 250 (from the first puzzle) + 500 (from the second puzzle) = 750 pieces."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the roses Jenny bought. Since roses cost $2 each, the cost for 15 roses is:
\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2/\text{rose} = \$30 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jenny has initially. She arrived with five 5 dollar bills, so:
\[ 5 \times \$5 = \$25 \]

Since the total cost of the roses is $30 and Jenny only has $25, she needs an additional $5 to pay for the roses. This means she will receive $5 in change.

Now, we need to determine the change in quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the number of quarters Jenny will receive is:
\[ \frac{\$5}{\$0.25/\text{quarter}} = 20 \text{ quarters} \]

Therefore, Jenny leaves with 20 quarters. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"

"To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the arrival and departure times of each train and then find out when Paul's train arrives.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays in the station for 20 minutes.
   - Departure time: 10 minutes + 20 minutes = 30 minutes.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives half an hour after the first train leaves (30 minutes).
   - Stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed (20 minutes / 4 = 5 minutes).
   - Departure time: 30 minutes + 5 minutes = 35 minutes.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives an hour after the second train leaves (35 minutes).
   - Leaves the station immediately after it arrives.
   - Departure time: 35 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves (35 minutes).
   - Departure time: 35 minutes + 20 minutes = 55 minutes.

Paul's train is the fourth train, which arrives at 55 minutes. Since Paul arrives at the station at 10 minutes, he will wait for his train for:

\[ 55 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time Paul will wait for his train is 45 minutes."
"First, let's calculate how many toothpicks Melanie has saved so far. She has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks.

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie needs a total of 200 toothpicks. She has already saved 120 toothpicks, so she still needs:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks, we divide the number of toothpicks she still needs by the number of toothpicks she saves each week:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 8 \]"
"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.
2. Calculate the price Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend.
3. Determine the percentage discount his friend received.

**Step 1: Calculate the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.**

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price.
\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers paid} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the price Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend.**

Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.
\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers sold to his friend} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

**Step 3: Determine the percentage discount his friend received.**

The original price of the watch was $2000, and Mr. Rogers' friend bought it for $1800. The discount amount is:
\[ \text{Discount amount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

The percentage discount is calculated as:
\[ \text{Percentage discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is 10%.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs over a period of 4 hours. Given that each spring creates one jellyfish per second, we can break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.

1. **Determine the number of jellyfish created by one spring in one hour:**
   - There are 60 seconds in one minute and 60 minutes in one hour, so there are \(60 \times 60 = 3600\) seconds in one hour.
   - Since one spring creates one jellyfish per second, in one hour, one spring will create \(3600\) jellyfish.

2. **Determine the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - Since one spring creates 3600 jellyfish in one hour, in 4 hours, one spring will create \(3600 \times 4 = 14400\) jellyfish.

3. **Determine the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates 14400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create \(14400 \times 5 = 72000\) jellyfish in 4 hours.

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs working at the same rate in 4 hours is 72000."

"First, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually.

Jenny buys 10 bunches of bananas, and each bunch has an average of 4 bananas. Therefore, the total number of bananas she buys is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Since each banana costs $0.80, the total cost if she bought the bananas individually would be:
\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches.

Jenny buys 10 bunches, and each bunch costs $3.00. Therefore, the total cost if she bought the bananas in bunches is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

Now, to find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we subtract the total cost of buying in bunches from the total cost of buying individually:
\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

So, Jenny saved:
\[ \boxed{2} \text{ dollars} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) and the amount of fence Harry gets as \( H \). According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so we can write:

\[ H = S + 60 \]

Since the total amount of fence is 100 feet, we also have:

\[ S + H = 100 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Subtract 60 from both sides:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply by their respective prices.

First, let's find out how many of each type of bike were sold:
- Total bikes sold = 300
- Trekking bikes sold = 50% of 300 = \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \)
- BMX bikes sold = 15% of 300 = \( 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \)
- MTB bikes sold = Total bikes sold - Trekking bikes sold - BMX bikes sold = \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 65 \)

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike:
- Price of one MTB = $500
- Price of one BMX = \( \frac{500}{2} = $250 \)
- Price of one Trekking bike = $450

Now, we calculate the total earnings:
- Earnings from MTB = \( 65 \times 500 = $32,500 \)
- Earnings from BMX = \( 45 \times 250 = $11,250 \)
- Earnings from Trekking bikes = \( 150 \times 450 = $67,500 \)

Finally, we sum up the earnings from all types of bikes:

\[ 3 \text{ stories} \times 24 \text{ feet/story} = 72 \text{ feet} \]

Given that the ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height with each bounce, the height after the first bounce is:

\[ 72 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height the ball goes on its second bounce is:

\[ 48 \text{ feet} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 48 \]"
"First, let's convert all heights to inches for easier calculation. The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child is:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 72 \text{ inches} \]

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so:
\[ 72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches} \]

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so:
\[ 74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches} \]

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so:
\[ 69 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height of the fourth child is 72 inches."
"To determine the earnings from selling 2000 apples at a rate of $5 per bag, we first need to find out how many bags were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can calculate the number of bags sold as follows:

\[ \text{Number of bags sold} = \frac{\text{Total number of apples sold}}{\text{Number of apples per bag}} = \frac{2000}{10} = 200 \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags sold by the price per bag:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of bags sold} \times \text{Price per bag} = 200 \times 5 = 1000 \]

So, the orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the meat, so it left \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
3. The Allosaurus then ate the remaining meat, which is \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms. According to the problem, this amount is 270 kilograms.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]

To find \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

Therefore, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 kilograms.

"First, we need to calculate the total area of the walls that Tony needs to paint. The room has four walls: two north-south walls and two east-west walls.

The area of the north and south walls is:
\[ 2 \times (10 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The area of the east and west walls is:
\[ 2 \times (5 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 40 \text{ square feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Adding these areas together gives the total area to be painted:
\[ 160 \text{ square feet} + 80 \text{ square feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ square feet}}{20 \text{ square feet per gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost of the paint. Since each gallon costs $12, the total cost is:
\[ 12 \text{ gallons} \times 12 \text{ dollars per gallon} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total cost to paint the room is:
\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the probabilities step by step.

Initially, Ellen has a case of 12 sodas. She shakes 3 of them, leaving 9 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.

1. Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself. This leaves 8 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.
2. Ellen's brother takes 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas. This leaves 6 unshaken sodas and 2 shaken sodas.

Now, Ellen's friend comes along. There are 6 unshaken sodas and 2 shaken sodas left. The friend can choose any of these 8 sodas. The probability that the friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left.

The probability is:
\[ \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \]

To express this probability as a percentage:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 25%."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours and then sum these distances since the trains are traveling in opposite directions.

The first train travels at 60 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will travel:
\[ 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \]

The second train travels at half the speed of the first train, which is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]
In 3 hours, it will travel:
\[ 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles} \]

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each train has traveled:
\[ 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 270 \]"
"To determine how many people Billy helps with their taxes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.
2. Determine the number of days Billy works.
3. Calculate the total number of hours Billy works.
4. Determine the total number of people he helps.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.**

- March has 31 days.
- April 19th is included in the count.

Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days

**Step 2: Determine the number of days Billy works.**

Billy takes 20% of the days off.

Days off = 20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days

Days Billy works = Total days - Days off = 50 - 10 = 40 days

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of hours Billy works.**

Billy works 3 hours a day.

Total hours = 40 days * 3 hours/day = 120 hours

**Step 4: Determine the total number of people he helps.**

Billy can help 2 people per hour.

Total people helped = 120 hours * 2 people/hour = 240 people

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of hours Bobby spends on his lunches and breaks over 5 days, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, calculate the total time spent on breaks and lunch per day:
- Lunch time per day: 30 minutes
- Break time per day: 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes

Total time per day = Lunch time + Break time
Total time per day = 30 minutes + 30 minutes = 60 minutes

Next, calculate the total time spent over 5 days:
Total time over 5 days = Total time per day * Number of days
Total time over 5 days = 60 minutes/day * 5 days = 300 minutes

Finally, convert the total time from minutes to hours:
Total time in hours = Total time in minutes / 60
Total time in hours = 300 minutes / 60 = 5 hours

So, the total number of hours Bobby spends on his lunches and breaks after 5 days is 5 hours."
"First, let's determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate the distance Micah ran as follows:

\[ \text{Distance Micah ran} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know the total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles. We can find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

\[ \text{Distance Ahito ran} = 52 - (8 + 28) = 52 - 36 = 16 \text{ miles} \]

So, Ahito ran 16 miles. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 16 \]"
"First, let's calculate the initial charge and the return:

Initial charge: $85.00
Return amount: $15.00

After the return, the charge on the credit card is:
\[ 85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the items she bought after the discounts:

1. Frying pan on sale for 20% off $20.00:
\[ 20.00 - (0.20 \times 20.00) = 20.00 - 4.00 = 16.00 \]

2. Set of towels on sale for 10% off $30.00:
\[ 30.00 - (0.10 \times 30.00) = 30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00 \]

Now, let's add the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels to the remaining balance on the credit card:
\[ 70.00 + 16.00 + 27.00 = 113.00 \]

Therefore, the new balance on her credit card is:

"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( T \).

According to the problem:
- A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{T}{5} \).
- A third of the large jellyfish change color under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{T}{5} = \frac{T}{15} \).
- When the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color. Therefore, \( \frac{T}{15} = 6 \).

We can solve for \( T \) as follows:
\[ \frac{T}{15} = 6 \]
\[ T = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ T = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Lauren saves each year and then figure out how many years she needs to work to save enough for her retirement plan.

1. **Calculate Lauren's annual savings:**
   Lauren saves 20% of her annual salary.
   \[
   \text{Annual savings} = 0.20 \times \$100,000 = \$20,000
   \]

2. **Determine the total amount Lauren needs for retirement:**
   Lauren plans to live with 40% of her current annual salary for 20 years.
   \[
   \text{Annual living expenses} = 0.40 \times \$100,000 = \$40,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total retirement savings needed} = \$40,000 \times 20 = \$800,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of years Lauren needs to work to save \$800,000:**
   \[
   \text{Number of years} = \frac{\$800,000}{\$20,000} = 40 \text{ years}
   \]

Since Lauren plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years, we need to determine how many more years she needs to work beyond the initial 20 years to reach the total of 40 years.

\[
\text{Additional years needed} = 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ years}
\]

Thus, Lauren needs to work an additional 20 years to save enough for her retirement plan. The final numerical answer is:

"To find out the length of each final cut, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, Marty cuts the 100 centimeters of ribbon into 4 equal parts. To find the length of each part, we divide 100 by 4:
   \[
   \frac{100}{4} = 25 \text{ cm}
   \]
   So, each of the 4 parts is 25 centimeters long.

2. Next, each of these 25 centimeter parts is divided into 5 equal parts. To find the length of each of these smaller parts, we divide 25 by 5:
   \[
   \frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ cm}
   \]
   Therefore, each of the final cuts will be 5 centimeters long.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total number of students in the school, we start by noting that 40% of the school population consists of 240 boys. Let's denote the total number of students in the school as \( T \).

Given that 40% of \( T \) is equal to 240 boys, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.40 \times T = 240 \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} \]

Calculating the right-hand side:
\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} = 600 \]

So, the total number of students in the school is 600.

Next, we need to find the number of girls in the school. Since 40% of the students are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. We calculate the number of girls as follows:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times T \]

Substituting the total number of students \( T = 600 \):
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times 600 \]

Calculating the right-hand side:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360."

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days in June.
2. Determine the total number of miles Soledad plans to hike in June.
3. Calculate the number of miles Soledad plans to hike per day.
4. Determine the difference between the planned miles per day and the required miles per day.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days in June.**
June has 30 days.

**Step 2: Determine the total number of miles Soledad plans to hike in June.**
Soledad plans to hike 9,300 miles in June.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of miles Soledad plans to hike per day.**
To find the planned miles per day, we divide the total miles by the number of days:
\[ \text{Planned miles per day} = \frac{9,300 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 310 \text{ miles/day} \]

**Step 4: Determine the difference between the planned miles per day and the required miles per day.**
Soledad wants to hike twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. Therefore, the total miles per day she plans to hike is:
\[ \text{Planned miles per day} = 125 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

Now, we find the difference between the planned miles per day and the required miles per day:
\[ \text{Difference} = 250 \text{ miles/day} - 310 \text{ miles/day} = -60 \text{ miles/day} \]

Since the result is negative, it indicates that Soledad is already hiking more than the required miles per day. Therefore, she does not need to hike any more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

Paul wants one third of the total 12 kg of apples:
\[ \text{Paul's share} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg} \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount of apples that Pierre and Paul want:
\[ \text{Total wanted by Pierre and Paul} = 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg} \]

Since the total amount of apples is 12 kg, the amount of apples that James will have left is:

Initially, Tate has:
- 4 male guppies
- 7 female guppies
- 3 male goldfishes
- 5 female goldfishes

After buying more fish, Tate has:
- 4 (initial male guppies) + 2 (additional male guppies) = 6 male guppies
- 7 (initial female guppies) + 1 (additional female guppy) = 8 female guppies
- 3 (initial male goldfishes) + 2 (additional male goldfishes) = 5 male goldfishes
- 5 (initial female goldfishes) + 3 (additional female goldfishes) = 8 female goldfishes

Now, let's calculate the total number of male and female fishes:
- Total male fishes = 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfishes) = 11 male fishes
- Total female fishes = 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfishes) = 16 female fishes

Finally, to find out how many more female fishes than male fishes Tate has, we subtract the total number of male fishes from the total number of female fishes:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers and then determine how many toys the fifth worker needs to produce per hour to meet the order requirements.

First, let's calculate the production rate of the first two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 6 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(6 \times 2 = 12\) toys per hour.

Next, let's calculate the production rate of the next two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 4 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(4 \times 2 = 8\) toys per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by all four workers in a 10-hour shift:
- The first two workers produce \(12 \times 10 = 120\) toys.
- The next two workers produce \(8 \times 10 = 80\) toys.
- Therefore, the total number of toys produced by all four workers is \(120 + 80 = 200\) toys.

The toy manufacturer received an order for 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, they still need 20 toys to ship the order. This means that the total number of toys produced by the four workers is \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys.

Since the four workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced \(380 - 200 = 180\) toys in the 10-hour shift.

To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours in the shift:
\[ \text{Toys per hour by the fifth worker} = \frac{180}{10} = 18 \]

Thus, the fifth worker produces 18 toys per hour. The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we first need to calculate half of the earth's circumference.

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of this distance is:
\[ \frac{40,000}{2} = 20,000 \text{ kilometers} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:
\[ \frac{20,000}{400} = 50 \text{ days} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 50 \]"
"To find the speed of the faster car, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car.
2. Use the speed of the 2nd fastest car to find the speed of the faster car.

\[ 120 \times 5 = 600 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. Therefore, the speed of the faster car is:
\[ 600 \times 1.25 = 750 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 750 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Determine Liam's age two years ago:
   - Liam is currently 16 years old.
   - Two years ago, Liam was \(16 - 2 = 14\) years old.

2. According to the problem, two years ago Liam's age was twice the age of Vince:
   - Let Vince's age two years ago be \(x\).
   - Therefore, \(14 = 2x\).

3. Solve for \(x\):
   \[
   x = \frac{14}{2} = 7
   \]
   So, Vince was 7 years old two years ago.

4. Determine Vince's current age:
   - Since Vince was 7 years old two years ago, his current age is \(7 + 2 = 9\).

Thus, Vince is currently 9 years old. The final numerical answer is:
\[

"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline as \( A \). Since they painted the same number of eggs, we have \( A = A \).

Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Sarah as \( S \). Then, the number of eggs painted by Camden is \( S + 12 \) because Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah.

We know that the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ A + A + S + (S + 12) = 56 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2A + 2S + 12 = 56 \]
Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get:
\[ 2A + 2S = 44 \]
Dividing the entire equation by 2, we get:
\[ A + S = 22 \]

We also know that Camden and Sarah together painted 30 eggs, so:
\[ S + (S + 12) = 30 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get:
\[ 2S = 18 \]
Dividing the entire equation by 2, we get:
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, substituting \( S = 9 \) back into the equation \( A + S = 22 \), we get:
\[ A + 9 = 22 \]
Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get:
\[ A = 13 \]

So, Arnold painted 13 eggs, Madeline painted 13 eggs, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

To find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold, we calculate:
\[ 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"First, we need to determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons. This can be calculated as:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200}{8} = 25 \]

Each group of 8 crayons will be placed in a box, and each box weighs 8 ounces. Since there are 25 groups, there will be 25 boxes. The total weight of the boxes is:

\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \times 8 = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, and Nik has 200 crayons, so the total weight of the crayons is:

\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \times 1 = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together gives:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the total weight in pounds is:

\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400}{16} = 25 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 25 \]"
"First, we need to determine how many 4-foot logs John can make from the 80-foot tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, the length of the logs he can make is:

\[ 80 \text{ feet} \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 4-foot logs he can cut from 64 feet of wood:

\[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

Now, we need to determine how many planks John can get from these 16 logs. Since he cuts 5 planks from each log:

\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

Finally, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling these planks. Since each plank is sold for $1.2:

\[ 80 \text{ planks} \times 1.2 \text{ dollars/plank} = 96 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns half of what her brother earns, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Valerie's salary} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

Given that Valerie earns $5000 per month, we can solve for her brother's salary:

\[ 5000 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

\[ \text{Brother's salary} = 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Now, we know Valerie's brother earns $10000 per month. Next, we need to find out how much their mother earns. Their mother earns twice their combined salary. First, we calculate their combined salary:

\[ \text{Combined salary} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} \]

\[ \text{Combined salary} = 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Their mother earns twice this combined salary:

\[ \text{Mother's salary} = 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \]

Now, we can find the total amount of money they all have together by adding their salaries:

\[ \text{Total amount} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} + \text{Mother's salary} \]

\[ \text{Total amount} = 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

So, the total amount of money they all have together is $45000."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time spent by Grandma on the beach and on the sidewalk, and then find the total time for the entire 3-mile walk.

First, let's denote the speed of Grandma on the beach as \( v \) miles per minute. Therefore, the speed on the sidewalk is \( 2v \) miles per minute.

Given that Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach, we can calculate the distance she covers on the beach as:
\[ \text{Distance on the beach} = v \times 40 \text{ minutes} = 40v \text{ miles} \]

Since the total distance on the beach is 2 miles, we have:
\[ 40v = 2 \]
\[ v = \frac{2}{40} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Now, we can calculate the time spent on the sidewalk. The distance on the sidewalk is 1 mile, and the speed on the sidewalk is \( 2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \) miles per minute. The time spent on the sidewalk is:
\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the total time spent on the entire 3-mile walk:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time on the beach} + \text{Time on the sidewalk} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's determine how much Jane has saved so far. She has saved $4 each week for 8 weeks, so:

\[ 4 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 8 \, \text{weeks} = 32 \, \text{dollars} \]

Jane's goal is to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she has already saved from her goal:

\[ 60 \, \text{dollars} - 32 \, \text{dollars} = 28 \, \text{dollars} \]

Jane saves $4 each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28, we divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings:

\[ \frac{28 \, \text{dollars}}{4 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 7 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 7 \]"

- 3 trees each had 7 blue birds: \(3 \times 7 = 21\)
- 2 different trees each had 4 blue birds: \(2 \times 4 = 8\)
- 1 tree had 3 blue birds: \(1 \times 3 = 3\)

Now, we add these amounts together to get the total number of blue birds:

\[21 + 8 + 3 = 32\]

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"First, let's determine the initial number of marbles Bob has. If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen is equal to 24 marbles, we can set up the following equation to find the initial number of marbles \( x \):

\[ x + 24 = 60 \]

Subtract 24 from both sides to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 60 - 24 \]
\[ x = 36 \]

So, Bob initially has 36 marbles. If he loses 10 of the marbles he has, the number of marbles he will have is:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the second mug of water such that after Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle, the resulting mixture can be drunk.

Let's denote the temperature of the second mug of water as \( T \) degrees.

When Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle, the resulting mixture can be drunk if the temperature of the mixture is at least 40 degrees.

The formula for the temperature of the mixture can be derived using the weighted average of the temperatures of the two mugs of water. The total volume of water in the mixture is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug).

The temperature of the mixture \( T_{\text{mixture}} \) can be calculated as:
\[ T_{\text{mixture}} = \frac{4 \times 33 + 1 \times T}{5} \]

We need this temperature to be at least 40 degrees:
\[ \frac{4 \times 33 + 1 \times T}{5} \geq 40 \]

Let's solve this inequality step by step:
\[ \frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40 \]
\[ 132 + T \geq 200 \]
\[ T \geq 200 - 132 \]
\[ T \geq 68 \]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the second mug of water must be at least 68 degrees.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of animals added to the farm over the course of three weeks and then add this to the initial number of animals.

First, let's determine the number of days in three weeks:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cows added by Milkie Cows Limited over these 21 days:
\[ 20 \text{ cows/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 420 \text{ cows} \]

Then, we calculate the number of chickens added by Broilers Limited over these 21 days:
\[ 10 \text{ chickens/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ chickens} \]

Now, we add the initial number of animals to the number of animals added:
\[ \text{Initial number of cows} + \text{Cows added} = 50 + 420 = 470 \text{ cows} \]
\[ \text{Initial number of chickens} + \text{Chickens added} = 20 + 210 = 230 \text{ chickens} \]

Finally, we find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks:
\[ 470 \text{ cows} + 230 \text{ chickens} = 700 \text{ animals} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount:

Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs cost:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Russell is ordering 4 packs, he gets a 10% discount on the total cost. The discount amount is:
\[ 40 \times 0.10 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell is getting in total. Since each pack contains 9 bagels and he is ordering 4 packs, the total number of bagels is:
\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

To find the cost per bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels:
\[ \frac{36}{36} = 1 \text{ dollar per bagel} \]

"First, let's determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. According to the question, Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, we calculate:

\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 1 less than 3 is 2 scoops, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. The question states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, 1 less than 3 scoops is 2 scoops, and 3 less than 6 potatoes is 3 potatoes. Therefore, 2 scoops of mashed potatoes require 3 potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes are required for 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 2 scoops require 3 potatoes, 18 scoops would require:

\[ \frac{18}{2} \times 3 = 9 \times 3 = 27 \]

So, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to first calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day and then multiply by 3.

From the information given:
- Each bouquet of sunflowers costs $8 and contains 12 sunflowers.
- Faraday earned $56 from selling bouquets per day.

First, we calculate the number of bouquets sold per day:
\[ \text{Number of bouquets sold per day} = \frac{\text{Earnings from bouquets per day}}{\text{Cost of one bouquet}} = \frac{56}{8} = 7 \text{ bouquets per day} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that both tickets are winners. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the probability of winning for the second ticket:**
   - The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as a probability of \(0.20\).
   - The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning the second ticket is \(3 \times 0.20 = 0.60\).

2. **Calculate the probability that both tickets are winners:**
   - Since the events are independent (the outcome of one ticket does not affect the outcome of the other), the probability that both tickets are winners is the product of their individual probabilities.
   - Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is \(0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12\).

3. **Convert the probability to a percentage:**
   - To express the probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100.

"First, let's determine the height of Isabel's brother, Ned. Since Isabel is 7 feet tall and Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, we can calculate Ned's height as follows:

\[ \text{Ned's height} = \text{Isabel's height} - 2 = 7 - 2 = 5 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know that Carl is one foot taller than Ned. Therefore, we can calculate Carl's height as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's height} = \text{Ned's height} + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ feet} \]

The problem states that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. Therefore, we can calculate the length of Carl's cane as follows:

\[ \text{Length of Carl's cane} = \frac{\text{Carl's height}}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"To determine how many more bottles of juices Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bottles needed to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.
2. Subtract the current daily production from the total number of bottles needed.

First, let's calculate the total number of bottles needed:
- Each person's daily energy demand is covered by 20% of a bottle.
- Therefore, to cover 100% of a person's daily energy demand, we need 5 bottles (since 100% / 20% = 5).

For 2300 people, the total number of bottles needed is:
\[ 2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we calculate how many more bottles are needed:
- Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day.
- The total number of bottles needed is 11500.

The additional bottles needed are:
\[ 11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 7300 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of babies dressed in purple and blue, and then calculate the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple.

First, let's find out how many babies are dressed in purple and how many are dressed in blue:
- Total babies = 8
- Babies dressed in purple = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- Babies dressed in blue = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we calculate how many babies wear bows:
- Babies wearing bows among the blue-wearers = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 2 = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.6667 \) (rounding to the nearest whole number, 1 baby)
- Babies wearing bows among the purple-wearers = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is \( 1 + 2 = 3 \).

Now, we need to find the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. This is given by the number of purple-wearers wearing bows divided by the total number of babies wearing bows:
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of purple-wearers wearing bows}}{\text{Total number of babies wearing bows}} = \frac{2}{3} \]

To convert this probability to a percentage:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 100\% = \frac{200}{3}\% \approx 66.67\% \]

Therefore, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is approximately \( 66.67\% \)."
"To find out how many reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and the number of reports received on Thursday and Friday, from the total number of reports received last week.

Total reports received last week = 5168
Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

Reports received on Wednesday = Total reports - (Reports on Monday and Tuesday + Reports on Thursday and Friday)

Let's calculate it:

Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - (1907 + 2136)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043
Reports received on Wednesday = 1125

So, the final numerical answer is 1125."
"First, let's determine how much land Abraham sold in each transaction.

1. Abraham initially owned 80 square meters of land.
2. He sold half of his land for $50. Half of 80 square meters is 40 square meters. So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.
3. After a month, he sold another 1/4 of his land. One quarter of 80 square meters is 20 square meters. So, he sold 20 square meters for $30.
4. The remaining land is the total land minus the land sold in the first and second transactions. The land sold in the first transaction was 40 square meters, and in the second transaction, it was 20 square meters. Therefore, the remaining land is \(80 - 40 - 20 = 20\) square meters.

Now, let's calculate the total money Abraham earned from selling the land.

- From the first transaction, he earned $50.
- From the second transaction, he earned $30.
- From the remaining land, he sold 20 square meters at $3 per square meter. So, he earned \(20 \times 3 = 60\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together, the total money Abraham earned is:
\[50 + 30 + 60 = 140\]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[140\]"

"To determine how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of face masks used per outing:**
   - Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out.
   - Therefore, for each outing, he uses 2 face masks.

2. **Determine the number of outings per day:**
   - Tyrion goes out three times a day.
   - Therefore, for each day, he uses \(3 \text{ outings/day} \times 2 \text{ masks/outing} = 6 \text{ masks/day}\).

3. **Determine the number of face masks used in 2 days:**
   - Since he uses 6 face masks per day, in 2 days he will use \(6 \text{ masks/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ masks}\).

Thus, the final numerical answer is 12."
"First, let's determine the total number of eggs Cole hid in the yard. Since a dozen is equal to 12, 3 dozen eggs is calculated as follows:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we'll calculate the number of eggs each person found:
- Lamar found 5 eggs.
- Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ eggs} \]
- Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so:
\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ eggs} \]
- Mei found half as many as Charlie, so:
\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we'll sum the number of eggs found by Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei:
\[ 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 \text{ eggs} \]

Finally, to find out how many eggs are still hidden in the yard, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden:
\[ 36 - 27 = 9 \text{ eggs} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 9 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of apartments in the first two complexes:
- Each of the first two complexes has 200 apartments.
- Therefore, the total number of apartments in the first two complexes is \(200 + 200 = 400\).

Next, we calculate the number of apartments in the third complex, which is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two complexes:
- The combined total of the first two complexes is 400 apartments.
- 60% of 400 is \(0.60 \times 400 = 240\).
- Therefore, the third complex has \(400 + 240 = 640\) apartments.

Now, we find the total number of apartments across all three complexes:
- The total number of apartments is \(400 + 640 = 1040\).

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each complex. Therefore, the total number of collections per week is:
- \(1040 \times 3 = 3120\) collections.

John gets paid $0.40 per collection. Thus, his weekly earnings are:
- \(3120 \times 0.40 = 1248\).

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and then sum them up.

1. **5-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 50 fruits.

2. **6-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.

3. **7-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.

4. **8-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(10 \times 50 - 200 = 500 - 200 = 300\) fruits.

5. **9-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 0 fruits.

6. **10-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, we sum the fruits produced each year:

"Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters, the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters, and the red rope as \( R \) centimeters. According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we substitute the expression for \( B \) from the second equation into the first equation:

\[ R = 4(Y - 7) \]

Next, we substitute the expressions for \( R \) and \( B \) into the third equation:

\[ 4(Y - 7) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]

Add 35 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 6Y = 72 \]

Divide both sides by 6:

\[ Y = 12 \]

Now that we have the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:

\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \]

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope:

\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is \( 20 \) centimeters.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine how much money Rissa and Ronnie were given initially:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = $15\).

2. **Let \(x\) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister.**
   - After giving \(x\) dollars to their sister, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her initial amount.
   - Therefore, \(15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15\).

3. **Solve for \(x\):**
   \[
   15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
   \]
   \[
   15 - x = 12
   \]
   \[
   x = 15 - 12
   \]
   \[
   x = 3

4. **Determine how much money Rissa has left:**
   - Rissa initially had $15 and gave $3 to her sister.
   - Therefore, Rissa is left with \(15 - 3 = 12\) dollars.

5. **Determine how much money Ronnie has left:**
   - Ronnie initially had $5 and did not give any money to his sister.
   - Therefore, Ronnie is left with $5.

"Let's denote the amount of red paint as \( R \), white paint as \( W \), purple paint as \( P \), and yellow paint as \( Y \).

According to the problem, there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, so we can say:
\[ R = W = P \]

It is also given that half the mural is yellow, so:
\[ Y = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, so:
\[ R + W + P + Y = 12 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ R + R + R + 6 = 12 \]
\[ 3R + 6 = 12 \]

Solving for \( R \):
\[ 3R = 12 - 6 \]
\[ 3R = 6 \]
\[ R = 2 \]

Therefore, the number of pints of red paint used is \( 2 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. The area of one bedroom is given by the product of its length and width:

\[ \text{Area of one bedroom} = 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

\[ \text{Total area of bedrooms} = 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so:

\[ \text{Area of the living room} = 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

\[ \text{Total area of the house} = 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

So, the total area of the house is:

Let's add these numbers step by step:

\[3 + 6 = 9\]
\[9 + 12 = 21\]
\[21 + 24 = 45\]
\[45 + 48 = 93\]

So, at the end of the week, Alice will have counted a total of 93 clouds in the sky across all five days."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of pods in the new box and then calculate how many cycles can be run with $1 worth of pods.

First, let's find out how many pods are in the new box. The new box has 20% more pods than the original box of 100 pods. 

20% of 100 pods is calculated as:
\[ 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ pods} \]

So, the new box has:
\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

Next, we need to determine how many cycles can be run with $1 worth of pods. Since each cycle uses 1 pod, $1 worth of pods will allow you to run:

"First, we determine the number of 20 dollar bills Thomas initially withdraws from the bank. Since he withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills}
\]

Next, Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home. Therefore, the number of bills he has left is:

\[
50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills}
\]

Thomas then uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. The number of bills he uses is:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

So, the number of bills he has left is:

\[
40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

Thomas then triples his money. Since each bill is worth $20, the total amount of money he has is:

\[
20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars}
\]

After tripling his money, he has $1200. He then converts all his money to 5 dollar bills. The number of 5 dollar bills he has is:

\[
\frac{1200}{5} = 240 \text{ bills}

"First, let's break down the information given:

1. In the first half, team A scores 4 goals.
2. In the first half, team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, which means team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.
3. In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which means team B scores \(2 \times 4 = 8\) goals.
4. In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which means team A scores \(8 / 4 = 2\) goals.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by each team in the match:

- Team A scores \(4 + 2 = 6\) goals in total.
- Team B scores \(2 + 8 = 10\) goals in total.

The total number of goals scored in the match is the sum of the goals scored by team A and team B:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chalk the teacher has left and then calculate how many days he can continue using only 20% of the chalk each day before he has to recycle it.

1. **Determine the amount of chalk used on Monday:**
   - The teacher used 45% of the chalk by the end of Monday.
   - The chalk used is 45% of 5 inches.
   - Chalk used on Monday = \( 5 \times \frac{45}{100} = 2.25 \) inches.

2. **Determine the remaining chalk after Monday:**
   - Initial chalk = 5 inches.
   - Chalk used on Monday = 2.25 inches.
   - Remaining chalk = \( 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \) inches.

3. **Determine the amount of chalk used each subsequent day:**
   - The teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk each day.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of days the teacher can continue using 20% of the chalk each day.

4. **Set up the equation for the remaining chalk after \( x \) days:**
   - After \( x \) days, the remaining chalk can be expressed as:
     \[
     2.75 \times (1 - 0.20)^x = 2.75 \times (0.80)^x
     \]
   - We need to find \( x \) such that the remaining chalk is less than 2 inches (the threshold before recycling).

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - We need to find the smallest integer \( x \) such that:
     \[
     2.75 \times (0.80)^x < 2
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 2.75:
     \[
     (0.80)^x < \frac{2}{2.75} \approx 0.7273
     \]
   - Take the natural logarithm of both sides:
     \[
     \ln((0.80)^x) < \ln(0.7273)
     \]
     \[
     x \ln(0.80) < \ln(0.7273)
     \]
   - Since \(\ln(0.80)\) is negative, divide both sides by \(\ln(0.80)\) and reverse the inequality:
     \[
     x > \frac{\ln(0.7273)}{\ln(0.80)}
     \]
   - Calculate the values:
     \[
     \ln(0.7273) \approx -0.310
     \]
     \[
     \ln(0.80) \approx -0.223
     \]
     \[
     x > \frac{-0.310}{-0.223} \approx 1.39
     \]
   - Since \( x \) must be an integer, we round up to the next whole number:
     \[
     x = 2

\[ \text{Number of masks Johnny bought} = 3 \times (\text{Number of masks Mike bought}) + 2 \]

Substituting the number of masks Mike bought (5) into the equation:

\[ \text{Number of masks Johnny bought} = 3 \times 5 + 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of masks Johnny bought} = 15 + 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of masks Johnny bought} = 17 \]

So, Johnny bought 17 face masks. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of teeth that the dentist fixes. According to the problem, the dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills. Since he drills 4 teeth, the number of teeth capped is:

\[ 4 + 7 = 11 \]

So, the total number of teeth fixed by the dentist is the sum of the teeth drilled and the teeth capped:

\[ 4 + 11 = 15 \]

Now, we need to find what percentage of James' teeth (which is 30) are fixed. The percentage can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:

"First, we need to determine the total cost of the milk that Mr. Marcellus initially purchased. The company sold 4000 gallons of milk at $3.5 per gallon. Therefore, the total cost is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 4000 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = \$14000
\]

Next, we need to find out how much milk had passed the expiry date. Mr. Marcellus returned 2/5 of the milk that he purchased. So, the amount of milk that was returned is:

\[
\text{Milk returned} = \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \text{ gallons} = \frac{2 \times 4000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \text{ gallons}
\]

Since the milk was sold at $3.5 per gallon, the refund amount for the returned milk is:

\[
\text{Refund amount} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = 1600 \times 3.5 = 5600
\]

Therefore, the amount Mr. Marcellus got in refunds is:

"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, we substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5(C + 7)) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5(C + 7)}{3} \]

Next, we eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Now, we solve for \( C \) by isolating it on one side of the equation:
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old. To verify, we can substitute \( C = 20 \) back into the equations to find \( W \):
\[ W = 5(C + 7) = 5(20 + 7) = 5 \times 27 = 135 \]

Now, we check the second condition:
\[ C + 25 = 20 + 25 = 45 \]
\[ \frac{1}{3}W = \frac{1}{3} \times 135 = 45 \]

Both conditions are satisfied, so the final answer is:

"First, we need to determine how many 50 kg bags are in 850 kg of coal. We do this by dividing the total weight of coal by the weight of each bag:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{850 \text{ kg}}{50 \text{ kg/bag}} = 17 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of bags by the cost per bag:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 17 \text{ bags} \times 18 \text{ dollars/bag} = 306 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed by Kate's 6 friends. Each friend eats 6 slices, so:

\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices} \]

Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, we need to determine how many cheese pizzas are required to provide 36 slices:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed by Kate's 6 friends. Each friend eats 4 slices, so:

\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Since the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we need to determine how many pepperoni pizzas are required to provide 24 slices:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Since Kate needs to buy enough cheese pizzas and pepperoni pizzas to satisfy her friends' consumption, and both require 3 pizzas each, she needs to buy:

\[ 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to account for the rate at which Jay builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which means he builds 20/60 = 1/3 of a snowball per minute.

Every 15 minutes, 2 snowballs melt. So, in 15 minutes, 1/3 * 15 = 5/3 snowballs are built and 2 are melted, resulting in a net gain of 5/3 - 2 = 1/3 of a snowball.

To find out how many snowballs Jay will have after 15 minutes, we calculate:
\[ \text{Snowballs after 15 minutes} = \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) \times 15 = 5 \text{ snowballs} \]

Now, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are required to reach 60 snowballs. Since he starts with 0 snowballs, we need to find the number of intervals \( n \) such that:
\[ 5n \geq 60 \]
\[ n \geq 12 \]

So, it will take at least 12 intervals of 15 minutes to have 60 snowballs. The total time required is:
\[ 12 \times 15 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 180 minutes."
"If John is currently 28 years old and he is twice as old as Jim, we can set up the following relationship:

\[ \text{John's age} = 2 \times \text{Jim's age} \]

Given that John's current age is 28, we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[ 28 = 2 \times \text{Jim's age} \]

To find Jim's age, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ \text{Jim's age} = \frac{28}{2} = 14 \]

So, Jim is currently 14 years old.

The final numerical answer is 14."

"Let's break down the problem day by day to find out how many bandages were used and how many were left at the end of each day.

**First Day:**
- They used 38 bandages.
- They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
- Total bandages at the end of the first day: \(38 - 38 + 50 = 50\).

**Second Day:**
- They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
- Total bandages at the end of the second day: \(50 - 28 = 22\).

**Third Day:**
- They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered \(2 \times 50 = 100\) bandages.
- They used half a pack, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.
- Total bandages at the end of the third day: \(22 - 25 + 100 = 97\).

According to the problem, they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. However, based on our calculation, they had 97 bandages left. This discrepancy suggests that the problem might have a different interpretation or there might be an error in the given conditions. Given the conditions as stated, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is 50.

The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to consider her regular pay and the additional attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her regular pay:
- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- She works 6 days a week.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

So, her daily pay is:
\[ 7.5 \text{ hours/day} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = \$11.25/\text{day} \]

Her weekly pay is:
\[ \$11.25/\text{day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = \$67.50/\text{week} \]

Since there are exactly 4 weeks in April, her total pay for April is:
\[ \$67.50/\text{week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = \$270 \]

Additionally, since she did not incur any absences, she receives an additional $10 for complete attendance each week. Over 4 weeks, the total attendance bonus is:
\[ \$10/\text{week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = \$40 \]

Therefore, her total earnings for April are:
\[ \$270 + \$40 = \$310 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$310 \]"
"To calculate the total amount of money Jason earned, we need to multiply the number of times he performed each task by the corresponding amount he earns for that task, and then sum these amounts.

- For emptying the dishwasher: Jason emptied the dishwasher 6 times, and he earns $0.50 for each instance. So, the total for this task is \(6 \times 0.50 = 3.00\) dollars.
- For doing laundry: Jason did laundry once, and he earns $3.00 for each instance. So, the total for this task is \(1 \times 3.00 = 3.00\) dollars.
- For taking the trash out: Jason took the trash out twice, and he earns $0.75 for each instance. So, the total for this task is \(2 \times 0.75 = 1.50\) dollars.
- For cleaning his room: Jason cleaned his room once, and he earns $1.50 for each instance. So, the total for this task is \(1 \times 1.50 = 1.50\) dollars.

Now, we sum these amounts to find the total earnings:
\[3.00 + 3.00 + 1.50 + 1.50 = 9.00\]

So, Jason earned a total of $9.00 in the two-week period."

"First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600, so the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find the cost per bottle of cognac. The problem states that the cognac costs 50% more per bottle than the scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 \times 1.5 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch. Since he bought 10 bottles of scotch, he buys:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

The total cost for the cognac is:

\[ \text{Total cost of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we can find the total amount John spends on both scotch and cognac by adding the cost of the scotch and the cost of the cognac:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **First Day Planting:**
   - Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
   - He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, so he planted \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

2. **Second Day Planting:**
   - On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day, so he planted \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
   - On the second day, he planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day. The number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the first day was 40, so \(\frac{1}{4}\) more than 40 is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10\). Therefore, he planted \(40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

3. **Total Trees Planted:**
   - The total number of White Oak trees planted over the two days is \(20 + 30 = 50\).
   - The total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted over the two days is \(40 + 50 = 90\).
   - Therefore, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is \(50 + 90 = 140\).

"First, let's calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had:

- Two eyeshadow palettes, each with four colors: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors.
- Three makeup sets, each with six colors: \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors.

So, the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had is \(8 + 18 = 26\) colors.

Her sister steals one of the palettes, which means Amy loses 4 colors. So, the number of colors left after the theft is \(26 - 4 = 22\) colors.

Amy then uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since each makeup set has 6 colors, half of the colors from one makeup set is \(6 / 2 = 3\) colors. Therefore, after using up half of the colors from one makeup set, the number of colors left is \(22 - 3 = 19\) colors.

"First, let's determine the height of Mattison's house. Since Mattison is 60 inches tall and his house is 7 times as high as he is, the height of the house is:
\[ 60 \times 7 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to find the height of the first floor. The problem states that the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison is. Therefore, the height of the first floor is:
\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Since the house is two stories tall, the height of the second floor is the total height of the house minus the height of the first floor:
\[ 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The height of the roof from the floor of the second floor is the height of the first floor, which is 180 inches. Therefore, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is:

   \text{Expected number of red jelly beans} = 0.30 \times 2880 = 864
   \]

5. **Determine the difference between Tim's guess and the true number of red jelly beans:**
   The true number of red jelly beans is 900.
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36
   \]

Tim was 36 jelly beans off from the true number of red jelly beans."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of passengers on the bus:** 20 people.
2. **Number of passengers who entered at the first stop:** 40 people.
3. **Total number of passengers after the first stop:** \(20 + 40 = 60\) people.
4. **Number of passengers who entered at the second stop:** \(\frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30\) people.
5. **Total number of passengers after the second stop:** \(60 + 30 = 90\) people.
6. **Number of passengers who entered at the third stop:** Since the number of passengers doubled, the number of passengers entering at the third stop is \(90 \times 2 = 180\) people.
7. **Total number of passengers after the third stop:** \(90 + 180 = 270\) people.

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. Since 270 people are already on the bus, the number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is:

\[270 - 200 = 70\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[70\]"
"To determine how much Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to break down the problem into steps.

1. **Initial Cost Calculation:**
   - Pauline visits the museum three times a year.
   - The initial cost per visit is $2.
   - Over one year, the total cost is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) dollars.
   - Over 5 years, the total cost is \(5 \times 6 = 30\) dollars.

2. **Cost Increase Calculation:**
   - After 5 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%.
   - A 150% increase means the new cost is \(2 + (2 \times 1.5) = 2 + 3 = 5\) dollars per visit.
   - Over the next 3 years, the total cost for these visits is \(3 \times 5 \times 3 = 45\) dollars.

3. **Total Cost Calculation:**
   - The total cost over the 8 years (5 years + 3 years) is the sum of the costs from the first 5 years and the next 3 years.
   - Total cost = \(30 + 45 = 75\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is \(\boxed{75}\)."
"To determine how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups required and then multiply by the time each group spends.

1. Determine the total number of students in the school:
   - There are 10 students in each of the 3 grades (4th, 5th, and 6th).
   - Total students = 10 students/grade * 3 grades = 30 students.

2. Determine the number of groups needed:
   - Only 8 students can try the escape room at a time.
   - Number of groups = Total students / Students per group = 30 students / 8 students/group = 3.75 groups.
   - Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we round up to the next whole number, which is 4 groups.

3. Calculate the total time required:
   - Each group spends 45 minutes.
   - Total time = Number of groups * Time per group = 4 groups * 45 minutes/group = 180 minutes.

Therefore, it will take 180 minutes for everyone to try the escape room."
"First, we need to calculate the cost of the wooden tables. John manufactured 4 wooden tables for $20 each, so the cost for the tables is:
\[ 4 \times 20 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the roof frames. John manufactured 2 roof frames for $10 each, so the cost for the roof frames is:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the total amount Ali has to pay John, we add the cost of the wooden tables and the cost of the roof frames:
\[ 80 + 20 = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 100 \]"
"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Consequently, the length of the longer piece would be \( 4x \) feet. Since the total length of the board is 40 feet, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find the value of \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece, which is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, is:

\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 32 \]"
"To determine how much of Aiden's secret steakhouse seasoning he will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many pounds of meat are needed to make 80 meatballs.
2. Calculate the amount of seasoning needed based on the amount of meat.

First, we know that Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat. To find out how many pounds of meat are needed for 80 meatballs, we divide the number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound:

\[
\text{Pounds of meat needed} = \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds of meat}
\]

Next, we know that Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat. Therefore, for 5 pounds of meat, the amount of seasoning needed is:

\[
\text{Seasoning needed} = 5 \text{ pounds of meat} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons of seasoning}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{10}

"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly made as \( C \) and the number of brownies as \( B \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, which can be expressed as:
\[ B = 3C - 2 \]

Carly's class has 5 people, and each person gets 2 treats. Therefore, the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

The total number of treats is the sum of the cupcakes and brownies:
\[ C + B = 10 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]

Adding 2 to both sides:
\[ 4C = 12 \]

Dividing both sides by 4:
\[ C = 3 \]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of a basic manicure and a basic pedicure without any discounts:
- Cost of a basic manicure: $35
- Cost of a basic pedicure: $40

The total cost for both services without any discounts is:
\[ 35 + 40 = 75 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount for getting both services:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 75 = 0.20 \times 75 = 15 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ 75 - 15 = 60 \]

Karen also wants to add nail art on each of her fingers. There are 10 fingers in total (2 fingers per hand, and 2 hands), and each nail art costs $3:

"First, let's calculate the number of issues Susan receives from each magazine:

1. From the 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year:
\[ 3 \text{ magazines} \times 12 \text{ issues/magazine} = 36 \text{ issues} \]

2. From the 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year:
\[ 1 \text{ magazine} \times 6 \text{ issues/magazine} = 6 \text{ issues} \]

3. From the last magazine that sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine:
\[ 4 \times 6 \text{ issues} = 24 \text{ issues} \]

Now, let's sum up all the issues:
\[ 36 \text{ issues} + 6 \text{ issues} + 24 \text{ issues} = 66 \text{ issues} \]

Since each magazine sends one issue per year, the total number of magazines Susan receives every year is the same as the total number of issues:
\[ 66 \text{ magazines} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 66 \]"
"Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as \( K \).

According to the problem, Shelley has 8 paintings more than Kim, so Shelley has \( K + 8 \) paintings.

Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, and we know Samantha has 27 paintings. Therefore, we can write the equation for the number of paintings Samantha has as:
\[ K + 8 - 12 = 27 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ K - 4 = 27 \]

To find \( K \), we add 4 to both sides of the equation:
\[ K = 27 + 4 \]
\[ K = 31 \]

So, Kim has 31 paintings. The final numerical answer is:

"To find the final price of the toy after the price changes, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price of the toy in December after an 80% increase.
2. Calculate the price of the toy in January after a 50% decrease from the December price.

**Step 1: Calculate the price in December.**

The original price in November was $40. An 80% increase means the price increased by \(40 \times 0.80 = 32\) dollars.

So, the price in December is:
\[ 40 + 32 = 72 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the price in January.**

The price in December was $72. A 50% decrease means the price decreased by \(72 \times 0.50 = 36\) dollars.

So, the price in January is:
\[ 72 - 36 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 36 \]"
"First, let's calculate the earnings from the standard lessons. Charlie charges $80 per hour for these lessons. He has 4 such lessons today:

\[ 4 \text{ lessons} \times \$80/\text{hour} = \$320 \]

Next, let's calculate the earnings from the lessons given to veterans. The rate is reduced by 25%, so the new rate is 75% of the standard rate:

\[ 0.75 \times \$80 = \$60/\text{hour} \]

Charlie has 2 lessons at this reduced rate:

\[ 2 \text{ lessons} \times \$60/\text{hour} = \$120 \]

Now, we add the earnings from both types of lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day:

\[ \$320 + \$120 = \$440 \]

So, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is:

\[ \boxed{440} \]"
"To find Sally's mean score, we need to follow these steps:

1. Sum all the scores.
2. Divide the sum by the number of scores.

Let's start by summing the scores:
\[ 50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 \]

Adding these step-by-step:
\[ 50 + 80 = 130 \]
\[ 130 + 80 = 210 \]
\[ 210 + 60 = 270 \]
\[ 270 + 40 = 310 \]
\[ 310 + 90 = 400 \]
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \]
\[ 500 + 70 = 570 \]
\[ 570 + 60 = 630 \]

The total sum of the scores is 630. Now, we need to divide this sum by the number of scores, which is 9.

\[ \text{Mean} = \frac{630}{9} = 70 \]

So, Sally's mean score is 70."
"Eve originally had 20 pomelos. After giving some away, she is left with \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the original amount. Therefore, she has \(20 \times \frac{1}{4} = 5\) pomelos left.

To find out how many pomelos she gave away, we subtract the number of pomelos she has left from the original number of pomelos:

\[20 - 5 = 15\]

So, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

The final numerical answer is 15."
"First, let's determine how many apples Walter ate. He bought 60 apples and ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of them:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ apples}
\]

So, the number of apples remaining after Walter ate 24 is:

\[
60 - 24 = 36 \text{ apples}
\]

Next, Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. The number of apples given to his sister is:

\[
0.25 \times 36 = 9 \text{ apples}
\]

So, the number of apples remaining after giving 9 apples to his sister is:

\[
36 - 9 = 27 \text{ apples}
\]

Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. The total amount of money he received is:

"If Regina wrote 9 novels last year and this is 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year, we can set up the following equation to find the total number of novels she has written this year:

\[ 9 = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{novels this year} \]

To find the number of novels she has written this year, we can rearrange the equation to solve for the number of novels this year:

\[ \text{novels this year} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} \]

Now, we calculate the value:

\[ \text{novels this year} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \]

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

The final numerical answer is 12."
"To find the percentage of the distance Michael has covered, we first need to calculate the total distance he travels in 3 days.

Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr. There are 24 hours in a day, so in 3 days, the total number of hours is:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 72 \text{ hours} \]

The total distance Michael travels in 72 hours at 50 km/hr is:
\[ 50 \text{ km/hr} \times 72 \text{ hours} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

The distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. To find the percentage of the total distance that Michael has covered, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{\text{Distance covered}}{\text{Total distance}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 0.6 \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of grapes used by Madeline's brother to make the grape juice. Since Madeline ate 6 grapes and her brother used up 5 times as many grapes, we calculate:

\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ grapes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many grapes were used in total by Madeline and her brother. Adding the grapes used by Madeline and her brother gives:

\[ 6 + 30 = 36 \text{ grapes} \]

Their mother then used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. Since each pie recipe calls for 12 grapes, the total number of grapes used to make the pies is:

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ grapes} \]

The total number of grapes at the beginning is the sum of the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and their mother. Therefore, we add the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and the grapes used to make the pies:

\[ 36 + 48 = 84 \text{ grapes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to calculate his weekly expenditure and then extend that to a yearly figure.

First, let's calculate the weekly cost:
- Cost of pasta: $1.00
- Cost of cheddar cheese: $3.00
- Cost of gruyere cheese: $3.00 * 2 = $6.00

Total weekly cost:
\[ 1.00 + 3.00 + 6.00 = 10.00 \]

Next, we calculate the yearly cost by multiplying the weekly cost by the number of weeks in a year (52 weeks):
\[ 10.00 \times 52 = 520.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year is:

"First, let's calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms. Since it takes 15 minutes per classroom, the total time required is:
\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert the total time into hours because the workday is given in hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
\[ 1200 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

The custodian works 8 hours per day. To find out what percentage of their day is spent cleaning, we use the formula for percentage:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent cleaning}}{\text{Total workday}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours/day}} \right) \times 100 = 2.5 \times 100 = 250\% \]

However, this percentage seems unreasonably high, so let's recheck the calculations. The total time required is 20 hours, and the workday is 8 hours, so the percentage of the day spent cleaning is:
\[ \left( \frac{20}{8} \right) \times 100 = 2.5 \times 100 = 250\% \]

This indicates that the custodian spends 250% of their workday cleaning, which is not possible in reality. The correct interpretation should be that the custodian spends 2.5 times their workday cleaning, which is 250% of their workday. However, in practical terms, this means they spend 2.5 times their 8-hour workday, which is 20 hours, but since they only have 8 hours, they would need to work more than one day to complete the task. 

Given the constraints of the problem, the correct interpretation in terms of the provided data is that the custodian spends 250% of their workday cleaning. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 250\% \]"
"First, let's determine the capacity of each shelf:

- Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase:

\[
\text{Total capacity of one bookcase} = 10 \text{ (middle shelf 1)} + 10 \text{ (middle shelf 2)} + 20 \text{ (bottom shelf)} + 15 \text{ (top shelf)} = 55 \text{ books}
\]

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:

\[
\text{Number of bookcases needed} = \frac{110 \text{ books}}{55 \text{ books per bookcase}} = 2
\]

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought. Since she bought five dozens of eggs and each dozen costs $2.40, the total cost is:

\[ 5 \text{ dozens} \times \$2.40 \text{ per dozen} = \$12.00 \]

Next, let's determine the total number of eggs Rose bought. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:

\[ 5 \text{ dozens} \times 12 \text{ eggs per dozen} = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we need to find out how much Rose will earn by selling the eggs. She sells the eggs at the rate of $1 for every 3 eggs. Therefore, the total earnings from selling 60 eggs can be calculated as follows:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ eggs}}{3 \text{ eggs per dollar}} = \$20.00 \]

Finally, to find Rose's profit, we subtract the total cost from the total earnings:

\[ \$20.00 - \$12.00 = \$8.00 \]

So, Rose's profit is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"

"First, let's determine the cost of the beef jerky after the discount. Normally, a bag of beef jerky costs $18.00, but it is currently $3.00 off, so the cost will be:

\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many sticks of beef jerky are in the bag. Since each bag contains 30 sticks, we can calculate the cost per stick by dividing the total cost by the number of sticks:

\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

The cost per stick is $0.50, which is equivalent to 50 cents. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \text{50 cents} \]"
"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to calculate how many questions she answered correctly on the first test.

The first test has 70 questions, and she got 60% of them correct. Therefore, the number of questions she got right on the first test is:
\[ 70 \times 0.60 = 42 \]

To pass 6th grade, Audrey needs to correctly answer 70% of the total questions. The total number of questions across both tests is:
\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]

So, she needs to correctly answer:
\[ 110 \times 0.70 = 77 \]
questions in total to pass.

Since she already got 42 questions correct on the first test, the number of questions she needs to get right on the second test is:
\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 35 \]"
"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \). According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. \( B = 5S - 4 \)
2. \( S + B = 116 \)

We can substitute the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying the left side gives:

\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:

\[ S = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes \( S \), we can find the number of blueberry cubes \( B \) using the first equation:

\[ B = 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is \( 96 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of flashlights and candles used by Brianna and her family.

First, let's determine the number of flashlights:
- There are 4 people in the house, so there are 4 flashlights for them.
- There are 2 flashlights for each room, and there are 8 rooms.
- Therefore, the number of flashlights for the rooms is \(2 \times 8 = 16\).
- Adding the flashlights for the people, the total number of flashlights is \(4 + 16 = 20\).

Next, let's determine the number of candles:
- There are 8 rooms in the house, so half of the rooms is \(8 / 2 = 4\) rooms.
- For the 4 rooms, there are 4 small candles each, so the total number of small candles is \(4 \times 4 = 16\).
- For the other 4 rooms, there are 5 medium candles each, so the total number of medium candles is \(4 \times 5 = 20\).
- Adding the small and medium candles, the total number of candles is \(16 + 20 = 36\).

Finally, to find the total number of candles and flashlights used, we add the total number of flashlights and the total number of candles:
\[20 + 36 = 56\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{56}

5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, the total time it takes John to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes."
"If there were 20 helmets, and Dominick saw half as many robots as helmets, then there were \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) robots.

Since Dominick also saw half as many helmets as footballs, and there were 20 helmets, then there were \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \) footballs.

Therefore, the total number of items Dominick saw is \( 20 \) (helmets) + \( 10 \) (robots) + \( 40 \) (footballs) = \( 70 \) items.

The final numerical answer is 70."
"First, we need to determine how many hours Tim spends dealing with calls in a single day. Since he spends 6 hours each day at work and it takes him 15 minutes to deal with each call, we need to convert the hours into minutes to make the calculation easier. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 360 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calls he can handle in one day. Since it takes him 15 minutes to handle one call, we divide the total minutes he works in a day by the time it takes to handle one call:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ minutes/day}}{15 \text{ minutes/call}} = 24 \text{ calls/day} \]

Now, to find out how many calls he deals with during a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of calls he handles in one day by the number of days in the week:

\[ 24 \text{ calls/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 120 \text{ calls/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much longer it will take for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish, we need to calculate the drying time for both scenarios and then find the difference.

For the old varnish:
- It takes 7 minutes for one painting to dry.
- For 6 paintings, the total drying time is \(7 \text{ minutes/painting} \times 6 \text{ paintings} = 42 \text{ minutes}\).

For the new varnish:
- It takes 12 minutes for one painting to dry.
- For 6 paintings, the total drying time is \(12 \text{ minutes/painting} \times 6 \text{ paintings} = 72 \text{ minutes}\).

Now, we find the difference in drying times:
- The difference is \(72 \text{ minutes} - 42 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}\).

"To determine the total amount of water Crista needs every day, we can break down the problem into parts based on the amount of water each group of plants needs.

1. **Plants needing half a cup of water:**
   - Number of plants: 4
   - Water per plant: 0.5 cups
   - Total water for these plants: \(4 \times 0.5 = 2\) cups

2. **Plants needing 1 cup of water:**
   - Number of plants: 8
   - Water per plant: 1 cup
   - Total water for these plants: \(8 \times 1 = 8\) cups

3. **Plants needing a quarter of a cup of water:**
   - Number of plants: \(20 - 4 - 8 = 8\)
   - Water per plant: 0.25 cups
   - Total water for these plants: \(8 \times 0.25 = 2\) cups

Now, we sum up the total water needed for all the plants:

Therefore, Crista needs \(\boxed{12}\) cups of water every day for her plants."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time Phineas spends hopping and swimming.

Phineas needs to travel a total of 200 yards. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, he will travel 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.

The time taken to hop 100 yards on land at a speed of 20 yards per minute is:
\[ \text{Time hopping} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

The time taken to swim 100 yards in water at a speed of 10 yards per minute is:
\[ \text{Time swimming} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards/minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

The total time to return home is the sum of the time spent hopping and the time spent swimming:
\[ \text{Total time} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

"To determine how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.**

Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day. Since one dozen equals 12 doughnuts, we have:
\[ 10 \text{ dozen} = 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ doughnuts per day} \]

June has 30 days, so the total number of doughnuts made in June is:
\[ 120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts.**

Each doughnut is sold for $2, so the total revenue is:
\[ 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \times 2 \text{ dollars/doughnut} = 7200 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add these amounts to find the total weekly cost:
$25.00 + $16.00 + $6.00 = $47.00

Finally, we multiply the weekly cost by 5 to find the cost for 5 weeks:
$47.00/week * 5 weeks = $235.00

So, Alicia spends $235.00 on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks."
"First, we need to determine John's new speaking speed after training. His normal speaking speed is 150 WPM (words per minute). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster, so his new speed is:

\[ 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of words in 10 pages. Since each page has 450 words, the total number of words in 10 pages is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of people Conor saw each day and then find the total for the week.

1. **First Day**: Conor saw 50 people.
2. **Second Day**: Conor saw 20 more people than on the first day, which is \(50 + 20 = 70\) people.
3. **Third Day**: The total number of people was twice the number on the second day, which is \(2 \times 70 = 140\) people.

Now, we need to find out how many people Conor saw on the remaining days of the week (fourth, fifth, and sixth days). We know that the average number of people seen each day for the week is 60. Therefore, the total number of people seen over the week is \(60 \times 7 = 420\).

Let's denote the number of people seen on the fourth, fifth, and sixth days as \(x\). The total number of people seen over the week can be expressed as:
\[50 + 70 + 140 + x + x + x = 420\]
\[260 + 3x = 420\]
\[3x = 420 - 260\]
\[3x = 160\]
\[x = \frac{160}{3}\]
\[x = 53.33\]

Since the number of people must be a whole number, we can assume the problem implies rounding or the context allows for fractional people, but typically, we would consider the exact calculation. However, for the sake of this problem, we will use the exact value to find the total number of people seen.

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is:
\[50 + 70 + 140 + 53.33 + 53.33 + 53.33 = 420\]

Thus, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is:
\[

"To find the total number of popped kernels, we will calculate the number of kernels popping in each 30-second interval and then sum them up, including the additional kernels that pop after the pan is removed from the heat.

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount pop, which is \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels.
3. In the next 30 seconds, four times the initial amount pop, which is \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels.
4. In the final 30 seconds, half the rate of the previous 30 seconds pop, which is \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) kernels.

Now, we sum the kernels popped in the first four intervals:
\[20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200\]

After the pan is removed from the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds pop from the residual heat. The number of kernels that pop from the residual heat is:
\[\frac{40}{4} = 10\]

Adding these to the total from the initial intervals, we get:
\[200 + 10 = 210\]

Therefore, the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat is:

"To determine the total number of lemons Tim needs, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, calculate the number of lemons needed for the 4 gallons of lemonade:
- Tim needs 1 cup of lemon juice per gallon of lemonade.
- For 4 gallons, he needs \(4 \text{ cups of lemon juice}\).

Next, determine the number of lemons needed for 4 cups of lemon juice:
- 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice.
- Therefore, for 4 cups, he needs \(4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ lemons}\).

Now, consider the extra gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart:
- This extra gallon also requires 1 cup of lemon juice.
- Since it is twice as tart, it still requires 6 lemons (as the tartness does not affect the amount of juice needed).

Adding the lemons needed for the 4 gallons and the extra gallon:
- Total lemons needed = 24 (for 4 gallons) + 6 (for the extra gallon) = 30 lemons.

Thus, the total number of lemons Tim will need is:

"To determine how many pounds of feed are left after a week, we need to calculate the total amount of feed consumed by the pigs over that period.

First, let's find out how much feed one pig consumes in a day:
- Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day.
- Therefore, one pig eats \(4 \times 2 = 8\) pounds of feed per day.

Next, we calculate the total feed consumption for all five pigs in one day:
- Five pigs each eat 8 pounds of feed per day.
- Therefore, the total feed consumption for five pigs in one day is \(5 \times 8 = 40\) pounds.

Now, we determine the total feed consumption for one week (7 days):
- Five pigs consume 40 pounds of feed per day.
- Therefore, in one week, they consume \(40 \times 7 = 280\) pounds of feed.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. To find out how much feed is left after a week, we subtract the total feed consumed in a week from the total feed ordered:
- Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed.
- The pigs consumed 280 pounds of feed in a week.
- Therefore, the amount of feed left is \(300 - 280 = 20\) pounds.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine the total number of hot dogs required for the party. Since there are 20 guests and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs, the total number of hot dogs needed is:
\[ 20 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ hot dogs/guest} = 40 \text{ hot dogs} \]

John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party. Therefore, the number of additional hot dogs he needs to buy is:
\[ 40 \text{ hot dogs} - 4 \text{ hot dogs} = 36 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Next, we need to determine how many packs of hot dogs John needs to buy. Since each pack contains 6 hot dogs, the number of packs required is:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ hot dogs}}{6 \text{ hot dogs/pack}} = 6 \text{ packs} \]

Each pack costs $2, so the total cost for the packs is:
\[ 6 \text{ packs} \times 2 \text{ dollars/pack} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total revenue Frances makes from selling the cupcakes and cookies.

For the cupcakes:
- She sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each.
- Total revenue from cupcakes = 20 * $2 = $40.

For the cookies:
- She sells 40 cookies at $1 each.
- Total revenue from cookies = 40 * $1 = $40.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from both cupcakes and cookies:
- Total revenue = $40 (from cupcakes) + $40 (from cookies) = $80.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the trays of food she bought:
- She buys 5 trays at $4 each.
- Total cost of trays = 5 * $4 = $20.

Finally, let's calculate the money Frances has left after her expenses:
- Money left = Total revenue - Total cost = $80 - $20 = $60.

So, the final numerical answer is $60."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Street**: There are 5 children.
2. **Second Street**: Each of the 5 children is joined by another child. Therefore, the number of children becomes \(5 + 5 = 10\).
3. **Third Street**: Each of the 10 children is joined by another 2 children. Therefore, the number of children becomes \(10 + (10 \times 2) = 10 + 20 = 30\).

On the third street, the original 5 children then give up and leave the group. So, we subtract these 5 children from the total of 30 children.

Thus, the number of children now following the truck is \(30 - 5 = 25\).

The final numerical answer is:
25"
"To find out how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to subtract the total number of meals she has already given out from the total number of meals she was supposed to distribute.

First, let's calculate the total number of meals given out:
- Meals given out on Friday: 64
- Meals given out on Saturday: 30
- Meals given out on Sunday: 48

Total meals given out = 64 + 30 + 48

Now, let's add these numbers:
Total meals given out = 64 + 30 + 48 = 142

Mamou was supposed to distribute 1,360 meals. So, the number of meals left to distribute is:
Meals left = Total meals to distribute - Total meals given out
Meals left = 1,360 - 142

Now, let's perform the subtraction:
Meals left = 1,360 - 142 = 1,218

Therefore, the number of meals Mamou has left to distribute is 1,218."

"First, let's calculate the time Charisma spends meditating each day. She meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes in the evening, which totals to 30 minutes per day.

Next, we calculate the time she spends on yoga each week. She practices yoga 5 days a week for 1 hour each day, which totals to 5 hours per week.

Now, we calculate the total time spent on yoga in 4 weeks:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Then, we calculate the total time spent on meditation in 4 weeks. Since she meditates 5 days a week for 30 minutes each day, the total time spent on meditation per week is:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 150 \text{ minutes/week} \]
Converting this to hours:
\[ 150 \text{ minutes/week} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 2.5 \text{ hours/week} \]
For 4 weeks:
\[ 2.5 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we add the total time spent on yoga and meditation over the 4 weeks:
\[ 20 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:

So, the total square footage of the quilt is 101 square feet."
"First, let's determine the number of seeds in a large sunflower. A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since one dozen equals 12, a small sunflower has:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds} \]

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36 seeds, we calculate:

\[ 0.50 \times 36 = 18 \text{ seeds} \]

Adding this to the original 36 seeds gives the number of seeds in a large sunflower:

\[ 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds} \]

Now, to find the total number of seeds in both a small and a large sunflower, we add the seeds from both:

\[ 36 + 54 = 90 \text{ seeds} \]

So, the total number of sunflower seeds altogether is:

\[ 90 \]"

"First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts with the buy one get one 50% off deal.

The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, he gets the second T-shirt at 50% off the original price. The discounted price for the second T-shirt is:
\[ 8 \times 0.5 = 4 \]

So, the total cost for the 2 T-shirts is:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes after the 40% discount.

The original price of the shoes is $40. The discount is 40%, so the price Jake pays for the shoes is:
\[ 40 \times (1 - 0.4) = 40 \times 0.6 = 24 \]

Now, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends:
\[ 12 + 24 = 36 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"First, let's calculate Ryan's total allowance for the 3 weeks he completed his chores. Since he earns $6 each week, his total allowance is:
\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the ice cream cones. Ryan bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends, so he bought 4 ice cream cones at $1.25 each. The total cost for the ice cream cones is:
\[ 4 \times 1.25 = 5 \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from Ryan's total allowance to find out how much money he has left:
\[ 18 - 5 = 13 \]

Ryan wants to use the remaining money to buy movie tickets, which cost $6.50 each. To find out how many movie tickets he can buy, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one movie ticket:
\[ 13 \div 6.50 = 2 \]

Since Ryan can only buy whole movie tickets, the number of movie tickets he can buy is:

\[ 30 + 2 \times 100 = 30 + 200 = 230 \]

Now, to find the total amount both Ellen and Lani spent together, we add the amounts they each spent:
\[ 105 + 230 = 335 \]

Therefore, the total amount they spent in all is:
\[ \boxed{335} \]"
"To determine the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars of his honey and jam mix, we need to calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar and then the total cost for 10 jars. After that, we can find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

First, let's calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar:
- Passion fruit: 2 pounds at $6 per pound = 2 * $6 = $12
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds at $8 per pound = 1.5 * $8 = $12
- Special honey: 2 pounds at $10 per pound = 2 * $10 = $20

The total cost for one jar is:
$12 (passion fruit) + $12 (jackfruit) + $20 (honey) = $44

Now, we calculate the total cost for 10 jars:
$44 * 10 = $440

Tim sells each jar for $50, so the total revenue from selling 10 jars is:
$50 * 10 = $500

Finally, the profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
$500 (revenue) - $440 (cost) = $60

Therefore, the profit Tim makes selling 10 jars is $60."

Now, let's add these amounts together to find the total expenditure:

Total spent = $3.50 + $15.00 + $8.50 = $27.00

Janet's parents gave her $40. To find out how much she has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the amount given by her parents:

Amount left = $40.00 - $27.00 = $13.00

So, the final numerical answer is $13.00."
"To determine how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of days Josh works in one week.
2. Determine the number of cars he services in one week.
3. Calculate his weekly earnings.
4. Multiply his weekly earnings by 2 to find his earnings in 2 weeks.

First, let's calculate the number of days Josh works in one week. He is open every day except Sunday and Wednesday. This means he works on 5 days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday).

Next, we calculate the number of cars he services in one week. Since he services 3 cars a day, in 5 days he services:
\[ 3 \text{ cars/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 15 \text{ cars/week} \]

Now, we determine his weekly earnings. He gets paid $4 per car, so his weekly earnings are:
\[ 15 \text{ cars/week} \times 4 \text{ dollars/car} = 60 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Finally, to find his earnings in 2 weeks, we multiply his weekly earnings by 2:

Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers, so each part would consist of 12 / 2 = 6 toy soldiers.

For the first half (6 toy soldiers) at $5 each:
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \]

For the second half (6 toy soldiers) at $7 each:
\[ 6 \times 7 = 42 \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total earnings:
\[ 30 + 42 = 72 \]

So, Matthew would earn $72 if he agrees to the offer."
"First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate returns, the dog continues to dig 6 holes a day, but Nate starts filling in 9 holes a day. The net effect is that 3 holes are filled each day (since 9 holes are filled minus 6 holes are dug):

\[ 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/day} = 3 \text{ holes/day filled} \]

Now, we need to determine how many days it will take to fill in all 84 holes. Since 3 holes are filled each day, the number of days required to fill in all the holes is:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

To find out how many weeks it takes, we divide the number of days by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes. The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine the average enrollment at Butler High School. Given that Butler High School enrolls an average of \(\frac{3}{4}\) as many students as Norman High School, we can calculate the enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

\[
\text{Enrollment at Butler High School} = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Enrollment at Norman High School}
\]

Given that the enrollment at Norman High School is 4000 students, we substitute this value into the equation:

\[
\text{Enrollment at Butler High School} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 = 3000
\]

Next, we need to find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School. We do this by subtracting the enrollment at Butler High School from the enrollment at Norman High School:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Enrollment at Norman High School} - \text{Enrollment at Butler High School}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Difference} = 4000 - 3000 = 1000

Chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies made - (Rainbow cookies + Oatmeal cookies)

Let's calculate the number of chocolate chip cookies:

Chocolate chip cookies = 7995 - (2595 + 3075)
Chocolate chip cookies = 7995 - 5670
Chocolate chip cookies = 2325

So, the number of chocolate chip cookies made is 2325."
"First, let's determine the number of each item Igor gathered by accident:

- Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many, which is \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes.
- Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes, but Igor gathered two more than requested, which is \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes.
- Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, and Igor picked up the correct number, which is 7 beakers.

Now, let's calculate the total number of items Igor gathered:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Aaron's speed:**
   - Let \( v \) be Vanessa's speed in miles per minute.
   - Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, Aaron's speed is \( 2v \).
   - Aaron completed 4 miles in 16 minutes.
   - Using the formula \( \text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \), we can write:
     \[
     16 = \frac{4}{2v}
     \]
   - Simplifying the equation:
     \[
     16 = \frac{4}{2v} \implies 16 = \frac{2}{v} \implies v = \frac{2}{16} = \frac{1}{8}
     \]
   - So, Vanessa's speed is \( \frac{1}{8} \) miles per minute.

2. **Determine the distance Vanessa ran:**
   - We are given that Vanessa ran 4 miles.

3. **Calculate the time Vanessa took to complete her part:**
   - Using the formula \( \text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \) again:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{\frac{1}{8} \text{ miles per minute}} = 4 \times 8 = 32 \text{ minutes}

"First, we need to determine the total selling price of the 50 watermelons. The vendor made a profit of 25% on the cost price of $80.

The profit amount can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Cost Price} \times \text{Profit Percentage} = 80 \times 0.25 = 20 \]

So, the total selling price is:
\[ \text{Total Selling Price} = \text{Cost Price} + \text{Profit} = 80 + 20 = 100 \]

To find the selling price of each watermelon, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:
\[ \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{\text{Total Selling Price}}{\text{Number of Watermelons}} = \frac{100}{50} = 2 \]

Thus, each watermelon was sold for $2."
"First, let's determine James's current age. Since Dora will be 12 in 3 years, she is currently 9 years old. James is now twice as old as Dora, so James is currently \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

Next, we need to find out how old John is now. We know that John had James when he was 19 years old, and James is currently 18 years old. Therefore, John is currently \(19 + 18 = 37\) years old.

Now, we need to determine the age of John's youngest son. The youngest son was born when John was 32 years old, so the youngest son is currently \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old. In 3 years, the youngest son will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}
\]"
"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in that time.

First, let's find out how many oranges each can peel in one minute:
- Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in one minute, she peels \(\frac{1}{3}\) of an orange.
- Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in one minute, she peels \(\frac{1}{4}\) of an orange.

Next, we calculate how many oranges each can peel in one hour (60 minutes):
- In 60 minutes, Ana peels \(60 \times \frac{1}{3} = 20\) oranges.
- In 60 minutes, Jane peels \(60 \times \frac{1}{4} = 15\) oranges.

Finally, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
- The difference is \(20 - 15 = 5\) oranges.

So, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{5}

"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400, and Mark gets it at 80% off. So, the discount amount is:

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 400 \times \frac{80}{100} = 400 \times 0.8 = 320 \]

Therefore, the cost of the radiator after the discount is:

\[ \text{Discounted cost of radiator} = 400 - 320 = 80 \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost of hiring the mechanic. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator. So, the cost for the mechanic is:

\[ \text{Cost for mechanic} = 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the radiator after the discount to the cost of hiring the mechanic to find the total amount Mark paid:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 230 \]"
"Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( K \).

We know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20, so \( C + K = 20 \).
2. Chickens have 2 legs each and cows have 4 legs each, and the total number of legs is 70, so \( 2C + 4K = 70 \).

We can solve these equations step by step. First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

We can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( C \):
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of slices available from the 7 pizzas. Since each pizza is cut into 8 slices, we can calculate the total number of slices as follows:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to divide the total number of slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends, which makes a total of 4 people. So, we divide the total number of slices by 4:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Thus, each of them can have \(\boxed{14}\) slices."
