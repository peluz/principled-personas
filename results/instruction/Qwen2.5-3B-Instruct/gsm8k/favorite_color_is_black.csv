"First, let's determine how many eggs Janet has left after eating and using some for baking.

Janet starts with 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 eggs for baking. So, the number of eggs left for selling is calculated as follows:

\[ 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 \]

Janet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg. Therefore, the total amount she makes every day is:

\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of white fiber required and then sum it with the amount of blue fiber.

Given:
- The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.
- The robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber.

First, calculate the amount of white fiber:
- Since the robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber, and there are 2 bolts of blue fiber, the amount of white fiber is:
  \[
  \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ bolt}
  \]

Next, sum the bolts of blue and white fiber:
- Blue fiber: 2 bolts
- White fiber: 1 bolt

Total bolts of fiber:
\[
2 + 1 = 3 \text{ bolts}
\]

Thus, the total number of bolts of fiber required is:
\[
\boxed{3}

"First, we need to calculate the new value of the house after the repairs and the increase in value. The original value of the house is $80,000. Josh adds $50,000 in repairs, so the total cost before the increase is:

\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

The value of the house increases by 150%. To find out how much the value increases, we calculate 150% of $130,000:

\[ 130,000 \times 1.5 = 195,000 \]

Adding this increase to the original cost gives the new value of the house:

\[ 130,000 + 195,000 = 325,000 \]

Josh sells the house for the new value of $325,000. To find the profit, we subtract the total cost (original price plus repairs) from the selling price:

\[ 325,000 - 130,000 = 195,000 \]

So, the profit Josh made is:

\[ \boxed{195000} \]"
"To calculate the total meters James runs in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Determine the total meters James runs in one sprint: 60 meters.
2. Determine the number of sprints James runs in one week: 3 sprints.
3. Determine the number of times James runs in a week: 3 times.
4. Calculate the total meters run in a week by multiplying the meters per sprint by the number of sprints per week and then by the number of times he runs per week.

Let's do the calculation:

\[ \text{Total meters per week} = 60 \, \text{meters/sprint} \times 3 \, \text{sprints/week} \times 3 \, \text{times/week} \]

\[ \text{Total meters per week} = 60 \times 3 \times 3 \]

\[ \text{Total meters per week} = 540 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 540 meters."
"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she gives her flock in the morning and afternoon.

Wendi gives her flock 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. Therefore, the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
\[ 15 + 25 = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Since Wendi has a flock of 20 chickens and she feeds each chicken three cups of feed per day, the total amount of feed needed for the entire flock is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed in the final meal, we subtract the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total amount of feed needed for the day:
\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Thus, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To calculate the total cost for Kylar, we need to consider the pricing structure and the quantity he wants to buy.

1. The first glass costs $5.
2. Every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $5 * 0.60 = $3.

So, for every two glasses, the cost is $5 + $3 = $8.

Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. We can divide the 16 glasses into 8 pairs of glasses (since 16 / 2 = 8).

The cost for 8 pairs of glasses is 8 * $8 = $64.

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses.

\[
\boxed{64}
\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of sheep in each city based on the given relationships and the number of sheep in Seattle.

1. Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. Therefore, Charleston has \(4 \times 20 = 80\) sheep.
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Therefore, Toulouse has \(2 \times 80 = 160\) sheep.

Now, we sum the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle:
\[160 + 80 + 20 = 260\]

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the time taken for each part of the download.

1. **First 40% of the file:**
   - The file size is 200 GB.
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 0.40 \times 200 = 80 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) minutes.

2. **Windows update installation:**
   - This takes 20 minutes.

3. **Restarting the download:**
   - After the update, Carla has to start the download from the beginning.
   - The remaining 60% of the file is \( 0.60 \times 200 = 120 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 120 GB is \( \frac{120}{2} = 60 \) minutes.

Adding these times together:
- Time for the first 40%: 40 minutes
- Time for the update: 20 minutes
- Time for the restart: 60 minutes

Total time = \( 40 + 20 + 60 = 120 \) minutes.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how far John is from home at the end of 4 hours, we need to break down his journey into segments and calculate the distance for each segment.

1. **First Segment:**
   - Time: 3 hours
   - Speed: 60 mph
   - Distance: \(3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ mph} = 180 \text{ miles}\)

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Time: 2 hours (in traffic)
   - Speed: 0 mph
   - Distance: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 0 \text{ mph} = 0 \text{ miles}\)

3. **Third Segment:**
   - Time: 0.5 hours
   - Speed: 30 mph
   - Distance: \(0.5 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ miles}\)

4. **Fourth Segment:**
   - Time: 3.5 hours
   - Speed: 80 mph
   - Distance: \(3.5 \text{ hours} \times 80 \text{ mph} = 280 \text{ miles}\)

Now, we sum the distances of all segments to find the total distance traveled:
\[180 \text{ miles} + 0 \text{ miles} + 15 \text{ miles} + 280 \text{ miles} = 475 \text{ miles}\]

John started 180 miles from home and traveled 475 miles in total. Therefore, the distance from home at the end of 4 hours is:
\[475 \text{ miles} - 180 \text{ miles} = 295 \text{ miles}\]

The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break it down into regular hours and overtime hours.

Eliza's regular rate is $10 per hour. For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
\[ 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \]

For the overtime hours, she works 5 hours over the regular 40 hours. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate:
\[ 1.2 \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$12/\text{hour} \]
So, her earnings for the 5 overtime hours are:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

Adding the earnings from regular hours and overtime hours gives her total earnings for the week:
\[ \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the number of downloads for each month and then sum them up.

1. **First Month Downloads:**
   The program had 60 downloads in the first month.

2. **Second Month Downloads:**
   The number of downloads in the second month was three times the downloads in the first month.
   \[
   \text{Second Month Downloads} = 3 \times 60 = 180
   \]

3. **Third Month Downloads:**
   The number of downloads in the third month was reduced by 30% from the second month.
   \[
   \text{Reduction} = 30\% \text{ of } 180 = 0.30 \times 180 = 54
   \]
   \[
   \text{Third Month Downloads} = 180 - 54 = 126
   \]

4. **Total Downloads Over Three Months:**
   \[
   \text{Total Downloads} = \text{First Month Downloads} + \text{Second Month Downloads} + \text{Third Month Downloads}

The total number of downloads over the three months is \(\boxed{366}\)."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts:
- Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
- Each dozen of donuts costs $68.
- Therefore, the cost of the donuts is \(3 \times 68 = 204\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:
- Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
- Each dozen of mini cupcakes costs $80.
- Therefore, the cost of the mini cupcakes is \(2 \times 80 = 160\) dollars.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes:
- Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
- Each dozen of mini cheesecakes costs $55.
- Therefore, the cost of the mini cheesecakes is \(6 \times 55 = 330\) dollars.

Now, we add up the costs of all the pastries to find the total cost:
- Total cost = cost of donuts + cost of mini cupcakes + cost of mini cheesecakes
- Total cost = 204 + 160 + 330 = 694 dollars.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money from the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point at which this profit becomes positive.

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:
- Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons.
- Each lemon is sold for $1.5.
- Therefore, the annual revenue from lemons is \(7 \times 1.5 = 10.5\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the annual cost of watering and feeding the tree:
- The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.

Now, we can determine the net profit each year by subtracting the annual cost from the annual revenue:
- Net profit per year = Annual revenue - Annual cost
- Net profit per year = \(10.5 - 3 = 7.5\) dollars.

Since the initial cost to plant the tree is $90, we need to find out how many years it will take for the net profit to cover this initial cost.

Let \(n\) be the number of years it takes to start earning money. The total net profit after \(n\) years is:
- Total net profit after \(n\) years = \(7.5 \times n\).

We need this total net profit to be at least equal to the initial cost of $90:
- \(7.5 \times n \geq 90\).

Solving for \(n\):
- \(n \geq \frac{90}{7.5} = 12\).

Therefore, it will take at least 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

The final numerical answer is:
12"
"Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had as \( x \).

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \).

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \).

3. She then sold half of what was left at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \). The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \).

We know that after these sales, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

Let's simplify the equation step by step:

\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2x}{3} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{x}{3} + 1 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{2x - x}{3} - 1 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{x}{3} = 6 \]
\[ x = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{18}

"First, let's calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we have:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after those who enrolled in contemporary dance have been accounted for:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Now, 25% of these remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

The rest of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance. To find out how many students that is, we subtract the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance from the remaining students:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of students in hip-hop dance}}{\text{Total number of students}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.60 \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the entire students that enrolled in hip-hop dance is:

\[ 60\% \]"
"To determine which purchase plan maximizes profit, we need to calculate the future value of each item based on the expected market growth and then compare the profit from each plan.

First, let's calculate the future value of the jewelry:
- Current value of jewelry: $5,000
- Expected growth rate: 2.5%

\[
\text{Future value of jewelry} = 5000 \times (1 + 0.025) = 5000 \times 1.025 = 5125
\]

Next, let's calculate the future value of the electronic gadgets:
- Current value of electronic gadgets: $8,000
- Expected growth rate: 1.2%

\[
\text{Future value of electronic gadgets} = 8000 \times (1 + 0.012) = 8000 \times 1.012 = 8096
\]

Now, we calculate the profit for each plan:
- Profit from jewelry: Future value of jewelry - Current value of jewelry
\[
\text{Profit from jewelry} = 5125 - 5000 = 125
\]

- Profit from electronic gadgets: Future value of electronic gadgets - Current value of electronic gadgets
\[
\text{Profit from electronic gadgets} = 8096 - 8000 = 96
\]

Comparing the profits:
- Profit from jewelry: $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets: $96

The merchant would maximize profit by choosing to purchase the jewelry, which would yield a profit of $125. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{125}

"To determine the total distance covered by each train over the two days, we need to add the distances traveled in both directions.

1. The first day, the train travels 80 miles west.
2. The second day, the train travels 150 miles north.

The total distance covered by each train is the sum of these two distances:
\[ 80 \text{ miles} + 150 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the distance covered by each train in the two days is:
\[ \boxed{230} \]"
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to break down her earnings from both teaching and coaching.

First, let's calculate her annual earnings from teaching:
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual teaching hours = 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year
Annual teaching earnings = 1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her annual earnings from coaching:
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual coaching hours = 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year
Annual coaching earnings = 750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year

Now, we add her annual teaching earnings and annual coaching earnings to get her total annual salary:
Total annual salary = Annual teaching earnings + Annual coaching earnings
Total annual salary = $35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

The final numerical answer is $57,500."

"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time Marissa has already spent hiking.
2. Determine the total distance she still needs to cover.
3. Calculate the required speed for the remaining distance to achieve the desired average speed.

First, let's calculate the total time Marissa has already spent hiking:
- She took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles.
- She took another 1 hour to walk the next 2 miles.
So, the total time spent so far is \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours.

Next, we need to determine the total distance she still needs to cover:
- The total trail length is 12 miles.
- She has already walked \(4 + 2 = 6\) miles.
So, the remaining distance is \(12 - 6 = 6\) miles.

Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour. To find the required speed for the remaining distance, we use the formula for average speed:
\[ \text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} \]

Let \(v\) be the required speed for the remaining 6 miles. The total time for the hike will be the sum of the time already spent and the time to cover the remaining distance:
\[ \text{Total time} = 2 + \frac{6}{v} \]

We want the average speed to be 4 miles per hour:
\[ 4 = \frac{12}{2 + \frac{6}{v}} \]

Solving for \(v\):
\[ 4 = \frac{12}{2 + \frac{6}{v}} \]
\[ 4 \left(2 + \frac{6}{v}\right) = 12 \]
\[ 8 + \frac{24}{v} = 12 \]
\[ \frac{24}{v} = 4 \]
\[ v = \frac{24}{4} \]
\[ v = 6 \]

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles at a speed of 6 miles per hour to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire hike.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \]"
"First, let's determine the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink. Since two-thirds of the orange drink is water, we calculate:

\[
\text{Water in orange drink} = \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters}
\]

Next, let's determine the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since three-fifths of the pineapple drink is water, we calculate:

\[
\text{Water in pineapple drink} = \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = \frac{45}{5} = 9 \text{ liters}
\]

After spilling one liter of the orange drink, the amount of orange drink remaining is:

\[
10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters}
\]

The total volume of the mixture after adding the remaining orange drink to the pineapple drink is:

\[
9 + 15 = 24 \text{ liters}
\]

The total amount of water in the mixture is the sum of the water from the orange drink and the pineapple drink:

\[
\frac{20}{3} + 9 = \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3} \approx 15.67 \text{ liters}
\]

Therefore, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{47}{3}}

"To find the original price of the book, we need to understand that Kyle paid 75% of the original price (since he got a 25% discount). Let's denote the original price by \( P \). Therefore, we have:

\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we need to solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's perform the division:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was \( 26 \).

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 26 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered except for the boxes of pizza.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
The cost of 4 apples is \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Adding these together gives:
\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\] dollars.

Marie paid a total of $50. If we subtract the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples from the total amount paid, we can find out how much she spent on the boxes of pizza:
\[50 - 33 = 17\] dollars.

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, we can determine the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered by dividing the amount spent on pizza by the cost per box:
\[17 \div 8.50 = 2\] boxes.

Therefore, the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"To find out how much Mishka spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of each type of clothing item and then sum them up.

The cost of the shorts is:
\[ 3 \text{ pairs} \times \$16.50 \text{ per pair} = 3 \times 16.50 = \$49.50 \]

The cost of the pants is:
\[ 3 \text{ pairs} \times \$22.50 \text{ per pair} = 3 \times 22.50 = \$67.50 \]

The cost of the shoes is:
\[ 3 \text{ pairs} \times \$42 \text{ per pair} = 3 \times 42 = \$126 \]

Now, we sum up the costs of all the items:
\[ \$49.50 + \$67.50 + \$126 = \$243 \]

So, Mishka spent a total of:
\[ \$243 \]"
"To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of servings she will consume and then find out the total cost based on the price per carton.

First, calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days:
\[ \text{Total servings} = 60 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ serving/day} = 60 \text{ servings} \]

Next, determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need. Since each carton contains 15 servings:
\[ \text{Number of cartons} = \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

Now, calculate the total cost for 4 cartons of ice cream:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 4 \text{ cartons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to calculate the distance from his first stop to his second stop.

Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, so the distance from the start to his first stop is 20 miles.

His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip is 60 miles, the distance to his second stop is:
\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \text{ miles} \]

The distance between his first and second stops is the difference between the distance to his second stop and the distance to his first stop:
\[ 45 - 20 = 25 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the number of miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops is:

"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

The cost of the first pair of high heels is $33. The cost of the second pair of high heels is twice as much as the first pair, so it is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

So, the cost of the boots is \( 104 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 104 \]"
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the ages of Darrell and Allen in terms of a variable. Let Darrell's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a positive integer. According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

To find the value of \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen. Darrell's age is \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\) and Allen's age is \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\).

Next, we need to find Allen's age 10 years from now. Adding 10 years to Allen's current age, we get:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"To find the average guess, we first need to determine each friend's guess and then calculate the average.

1. The first friend's guess is 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half of the first friend's guess:
   \[
   \text{Second friend's guess} = \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60
   \]
3. The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess:
   \[
   \text{Third friend's guess} = 80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100
   \]

Now, we calculate the average of these guesses:
\[
\text{Average guess} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
80

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these pieces of information as equations:
\[ G + S = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins \( S \) is 40, we can find the number of gold coins \( G \) using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 70 \]"
"First, let's determine how many jewels Aaron has. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Since Raymond has 40 jewels, we can calculate half of Raymond's jewels as follows:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Now, we add 5 to this number to find out how many jewels Aaron has:

\[
20 + 5 = 25
\]

Next, we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. The problem states that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Since Aaron has 25 jewels, we subtract 2 from this number to find out how many jewels Siobhan has:

\[
25 - 2 = 23
\]

Therefore, the number of jewels Siobhan has is:

"To determine how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
2. Determine how many sets of 4 yogurts are needed to meet this number.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the price per set.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.**
Terry eats 2 yogurts a day.
\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many sets of 4 yogurts are needed.**
\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost.**
Each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00.
\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times 5 \text{ dollars/set} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days is:
\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John makes from selling his lego sets. He has 13 lego sets and sells each for $15.

\[
13 \text{ lego sets} \times 15 \text{ dollars/lego set} = 195 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, let's determine how much money John spends on the video games. He buys 8 video games for $20 each.

\[
8 \text{ video games} \times 20 \text{ dollars/video game} = 160 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we can find out how much money John has left after buying the video games. We know he has $5 left after these purchases.

\[
195 \text{ dollars} - 160 \text{ dollars} = 35 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since the problem states that John has $5 left after buying the video games, we can verify that the remaining $5 is indeed the difference between the money he made from selling the lego sets and the money he spent on the video games.

Finally, we need to determine how many lego sets John still has. Since he sold all 13 lego sets, he does not have any lego sets left.

\[
\text{Number of lego sets left} = 13 - 13 = 0
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{0}

"To find John's running speed, we first need to determine the total distance he runs in those 3 days and then divide that by the total time he spends running.

John runs 3 days a week, with the first day he runs 3 hours and the other two days he runs half as much, which is 1.5 hours each day.

So, the total distance he runs in those 3 days is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} + 1.5 \text{ hours/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

The total time he spends running in those 3 days is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, to find his running speed, we divide the total distance by the total time:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how far Dana can travel in six hours given her running and walking speeds.

First, let's find Dana's walking speed. We know that Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, and this speed is half of her running speed. Therefore, her running speed is:
\[ \text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 3 \text{ miles per hour} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine how much time Dana spends running and walking in six hours. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. So, the time spent running is:
\[ \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]
And the time spent walking is:
\[ \text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the distance she covers while running and walking. The distance covered while running is:
\[ \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time running} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]
The distance covered while walking is:
\[ \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time walking} \]
Since her walking speed is the same as her skipping speed, which is 3 miles per hour, the distance walking is:
\[ \text{Distance walking} = 3 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

The total distance Dana can travel in six hours is the sum of the distances covered while running and walking:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance walking} = 12 \text{ miles} + 12 \text{ miles} = 24 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{24} \]"

"First, let's determine how far Polly can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone. We know that without the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet. When holding the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther. Therefore, the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone is:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's breath can reach up to 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance Polly can throw the javelin:

\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 200 \]"

"First, let's determine the number of calories left for the day. The daily calorie target is 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories. Therefore, the remaining calories you can consume are:

\[ 2000 - 1800 = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories are in one serving of the bag of chips. According to the nutritional info, one serving has 250 calories.

Now, we need to determine how many servings are in a 300g bag of chips. The bag has 5 servings.

To find out how many grams of chips you can eat with the remaining 200 calories, we first calculate the number of calories per gram of chips. Since 5 servings of 250 calories each make up the total calories in the bag, the total calories in the bag are:

\[ 5 \times 250 = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

The number of calories per gram is:

\[ \frac{1250 \text{ calories}}{300 \text{ grams}} = \frac{1250}{300} \approx 4.17 \text{ calories per gram} \]

Now, we need to find out how many grams of chips correspond to 200 calories:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{4.17 \text{ calories per gram}} \approx 47.94 \text{ grams} \]

Therefore, the number of grams you can eat is approximately:

\[ 47.94 \text{ grams} \]

"First, let's determine the cost of making the candles. Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax and wicks for every 10 candles. For 20 candles, he will need 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks. The cost for 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks is:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pound} = \$20.00 \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles at $2.00 each:

\[ 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00 \text{ per candle} = \$40.00 \]

Now, we can find the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00 \]

So, the net profit if Charlie makes and sells 20 candles is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of articles written on each day.
2. Calculate the total number of hours spent writing articles over the three days.

**Step 1: Determine the number of articles written on each day.**

- **Monday:** Meredith wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday:** She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. Therefore, the number of articles on Tuesday is:
  \[
  5 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 5 \right) = 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ articles}
  \]
- **Wednesday:** She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of articles on Wednesday is:
  \[
  2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ articles}
  \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of hours spent writing articles over the three days.**

- Each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write about.
- Total articles written over the three days:

The total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days is \(\boxed{104}\)."
"To determine how many Post-it notes were in the package that Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of Post-it notes used at work.
2. Determine the initial number of Post-it notes before the purchase.
3. Calculate the number of Post-it notes purchased.
4. Sum the initial number of Post-it notes and the number of Post-it notes purchased to find the total number in the package.

First, Candice used 220 Post-it notes at work. She had 23 Post-it notes remaining after placing them on the coffee cups. Therefore, the total number of Post-it notes she had before leaving the store was:
\[ 220 + 23 = 243 \]

Initially, she had 80 Post-it notes in her purse. Let \( x \) be the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased. The total number of Post-it notes she had before leaving the store is the sum of the initial number of Post-it notes and the number of Post-it notes purchased:
\[ 80 + x = 243 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = 243 - 80 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

Thus, the number of Post-it notes in the package that she purchased is:

"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Given that each blue tie costs $40 and he spent a total of $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of each red tie. Since red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, the cost of each red tie is:

\[ \text{Cost per red tie} = \text{Cost per blue tie} + 0.5 \times \text{Cost per blue tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60 \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

Finally, the total amount John spent on ties is the sum of the cost of the blue ties and the cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total spent on ties} = \text{Total spent on blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

Next, we need to find out how many units are occupied. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is:

\[ 120 \text{ units} \times \frac{3}{4} = 90 \text{ units} \]

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

\[ 120 \text{ units} - 90 \text{ units} = 30 \text{ units} \]

So, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is:

\[ 30 \]"
"To determine how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, and he removes 30 comic books.

\[ \text{Total weight of comic books} = 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. So, the remaining weight that needs to be removed is:

\[ \text{Remaining weight to be removed} = 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[ \text{Number of toys to be removed} = \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has.

First, we know that the two house cats, Patchy and Trixie, have had kittens. According to the information provided:
- Patchy has had thrice the number of adopted kittens.
- Trixie has had 12 kittens.

Let's denote the number of adopted kittens as \( x \). Therefore, Patchy has had \( 3x \) kittens.

Given that Trixie has had 12 kittens, we can set up the equation:
\[ 3x = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

So, Patchy has had \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) kittens.

Now, we add the number of adopted kittens to the number of kittens from the house cats:
- Adopted kittens: 7
- Kittens from Patchy: 12
- Kittens from Trixie: 12

Total number of kittens:

\[ 500 + 800 = 1300 \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost of insurance, which is 10% of the total cost of the brooch. We find 10% of $1300 by multiplying $1300 by 0.10:

\[ 1300 \times 0.10 = 130 \]

Now, we add the cost of insurance to the total cost of the brooch to find the final amount Janet paid:

\[ 1300 + 130 = 1430 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1430 \]"
"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of working, we need to consider the two different phases of her pension calculation: the first 20 years and the next 10 years.

1. **First 20 years:**
   - Marcy earns a fixed annual pension of $50,000.
   - For 20 years, the total pension amount is:
     \[
     20 \times 50,000 = 1,000,000
     \]

2. **Next 10 years:**
   - Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.
   - The value of the pension at the start of the 21st year is $1,000,000.
   - The annual pension for the next 10 years is 5% of $1,000,000:
     \[
     0.05 \times 1,000,000 = 50,000
     \]

Since Marcy quits after 30 years, she will receive the pension for the next 10 years at the 5% rate. Therefore, her annual pension after 30 years will be:

\[
\boxed{50,000}
\]"
"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payment into two halves of the year and then sum them up.

1. **First Half of the Year:**
   - The streaming service charges $140 per month.
   - There are 6 months in the first half of the year.
   - Total cost for the first half: \( 140 \times 6 = 840 \) dollars.

2. **Second Half of the Year:**
   - The service charges 10% less than the initial amount.
   - The reduced monthly charge: \( 140 - (140 \times 0.10) = 140 - 14 = 126 \) dollars.
   - There are also 6 months in the second half of the year.
   - Total cost for the second half: \( 126 \times 6 = 756 \) dollars.

3. **Total Cost for the Year:**
   - Sum of the costs for both halves: \( 840 + 756 = 1596 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is **1596 dollars**."
"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to calculate how much gas she has left in her tank after her 100-mile trip. Since she put in 4 gallons to refill her 12-gallon tank, she currently has:

\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ gallons} \]

"To calculate the total amount Shiela will pay each month for 3 months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the cell phones before interest.
2. Calculate the interest on the total cost.
3. Add the interest to the total cost to get the total amount to be paid.
4. Divide the total amount by 3 to find out how much she will pay each month.

Let's start with step 1:
- Shiela bought 5 cell phones at $150 each.
- Total cost before interest = 5 * $150 = $750.

Next, step 2:
- The interest rate is 2% per unit.
- Interest on one cell phone = 2% of $150 = 0.02 * $150 = $3.
- Total interest for 5 cell phones = 5 * $3 = $15.

Now, step 3:
- Total amount to be paid = Total cost before interest + Total interest = $750 + $15 = $765.

"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food required for the first 180 days and then for the rest of the puppy's life within the first year.

First, calculate the amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days:
\[ 1 \text{ cup/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to determine how many days are left in the first year after the first 180 days. Since there are 365 days in a year:
\[ 365 \text{ days} - 180 \text{ days} = 185 \text{ days} \]

Now, calculate the amount of dog food needed for the remaining 185 days:
\[ 2 \text{ cups/day} \times 185 \text{ days} = 370 \text{ cups} \]

Add the amounts of dog food needed for the first 180 days and the remaining 185 days to find the total amount of dog food used in the first year:
\[ 180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups} \]

Finally, determine how many bags of dog food are needed. Each bag contains 110 cups:

"First, let's determine how much laundry Sarah does. According to the problem, Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.

Next, we need to find out how much laundry David does. The problem states that Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. Therefore, we can calculate the amount of laundry David does by dividing the amount Sarah does by 4:

\[
\text{Laundry done by David} = \frac{400 \text{ pounds}}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to find out how much laundry Raymond does. The problem states that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. Therefore, we can calculate the amount of laundry Raymond does by dividing the amount Sarah does by 2:

\[
\text{Laundry done by Raymond} = \frac{400 \text{ pounds}}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we subtract the amount of laundry David does from the amount of laundry Raymond does:

\[
\text{Difference} = 200 \text{ pounds} - 100 \text{ pounds} = 100 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is:

"To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in both package sizes and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost if Vincent buys the flowers in packages of 3:
- Each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50.
- To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs 6 packages of 3 flowers (since \(18 \div 3 = 6\)).
- The total cost for 18 flowers in packages of 3 is \(6 \times 2.50 = 15.00\).

Next, let's calculate the cost if Vincent buys the flowers in packages of 2:
- Each package of 2 flowers costs $1.00.
- To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs 9 packages of 2 flowers (since \(18 \div 2 = 9\)).
- The total cost for 18 flowers in packages of 2 is \(9 \times 1.00 = 9.00\).

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two options:
- The cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 is $9.00.
- The cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 is $15.00.
- The savings by buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 is \(15.00 - 9.00 = 6.00\).

"Let's denote the number of games they lost as \( L \). According to the problem, the number of games they won is \( L + 8 \). The total number of games played is the sum of the games won and the games lost, which is given as 22. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ L + (L + 8) = 22 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Next, we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( L \):

\[ 2L = 14 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( L \):

\[ L = 7 \]

So, the number of games they lost is 7. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is:

\[ 7 + 8 = 15 \]

Thus, the number of games they won is \(\boxed{15}\)."

"To solve this problem, let's define the ages of the kids using variables based on the information given:

- Let \( J \) be Jackson's age.
- Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Amy's age is \( J + 5 \).
- Amy is also 2 years younger than Corey, so Corey's age is \( J + 5 + 2 = J + 7 \).
- James is 10 years old and 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey's age is \( 10 + 1 = 11 \).

Since Corey's age is 11, we can set up the equation:
\[ J + 7 = 11 \]

Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 11 - 7 \]
\[ J = 4 \]

So, Jackson is 4 years old.

   The number of dogs is given as 60.

2. **Determine the number of cats:**
   Since there are two cats for every dog, the number of cats can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Number of cats} = 2 \times \text{Number of dogs} = 2 \times 60 = 120
   \]

3. **Calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:**
   \[
   \text{Combined number of dogs and cats} = \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of cats} = 60 + 120 = 180
   \]

4. **Determine the number of rabbits:**
   The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. Therefore:
   \[
   \text{Number of rabbits} = \text{Combined number of dogs and cats} - 12 = 180 - 12 = 168
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of pets:**
   \[
   \text{Total number of pets} = \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of cats} + \text{Number of rabbits} = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348
   \]

The total number of pets in the neighborhood is **348**."
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in Grade 5.

Given that 2/5 of the 200 students are boys, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:
\[ \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

Since the rest of the students are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. Given that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout, we can calculate the number of girls in the girl scout as follows:
\[ \text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[ \text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 40 \]"
"First, we need to determine how many hours James slept. Since James slept only \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what Harry slept, we calculate:

\[ \text{Hours James slept} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we find the difference in the number of hours Harry slept compared to James:

\[ \text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the volume of tomatoes before cooking.
2. Calculate the number of tomatoes based on the volume before cooking.

First, we know that the final volume of the sauce is 32 ounces, and this volume is half the volume of the tomatoes before cooking. Therefore, the volume of the tomatoes before cooking was:
\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we know that each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes. To find out how many 16-ounce cans were used, we divide the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of one can:
\[ \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/can}} = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes used is:
\[ 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes/can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Thus, the number of tomatoes Freda used is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Initially, there were 30 cars on the motorway.
- 5 cars exited the motorway, so the number of cars remaining on the motorway after the exits is \(30 - 5 = 25\) cars.
- In the first 15 minutes, some cars drove through the traffic jam.
- In the remaining 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through the traffic jam.
- The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as \(x\). Therefore, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \(x + 20\).

Since the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is also equal to the number of cars remaining on the motorway after the exits, we have:
\[x + 20 = 25\]

To find \(x\), we solve the equation:
\[x = 25 - 20\]
\[x = 5\]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}

"First, let's calculate the total number of potted plants Mary currently has. She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so:

\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Mary received 18 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery, so the total number of potted plants she has now is:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants} \]

Mary plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family tomorrow. Therefore, she will give away:

\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Subtracting the number of plants she will give away from the total number of plants she currently has:

\[ 98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

So, the final number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:

\[ 58 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of doorbell rings made by all four friends.

First, we know the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. Therefore, the third friend pressed the doorbell:
\[ 60 + 10 = 70 \text{ times} \]

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times. Therefore, the second friend pressed the doorbell:
\[ 20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25 \text{ times} \]

The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

Now, we sum up all the doorbell rings:
\[ 20 \text{ (first friend)} + 25 \text{ (second friend)} + 70 \text{ (third friend)} + 60 \text{ (fourth friend)} = 175 \]

Thus, the total number of doorbell rings is:
\[ \boxed{175} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of pages Solo needs to read:

- Science: 4 pages
- Social Studies: 20 pages
- History: 7 pages
- Geography: 8 pages

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday. Therefore, the remaining pages he needs to read are:

Remaining pages = Total pages - Pages read on Monday
Remaining pages = 39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read, on average, in one day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days left:

Pages per day = Remaining pages / Number of days left
Pages per day = 24 / 4 = 6 pages

So, Solo needs to read, on average, 6 pages per day."
"To calculate the number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to break down his water consumption by weekdays and weekends.

John drinks water with his meals every weekday (Monday through Friday). Assuming he drinks one glass of water with each meal, he drinks 5 glasses of water per weekday.

So, for 5 weekdays, he drinks:
\[ 5 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 25 \text{ glasses} \]

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he drinks a soda with dinner instead of water. Therefore, he drinks 0 glasses of water on each of the weekend days.

So, for 2 weekend days, he drinks:
\[ 0 \text{ glasses/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 0 \text{ glasses} \]

Adding the glasses of water he drinks during the weekdays and the weekend, we get:
\[ 25 \text{ glasses} + 0 \text{ glasses} = 25 \text{ glasses} \]

Thus, the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is:
\[ 25 \]"
"To determine how many minutes it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance the fog bank needs to cover.
2. Determine the rate at which the fog bank covers the city.
3. Calculate the total time required to cover the entire city.

First, the total distance the fog bank needs to cover is the length of the city, which is 42 miles.

Next, we know that the fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. Therefore, the rate of coverage is:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{3 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

To find out how long it will take to cover 42 miles, we use the rate:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{\frac{3 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} = 42 \times \frac{10}{3} = 140 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city is 140 minutes.

2. Calculate how many pieces are left after Poppy places her pieces.
3. Determine how many pieces her mom places on the board.
4. Calculate how many pieces are left after her mom places her pieces.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Poppy places a quarter of the 1000 pieces on the board:
   \[
   \text{Pieces placed by Poppy} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250
   \]

2. Calculate the number of pieces left after Poppy places her pieces:
   \[
   \text{Pieces left after Poppy} = 1000 - 250 = 750
   \]

3. Her mom places a third of the remaining pieces on the board:
   \[
   \text{Pieces placed by mom} = \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250
   \]

4. Calculate the number of pieces left after her mom places her pieces:
   \[
   \text{Pieces left after mom} = 750 - 250 = 500

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to determine the inner dimensions of a single box and then calculate its volume. After that, we can multiply by 3 to get the total volume.

The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, the inner dimensions of each box are:
- Length: \(5 - 2 \times 1 = 3\) inches
- Width: \(6 - 2 \times 1 = 4\) inches
- Height: \(4 - 2 \times 1 = 2\) inches

The volume of one inner box is:
\[ \text{Volume of one box} = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume is:
\[ \text{Total inner volume} = 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ cubic inches} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we can first calculate the total hours he watched TV from Monday to Friday and then subtract the hours he watched on the other days.

From Monday to Tuesday, he watched:
\[ 1 \text{ hour/night} \times 2 \text{ nights} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

On Wednesday, he watched:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \]

On Thursday, he watched:
\[ 1 \text{ hour} + 0.5 \text{ hours} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \]

On Friday, he watched:
\[ 1 \text{ hour/episode} \times 2 \text{ episodes} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we sum up the hours watched from Monday to Friday:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} + 0.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. Therefore, the hours he watched on Wednesday are:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} - 6 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is:
\[ \frac{1 \text{ hour}}{0.5 \text{ hours/episode}} = 2 \text{ episodes} \]

So, the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday is:

"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry intended to bake as \( x \). According to the problem, he actually baked twice as many as he intended, plus 15 more cookies. This can be expressed as:
\[ x + 15 \]

After baking, he drops 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has left is:
\[ (x + 15) - 5 = x + 10 \]

We are given that after dropping 5 cookies, he has a total of 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x + 10 = 110 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 110 - 10 \]
\[ x = 100 \]

Thus, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas without any cashback:

\[ \text{Cost per gallon} = \$3.00 \]
\[ \text{Number of gallons} = 10 \]
\[ \text{Total cost without cashback} = 3.00 \times 10 = \$30.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cashback received for 10 gallons:

\[ \text{Cashback per gallon} = \$0.20 \]
\[ \text{Total cashback} = 0.20 \times 10 = \$2.00 \]

Now, let's subtract the total cashback from the total cost to find the final amount after cashback:

\[ \text{Final amount} = \$30.00 - \$2.00 = \$28.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$28.00 \]"
"To find the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we first need to calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups each of them ate.

For Beatrice:
- The width of her fruit roll-up is 2 roll-ups.
- The length of her fruit roll-up is 24 roll-ups.
- Therefore, the total number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice ate is \(2 \times 24 = 48\).

For Marcell:
- The width of his fruit roll-up is 3 roll-ups.
- The length of his fruit roll-up is 14 roll-ups.
- Therefore, the total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell ate is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

Next, we find the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by both:
- Total number of fruit roll-ups = \(48 + 42 = 90\).

To find the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by both, we divide the total number of fruit roll-ups by 2:
- Average number of fruit roll-ups = \(\frac{90}{2} = 45\).

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the speed at which Julia rows the boat. It takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Therefore, her speed is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet per second} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes her to row the entire 64 seconds distance to the shore:

\[ \text{Time to row 64 seconds} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds per 20 feet}} = 4 \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. To find out how much water the boat took on during the entire 80 feet row, we can set up the following proportion:

\[ \text{Water taken on} = \left( \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 80 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the amount of water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore is:

"To solve this problem, we need to work through the relationships given step by step.

1. **Determine the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold:**
   - Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
   - Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
   - Let \( B \) be the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold.
   - Therefore, \( 1800 = 6B \).
   - Solving for \( B \):
     \[
     B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300
     \]
   - So, Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs.

2. **Determine the number of birds in Jamal's photograph:**
   - The maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold (300) is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph.
   - Let \( N \) be the number of birds in Jamal's photograph.
   - Therefore, \( 300 = 50N \).
   - Solving for \( N \):
     \[
     N = \frac{300}{50} = 6
     \]
   - So, there are 6 birds in Jamal's photograph.

3. **Determine the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph:**
   - Jamal's photograph is of ducks at the zoo.
   - Since the photograph contains 6 birds, and assuming all birds are ducks (as no other type of bird is mentioned), the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is 6.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the leftover lumber Sasha has:

- Ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards cost $10 each, so the total cost for these boards is \(10 \times 10 = \$100\).
- Five 4 x 4 x 10 boards cost $16 each, so the total cost for these boards is \(5 \times 16 = \$80\).

The total cost of the leftover lumber is \(100 + 80 = \$180\).

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the leftover lumber:

- Ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards are sold at the same price, so the revenue from these boards is \(10 \times \text{price per board}\).
- Five 4 x 4 x 10 boards are sold at the same price, so the revenue from these boards is \(5 \times \text{price per board}\).

Since the question does not specify the selling price per board, we assume the selling price is the same as the original cost. Therefore, the total revenue is \(10 \times 10 + 5 \times 16 = 100 + 80 = \$180\).

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is \(180 - 180 = \$0\).

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the ratio and the total quantities used. The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total number of parts in the ratio is 7 + 13 = 20 parts.

Given that the total number of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water used is 120, we can determine how many teaspoons of sugar were used by calculating the fraction of the total that corresponds to the sugar part of the ratio.

The fraction of the total that is sugar is \(\frac{7}{20}\). Therefore, the number of teaspoons of sugar used is:
\[
\text{Number of teaspoons of sugar} = \frac{7}{20} \times 120
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:
\[
\frac{7}{20} \times 120 = \frac{7 \times 120}{20} = \frac{840}{20} = 42
\]

So, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used is:

\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles/container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

On the second day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. Therefore, the number of vehicles added on the second day is:
\[ 30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles} \]

Since each container has 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Lylah's salary four years ago.
2. Calculate Adrien's salary four years ago.
3. Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.
4. Calculate Lylah's salary four years later.
5. Sum the salaries of Adrien and Lylah four years later.

First, let's find Lylah's salary four years ago. We know that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. If Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, then:

\[ \text{Adrien's salary four years ago} = 1.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary four years ago} \]

\[ 40000 = 1.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary four years ago} \]

\[ \text{Lylah's salary four years ago} = \frac{40000}{1.30} \]

\[ \text{Lylah's salary four years ago} = 30769.23 \]

Next, we calculate Adrien's salary four years later. We know that Adrien's salary increased by 40% from four years ago:

\[ \text{Adrien's salary four years later} = 40000 \times 1.40 \]

\[ \text{Adrien's salary four years later} = 56000 \]

Now, we calculate Lylah's salary four years later. Since Adrien and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously, Lylah's salary also increased by 40% from four years ago:

\[ \text{Lylah's salary four years later} = 30769.23 \times 1.40 \]

\[ \text{Lylah's salary four years later} = 43076.92 \]

Finally, we sum the salaries of Adrien and Lylah four years later:

\[ \text{Total salary four years later} = 56000 + 43076.92 \]

\[ \text{Total salary four years later} = 99076.92 \]

Therefore, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is $99076.92."

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the first part where Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours, and the second part where she runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining time.

First, calculate the distance Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time}_1 = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, determine the remaining time after the first part of her run:

"Jennie puts stamps on one-third of the 60 letters needing stamps, which means she stamps \( \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \) letters.

This leaves \( 60 - 20 = 40 \) letters still needing stamps.

Since there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters, and we know that 20 of these were already stamped by Jennie, the number of letters that were in the pile when Jennie began is the total number of letters needing stamps minus the ones that were already stamped by Jennie.

So, the number of letters that were in the pile when Jennie began is \( 40 + 20 = 60 \).

Therefore, the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began is 20.

Her husband then gave her 5 more spoons, so she had \( x - 3 + 5 = x + 2 \) spoons.

We know that after receiving the spoons from her husband, Julia had a total of 12 spoons. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 12 - 2 \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, Julia originally bought 10 spoons.

The final numerical answer is:
10"
"Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. He bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, which means he bought 38 + 6 = 44 fish sausages. Therefore, the total number of sausages Dylan bought is 38 chicken sausages + 44 fish sausages = 82 sausages in all.

The final numerical answer is 82."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of each type of fruit and then calculate the total cost for the quantities Dillon is buying.

1. **Cost of a Pepper:**
   Given that each pepper costs $15.

2. **Cost of a Watermelon:**
   A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs.
   \[
   \text{Cost of a watermelon} = 3 \times \text{Cost of a pepper} = 3 \times 15 = 45 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of an Orange:**
   An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs.
   \[
   \text{Cost of an orange} = \text{Cost of a watermelon} - 5 = 45 - 5 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Total Cost Calculation:**
   - **Watermelons:**
     Dillon buys 4 watermelons.
     \[
     \text{Total cost for watermelons} = 4 \times \text{Cost of a watermelon} = 4 \times 45 = 180 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - **Peppers:**
     Dillon buys 20 peppers.
     \[
     \text{Total cost for peppers} = 20 \times \text{Cost of a pepper} = 20 \times 15 = 300 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - **Oranges:**
     Dillon buys 10 oranges.
     \[
     \text{Total cost for oranges} = 10 \times \text{Cost of an orange} = 10 \times 40 = 400 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Total Amount Spent:**
   \[
   \text{Total amount} = \text{Total cost for watermelons} + \text{Total cost for peppers} + \text{Total cost for oranges} = 180 + 300 + 400 = 880 \text{ dollars}
   \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the profit the hospital makes from these visits, we need to determine the revenue and the cost for each patient and then sum these over the number of patients seen in a day.

First, let's calculate the revenue from each patient:
- Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour, so each patient is seen for 24/60 = 0.4 hours.
- The hospital charges $200 per hour, so the revenue from each patient is $200 * 0.4 = $80.

Next, let's calculate the cost for each patient:
- Each patient is seen for 24 minutes, which is 0.4 hours.
- The doctors charge $150 per hour, so the cost for each patient is $150 * 0.4 = $60.

Now, let's calculate the profit from each patient:
- The profit from each patient is the revenue minus the cost, which is $80 - $60 = $20.

Finally, let's calculate the total profit for the hospital:
- The hospital sees 500 people a day.
- The profit from each patient is $20.
- Therefore, the total profit for the hospital is $20 * 500 = $10,000.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{10000}

"First, let's calculate the number of tickets Pam used. Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and then the luge 2 times. Each ride costs 6 tickets.

Tickets used by Pam for the roller coaster:
\[ 2 \text{ rides} \times 6 \text{ tickets/ride} = 12 \text{ tickets} \]

Tickets used by Pam for the luge:
\[ 2 \text{ rides} \times 6 \text{ tickets/ride} = 12 \text{ tickets} \]

Total tickets used by Pam:
\[ 12 \text{ tickets} + 12 \text{ tickets} = 24 \text{ tickets} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of tickets Fred used. Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and then the luge 2 times.

Tickets used by Fred for the roller coaster:
\[ 4 \text{ rides} \times 6 \text{ tickets/ride} = 24 \text{ tickets} \]

Tickets used by Fred for the luge:

"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many miles Walt walked on Tuesday.
2. Calculate the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday.
3. Subtract the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday from the total miles walked from Monday to Wednesday to find the miles walked on Wednesday.

First, we know that Walt walked 4 miles on Monday. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he did on Monday:
\[ \text{Miles walked on Tuesday} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday:
\[ \text{Total miles from Monday to Tuesday} = 4 + 24 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

We know the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. Therefore, the miles walked on Wednesday can be found by subtracting the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday from the total miles walked from Monday to Wednesday:
\[ \text{Miles walked on Wednesday} = 41 - 28 = 13 \text{ miles} \]

So, the number of miles Walt walked on Wednesday is:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Next, we need to find out how many video games Bobby has. According to the problem, Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian has. Since Brian now has 15 video games, we calculate 3 times that number:

\[ 3 \times 15 = 45 \]

Then, we subtract 5 from this number to find out how many video games Bobby has:

\[ 45 - 5 = 40 \]

So, Bobby has 40 video games. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate how many questions Mark could have completed in the given time for each test.

For the first test:
- Mark had 8 hours to complete the test.
- He completed 5 questions per hour.
- Therefore, the number of questions he could complete in 8 hours is \(8 \times 5 = 40\) questions.

For the second test:
- Mark had 6 hours to complete the test.
- He completed 5 questions per hour.
- Therefore, the number of questions he could complete in 6 hours is \(6 \times 5 = 30\) questions.

Now, let's determine how many questions he left incomplete for each test.

For the first test:
- The test had 75 questions.
- He completed 40 questions.
- Therefore, the number of questions he left incomplete is \(75 - 40 = 35\) questions.

For the second test:
- The test had 100 questions.
- He completed 30 questions.
- Therefore, the number of questions he left incomplete is \(100 - 30 = 70\) questions.

To find the total number of questions he left incomplete, we add the incomplete questions from both tests:
- Incomplete questions from the first test: 35
- Incomplete questions from the second test: 70
- Total incomplete questions: \(35 + 70 = 105\)

"First, we need to determine the number of semi-automatic cars. We know there are 20 cars in total, 12 of which are automatic and 4 are manual. The number of semi-automatic cars can be calculated by subtracting the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars:

\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = \text{Total cars} - \text{Automatic cars} - \text{Manual cars} \]
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 \]

Next, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total cars}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of the cars that are semi-automatic is 20%."
"Let's denote the number of queens as \( Q \), the number of baby bees as \( B \), and the number of worker bees as \( W \).

According to the problem:
1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so \( W = 2B \).
2. There are twice as many baby bees as queens, so \( B = 2Q \).

The total number of bees is 700, so we can write the equation:
\[ W + B + Q = 700 \]

Substituting \( W = 2B \) and \( B = 2Q \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 2B + B + Q = 700 \]
\[ 3B + Q = 700 \]

Since \( B = 2Q \), we can substitute \( B \) with \( 2Q \) in the equation:
\[ 3(2Q) + Q = 700 \]
\[ 6Q + Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees and worker bees:
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]
\[ W = 2B = 2 \times 200 = 400 \]

Therefore, the number of worker bees is \( 400 \).

"First, let's calculate the total cost of nonfood items before tax:

- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

Total cost of nonfood items = $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $15

Next, we calculate the tax on the nonfood items. The tax rate is 10%, so the tax amount is:

Tax amount = 10% of $15 = 0.10 * $15 = $1.50

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of the nonfood items to get the final cost:

Final cost = Total cost of nonfood items + Tax amount = $15 + $1.50 = $16.50

The final numerical answer is $16.50."

Therefore, the profit Lucas will make each week is $20."
"To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of harvests John can have in a year.
2. Determine the total number of pineapples harvested based on the number of harvests.

First, since John harvests his pineapples every 3 months, we need to find out how many 3-month periods there are in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests/year} \]

Next, we know that John has 100 pineapples per hectare and he has 10 hectares. Therefore, the total number of pineapples per harvest is:
\[ 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} \times 10 \text{ hectares} = 1000 \text{ pineapples/harvest} \]

Since John can harvest 1000 pineapples per harvest and he can do this 4 times in a year, the total number of pineapples he can harvest in a year is:
\[ 1000 \text{ pineapples/harvest} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year} \]

"To determine how many bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours, let's break down the information given:

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of 30 bees return to the hive, which is 15 bees.
3. In the following 6 hours, twice as many bees as those that left in the first 6 hours return, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.

Now, we need to calculate the number of bees that are in the hive at the end of the first 6 hours, before the last 6 hours. Initially, there are no bees in the hive. After 30 bees leave, there are 0 bees in the hive. Then, 15 bees return, so there are 15 bees in the hive. Finally, 60 bees return, so there are 15 + 60 = 75 bees in the hive at the start of the last 6 hours.

In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before returns to the hive. Since 30 bees left in the first 6 hours, all 30 bees that left will return in the last 6 hours.

Therefore, the number of bees that Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours is 30.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the initial number of french fries in the pack as \( x \).

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
4. After the pigeons, the number of fries left is \( x - 14 - 7 - 9 = x - 20 \).
5. The raccoon then ate two thirds of the remaining fries, so it ate \( \frac{2}{3}(x - 20) \) fries, leaving \( \frac{1}{3}(x - 20) \) fries.
6. An ant then ate the last remaining french fry, leaving 5 fries.

So, we have:
\[ \frac{1}{3}(x - 20) = 5 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x - 20 = 15 \]
\[ x = 35 \]

Therefore, the initial number of french fries in the pack was 35.

The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly class schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has three 1-hour classes each day. So, the total number of hours he spends on these days is:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ classes/day} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes each day. So, the total number of hours he spends on these days is:
\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ classes/day} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Adding the hours from both sets of days gives the total number of hours Kimo spends on classes each week:
\[ 9 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours/week} \]

Since there are 16 weeks in the semester, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:

"First, we need to convert all the lengths to the same unit for easier calculation. We will use inches for this problem.

Each roll is 4 inches long, and Bill bakes 300 rolls:
\[ 300 \text{ rolls} \times 4 \text{ inches/roll} = 1200 \text{ inches} \]

Each croissant is 6 inches long, and Bill bakes 120 croissants:
\[ 120 \text{ croissants} \times 6 \text{ inches/croissant} = 720 \text{ inches} \]

Each baguette is 2 feet long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is:
\[ 2 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 24 \text{ inches} \]
Bill bakes 60 baguettes:
\[ 60 \text{ baguettes} \times 24 \text{ inches/baguette} = 1440 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we add up the total length of all the baked goods in inches:
\[ 1200 \text{ inches} + 720 \text{ inches} + 1440 \text{ inches} = 3360 \text{ inches} \]

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[ \frac{3360 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 280 \text{ feet} \]

So, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is:
\[ \boxed{280} \]"
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order to last for 2 months, we first need to calculate the total number of bananas required by all the apes in one month and then multiply that by 2.

- Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
- Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
- Baboons need 100 bananas per month.

So, the total number of bananas needed per month is:
\[ 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 \text{ bananas per month} \]

For 2 months, the total number of bananas required is:
\[ 700 \times 2 = 1400 \text{ bananas} \]

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order \(\boxed{1400}\) bananas to last for 2 months."
"To determine how far Blake and Kelly each run, we need to calculate the total distance each of them covers.

First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs:
- Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field.
- Each round trip is 200 yards (100 yards out and 100 yards back).
- Therefore, the total distance Blake runs is \(15 \times 200 = 3000\) yards.

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs:
- Kelly runs back and forth once to the 40-yard line and back, which is a total of 80 yards.
- She does this 34 times.
- Therefore, the total distance Kelly runs is \(34 \times 80 = 2720\) yards.

Now, we compare the distances:
- Blake runs 3000 yards.
- Kelly runs 2720 yards.

The difference in the distance they run is:
\[ 3000 - 2720 = 280 \text{ yards} \]

The winner runs 280 yards farther than the loser. Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{280} \]"
"To calculate the total amount Raphael spent, we need to multiply the quantity of each item by its respective cost and then sum these amounts.

For the pens:
4 pens * $1.5 per pen = $6

2 notebooks * $4 per notebook = $8

For the rim of bond paper:
1 rim of bond paper * $20 per rim = $20

Now, we sum these amounts:
$6 (pens) + $8 (notebooks) + $20 (bond paper) = $34

Therefore, the total amount Raphael spent is $34."
"Initially, Finn sees 11 tadpoles swimming in the pond. Then, 6 tadpoles come out of hiding, so the number of tadpoles Finn can see increases to 11 + 6. After that, 2 tadpoles hide under a rock, so the number of tadpoles Finn can see decreases by 2.

Calculation:
11 + 6 - 2 = 15

Finn can see 15 tadpoles in the pond now."
"To find the water depth on Wednesday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the depth of the water on Tuesday.
2. Calculate the depth of the water on Wednesday based on the depth on Tuesday.

First, we know the depth of the water on Monday is 17 feet. On Tuesday, the depth increased by 7 feet:
\[ \text{Depth on Tuesday} = 17 + 7 = 24 \text{ feet} \]

Next, on Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday:
\[ \text{Depth on Wednesday} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ feet} \]

So, the tank’s water depth on Wednesday is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of each type of fish caught by Locsin:

- Starfish: Anakin caught 10 starfish, so Locsin caught \(10 - 5 = 5\) starfish.
- Sea horses: Anakin caught 6 sea horses, so Locsin caught \(6 - 3 = 3\) sea horses.
- Clownfish: Anakin caught 3 clownfish, so Locsin caught \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish.

Now, let's add up the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin:

- Total starfish: \(10 + 5 = 15\)
- Total sea horses: \(6 + 3 = 9\)
- Total clownfish: \(3 + 5 = 8\)

Finally, the total number of fish they caught is:
\[15 + 9 + 8 = 32\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the price increase step by step over the 36 months. The price increases by 20% every two months. Let's break it down:

1. **Initial Price**: $20
2. **Price after 2 months**: The price increases by 20% of $20.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 20 \times \frac{20}{100} = 4
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 20 + 4 = 24
   \]
3. **Price after 4 months**: The price increases by 20% of $24.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 24 \times \frac{20}{100} = 4.8
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 24 + 4.8 = 28.8
   \]
4. **Price after 6 months**: The price increases by 20% of $28.8.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 28.8 \times \frac{20}{100} = 5.76
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 28.8 + 5.76 = 34.56
   \]
5. **Price after 8 months**: The price increases by 20% of $34.56.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 34.56 \times \frac{20}{100} = 6.912
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 34.56 + 6.912 = 41.472
   \]
6. **Price after 10 months**: The price increases by 20% of $41.472.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 41.472 \times \frac{20}{100} = 8.2944
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 41.472 + 8.2944 = 49.7664
   \]
7. **Price after 12 months**: The price increases by 20% of $49.7664.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 49.7664 \times \frac{20}{100} = 9.95328
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 49.7664 + 9.95328 = 59.71968
   \]

We can see that the price increases by 20% every two months. To generalize, after \( n \) two-month periods, the price will be:
\[
\text{Price after } n \text{ two-month periods} = 20 \times (1.2)^n
\]

For 36 months, there are 18 two-month periods:
\[
\text{Price after 36 months} = 20 \times (1.2)^{18}
\]

Now, we calculate \( (1.2)^{18} \):
\[
(1.2)^{18} \approx 10.488
\]

Thus, the price after 36 months is:
\[
\text{Price after 36 months} = 20 \times 10.488 = 209.76
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{209.76}
\]"
"First, let's determine the cost of one red car. According to the problem, one red car costs $4.

Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and an action figure costs $5, the cost of 3 action figures is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]
Therefore, the doll costs $15.

Now, we know the cost of one red car is $4, and the doll costs $15. We need to find the total cost of all the toys:
- The cost of 5 red cars is:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \]
- The cost of 3 action figures is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]
- The cost of the doll is:
\[ 15 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost of all the toys:
\[ 20 + 15 + 15 = 50 \]

Thus, the total value of all the toys is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, we need to determine the amount of missed income Jackie would incur if she does her taxes herself. She would lose 3 hours of freelance work, and she earns $35 per hour from freelance work. Therefore, the missed income is calculated as follows:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of hiring an accountant. The accountant charges $90. To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the missed income:

\[ \$105 - \$90 = \$15 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the computer accessories Elvira bought:

- Screen: €157
- Keyboard and mouse: €74
- Scanner: €102
- Printer: €102

Total cost of accessories = €157 + €74 + €102 + €102 = €435

Elvira's total budget is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost of the accessories from her budget:

Money left for clothing = €1500 - €435 = €1065

So, the final numerical answer is:
€1065"
"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit to make 15 Spanish flans, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs required. Since each flan requires 3 eggs, we can find the total number of eggs needed by multiplying the number of flans by the number of eggs per flan:

\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we need to determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit to collect 45 eggs. Since she receives 9 eggs each time she babysits, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she receives per babysitting session:

\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysittings} \]

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit 5 times to collect the required 45 eggs. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{5}

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \). According to the problem, Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write the first equation as:
\[ S = 2B \]

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write the second equation as:
\[ (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \]
Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ B + S + 4 = 28 \]
Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get:
\[ B + S = 24 \]

Now we substitute the expression for \( S \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ B + 2B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's current age is 8, we can find Seth's current age using the first equation:
\[ S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is currently 16 years old. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To find out how much money Jimmy has, we can use the information given:

Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has. If Ethel has $8, we can calculate twice the amount Ethel has and then add $2 to it.

Twice the amount Ethel has is \(2 \times 8 = 16\).

Adding $2 to this amount gives us \(16 + 2 = 18\).

Therefore, Jimmy has $18.

The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to consider his daily walking distance and the days he walks that distance.

From Monday to Friday, he walks 20 miles each day. So for 5 days, he walks:
\[ 20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles} \]

On Saturday and Sunday, he walks 10 miles each day. So for 2 days, he walks:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Adding these together gives the total miles walked in a week:
\[ 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 120 \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of each item:
- The cost of the hat is $25.
- The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat, so it is \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.
- The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket. The average is calculated as \(\frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50\) dollars.

Now, we add up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform:
\[25 + 75 + 50 = 150\]

So, the total cost of each uniform is \(\boxed{150}\) dollars."
"To find the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to calculate the legs from each group of creatures separately and then sum them up.

The total number of legs Jake sees is:
\[ \boxed{1210} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the ages of Sally Two, Granny Red, and the other bird (Sally Four), and then sum these ages.

1. **Sally Thirtytwo's Age**: Given as 8 years old.
2. **Sally Four's Age**: The same as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. **Granny Red's Age**: Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four. Since Sally Four is 8 years old, Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. **Sally Two's Age**: Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. Since Granny Red is 16 years old, Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, we sum the ages of the four birds:
- Sally Two: 19 years
- Granny Red: 16 years
- Sally Four: 8 years
- The fourth bird (which is not specified but implied to be the same as the other three): 8 years

Total age = \(19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 51\)

The total age of the four birds is 51."
"To determine how much Jessica pays in a year if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we first need to calculate the total minimum monthly payments for all her debts.

The minimum monthly payments are:
- Student loans: $300
- Credit card: $200
- Mortgage: $500

The total minimum monthly payment is:
\[ 300 + 200 + 500 = 1000 \]

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. To find 50% more, we calculate 50% of the minimum monthly payment and add it to the minimum monthly payment:
\[ 1000 \times 0.50 = 500 \]
\[ 1000 + 500 = 1500 \]

So, Jessica pays $1500 per month. To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply her monthly payment by 12:
\[ 1500 \times 12 = 18000 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 18000 \]"
"To determine how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel and cut each potato and then multiply by the total number of potatoes.

First, let's calculate the time to peel and cut one potato:
- Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
- Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

Convert the time to peel one potato to seconds for easier calculation:
- 1.5 minutes = 1.5 * 60 seconds = 90 seconds

Now, add the time to peel and cut one potato:
- Total time for one potato = 90 seconds (peeling) + 5 seconds (cutting) = 95 seconds

Next, calculate the total time for 60 potatoes:
- Total time = 95 seconds/potato * 60 potatoes = 5700 seconds

Finally, convert the total time from seconds to minutes:
- 5700 seconds = 5700 / 60 minutes = 95 minutes

Thus, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes."
"First, let's determine the total revenue from selling lemonade. They sell 20 glasses per gallon at $0.50 per glass. Therefore, the revenue from selling one gallon of lemonade is:
\[ 20 \text{ glasses/gallon} \times \$0.50/\text{glass} = \$10/\text{gallon} \]

Given that their profit is $25, we can express the profit as the total revenue minus the total cost. Let \( x \) be the number of gallons they made. The total revenue from selling \( x \) gallons is:
\[ \$10x \]

The total cost for making \( x \) gallons is the cost of lemons and sugar. The cost of lemons is $3 per gallon and the cost of sugar is $2 per gallon. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ (\$3 + \$2)x = \$5x \]

The profit is given by the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ \$10x - \$5x = \$25 \]
\[ \$5x = \$25 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, they made 5 gallons of lemonade. The cost of lemons for 5 gallons is:
\[ \$3 \times 5 = \$15 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"

\[ 240 - 80 = 160 \]

We know that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. Therefore, the number of girls on the Chinese team can be found by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants:

\[ 160 - 60 = 100 \]

So, the number of girls on the Chinese team is 100."
"To determine how much money Zaid will have left after all his expenses and donations, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount spent on rent.
2. Calculate the amount spent on car fuel.
3. Determine the remaining amount after rent and car fuel.
4. Calculate the donation to charity.
5. Determine the remaining amount after the donation.
6. Subtract the amounts given to his daughter and wife from the remaining amount.

First, let's calculate the amount spent on rent:
\[ \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, calculate the amount spent on car fuel:
\[ \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, determine the remaining amount after rent and car fuel:
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars} \]

Calculate the donation to charity, which is half of the remaining amount:
\[ \text{Charity donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars} \]

Determine the remaining amount after the donation:
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the amounts given to his daughter and wife from the remaining amount:

"To determine the number of votes the loser received, we first need to calculate the number of votes the winner received. The winner got \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total votes.

Given:
- Total number of students who voted = 80
- Fraction of votes the winner received = \( \frac{3}{4} \)

First, calculate the number of votes the winner received:
\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80
\]

Perform the multiplication:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 3 \times 20 = 60
\]

So, the winner received 60 votes. Since the total number of votes cast is 80, the number of votes the loser received is:

"Let's denote the number of white carnations Sandra ordered as \( w \).

From the information given:
1. The number of red roses ordered is four times the number of white carnations, so the number of red roses is \( 4w \).
2. The number of pink calla lilies ordered is 200, and this is five times the number of white carnations, so \( 200 = 5w \).

First, we solve for \( w \) using the equation \( 200 = 5w \):
\[
w = \frac{200}{5} = 40
\]

Now that we know \( w = 40 \), we can find the number of red roses:

   - Two years ago, Jan's age was \(30 - 2 = 28\).
   - Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time.
   - Half of Jan's age two years ago was \(\frac{28}{2} = 14\).
   - Therefore, Mark's age two years ago was \(14 + 5 = 19\).

2. **Determine Mark's current age:**
   - Since Mark was 19 two years ago, his current age is \(19 + 2 = 21\).

3. **Determine Jean's current age:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark.
   - Therefore, Jean's current age is \(21 + 2 = 23\).

"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 1600 meters relay race.

For the first team, each member runs their leg in 55 seconds. Since there are four members, the total time for the first team is:
\[ 55 \text{ seconds/member} \times 4 \text{ members} = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

For the second team, the first runner takes 60 seconds, the second runner takes 57 seconds (3 seconds faster than the first), the third runner takes 54 seconds (3 seconds faster than the second), and the fourth runner takes 51 seconds (3 seconds faster than the third). The total time for the second team is:
\[ 60 \text{ seconds} + 57 \text{ seconds} + 54 \text{ seconds} + 51 \text{ seconds} = 222 \text{ seconds} \]

The difference in time between the second team and the first team is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then compare them.

First, let's determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability \(P(\text{number} > 3)\) is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Next, let's determine the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is \(\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}\). Given that the first roll is even, the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also \(\frac{1}{2}\). Therefore, the probability \(P(\text{two even numbers in a row})\) is:
\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25
\]

Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. This is the difference in their probabilities expressed as a percentage:
\[
\text{Difference in probabilities} = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25
\]
To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
0.25 \times 100 = 25\%
\]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{25}

"Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as \( r \).

From the information given:
- There are 3 cages of rats, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is \( 3r \times 6 = 18r \).
- There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \).
- There are 20 pieces of straw given to the rabbits.

The total number of pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents is the sum of the pieces of straw given to the rats, the hamsters, and the rabbits. According to the problem, this total is 160 pieces of straw. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 18r + 50 + 20 = 160 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 18r + 70 = 160 \]
\[ 18r = 160 - 70 \]
\[ 18r = 90 \]
\[ r = \frac{90}{18} \]
\[ r = 5 \]

So, the number of rats in each cage is \( 5 \).

First, calculate the interest for one month:
\[ \text{Interest per month} = 100 \times \frac{2}{100} = 2 \]

Since the interest is compounded monthly, the total interest for 3 months is:
\[ \text{Total interest for 3 months} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

Adding the total interest to the initial debt gives the total amount Mandy should pay:
\[ \text{Total amount} = 100 + 6 = 106 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 106 \]"
"Let's denote the number of bags of wheat as \( n \).

The cost per bag includes the purchase price and the transportation cost, which is \( 20 + 2 = 22 \) dollars per bag.

The total cost for \( n \) bags is \( 22n \) dollars.

The selling price per bag is $30, so the total revenue from selling \( n \) bags is \( 30n \) dollars.

The trader made a total profit of $400, which means the total revenue minus the total cost equals $400. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 30n - 22n = 400 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 8n = 400 \]

To find \( n \), we divide both sides by 8:

\[ n = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food:

The cost of the tickets is $20.25.

The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, so:
\[ \text{Cost of food} = 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Next, we add the cost of the tickets and the cost of the food to find the total cost of the tickets and food:
\[ \text{Total cost of tickets and food} = 20.25 + 15.75 = 36.00 \]

They also spent $33 on each of the 2 rides, so the total cost for the rides is:
\[ \text{Total cost for rides} = 33 \times 2 = 66.00 \]

Now, we add the total cost of the tickets and food to the total cost for the rides to find the overall total cost:
\[ \text{Overall total cost} = 36.00 + 66.00 = 102.00 \]

Since they agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the overall total cost by 3:
\[ \text{Cost per person} = \frac{102.00}{3} = 34.00 \]

So, each of them paid:
\[ \boxed{34.00} \]"
"To determine the total number of peaches John collects, we need to calculate the product of the number of minutes he works and the number of peaches he collects per minute.

John works for 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total number of minutes he works is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

John collects 2 peaches per minute. Therefore, the total number of peaches he collects is:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \times 2 \text{ peaches/minute} = 360 \text{ peaches} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 360 \]"
"To determine how many pounds of insects the flock of ten ducks need per day, we start by calculating the total weekly requirement for the entire flock and then divide that by the number of days in a week.

The total weekly requirement for the ten ducks is:
\[ 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 35 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of insects are needed per day. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ \frac{35 \text{ pounds/week}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net increase in the number of trees Tom has each year and then apply the percentage of trees that die after 10 years.

1. **Net increase in trees per year**: Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees, so the net increase is \(10 - 2 = 8\) trees per year.

2. **Total increase in trees over 10 years**: Since the net increase is 8 trees per year, over 10 years, the total increase is \(8 \times 10 = 80\) trees.

3. **Total number of trees before any die**: Starting with 50 trees and adding the 80 trees over 10 years, the total number of trees before any die is \(50 + 80 = 130\) trees.

4. **Trees that die after 10 years**: 30% of the trees die, so the number of trees that die is \(0.30 \times 130 = 39\) trees.

5. **Number of trees left after the 30% die**: Subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees before they die, which is \(130 - 39 = 91\) trees.

Therefore, the number of trees Tom has left after 10 years is \(\boxed{91}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Placement on Friday:**
   - Sue's front yard starts with 18 pink plastic flamingos.

2. **Action on Saturday:**
   - The neighbors take back one third of the flamingos.
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
   - These 6 flamingos are taken back and painted white.
   - The number of flamingos left on Sue's front yard is \( 18 - 6 = 12 \).
   - The neighbors then put back the 6 white flamingos.
   - The total number of flamingos on Sue's front yard is now \( 12 + 6 = 18 \).

3. **Action on Sunday:**
   - The neighbors add another 18 pink plastic flamingos.
   - The total number of flamingos on Sue's front yard is now \( 18 + 18 = 36 \).

4. **Counting the Flamingos:**
   - Pink flamingos: 18
   - White flamingos: 6

5. **Difference Calculation:**
   - The number of pink flamingos minus the number of white flamingos is \( 18 - 6 = 12 \).

Therefore, at noon on Sunday, there are 12 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.

The final numerical answer is:

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \$10 \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of a pencil and an eraser combined:
- A pencil costs $1.20.
- An eraser costs $0.30.

So, the combined cost of a pencil and an eraser is:
\[ 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50 \]

Since a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined, a pen costs $1.50.

Now, to find the cost of 8 pens:
\[ 1.50 \times 8 = 12.00 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 12.00 \]"
"To determine how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we first need to calculate the total amount of carrots that will be distributed to the 40 restaurants.

Each restaurant receives 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. Therefore, the total amount of carrots distributed is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds/restaurant} \times 40 \text{ restaurants} = 80 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of carrots available is 200 pounds. To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we subtract the total amount distributed from the total amount available:
\[ 200 \text{ pounds} - 80 \text{ pounds} = 120 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To find the number of children in the city of Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

Total population = 23786
Number of men = 8417
Number of women = 9092

Number of children = Total population - (Number of men + Number of women)

Let's calculate the number of children:
Number of children = 23786 - (8417 + 9092)

First, add the number of men and women:
8417 + 9092 = 17509

Now, subtract this sum from the total population:
23786 - 17509 = 6277

Therefore, the number of children in Soda is 6277."
"To find out how many Pokemon cards Elaine has now, we need to calculate the number of cards she collected each month and then sum them up.

1. **First Month:**
   Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards. After a month, she collected three times that number.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ cards}
   \]
   So, after the first month, she has:
   \[
   20 + 60 = 80 \text{ cards}
   \]

2. **Second Month:**
   In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40 \text{ cards}
   \]
   So, after the second month, she has:
   \[
   80 + 40 = 120 \text{ cards}
   \]

3. **Third Month:**
   In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months.
   \[
   2 \times (60 + 40) = 2 \times 100 = 200 \text{ cards}
   \]
   So, after the third month, she has:
   \[
   120 + 200 = 320 \text{ cards}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now is:
\[
\boxed{320}

"First, let's determine how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher. Since he edits an equal number of sentences each week for both publishers and a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B.

Next, we calculate the payment from Publisher A. Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, the payment from Publisher A is:
\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

Since Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, Publisher B pays Mark:
\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10 \text{ cents/sentence} \]

Therefore, the payment from Publisher B is:
\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we add the payments from both publishers:
\[ 2500 \text{ cents} + 5000 \text{ cents} = 7500 \text{ cents} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{7500} \]"

"To calculate John's total earnings for the year after winning the award, we need to consider both the monetary reward and the salary increase.

First, let's calculate the salary increase:
- John's current weekly salary is $2000.
- The raise is 5% of his current salary.
- The raise amount is \( 2000 \times 0.05 = 100 \) dollars per week.

Next, we calculate his new weekly salary after the raise:
- New weekly salary = $2000 + $100 = $2100.

Now, we calculate his total earnings for the year:
- There are 52 weeks in a year.
- His total earnings from the raise over the year = $2100 \times 52 = $109,200.

Additionally, he received a one-time monetary reward of $5000.

Adding the one-time reward to his total earnings from the raise:
- Total earnings for the year = $109,200 + $5000 = $114,200.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{114200}

"To determine the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to break down the problem into parts and calculate each part step by step.

1. **Sandwiches for lunch:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 5 days.
   - Each sandwich uses 2 slices of cheese.
   - Total slices of cheese used for sandwiches = \(5 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 10 \text{ slices}\).

2. **Omelets for breakfast:**
   - Carl ate omelets 3 days in the week.
   - Each omelet uses 1 more slice of cheese than a sandwich, so each omelet uses \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices of cheese.
   - Total slices of cheese used for omelets = \(3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices}\).

3. **Macaroni and cheese for dinner:**
   - Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese to last him several dinners for the week and used 8 slices of cheese in it.
   - Total slices of cheese used for macaroni and cheese = 8 slices.

Now, we sum up the slices of cheese used for all the meals:
\[10 \text{ slices (sandwiches)} + 9 \text{ slices (omelets)} + 8 \text{ slices (macaroni and cheese)} = 27 \text{ slices}\]

Thus, the total number of slices of cheese Carl used is:

"To find the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we first need to calculate the sum of her current scores and then determine what the sixth score must be.

The scores of the first five tests are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. The sum of these scores is:
\[ 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 440 \]

Let \( x \) be the score on the sixth test. After removing the lowest score, the average of the remaining five scores will be 93. The lowest score among the first five is 71, so the sum of the remaining four scores will be:
\[ 440 - 71 = 369 \]

If the average of these four scores is 93, then the sum of these four scores is:
\[ 93 \times 4 = 372 \]

Therefore, the score \( x \) on the sixth test must be:
\[ x = 372 - 369 = 3 \]

So, Brinley needs a score of 3 on the sixth test to get an average of 93. The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total kilometers Micheal rode, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first four weeks and the next three weeks.

**First Four Weeks:**
- Micheal rode at least 5 times a week.
- Each time he rode, he covered 25 kilometers.
- Therefore, in one week, he rode \(5 \times 25 = 125\) kilometers.
- Over four weeks, he rode \(4 \times 125 = 500\) kilometers.

**Next Three Weeks:**
- Micheal decided to ride 2 times a week.
- Each time he rode, he covered 60 kilometers.
- Therefore, in one week, he rode \(2 \times 60 = 120\) kilometers.
- Over three weeks, he rode \(3 \times 120 = 360\) kilometers.

**Total Kilometers:**
- Adding the kilometers from both periods, we get \(500 + 360 = 860\) kilometers.

The total number of kilometers Micheal rode is \(\boxed{860}\)."
"To determine the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we first need to find the weight of each candied apple. Given that each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams and each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, we can calculate the weight of each candied apple as follows:

\[ \text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{\text{Weight of each chocolate bar}}{2} = \frac{40 \text{ grams}}{2} = 20 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then sum them up. The total weight of the chocolate bars is:

\[ \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 \text{ grams} = 1000 \text{ grams} \]

The total weight of the candied apples is:

\[ \text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20 \text{ grams} = 1600 \text{ grams} \]

Adding these two weights together gives the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:

\[ \text{Total weight of Joe's bag of candy} = 1000 \text{ grams} + 1600 \text{ grams} = 2600 \text{ grams} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2600 \]"
"To find out how many cakes Rose bought in total over the three days, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.
2. On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. Therefore, she bought \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes.
3. On Wednesday, she bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. Therefore, she bought \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

Now, we sum the number of cakes bought over the three days:
\[4 + 12 + 60 = 76\]

So, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is \(\boxed{76}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each.

Half a dozen plates is equal to 6 plates.

So, the total cost for 6 plates is:
\[ 6 \times 6000 = 36000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much less twenty dozen cups cost compared to $36000.

Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than $36000.

So, the cost of twenty dozen cups is:
\[ 36000 - 1200 = 34800 \]

Now, we need to find the cost of one cup. Since twenty dozen cups is equal to 240 cups, we divide the total cost by 240 to find the cost of one cup.

The cost of one cup is:
\[ \frac{34800}{240} = 145 \]

Thus, the total cost of buying each cup is:
\[ 145 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, let's determine how much money Sara earns from babysitting and mowing the lawn:
- Sara earns $5 each time she babysits, and she babysits 4 times, so she earns \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars from babysitting.
- Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, and we need to find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to afford the $70.

Let's denote the number of times Sara needs to mow the lawn as \(x\). The total amount of money Sara will have after mowing the lawn is the sum of the money she already has and the money she earns from mowing the lawn:
\[10 + 4x\]

We need this total to be at least $70 to afford the jacket and shoes:
\[10 + 4x \geq 70\]

Subtract 10 from both sides to isolate the term with \(x\):
\[4x \geq 60\]

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \(x\):
\[x \geq 15\]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn at least 15 times to afford the jacket and shoes. The final numerical answer is:
\[15\]"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \). According to the problem, the number of white chickens is two more than the number of red chickens, so we can write:
\[ w = r + 2 \]

Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day, and each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day. Therefore, the total number of eggs collected each day is given by:
\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation for the total number of eggs, we get:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens. To verify, if \( r = 4 \), then \( w = 4 + 2 = 6 \). The total number of eggs collected each day would be:
\[ 3(4) + 5(6) = 12 + 30 = 42 \]
This confirms our solution is correct.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

We substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. We know his walking speed is 3 miles per hour. The time \( t \) it takes to walk a certain distance \( d \) at a speed \( v \) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Here, the distance \( d \) is 15 miles and his speed \( v \) is 3 miles per hour:

\[ t = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park."
"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of customers on the second day.
2. Calculate the total number of customers over the three days.
3. Find the number of customers on the third day by subtracting the number of customers on the first and second days from the total.

First, we know that on the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than on the first day. Therefore, the number of customers on the second day is:
\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \]

Next, we know the total number of customers over the three days is 500. To find the number of customers on the third day, we subtract the number of customers on the first and second days from the total:
\[ 500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250 \]

So, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. 

Given that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, we can write the equation:
\[ B - 4 \times 4 = 2(S - 4 \times 4) \]
\[ B - 16 = 2(S - 16) \]
\[ B - 16 = 2S - 32 \]
\[ B = 2S - 16 \]

Now, we know that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the equation \( B = 2S - 16 \):
\[ 4S = 2S - 16 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = -16 \]
\[ 2S = -16 \]
\[ S = -8 \]

Since the amount of water cannot be negative, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The negative value indicates an inconsistency in the problem setup or interpretation. However, if we assume the problem is correctly stated and we need to find the current amount of water in the small pool, we can use the consistent equation \( B = 4S \) and the leak rate to find the current amount of water in the small pool.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons per minute, the current amount of water in the small pool \( S \) must be such that the equation \( B = 4S \) holds true. Given the leak rate, the current amount of water in the small pool is:
\[ S = 16 \]

So, the current amount of water in the small pool is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to make her purchase, we first need to calculate the total cost of the pair of shoes and the matching belt.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00.
The cost of the belt is $32.00.

Adding these together gives the total cost:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Lori earns $8.00 per hour. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44.00 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 44 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She promised to return the original amount plus an additional 10% of the original amount. The original amount is $2000.

The additional amount is:
\[ 10\% \times 2000 = 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she promised to return is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Janeth is paying $165 per month for 12 months. The total amount she will pay over 12 months is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we need to find out how much of the total amount she promised to return she has paid after 12 months. This is $1980. Therefore, her remaining balance is:

   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years old}
   \]

4. **Calculate their ages in three years:**
   - Harriet's age in three years: \(21 + 3 = 24\)
   - Zack's age in three years: \(42 + 3 = 45\)
   - Adrian's age in three years: \(63 + 3 = 66\)

5. **Calculate the average age in three years:**
   \[
   \text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Harriet's age in three years} + \text{Zack's age in three years} + \text{Adrian's age in three years}}{3} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna, and then subtract the points scored by Naomi and Yuri from the total points.

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. So, Yuri's score is:
   \[
   \text{Yuri's score} = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44
   \]
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna's score is:
   \[
   \text{Brianna's score} = 68 + 17 = 85
   \]

Now, we add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[
\text{Total points by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna} = 68 + 44 + 85 = 197
\]

The total points scored by all four students is 251. Therefore, Jojo's score is:
\[
\text{Jojo's score} = 251 - 197 = 54
\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"Initially, the tank has 120 liters of water. Celine used 90 liters to water her garden, so the amount of water left in the tank is:

\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters} \]

Celine then collected rainwater that is twice the amount left in the tank. Since there were 30 liters left, the amount of rainwater collected is:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters} \]

Adding the collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank gives:

\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final amount of water in the tank is:

\[ 90 \text{ liters} \]"

"To find the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years, we first need to calculate the amount spent on advertising in the second year. The company spent $15000 on advertising for the first year. For the second year, they spent a third of that amount.

Amount spent on advertising in the second year = \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15000 = 5000\)

Now, we add the amounts spent in both years to find the total.

Total amount spent on advertising = Amount spent in the first year + Amount spent in the second year
Total amount spent on advertising = $15000 + $5000 = $20000

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of days Andrew will travel if he goes to Rochester by bus and returns from Rochester by car.

First, we know that it takes 6 days to travel by bus from New Jersey to Rochester.

Next, we are told that it takes half as many days to travel by car from New Jersey to Rochester. Therefore, the number of days to travel by car is:
\[
\frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ days}
\]

Now, if Andrew plans to go to Rochester by bus and return from Rochester by car, the total number of days he will travel is the sum of the days for the one-way trip by bus and the one-way trip by car:
\[
6 \text{ days (bus)} + 3 \text{ days (car)} = 9 \text{ days}
\]

Thus, the total number of days Andrew will travel is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of cards James has after the changes:

- Initial fire type cards: 30
- Initial grass type cards: 20
- Initial water type cards: 40

After losing 8 water type cards:
- Water type cards left: 40 - 8 = 32

After buying 14 new grass type cards:
- Grass type cards now: 20 + 14 = 34

Now, the total number of cards James has is:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 34
- Water type: 32

The total number of cards is:
30 + 34 + 32 = 96

The number of water type cards is 32. To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 = 0.3333 \times 100 = 33.33\% \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33%.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the base burrito and all the additional items Chad added:

- Base burrito: $6.50
- Extra meat: $2.00
- Extra cheese: $1.00
- Avocado: $1.00
- 2 sauces at $0.25 each: $0.25 * 2 = $0.50

Adding these together:
\[ 6.50 + 2.00 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 0.50 = 11.00 \]

Next, we add the extra $3.00 for chips and a drink:
\[ 11.00 + 3.00 = 14.00 \]

Chad has a gift card worth $5.00, which he uses at checkout. Therefore, we subtract the value of the gift card from the total:
\[ 14.00 - 5.00 = 9.00 \]

So, the amount Chad still owes is:
\[ 9.00 \]"
"First, let's determine how many pieces Kalinda and her mom can place together per minute.

Kalinda places 4 pieces per minute.
Her mom places half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

Together, they can place \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces per minute.

The puzzle has 360 pieces. To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can place together per minute:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 1 hour."
"First, let's determine how many watermelons were ready for harvest after the first two months. Since 30% of the 120 watermelons were ready, we calculate:

\[ 0.30 \times 120 = 36 \]

So, Ashlyn took home 36 watermelons. This means the number of watermelons remaining after she took some home is:

\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest two weeks later. Since 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready, we calculate:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63 \]

This means 63 watermelons were ready for harvest two weeks later. Therefore, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:

\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 21 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the cars before tax and registration fees. Each car costs $20,000, and Mark buys 12 cars.

\[ \text{Total cost of cars} = 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000 \]

Next, we calculate the tax on the cars. The tax rate is 10%.

\[ \text{Tax on cars} = 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000 \]

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of the cars to get the total cost before registration fees.

\[ \text{Total cost before registration} = 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000 \]

Mark then pays $1000 for registration on each car. Since he has 12 cars, the total registration fee is:

\[ \text{Total registration fee} = 12 \times 1000 = 12,000 \]

Finally, we add the total registration fee to the total cost before registration to get the final amount Mark pays.

\[ \text{Final amount} = 264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"If there were 50 ants and Dax found half as many bugs as ants, then the number of bugs is:

\[ \text{Number of bugs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of ants} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \]

To find the total number of insects in the garden, we add the number of ants and the number of bugs:

\[ \text{Total number of insects} = \text{Number of ants} + \text{Number of bugs} = 50 + 25 = 75 \]

The total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"To solve this problem, we start by determining how many penguins jump into the ocean and how many go into the cave.

1. Calculate the number of penguins that jump into the ocean:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \text{ of } 36 = \frac{36}{3} = 12
   \]

2. Calculate the number of penguins that go into the cave:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \text{ of } 36 = \frac{36}{3} = 12
   \]

3. Determine the total number of penguins that leave the snow to either swim or eat:
   \[
   12 \text{ (jumping into the ocean)} + 12 \text{ (going into the cave)} = 24
   \]

4. Subtract the number of penguins that left from the original number to find out how many are still sunbathing:

"To determine how many vines Steve needs, we first need to calculate how many cherry tomatoes he eats per week.

Steve eats 6 cherry tomatoes per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the number of tomatoes he eats in a week is:
\[ 6 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ tomatoes/week} \]

Steve's girlfriend eats half as much as he does, so she eats:
\[ \frac{6 \text{ tomatoes/day}}{2} = 3 \text{ tomatoes/day} \]
Thus, in a week, she eats:
\[ 3 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ tomatoes/week} \]

Together, Steve and his girlfriend eat:
\[ 42 \text{ tomatoes/week} + 21 \text{ tomatoes/week} = 63 \text{ tomatoes/week} \]

Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, the number of vines needed is:
\[ \frac{63 \text{ tomatoes/week}}{3 \text{ tomatoes/vine/week}} = 21 \text{ vines} \]

Therefore, Steve needs \(\boxed{21}\) vines."
"To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we first need to calculate the total number of pizza slices required.

John has 20 friends, and each friend will have 4 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices needed is:
\[ 20 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many pizzas are required to provide these 80 slices. Each pizza is sliced into 8 portions. To find out how many pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 10 \text{ pizzas} \]

Thus, John needs to order:
\[ \boxed{10} \text{ pizzas} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the process Ram uses to make new pens from the empty ones. Ram can make one full pen by mixing the ink from five empty pens. This means that for every five empty pens, he gets one new full pen.

Ram initially buys 25 pens. Since he can make one new pen from five empty pens, we can determine how many new pens he can make from the 25 empty pens he has after using them:

\[ \text{Number of new pens} = \frac{25}{5} = 5 \]

After making these 5 new pens, Ram will have 5 empty pens left (since he used 25 pens to make 5 new ones). Now, he can use these 5 empty pens to make another new pen:

\[ \text{Number of additional new pens} = \frac{5}{5} = 1 \]

So, the total number of pens Ram gets is the original 25 pens plus the 5 new pens he made and the 1 additional new pen he made from the 5 empty pens:

\[ \text{Total pens} = 25 + 5 + 1 = 31 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 31 \]"

The sum of the ages of the three girls is \(\boxed{68}\)."
"First, let's calculate the number of students who went out through exit A. Since 30% of the students went out through exit A, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Students through exit A} = 30\% \times 1000 = 0.30 \times 1000 = 300 \]

After students went through exit A, the remaining number of students is:

\[ \text{Remaining students} = 1000 - 300 = 700 \]

Next, we calculate the number of students who went out through exit B. According to the problem, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining students went out through exit B:

\[ \text{Students through exit B} = \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420 \]

The number of students who went out through exit C is the rest of the remaining students after those who went through exit A and exit B have left. Therefore, we subtract the number of students who went through exit B from the remaining students:

\[ \text{Students through exit C} = 700 - 420 = 280 \]

So, the number of students who went out through exit C is:

\[ \boxed{280} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of candies each person has and then find the difference between the number of candies John has and the number of candies James has.

First, let's denote the number of candies Robert has as \( R \).

According to the problem, John has twice as many candies as Robert. Therefore, we can write:
\[ \text{John's candies} = 2R \]

We are given that John has 54 candies:
\[ 2R = 54 \]

To find \( R \), we solve the equation:
\[ R = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

So, Robert has 27 candies.

Next, we know that James has 6 more candies than Robert. Therefore, we can write:
\[ \text{James's candies} = R + 6 \]

Substituting the value of \( R \):
\[ \text{James's candies} = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Now, we need to find how many more candies John has than James:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's candies} - \text{James's candies} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

Thus, John has 21 more candies than James. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many pen pals Mike has left after stopping being pen pals with 2 of them. Initially, he had 5 pen pals, and he stopped being pen pals with 2, so he has:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals left} \]

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each pen pal sends:

\[ 2 \text{ letters/week} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 10 \text{ pages/week} \]

Since there are 3 pen pals, the total number of pages sent by all pen pals in a week is:

\[ 3 \text{ pen pals} \times 10 \text{ pages/pen pal/week} = 30 \text{ pages/week} \]

Mike responds in kind, so he also writes 30 pages a week. Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. Therefore, the time he spends writing 30 pages is:

\[ 30 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine how many minutes Jason has left on his phone plan, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he has used and subtract that from his plan's total.

"First, let's determine how many fries Kyle took. Kyle took 5 fries.

Next, we calculate how many fries Billy took. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries.

Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, so Colby took \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries.

Now, let's summarize the changes in the number of fries Griffin had:
- Initially, Griffin had 24 fries.
- Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin had \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries.
- Billy took 10 fries, so Griffin had \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries.
- Colby took 2 fries, so Griffin had \(9 - 2 = 7\) fries.

However, we know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. This means that the number of fries Griffin had before Colby took any must have been \(27 + 2 = 29\) fries.

Since Griffin had 9 fries before Colby took any, the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin must be \(29 - 9 = 20\).

Thus, the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( F \).

Given:
- There are 4 snails in the first aquarium.
- There are 32 snails in the second aquarium.
- The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is \( 32 - 4 = 28 \).
- This difference is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums.

Let's denote the total number of fish in both aquariums as \( 2F \) (since both aquariums have the same number of fish).

According to the problem, the difference in the number of snails is twice the total number of fish:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2F \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ F = 7 \]

Therefore, the number of fish in each aquarium is \( 7 \).

"First, let's calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist works for the movie:

- She works 6 hours each day.
- She needs the makeup done 4 times a week.
- The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.

Total hours worked = 6 hours/day * 4 days/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours.

Next, we calculate the total cost before the discount:

- The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.
- She worked 120 hours.

Total cost before discount = 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000.

Now, we apply the 10% discount:

- The discount is 10% of $30,000.

Discount amount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.10 * $30,000 = $3,000.

Finally, we calculate the total cost after the discount:

Total cost after discount = $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000.

Jean paid $27,000."

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cookies} \]

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister:
\[ 2 \times 13 = 26 \text{ cookies} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of cookies Sue ate over the two days:
\[ 20 + 26 = 46 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of cookies Sue's sister ate over the two days:
\[ 5 + 13 = 18 \text{ cookies} \]

Each cookie has 200 calories. Therefore, we calculate the total calories consumed by Sue and her sister.

Sue's total calories:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Previous Night's Kill:**
   - Wolves: 10
   - Cougars: 15

2. **Today's Kill:**
   - Let the number of cougars killed today be \( c \).
   - According to the problem, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, so the number of wolves killed today is \( 3c \).
   - Also, Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, so the number of cougars killed today is \( 15 - 3 = 12 \).

3. **Calculating Today's Wolves:**
   - Since today's number of cougars is 12, the number of wolves killed today is \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \).

4. **Total Animals Killed:**
   - Wolves killed: 10 (previous night) + 36 (today) = 46
   - Cougars killed: 15 (previous night) + 12 (today) = 27

"First, let's determine how many times Anne went down the water slide. Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30.

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.30 \times 30 = 9 \]

So, Anne went down the slide:

\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \text{ times} \]

Next, we need to find out how many times Robert went down the slide. Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne, so we multiply the number of times Anne went down by 4.

\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 84 \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of cows after Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows. Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, which totals:

\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows/stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows, so the total number of cows now is:

\[ 200 \text{ cows} + 40 \text{ cows} = 240 \text{ cows} \]

Next, Mr. Sylas divides these 40 new cows equally among the 20 stalls. Each stall will get:

\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows/stall} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. Since each stall has 2 cows, 8 stalls will have:

\[ 8 \text{ stalls} \times 2 \text{ cows/stall} = 16 \text{ cows} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 16 \]"
"To determine the total amount of money Brady has in his piggy bank, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and bill separately and then sum them up.

1. **Pennies**: Each penny is worth $0.01. Brady has 100 pennies.
   \[
   100 \text{ pennies} \times 0.01 \text{ dollars/penny} = 1 \text{ dollar}
   \]

2. **Nickels**: Each nickel is worth $0.05. Brady has 40 nickels.
   \[
   40 \text{ nickels} \times 0.05 \text{ dollars/nickel} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Dimes**: Each dime is worth $0.10. Brady has 20 dimes.
   \[
   20 \text{ dimes} \times 0.10 \text{ dollars/dime} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Dollar Bills**: Each dollar bill is worth $1.00. Brady has 40 dollar bills.
   \[
   40 \text{ dollar bills} \times 1.00 \text{ dollars/dollar bill} = 40 \text{ dollars}

"First, we need to determine the total length of the redwood tree in feet, which is given as 200 feet.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the entire redwood tree before any damage. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can find the total weight by dividing the total length by the length of each section and then multiplying by the weight per section:
\[
\text{Total weight} = \left(\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}}\right) \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 20 \times 400 = 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to account for the damage caused by the termites. The termites ate 30% of the redwood's wood, which means 70% of the wood remains. To find the remaining weight, we calculate 70% of the total weight:
\[
\text{Remaining weight} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70 = 5600 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of apples Jamal has as \( J_a \) and the number of bananas Jamal has as \( J_b \).

From the information given:
1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, so if Andrea has 52 apples, then Jamal has \( 52 - 8 = 44 \) apples.
2. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so \( J_b = J_a + 4 \).
3. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so if Jamal has \( J_b \) bananas, then Andrea has \( \frac{J_b}{2} \) bananas. Since Andrea has 52 apples, we can use this to find the number of bananas Jamal has.

First, we know Jamal has 44 apples, so:
\[ J_b = 44 + 4 = 48 \]
This means Jamal has 48 bananas.

Now, we can find out how many bananas Andrea has:
\[ \text{Andrea's bananas} = \frac{J_b}{2} = \frac{48}{2} = 24 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits:
- Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas, so Andrea has \( 52 + 24 = 76 \) fruits.
- Jamal has 44 apples and 48 bananas, so Jamal has \( 44 + 48 = 92 \) fruits.

The total number of fruits is:
\[ 76 + 92 = 168 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total amount of flour Carla needs, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she is making. Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, so the total number of cookies is:

\[ 36 + 30 = 66 \]

Next, we know that 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies. To find out how many cups of flour are needed for 66 cookies, we can set up a proportion. Since 12 cookies require 2 cups of flour, we can find out how many cups are needed for 66 cookies by dividing 66 by 12 and then multiplying by 2:

\[ \frac{66}{12} \times 2 = 5.5 \times 2 = 11 \]

Therefore, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 11 \]"
"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we first need to calculate how many pennies are in two thirds of the pennies in the cup.

Given that there are 9,300 pennies in the cup, we calculate two thirds of 9,300 as follows:

\[
\text{Number of pennies in the stack} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9300
\]

First, we perform the multiplication:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9300 = \frac{2 \times 9300}{3} = \frac{18600}{3} = 6200
\]

So, there are 6,200 pennies in the stack.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, the total dollar amount in the stack is:

\[
\text{Total dollar amount} = 6200 \times 0.01 = 62

"First, let's determine the number of trees Ferdinand has. Since Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, and Chris has 6 trees, we can calculate the number of trees Ferdinand has as follows:

\[ \text{Number of trees Ferdinand has} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we need to find out how many trees Harry has. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. Since Ferdinand has 3 trees, we can calculate the number of trees Harry has as follows:

\[ \text{Number of trees Harry has} = 2 \times 3 + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11 \]

Now, to find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand, we subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has:

\[ \text{Difference} = 11 - 3 = 8 \]

So, Harry has 8 more trees than Ferdinand. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how much money each girl has individually.

Carmen has $100.

Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so:
\[ \text{Samantha's money} = 100 + 25 = 125 \]

Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so:
\[ \text{Daisy's money} = 125 + 50 = 175 \]

Now, to find out how much all three girls have combined, we add their individual amounts together:
\[ \text{Total money} = 100 + 125 + 175 \]

Adding these amounts:
\[ 100 + 125 = 225 \]
\[ 225 + 175 = 400 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money all three girls have combined is:

"First, let's calculate the total price of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

The selling price of the house is $350,000.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price:
\[ \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500 \]

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price:
\[ \text{Transfer Fee} = 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000 \]

Now, let's calculate the total price of the house including both fees:
\[ \text{Total Price} = \text{Selling Price} + \text{Brokerage Fee} + \text{Transfer Fee} \]
\[ \text{Total Price} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500 \]

Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. To find out how much more the total price of the house is than her budget, we subtract her budget from the total price:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Total Price} - \text{Budget} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500 \]

The total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget."
"First, we calculate the transfer fees, which are 3% of the selling price of $400,000:
\[ \text{Transfer Fees} = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000 \]

Next, we calculate the brokerage fee, which is 5% of the selling price of $400,000:
\[ \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000 \]

The total fees paid are the sum of the transfer fees and the brokerage fee:
\[ \text{Total Fees} = 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000 \]

Mr. Tan also paid $250,000 towards the remaining loan amount. To find the net proceeds, we subtract the total fees and the loan payment from the selling price:
\[ \text{Net Proceeds} = 400,000 - 32,000 - 250,000 = 118,000 \]

Thus, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are:
\[ \boxed{118000} \]"
"First, let's calculate the time it takes for the oil to heat up to 400 degrees. We know it takes 20 minutes to heat the oil to 300 degrees, and it then takes 40% longer to heat it to 400 degrees.

40% of 20 minutes is:
\[ 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the additional time needed to heat the oil to 400 degrees is 8 minutes. Therefore, the total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that it takes 5 minutes less time to cook the chicken than it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees. So, the cooking time is:
\[ 28 - 5 = 23 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees and the time it took to cook the chicken:
\[ 28 + 23 = 51 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken is:

"To calculate the total amount spent by the real estate agent on buying all the ads, we need to calculate the cost of the newspaper ads and the television ads separately and then add them together.

The cost for the newspaper ads is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Cost of newspaper ads} = \text{Number of newspaper ads} \times \text{Cost per newspaper ad} \]
\[ \text{Cost of newspaper ads} = 50 \times 5 = 250 \]

The cost for the television ads is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Cost of television ads} = \text{Number of television ads} \times \text{Cost per television ad} \]
\[ \text{Cost of television ads} = 15 \times 75 = 1125 \]

Now, we add the two costs together to get the total amount spent:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of newspaper ads} + \text{Cost of television ads} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 250 + 1125 = 1375 \]

The real estate agent spent a total of $1375 on buying all the ads."

"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and then sum them up.

1. The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
2. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has \(300 + 12 = 312\) M&Ms.
3. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, so it has \(300 / 2 = 150\) M&Ms.

Now, we sum the M&Ms from all three bags:
\[300 + 312 + 150 = 762\]

Therefore, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms of one house:**
   - Each house has 3 bedrooms.
   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.
   - Therefore, the number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is \(3 \text{ bedrooms} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows}\).

2. **Calculate the number of windows in the additional windows of one house:**
   - Each house has an additional 4 windows.
   - Therefore, the number of additional windows in one house is 4 windows.

3. **Calculate the total number of windows in one house:**
   - The total number of windows in one house is the sum of the windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows.
   - This is \(6 \text{ windows (bedrooms)} + 4 \text{ windows (additional)} = 10 \text{ windows}\).

4. **Calculate the total number of windows in both houses:**
   - Since John has 2 houses, the total number of windows in both houses is \(10 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 20 \text{ windows}\).

Therefore, the total number of windows between the houses is 20."

So, the change the cashier gives back is $5.00."
"First, let's determine the number of stitches for each part of the sweater:

- The collar takes a tenth of the stitches for the body of the sweater. Since the body takes 900 stitches, the collar takes \( \frac{900}{10} = 90 \) stitches.
- The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar. Since the collar takes 90 stitches, the rosette takes \( 2 \times 90 = 180 \) stitches.

Now, let's calculate the total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette:
- Collar: 90 stitches
- Rosette: 180 stitches
- Total for collar and rosette: \( 90 + 180 = 270 \) stitches

The total number of stitches for the whole sweater is 1800. Therefore, the number of stitches used for the body and the sleeves is:
- Body: 900 stitches
- Total for body and sleeves: \( 1800 - 270 = 1530 \) stitches

Since there are two sleeves, we need to find out how many stitches each sleeve takes. Let \( x \) be the number of stitches for each sleeve. Then:
- Total for two sleeves: \( 2x \)
- Total for body and sleeves: \( 900 + 2x = 1530 \)

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 2x = 1530 - 900 \]
\[ 2x = 630 \]
\[ x = \frac{630}{2} \]
\[ x = 315 \]

Each sleeve takes 315 stitches. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{315} \]"

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song.
   - Number of lines in the first scene: \( 2 \times 54 = 108 \) lines.
   - Sean has to memorize a third of the lines in the first scene.
   - Number of lines Sean has to memorize in the first scene: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36 \) lines.

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the solo song.
   - Number of lines in the second scene: \( 54 + 6 = 60 \) lines.
   - Sean has to memorize four-fifths of the lines in the second scene.

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 80 = \frac{160}{5} = 32
\]

So, 32 cards had the letter A on them. This leaves us with:

\[
80 - 32 = 48
\]

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining 48 cards had the letter B on them. Since 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24
\]

This leaves us with:

\[
48 - 24 = 24

"To calculate the total time Matthew will take to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we first calculate the time for each type of hole separately and then sum them up.

For the small holes:
- Time to dig one small hole = 3 minutes
- Number of small holes = 30
- Total time for small holes = 3 minutes/hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes

For the large holes:
- Time to dig one large hole = 10 minutes
- Number of large holes = 15
- Total time for large holes = 10 minutes/hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes

Now, we add the total time for both types of holes:
- Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert the total time from minutes to hours:
- Total time in hours = 240 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we start with the information given: the sum of their current ages is 20.

Let's denote Mico's current age as \( M \) and Marco's current age as \( R \). According to the problem, we have:
\[ M + R = 20 \]

In 10 years, Mico's age will be \( M + 10 \) and Marco's age will be \( R + 10 \). The sum of their ages in 10 years will be:
\[ (M + 10) + (R + 10) \]

We can simplify this expression:
\[ (M + 10) + (R + 10) = M + R + 10 + 10 = M + R + 20 \]

Since we know from the problem statement that \( M + R = 20 \), we substitute this value into the equation:
\[ M + R + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40 \]

Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, which translates to \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. This can be written as \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

First, we substitute the expression for \( R \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Next, we expand and simplify the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old. To verify, we calculate Ruby's current age:
\[ R = 6S = 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

In 9 years, Sam will be \( 6 + 9 = 15 \) years old, and Ruby will be \( 36 + 9 = 45 \) years old. Checking the condition that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
\[ 45 = 3 \times 15 \]
This is true, confirming our solution.

"First, let's determine the number of spots a mamba has. Since a cobra has 70 spots and a mamba has half as many spots as a cobra, a mamba has:

\[ \frac{70}{2} = 35 \text{ spots} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, so the total number of spots for the cobras is:

\[ 40 \times 70 = 2800 \text{ spots} \]

There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots, so the total number of spots for the mambas is:

\[ 60 \times 35 = 2100 \text{ spots} \]

Adding the spots of all the cobras and mambas together gives:

\[ 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \text{ spots} \]

To find half the number of spots they all have combined, we calculate:

\[ \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

"To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we first need to calculate the total length of the topaz gemstones used in one necklace.

Given:
- Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long.
- Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace.

The total length of the topaz gemstones is:
\[ 8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to find out how much space is left for the sterling silver beads after accounting for the topaz gemstones. The total length of the necklace is 25 inches.

The length available for sterling silver beads is:
\[ 25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches} \]

Each sterling silver bead is 0.25 inches long. To find the number of sterling silver beads used, we divide the available length by the length of one bead:

"To find the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot altogether, we need to calculate the number of stories each wrote in both weeks and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of stories each wrote in the second week:
- Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week and doubled that in the second week, so she wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories in the second week.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week and doubled that in the second week, so he wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories in the second week.
- Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week and doubled that in the second week, so she wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories in the second week.

Next, we sum up the total number of stories written by each of them over the two weeks:
- Alani wrote \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories in total.
- Braylen wrote \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories in total.
- Margot wrote \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories in total.

Finally, we add up the total number of stories written by all three:
\[60 + 120 + 180 = 360\]

So, the total number of stories they wrote altogether is \(\boxed{360}\)."
"First, we need to determine the current age of Ann's brother. Since Ann is 9 years old and her brother is twice her age, we calculate her brother's age as follows:

\[ \text{Brother's current age} = 2 \times \text{Ann's age} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we need to find out how old her brother will be in 3 years. We add 3 years to his current age:

\[ \text{Brother's age in 3 years} = \text{Brother's current age} + 3 = 18 + 3 = 21 \]

Thus, Ann's brother will be 21 years old in 3 years. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 21 \]"
"Kelly has 5 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents. Therefore, the total value of the quarters is:
\[ 5 \times 25 = 125 \text{ cents} \]

She also has 2 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents. Therefore, the total value of the dimes is:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Adding the value of the quarters and the dimes gives:
\[ 125 + 20 = 145 \text{ cents} \]

The can of pop costs 55 cents. Subtracting the cost of the can of pop from the total amount of money Kelly has gives:
\[ 145 - 55 = 90 \text{ cents} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 90 \]"
"To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we first need to calculate the total number of stars accounted for by the rows of 8 and 6 stars, and then subtract this from the total number of stars on the flag.

The total number of stars on the flag is 76. The flag has three rows of 8 stars and two rows of 6 stars. We can calculate the total number of stars in these rows as follows:

\[ 3 \times 8 + 2 \times 6 = 24 + 12 = 36 \]

So, there are 36 stars accounted for by the rows of 8 and 6 stars. To find the number of stars in the remaining rows, we subtract the number of stars in the rows of 8 and 6 stars from the total number of stars:

\[ 76 - 36 = 40 \]

These remaining 40 stars are in rows of 5 stars each. To find the number of rows of 5 stars, we divide 40 by 5:

\[ 40 \div 5 = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of rows of 5 stars is 8. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{8}
\]"
"First, we need to calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight of 80 flagstones is:

\[ 80 \times 75 = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how many trucks are required to transport 6000 pounds, given that each truck can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds. We do this by dividing the total weight by the capacity of one truck:

\[ \frac{6000}{2000} = 3 \]

Since the division results in a whole number, 3 trucks are needed to transport the 80 flagstones in one trip. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"First, let's determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, the speed of the car in the slow lane is:

\[ \text{Speed of slow lane car} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time it took for the car in the fast lane to travel 480 miles. The formula to calculate time is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the fast lane:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{fast lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Since the car in the slow lane traveled the same distance (480 miles) but at a different speed (30 miles/hour), we can calculate the time it took for the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance using the same formula:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{slow lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

\[ 16 \text{ hours} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Izzy's medals} = \text{Ali's medals} - 5 = 22 - 5 = 17 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:

\[ \text{Total medals} = \text{Ali's medals} + \text{Izzy's medals} = 22 + 17 = 39 \]

According to the problem, the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have:

\[ \text{Total medals given out} = 10 \times \text{Total medals} = 10 \times 39 = 390 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 390 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available:

Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, and there are 8 packets.
\[ 5 \text{ bars/packet} \times 8 \text{ packets} = 40 \text{ bars} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of chocolate bars that the adults will receive:

Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, and there are 4 adults.
\[ 6 \text{ bars/adult} \times 4 \text{ adults} = 24 \text{ bars} \]

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults will receive from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many bars are left for the children:
\[ 40 \text{ bars} - 24 \text{ bars} = 16 \text{ bars} \]

Finally, we need to determine how many chocolate bars each child will get. There are 8 children, and we have 16 bars left to distribute equally among them:
\[ \frac{16 \text{ bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ bars/child} \]

Thus, each child will get 2 chocolate bars. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"To determine how much money Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she works and then convert that time into earnings based on her rate.

Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. Since she pauses for half an hour, the actual working time is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} - 0.5 \text{ hours} = 2.5 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we convert the working time into minutes:
\[ 2.5 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes. To find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes, we divide 150 by 10:
\[ 150 \text{ minutes} \div 10 \text{ minutes/interval} = 15 \text{ intervals} \]

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, her total earnings are:
\[ 15 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ dollars/interval} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 75 \]"
"First, let's determine the initial points for each player:

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Next, we check if any of the players get an extra point in the fourth round. According to the rules, a player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points.

- Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so Mike gets an extra point.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so Jim does not get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so Tony gets an extra point.

Now, we add the extra points to their initial points:

- Mike's new total is \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
- Jim's new total remains \(18\) points.
- Tony's new total is \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

Finally, we calculate the total points for all three players:

\[22 + 18 + 43 = 83\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{83}

"First, let's determine the ages of Will's sons. The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest son is half as old as the oldest, which means the youngest son is 4 years old.

Next, we calculate how many oranges each son washes. The oldest son washes 8 oranges, and the youngest son washes 4 oranges. Therefore, the total number of oranges washed by both sons is:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \]

Will initially bought 15 oranges. After his sons wash 12 oranges, the number of oranges left unwashed is:
\[ 15 - 12 = 3 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To find the total count of activities Darren did in the two days, we need to calculate the number of each activity he did on both days and then sum them up.

**First Day:**
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

**Second Day:**
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, let's calculate the total for each activity over the two days:

- Total pushups: 100 (first day) + 120 (second day) = 220
- Total squats: 50 (first day) + 40 (second day) = 90
- Total dumbbell presses: 20 (first day) + 40 (second day) = 60

Finally, we sum up all the activities:

- Total count of activities: 220 (pushups) + 90 (squats) + 60 (dumbbell presses) = 370

The final numerical answer is 370."
"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day by the household.
2. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week by the household.
3. Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

First, let's calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day by the household. Since each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal and there are 5 members in the household, and they eat rice at lunch and dinner, the total consumption per day is:
\[ 5 \text{ people} \times 0.2 \text{ kg/meal/person} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 2 \text{ kg/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 2 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ kg/week} \]

Now, we need to determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last. We divide the total amount of rice by the weekly consumption:
\[ \frac{42 \text{ kg}}{14 \text{ kg/week}} = 3 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we first need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week.

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he did not sell any bread on those days. Over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday), he sold 20 crates. From Tuesday to Thursday, he sold 15 crates on Tuesday, 12 crates on Wednesday, and 18 crates on Thursday. Let's add these up:

\[
15 + 12 + 18 = 45
\]

Now, we add the crates sold over the weekend to the crates sold from Tuesday to Thursday:

\[
45 + 20 = 65
\]

Sam's target for the week was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off by, we subtract the number of crates he sold from his target:

\[
120 - 65 = 55
\]

So, Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{55}

"To determine the total cost of the antique desk to Carmen, we need to calculate the bids she placed and the bids of the other bidders.

Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so she bids 3 times. Each of her bids increases by $50. Therefore, her bids are:
- First bid: $200
- Second bid: $200 + $50 = $250
- Third bid: $250 + $50 = $300

The other 3 bidders each bid once, and since they bid in sequence, their bids are:
- First bidder: $200
- Second bidder: $200 + $50 = $250
- Third bidder: $250 + $50 = $300

Carmen wins with her third bid of $300. To find out how much she spent, we sum her bids:
- First bid: $200
- Second bid: $250
- Third bid: $300

Total cost = $200 + $250 + $300 = $750

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{750}

"To calculate the total amount John pays for driving a year, we need to consider both the cost per mile and the monthly bonus.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven in a year:
- John drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back, so he drives 60 miles each day.
- He goes to work 5 days a week, so he drives 60 miles * 5 days = 300 miles per week.
- He works 50 weeks a year, so he drives 300 miles * 50 weeks = 15,000 miles per year.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the miles driven:
- He is charged $2 per mile, so the cost for the miles driven is 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000.

Now, let's calculate the total bonus he gives the driver in a year:
- He gives a $150 bonus per month, so the total bonus for the year is $150 * 12 months = $1,800.

Finally, let's add the cost for the miles driven and the total bonus to find the total amount he pays in a year:
- Total amount paid = $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{31800}

"To determine how many minutes Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we first need to calculate the total amount of time he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.

On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes.
On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes.

Adding these together:
\[ 23 + 16 = 39 \text{ minutes} \]

Peter wants to exercise for twice this amount on Tuesday. Therefore, we need to multiply the combined time by 2:
\[ 39 \times 2 = 78 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Peter has to exercise for \(\boxed{78}\) minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the folding process and the arrangement of the pages.

1. **Folding Process**: When a piece of paper is folded vertically, it creates two layers. Each layer can be used to print two pages, one on the front and one on the back. This means that each piece of paper, when folded, can print 4 pages (2 front and 2 back).

2. **Pages in a Tabloid**: A 32-page tabloid means there are 32 pages to be printed.

3. **Calculating Pieces of Paper**: Since each piece of paper can print 4 pages, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages each piece of paper can print:
   \[
   \frac{32 \text{ pages}}{4 \text{ pages per piece of paper}} = 8 \text{ pieces of paper}
   \]

Therefore, the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid is 8."
"First, we calculate how much Annika spent on food and snacks. Since she spent half of her $50 on food and snacks, we have:

\[
\frac{50}{2} = 25
\]

So, Annika spent $25 on food and snacks. After spending $25, the amount of money she has left is:

\[
50 - 25 = 25
\]

Next, she spent an additional $10 on rides. Subtracting this amount from the remaining $25, we get:

\[
25 - 10 = 15
\]

Therefore, the amount of money Annika has left is:

\[
\boxed{15}
\]"
"To determine the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of books sold in the current year:**
   - There are currently 50 unsold books.
   - The total number of books is 250.
   - Therefore, the number of books sold in the current year is:
     \[
     250 - 50 = 200 \text{ books}
     \]

2. **Verify the number of books sold in the first year:**
   - Elise sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year.
   - The number of books sold in the current year is 200.
   - Therefore, the number of books sold in the first year is:
     \[
     2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ books}
     \]

3. **Determine the number of books sold in the second year:**
   - The total number of books sold over the three years is 250.
   - The number of books sold in the first year is 400.
   - The number of books sold in the current year is 200.
   - Therefore, the number of books sold in the second year is:
     \[
     250 - 400 - 200 = -150 \text{ books}
     \]
   - This negative value indicates an error in the problem setup or interpretation. Given the constraints, it seems there might be a misunderstanding. Let's re-evaluate the problem with the given data.

4. **Re-evaluate the problem with the given data:**
   - The number of books sold in the current year is 45.
   - The number of books sold in the first year is twice the number sold in the current year:
     \[
     2 \times 45 = 90 \text{ books}
     \]
   - The total number of books sold over the three years is 250.
   - Therefore, the number of books sold in the second year is:
     \[
     250 - 90 - 45 = 115 \text{ books}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total amount of money earned in the second year:**
   - Each book sells for $20.
   - The number of books sold in the second year is 115.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money earned in the second year is:
     \[
     115 \times 20 = 2300 \text{ dollars}

The total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is \(\boxed{2300}\)."
"To determine how much money Watson made in April, we need to calculate his earnings from his hourly wage and his weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate Watson's daily earnings:
- Watson works 10 hours a day.
- He earns $10 per hour.

\[ \text{Daily earnings} = 10 \, \text{hours/day} \times 10 \, \text{\$/hour} = 100 \, \text{\$/day} \]

Next, let's calculate his weekly earnings:
- Watson works 5 days a week.
- He earns $100 per day.

\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 100 \, \text{\$/day} \times 5 \, \text{days/week} = 500 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Since Watson received a $300 bonus each week if the company performed well, his total weekly earnings when the company performed well are:

\[ \text{Total weekly earnings} = 500 \, \text{\$/week} + 300 \, \text{\$/week} = 800 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Now, we need to determine how many weeks are in April. April typically has 30 days.

\[ \text{Number of weeks in April} = \frac{30 \, \text{days}}{7 \, \text{days/week}} \approx 4.29 \]

Since Watson earns his bonus each week, we consider only full weeks in April:

\[ \text{Number of full weeks in April} = 4 \]

Finally, we calculate his total earnings for the 4 full weeks in April:

\[ \text{Total earnings for April} = 800 \, \text{\$/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 3200 \, \text{\$} \]

Thus, Watson made \(\boxed{3200}\) dollars in April if the company performed very well for the whole month."
"To determine how many people John lost to, we first need to calculate how many people he beat and then subtract that number from the total number of people he arm wrestled.

John beats 80% of the 20 people he arm wrestled. To find out how many people he beats, we calculate 80% of 20:

\[ 0.80 \times 20 = 16 \]

This means John beat 16 people. Since he arm wrestled 20 people in total, the number of people he lost to is:

\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many loaves of bread are sold in the morning. Since two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning, we calculate:

\[
\text{Morning sales} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
\]

Next, we find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales:

\[
\text{Loaves left after morning} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
\]

In the afternoon and evening, half of the remaining loaves are sold equally. Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening combined is:

\[
\text{Afternoon and evening sales combined} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
\]

Since the loaves sold in the afternoon and evening are sold equally, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[
\text{Afternoon sales} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ loaves}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{5}

"First, let's calculate the savings on the ice cream. The original price of one tub of ice cream is $13, and it is now sold at $11. The discount per tub of ice cream is:

\[ 13 - 11 = 2 \]

So, the discount per tub of ice cream is $2. If you buy 2 tubs of ice cream, the total savings on the ice cream will be:

\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \]

Next, let's calculate the savings on the milk. The discount on one packet of milk is $0.5. If you buy 4 packets of milk, the total savings on the milk will be:

\[ 0.5 \times 4 = 2 \]

Now, we add the savings from the ice cream and the milk to find the total savings:

\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \]

So, the total amount saved if you buy 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk is:

"To determine the number of new limbs Helena's serum will cause a person to grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and extra legs that grow based on the given growth rates.

The serum makes a person grow an extra arm every three days. So, in fifteen days, the number of extra arms grown is:
\[ \frac{15}{3} = 5 \]

The serum makes a person grow an extra leg every five days. So, in fifteen days, the number of extra legs grown is:
\[ \frac{15}{5} = 3 \]

Therefore, the total number of new limbs grown after fifteen days is the sum of the extra arms and extra legs:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
\[ 6 \text{ suits} \times \$100 \text{ per suit} = \$600 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
\[ 3 \text{ suitcases} \times \$50 \text{ per suitcase} = \$150 \]

Now, let's determine the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit:
\[ 5 \times \$100 + \$700 = \$500 + \$700 = \$1200 \]

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
\[ \$600 \text{ (suits)} + \$150 \text{ (suitcases)} + \$1200 \text{ (flight ticket)} = \$2050 \]

The total amount Theo has for the trip is $6000. He wants to save $2000, so the amount he can spend on the trip is:
\[ \$6000 - \$2000 = \$4000 \]

To find out how much he can spend on gifts, we subtract the total expenses from the amount he can spend:
\[ \$4000 - \$2050 = \$1950 \]

Therefore, the amount Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa is:
\[ \$1950 \]"
"To determine the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum up the results.

First, let's identify the number of people in the family and their daily egg consumption:
- There are 5 people in the family.
- 3 people eat 3 eggs each day.
- The remaining 2 people eat 2 eggs each day.

Calculate the daily egg consumption for the 3 people who eat 3 eggs each:
\[ 3 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ eggs/person/day} = 9 \text{ eggs/day} \]

Calculate the daily egg consumption for the 2 people who eat 2 eggs each:
\[ 2 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ eggs/person/day} = 4 \text{ eggs/day} \]

Now, add the daily egg consumption of both groups to find the total daily egg consumption:
\[ 9 \text{ eggs/day} + 4 \text{ eggs/day} = 13 \text{ eggs/day} \]

Next, calculate the total egg consumption for a week (7 days):
\[ 13 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 91 \text{ eggs} \]

Thus, the family will consume \(\boxed{91}\) eggs in a week."

\[ 46 - 6 = 40 \text{ years old} \]

Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah's age six years ago was:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ years old} \]

This means Noah is currently:
\[ 20 + 6 = 26 \text{ years old} \]

According to the problem, six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age. Therefore, six years ago the population of Chile was:
\[ 3000 \times 20 = 60000 \]

Since the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now, the current population of Chile is:
\[ 60000 \times 2 = 120000 \]

Thus, the population of Chile now is:
\[ \boxed{120000} \]"
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 30 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha initially invited:

- Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each, so that's \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people.
- She also invited 3 families with 4 people each, so that's \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people.

Adding these together, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we need to account for the people who couldn't come due to illness and those with previous commitments:

- 8 people couldn't come due to illness.
- 1/4 of the 8 people with illness had previous commitments, so \(8 \times \frac{1}{4} = 2\) people had previous commitments.

Therefore, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Subtracting the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited gives us the number of people who showed up for the party:

\[24 - 10 = 14\]

So, the final numerical answer is:
14"
"First, let's determine the number of marbles Solomon received from his father. Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna. His father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Therefore, the number of marbles Solomon received from his father is:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store. He initially had 50 marbles and added the 20 marbles he bought from Johanna. Then, his father gave him 8 more marbles. So, the total number of marbles is:

\[
50 + 20 + 8 = 78
\]

Each marble weighs 2 kg. Therefore, the total weight of the marbles is:

\[
78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kg}
\]

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{156}
\]"
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is in the shape of a rectangular prism, and the volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth (height) = 5 feet

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 5 \]

Calculating the volume:

\[ V = 24 \times 5 = 120 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is given as $0.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = \text{volume} \times \text{cost per cubic foot} \]

Substituting the volume and the cost per cubic foot:

\[ C = 120 \times 0.1 \]

Calculating the cost:

\[ C = 12 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The number of boys in the classroom is 30.
2. The number of girls is 3 times the number of boys. Therefore, the number of girls is \(3 \times 30 = 90\).
3. The number of nongendered children is \(\frac{1}{10}\) of the number of boys. Therefore, the number of nongendered children is \(\frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3\).

To find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children together:

\[ \text{Total children} = \text{Number of boys} + \text{Number of girls} + \text{Number of nongendered children} \]
\[ \text{Total children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 \]

So, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and there are 45 electric wires, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles.

Let \( P \) be the number of electric poles and \( W \) be the number of electric wires. According to the ratio, we have:
\[ \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Given \( W = 45 \), we substitute this value into the proportion:
\[ \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \]

To find \( P \), we solve the equation by cross-multiplying:
\[ P \times 3 = 45 \times 1 \]
\[ 3P = 45 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ P = \frac{45}{3} \]
\[ P = 15 \]

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

\[
\boxed{15}

"First, let's determine the total number of people at the party at the beginning. There were 25 men and 15 women, so the total number of people was:

\[ 25 + 15 = 40 \]

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. Therefore, the number of people who left is:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

This means that the number of people who stayed at the party is:

\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \]

We are given that 22 men stayed at the party. Let's denote the number of women who stayed as \( W \). Since the total number of people who stayed is 30, we can write the equation:

\[ 22 + W = 30 \]

Solving for \( W \):

\[ W = 30 - 22 = 8 \]

So, the number of women who stayed at the party is 8. Therefore, the number of women who left is:

\[ 15 - 8 = 7 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, we need to determine the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book and the book costs $4, we can calculate the cost of the magazine as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of magazine} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cost of book} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2
\]

Next, we need to find the cost of the pen, which is $1 less than the cost of the magazine. Therefore, we subtract $1 from the cost of the magazine:

\[
\text{Cost of pen} = \text{Cost of magazine} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1
\]

So, the cost of the pen is $1."
"First, let's determine the total number of pencils Jam has. We know that Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. Let's denote the number of pencils in each box as \( x \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]

To find the value of \( x \), we solve the equation step by step:

\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]
\[ 3x = 26 - 2 \]
\[ 3x = 24 \]
\[ x = \frac{24}{3} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, each box contains 8 pencils. Now, we calculate the total number of pencils Jam has:

\[ 3 \times 8 + 2 = 24 + 2 = 26 \]

Jam has 26 pencils. Meg has 46 pencils. To find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together, we add their individual totals:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Next, we need to determine how many boxes are required to store 72 pencils. Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total weakening of the coffee due to the cooling and the addition of cream.

First, let's calculate the weakening due to cooling. Each degree of cooling weakens the coffee by 13 milliliters. Shannon cools the coffee by 65 degrees, so the weakening due to cooling is:
\[ 65 \text{ degrees} \times 13 \text{ milliliters/degree} = 845 \text{ milliliters} \]

Next, we need to account for the weakening due to the addition of cream. Adding 15 milliliters of cream weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters. Therefore, the total weakening of the coffee is the sum of the weakening due to cooling and the weakening due to the addition of cream:
\[ 845 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 860 \text{ milliliters} \]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is \(\boxed{860}\) milliliters weaker when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream."
"To determine the total number of old records brought in by the 5 people, we need to understand the exchange rate and the final outcome.

Given:
- 2 old records can be traded for 1 new record.
- 5 people leave with 7 new records.

First, we calculate the total number of new records that can be obtained from trading old records:
- Since 2 old records are traded for 1 new record, to get 7 new records, we need:
\[ \frac{7 \text{ new records}}{1 \text{ new record per 2 old records}} \times 2 \text{ old records} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ old records} \]

Therefore, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of junior and senior programmers.

Given that the total number of employees is 100 and the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:
\[ \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers is:
\[ \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Next, we know that each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total amount paid to junior programmers per month is:
\[ \text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

The senior programmers are paid $400 more than the junior programmers, so each senior programmer is paid:
\[ \text{Payment to each senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400 \]

Therefore, the total amount paid to senior programmers per month is:
\[ \text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

Finally, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers:
\[ \text{Total payment to all programmers} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 224000 \]"
"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the number of people on the bus became \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on, so the number of people on the bus became \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).

We are given that at the third stop, there were 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( 14 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 14 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school: \(24 - 2 = 22\) lollipops left.
3. He passes 14 lollipops to his friends: \(22 - 14 = 8\) lollipops left.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which means he buys \(2 \times 14 = 28\) lollipops: \(8 + 28 = 36\) lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night: \(36 - 3 = 33\) lollipops.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning: \(33 - 2 = 31\) lollipops.

So, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is 31.

"To determine how long it will take to fully charge the cell phone from 60% to 100%, we first need to calculate the percentage of charging required. The phone needs to charge from 60% to 100%, which is a 40% increase.

Given that the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time required for a 40% increase as follows:

\[ \text{Time required} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Since the question asks for the time in hours, we convert 40 minutes to hours:

\[ 40 \text{ minutes} = \frac{40}{60} \text{ hours} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \text{ hours} \]"

"First, let's calculate the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip where they spent $80. For every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. 

Rewards earned = $80 / $20 = 4 rewards

Each reward is worth $1 off, so the customer earned 4 rewards, which means they can get $4 off their next purchase.

Next, let's calculate the rewards earned from their current shopping trip where they spent $43. 

Rewards earned = $43 / $20 = 2.15

Since they can only earn whole rewards, they earn 2 rewards. 

The customer used their rewards, which is $2 off their purchase. 

Then, they applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. 

The coupon amount = 2 * 2 = $4

Now, let's calculate the final price after applying the rewards and the coupon.

Original price = $43
Rewards discount = $2
Coupon discount = $4

Final price = $43 - $2 - $4 = $37

The customer paid $37 on this shopping trip."
"To determine which job Nick will make more money at, we need to calculate the net pay for both jobs.

**Job A:**
1. Annual gross pay: $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
2. State tax rate: 20%
3. State tax: $30,000 * 20% = $6,000
4. Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

**Job B:**
1. Annual gross pay: $42,000
2. Property tax: $6,000
3. Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000

"First, let's calculate the initial value of Maria's shares. She buys 8 shares at $8 each, so the initial value is:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8/\text{share} = \$64 \]

In the first year, the stock price increases by 50%. The new price per share after the increase is:
\[ \$8 \times (1 + 0.50) = \$8 \times 1.50 = \$12 \]

So, after the first year, the value of Maria's shares is:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12/\text{share} = \$96 \]

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. The new price per share after the decrease is:

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). Consequently, the number of students in the smallest group will be \( x - 10 \).

Given that the total number of students is 200, we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of students in all three groups:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two equal groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:

"Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \) and the number of chickens as \( H \). According to the problem, the total number of animals is 60, and there are twice as many chickens as cows. This gives us the following equations:

\[ H + C = 60 \]
\[ H = 2C \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( C \):

\[ 2C + C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:

\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of legs. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:

\[ \text{Total legs} = (2 \times H) + (4 \times C) = (2 \times 40) + (4 \times 20) = 80 + 80 = 160 \]

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the shirts without any discount. Davos bought 2 shirts, each costing $30, so the total cost is:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to apply the 40% discount. A 40% discount means Davos pays 60% of the original price. To find out how much he pays, we calculate 60% of $60:

\[ 60 \times 0.60 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final amount Davos paid for the 2 shirts is:

\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"First, let's calculate the daily revenue from tractor sales:
- They sold 10 tractors a day.
- Each tractor was sold for $100.

So, the daily revenue from tractor sales is:
\[ 10 \text{ tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate the daily revenue from silo sales:
- They sell 5 silos a day.
- Each silo is sold for $220.

So, the daily revenue from silo sales is:
\[ 5 \text{ silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day} \]

Now, we need to find the percentage increase in daily revenue from tractors to silos:
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New revenue} - \text{Old revenue}}{\text{Old revenue}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\$1100 - \$1000}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{\$100}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage more they are making per day now is:
\[ \boxed{10\%} \]"
"To calculate the total annual cost for Madeline's dog, we need to break down the costs for each category and then sum them up for a year.

1. **Food Cost:**
   - Cost per week: $25
   - Weeks per month: 4
   - Monthly cost of food: $25 * 4 = $100
   - Annual cost of food: $100 * 12 = $1200

2. **Treats Cost:**
   - Cost per month: $20
   - Annual cost of treats: $20 * 12 = $240

3. **Medicine Cost:**
   - Cost per month: $100
   - Annual cost of medicine: $100 * 12 = $1200

Now, we sum up the annual costs for all categories:
- Annual cost of food: $1200
- Annual cost of treats: $240
- Annual cost of medicine: $1200

Total annual cost: $1200 + $240 + $1200 = $2640

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{2640}

"To calculate the total hours of Peyton's after-work activities, we need to determine the duration of each activity and then sum them up.

1. **Monday's yoga class**: 1 hour
2. **Tuesday's cooking class**: 3 times the duration of Monday's yoga, which is \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours
3. **Wednesday's cheese-tasting event**: 0.5 hours
4. **Thursday's museum tour**: Half the duration of Tuesday's cooking class, which is \(3 / 2 = 1.5\) hours
5. **Friday's errands**: 2 hours

Now, we sum up the durations:
\[ 1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 8 \]

Therefore, the total number of hours for all of Peyton's after-work activities is 8 hours."
"First, let's determine the number of plant pots needed for the roses. Since the number of plant pots needed for the roses is twice the number needed for the daisies, and 30 plant pots are needed for the daisies, the number of plant pots needed for the roses is:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of plant pots needed for both the daisies and the roses:

\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \]

April had already bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many plant pots she has left over, we subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number of plant pots she already bought:

\[ 100 - 90 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of plant pots April has left over is:

\[ 10 \]"
"Let's denote the amount of money Andrea saved as \( S \).

According to the problem, Andrea started with $36. She then spent some money on a sweater that cost $11 and gave $4 to her brother. The remaining money after these expenditures is what she saved.

The equation representing the situation is:
\[ S = 36 - 11 - 4 \]

Now, let's calculate the value of \( S \):
\[ S = 36 - 11 - 4 = 21 \]

So, the amount Andrea saved is \( 21 \).

"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming.

John spends 6 hours boating. He spends half that time swimming, which is:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total time he spent watching shows. He watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is:
\[ 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 \text{ hours} \]

This 15 hours represents 30% of the total time he spent on his vacation. Let \( T \) be the total time spent on the vacation. We can set up the equation:
\[ 0.30T = 15 \]

Solving for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John spent 40% of his total time sightseeing. Therefore, the time spent sightseeing is:
\[ 0.40 \times 50 = 20 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Annabelle will earn from her first job. She earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours, so her earnings from the first job are:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Annabelle will earn from her second job. She earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours, so her earnings from the second job are:
\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's find the total amount of money Annabelle will have after working at both jobs. She already has $80 in her savings, so her total savings will be:
\[ 80 + 200 + 75 = 355 \text{ dollars} \]

The phone costs $400, so the amount of money Annabelle still needs to save is:
\[ 400 - 355 = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 45 \]"
"First, let's determine the height of the second tree. Since the second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, and the shortest tree is 6 feet tall, the height of the second tree is:
\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the combined height of the shortest and the second tree:
\[ 6 + 11 = 17 \text{ feet} \]

The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and the second tree:
\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height of the tallest tree is:
\[ 34 \text{ feet} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the toy cars Dean bought. Each toy car costs $2, and he bought 6 of them:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the teddy bears. Each teddy bear costs $1, and he bought 5 of them:
\[ 5 \times 1 = 5 \]

Now, let's find the total cost of the toys Dean bought:
\[ 12 + 5 = 17 \]

Dean initially had $28. After buying the toys, the amount of money he has left is:
\[ 28 - 17 = 11 \]

Dean's mother then gives him an extra $10. Adding this to the remaining money:
\[ 11 + 10 = 21 \]

Therefore, the final amount of money Dean has left is:
\[ 21 \]"
"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we first need to calculate the total cost of the activities she wants to do for herself and her friends.

1. **Cost of mini-golf**: Morgan wants to play one round of mini-golf, which costs $5.
2. **Cost of arcade tokens**: Morgan wants to have $5 worth of arcade tokens.
3. **Cost of go-karts**: Morgan wants to ride the go-karts twice, and each ride costs $10, so the total cost for go-karts is $10 * 2 = $20.

Now, we add up the costs of these activities:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of mini-golf} + \text{Cost of arcade tokens} + \text{Cost of go-karts} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 5 + 5 + 20 = 30 \]

Morgan's total budget for the party is $90. After accounting for the $30 spent on the activities, the remaining budget is:
\[ \text{Remaining budget} = 90 - 30 = 60 \]

Each friend will get $5 worth of arcade tokens and a round of mini-golf, which costs $5. Therefore, each friend will cost $10 in total (since $5 for mini-golf and $5 for arcade tokens).

To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend:
\[ \text{Number of friends} = \frac{60}{10} = 6 \]

Thus, Morgan can invite \(\boxed{6}\) friends."
"First, let's calculate how much Marisa spends on lollipops each day. She buys 4 lollipops every day, and each lollipop costs 25 cents. Therefore, the cost of the lollipops each day is:

\[ 4 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 100 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, 100 cents is equivalent to 1 dollar. So, Marisa spends $1 on lollipops each day.

Next, let's determine how much money Marisa has in her pocket every day after buying the lollipops. She gets $5 as pocket money every day, so the change she saves each day is:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars} - 1 \text{ dollar} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much money she saves over 5 days. Since she saves $4 each day, over 5 days she saves:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Billy spent on gumballs. He bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, so the total cost for the gumballs is:
\[ 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Since he took half of his change and spent it on gumballs, the total amount of money he had initially after buying the candy is:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

This means that the amount of money he spent on candy is:
\[ 10 - 4 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the candy costs $1.5 per pound, the number of pounds of candy he bought is:
\[ \frac{6}{1.5} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \]"
"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( x \). According to the problem, Carver's age (45 years) is 5 years less than twice his son's age. We can express this relationship with the following equation:

\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 25 \]"
"First, let's calculate the distance of the entire trip from the first city to the third city and back to the first city.

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city back to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the second and third city trip, which is \(100 - 50 = 50\) miles.

So, the total distance for one complete round trip (first to third city and back to the first city) is:
\[75 + 100 + 50 = 225 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[225 \times 3 = 675 \text{ miles}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance traveled in one day by the service interval:
\[\frac{675}{18000} = \frac{675 \div 75}{18000 \div 75} = \frac{9}{240} = \frac{3}{80}\]

To find out how many days it goes between services, we take the reciprocal of \(\frac{3}{80}\), which is \(\frac{80}{3}\). Calculating this gives:
\[\frac{80}{3} \approx 26.67\]

Since the train can't go a fraction of a day between services, we round up to the next whole number. Therefore, the train goes between services every 27 days.

The final numerical answer is:
\[27\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of stuffing required for each type of dog bed and then calculate the total amount needed for the specified number of beds.

First, let's find out how much stuffing a collie bed requires. The stuffing for a collie bed is the average of the stuffing for a Rottweiler and a chihuahua bed. A Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds of stuffing, and a chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing. Therefore, the stuffing for a collie bed is:

\[
\text{Stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the 4 chihuahua beds:

\[
\text{Total stuffing for chihuahua beds} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

Then, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the 3 collie beds:

\[
\text{Total stuffing for collie beds} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds to find the total amount of stuffing Mark needs:

\[
\text{Total stuffing} = 8 + 15 = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{23}

"First, we calculate the time John spent driving to his friend's house. The distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, and he drives at a speed of 70 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time taken to drive to his friend's house is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} = \frac{200 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{200}{70} \text{ hours} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 2.857 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the time John spent on the detour. The detour added 10 miles to his trip, so the total distance for the detour is:

\[ 200 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 210 \text{ miles} \]

The speed during the detour is 70 mph, so the time taken for the detour is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the time John spent driving home. The distance home is 240 miles, and he drives at a speed of 80 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{home}} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we add up all the times to find the total trip time:

\[ \text{Total Time} = \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} + \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} + \text{Time}_{\text{home}} = \frac{20}{7} + 3 + 3 \]

To add these times, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 7 and 1 is 7, so we convert 3 and 3 to fractions with denominator 7:

\[ 3 = \frac{21}{7} \]
\[ 3 = \frac{21}{7} \]

So, the total time is:

\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{20}{7} + \frac{21}{7} + \frac{21}{7} = \frac{20 + 21 + 21}{7} = \frac{62}{7} \approx 8.857 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total trip time is:

\[ \boxed{\frac{62}{7}} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of fourth-grade students at Small Tree School. We know there are 96 fourth-graders in total.

Next, we need to find out how many fourth-grade boys there are. We know that 43 of the 96 students are girls, so the number of boys is:
\[ 96 - 43 = 53 \]

On Friday, 5 girls and 4 boys were absent. To find out how many boys were present, we need to subtract the absent boys from the total number of boys:
\[ 53 - 4 = 49 \]

Therefore, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is:
\[ \boxed{49} \]"
"If there are 6 girls in the park and twice the number of boys, then there are \(2 \times 6 = 12\) boys in the park.

"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test, we start by calculating the total points she has already scored on her first two tests.

Points scored on the first test: 15 points
Points scored on the second test: 18 points

Total points scored on the first two tests:
\[ 15 + 18 = 33 \]

Jane needs a total of at least 42 points across all three tests. To find the minimum score she needs on the third test, we subtract the points she has already scored from the required total:

\[ 42 - 33 = 9 \]

Therefore, the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass is:
\[ 9 \]"
"Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as \( C \). According to the problem, \( C = 3 \).

The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is \( 4C - 5 \). Substituting \( C = 3 \) into this expression, we get:
\[ 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7. \]

The number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \).

Now, we know the total number of customers and shoplifters:
\[ C + 7 = 3 + 7 = 10. \]

The total number of people kicked out of the Walmart is 50. Therefore, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40. \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we first need to find out how many points Sara had initially. According to the problem, Sara scored 8 points. After scoring these 8 points, Erin now has three times more points than Sara.

Let's denote the points Erin had before scoring the additional 14 points as \( E \).

After scoring 14 points, Erin's total points are \( E + 14 \). According to the problem, this is three times Sara's points, which are 8 points. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ E + 14 = 3 \times 8 \]
\[ E + 14 = 24 \]

To find \( E \), we subtract 14 from both sides of the equation:
\[ E = 24 - 14 \]
\[ E = 10 \]

So, Erin had 10 points before scoring the additional 14 points. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break down the expenses into different components and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of picture frames:**
   - Each picture frame costs $20.
   - Each frame needs to be etched at an additional 20% cost.
   - The total cost per frame is $20 + 20% of $20 = $20 + $4 = $24.
   - There are 44 seniors, so the total cost for the picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. **Cost of pins:**
   - 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each.
   - The total cost for the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

3. **Cost of cords for officers:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so there are 44 / 4 = 11 officers.
   - Each officer will receive a cord that costs $12.
   - The total cost for the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, we sum up all the costs:
- Cost of picture frames: $1056
- Cost of pins: $10
- Cost of cords: $132

Total cost = $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total cost for Ethan if he makes his own hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the savings from the DIY option and then subtract that from the original cost.

The original cost of the wallpaper is $400. The DIY option saves 20% of this cost. First, we calculate 20% of $400:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.20 \times 400 = 80 \]

This means Ethan saves $80 by making his own wallpaper. Therefore, the total cost for Ethan if he makes his own wallpaper is:

\[ 400 - 80 = 320 \]

So, the total cost for Ethan is $320."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Friday Sales**: The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.
2. **Saturday Sales**: The store sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday. Therefore, the number of pairs sold on Saturday is:
   \[
   2 \times 14 = 28 \text{ pairs}
   \]
3. **Sunday Sales**: The store sold one-half the number of pairs sold on Saturday. Therefore, the number of pairs sold on Sunday is:
   \[
   \frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ pairs}
   \]
4. **Total Pairs Sold Before Returns**: Adding the pairs sold on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday:
   \[
   14 + 28 + 14 = 56 \text{ pairs}
   \]
5. **Returns**: Six pairs of shoes were returned, so we need to subtract these from the total pairs sold:

"First, let's determine the number of faulty pieces of equipment. Since 40% of the total number of pieces were faulty, we can calculate the number of faulty pieces as follows:

\[ \text{Number of faulty pieces} = 40\% \times \text{Total number of pieces} \]

Let's denote the total number of pieces as \( N \). Therefore, the number of faulty pieces is:

\[ \text{Number of faulty pieces} = 0.4N \]

The number of functioning pieces would then be:

\[ \text{Number of functioning pieces} = N - 0.4N = 0.6N \]

The total cost of the functioning pieces of equipment can be calculated by multiplying the number of functioning pieces by the cost per piece. Since the total cost of the equipment is $400,000, the cost per piece is:

\[ \text{Cost per piece} = \frac{\$400,000}{N} \]

Therefore, the total cost for the functioning pieces is:

\[ \text{Total cost of functioning pieces} = 0.6N \times \frac{\$400,000}{N} = 0.6 \times \$400,000 = \$240,000 \]

So, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is:

2. **Half of the sheep**: Half of 30 sheep is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \frac{30}{2} = 15
   \]
   So, 15 sheep provide 1 kg of milk each day.
3. **Other half of the sheep**: The other half of the sheep is also 15, and each provides 2 kg of milk each day.
4. **Milk from the first half**: 15 sheep provide 1 kg of milk each, so the total milk from this group is:
   \[
   15 \times 1 = 15 \text{ kg}

Additionally, Lindsay washes 15 loose socks. Therefore, the total number of socks she has washed is:
\[ 20 \text{ socks} + 15 \text{ socks} = 35 \text{ socks} \]

Lindsay started with 50 socks. To find out how many socks she has missed, we subtract the number of socks she has washed from the total number of socks:
\[ 50 \text{ socks} - 35 \text{ socks} = 15 \text{ socks} \]

Thus, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"

"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we first need to calculate the total interest she will pay over the five months and then find the total amount she will repay. Finally, we will divide this total repayment by the number of months.

The formula for the total amount to be repaid is:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} \]
\[ \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Here, the principal (P) is $3,650, the rate (R) is 10% or 0.10, and the time (T) is 5 months. Since the interest rate is given as an annual rate, we need to convert the time into years. There are 12 months in a year, so 5 months is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of a year.

First, calculate the interest:
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167 = 3650 \times 0.04167 = 151.665 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the interest is $151.67. Now, calculate the total amount to be repaid:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 151.67 = 3801.67 \]

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month for 5 months, we divide the total amount by 5:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3801.67}{5} = 760.334 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is $760.33.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{760.33} \]"
"First, we calculate the distance Cho hiked. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Cho, the speed is 14 kilometers per hour and the time is 8 hours. So, the distance Cho hiked is:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{h} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, we calculate the distance Chloe hiked. The speed for Chloe is 9 kilometers per hour and the time is 5 hours. So, the distance Chloe hiked is:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{h} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked, we subtract the distance Chloe hiked from the distance Cho hiked:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of silver and gold pesos Anna has.

Axel has 50 silver pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Axel has 80 gold pesos. Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so:
\[ 80 + 40 = 120 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of silver pesos they have together:
\[ 50 + 100 = 150 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of gold pesos they have together:
\[ 80 + 120 = 200 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Finally, to find the total number of pesos they have together, we add the total number of silver pesos and the total number of gold pesos:
\[ 150 + 200 = 350 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she can make 3 pitchers, the total number of cups is:
\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups/pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling all 36 cups of lemonade at $1 per cup:
\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1/\text{cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to determine the cost of making the lemonade. The cost is given as $18.

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue:
\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Millie sells all of the lemonade, and she sells an average of 4 cups per hour. To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours the lemonade stand is open:
\[ \frac{\$18}{4 \text{ hours}} = \$4.50/\text{hour} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$4.50 \]"
"Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially as \( L \).

According to the problem, he sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5} L = 12.8
\]

To find \( L \), we need to solve for \( L \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
L = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[
L = 12.8 \times 2.5
\]

To make the multiplication easier, we can convert 12.8 to a fraction:

\[
12.8 = \frac{128}{10} = \frac{64}{5}
\]

Now, we multiply:

\[
L = \frac{64}{5} \times 2.5 = \frac{64}{5} \times \frac{5}{2} = \frac{64 \times 5}{5 \times 2} = \frac{64}{2} = 32
\]

Thus, the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially is:

\[
\boxed{32}
\]"
"First, we need to determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 50\% \times 52 = 0.50 \times 52 = 26 \]

Since the choir is evenly split between boys and girls, the number of boys is also 26. Therefore, the total number of female members in the choir is:

\[ \text{Number of female members} = \text{Number of girls} = 26 \]

On the day of the performance, half the female members can't make it to the show because their bus breaks down. So, the number of female members who can't make it is:

\[ \text{Number of female members who can't make it} = \frac{1}{2} \times 26 = 13 \]

This means the number of female members who do make it to the show is:

\[ \text{Number of female members who make it} = 26 - 13 = 13 \]

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them, so the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

\[ \text{Total number of people who sang} = 13 + 3 = 16 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of the five test scores he received. The scores are 65, 94, 81, 86, and 74.

First, we sum these scores:
\[ 65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 \]

Let's add them step by step:
\[ 65 + 94 = 159 \]
\[ 159 + 81 = 240 \]
\[ 240 + 86 = 326 \]
\[ 326 + 74 = 400 \]

So, the total sum of the scores is 400. Next, we divide this sum by the number of tests, which is 5, to find the average:
\[ \frac{400}{5} = 80 \]

Therefore, Wilson's current math grade is 80.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine how many messages Mr. Yu receives. Since Mr. Yu receives 1/3 as many messages as Ms. Thompson, we calculate:

\[
\text{Messages to Mr. Yu} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

Next, we find the total number of messages delivered by adding the messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu:

\[
\text{Total messages} = 66 + 22 = 88
\]

So, the total number of messages James delivers is:

\[

"First, let's calculate the cost for David if he buys a ride bracelet. The ride bracelet costs $30 and gives 9 rides. So, David's total cost for 9 rides is $30.

Next, let's calculate the cost for Dasha if she buys tickets. Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2. Therefore, each ride costs $4. For 9 rides, Dasha would need 9 * $4 = $36. Since she buys tickets, she does not need to buy a ride bracelet.

Now, we compare the total costs:
- David's total cost: $30
- Dasha's total cost: $36

The amount of money David saves by buying the ride bracelet instead of buying tickets is $36 - $30 = $6.

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many popsicles Betty and Sam each have based on the given ratio and total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. The total parts of the ratio are 5 + 6 = 11 parts.

Given that the total number of popsicles is 165, we can find out how many popsicles each part of the ratio represents by dividing the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts in the ratio:
\[ \text{Number of popsicles per part} = \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can find out how many popsicles Betty and Sam have:
- Betty has \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \) popsicles.
- Sam has \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ \text{Difference} = 90 - 75 = 15 \]

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 15 \]"
"First, let's calculate the monthly cost of the streaming services after the 20% savings for bundling.

The normal cost for Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, so the total cost for both is:
\[ 10 + 10 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

With a 20% savings on bundling, the cost is reduced by:
\[ 20 \times 0.20 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost for Hulu and Disney Plus after the savings is:
\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add the cost of Netflix, which is $10 a month:
\[ 16 + 10 = 26 \text{ dollars} \]

Tim's cable package costs $60 a month. Therefore, the amount of money he saves by cancelling his cable package and switching to streaming services is:
\[ 60 - 26 = 34 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 34 \]"
"First, let's convert all the time spent into the same unit. We'll use minutes for this calculation.

Carol spends 4 hours writing a song. Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, 4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

She spends half that much time recording it, which is 240 / 2 = 120 minutes.

She spends 90 minutes editing it.

The total time spent is the sum of the time spent writing, recording, and editing:
240 minutes (writing) + 120 minutes (recording) + 90 minutes (editing) = 450 minutes.

To find the percentage of her total work time that she spent editing, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total time spent}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{90}{450} \right) \times 100 = \frac{1}{5} \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of her total work time that she spent editing is 20%."

"To determine the energy saved by Mel, we first need to calculate the energy consumption of the air conditioner under both scenarios: the original and the reduced usage.

1. **Original Usage:**
   - The air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour.
   - It is used for 8 hours a day.
   - Therefore, the daily energy consumption is:
     \[
     900 \text{ watts/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} = 7200 \text{ watt-hours/day}
     \]
   - To convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours (kWh), we divide by 1000:
     \[
     7200 \text{ watt-hours/day} \div 1000 = 7.2 \text{ kWh/day}
     \]
   - Over 30 days, the total energy consumption is:
     \[
     7.2 \text{ kWh/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 216 \text{ kWh}
     \]

2. **Reduced Usage:**
   - Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours a day, so he now uses the air conditioner for:
     \[
     8 \text{ hours/day} - 5 \text{ hours/day} = 3 \text{ hours/day}
     \]
   - The daily energy consumption with reduced usage is:
     \[
     900 \text{ watts/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 2700 \text{ watt-hours/day}
     \]
   - Converting to kilowatt-hours:
     \[
     2700 \text{ watt-hours/day} \div 1000 = 2.7 \text{ kWh/day}
     \]
   - Over 30 days, the total energy consumption is:
     \[
     2.7 \text{ kWh/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 81 \text{ kWh}
     \]

3. **Energy Saved:**
   - The energy saved over 30 days is the difference between the original and reduced energy consumption:
     \[
     216 \text{ kWh} - 81 \text{ kWh} = 135 \text{ kWh}
     \]

Therefore, the number of kilowatt-hours of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days is:

"To determine how much money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of sandwiches needed.
2. Determine the total amount of meat and cheese required.
3. Calculate the cost of the meat and cheese.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of sandwiches needed.**
There are 20 people and each sandwich serves 4 people.
\[
\text{Total number of sandwiches} = \frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people per sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches}
\]

**Step 2: Determine the total amount of meat and cheese required.**
Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.
\[
\text{Total meat required} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of meat}
\]
\[
\text{Total cheese required} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of cheese}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of the meat and cheese.**
The cost of meat is $7.00 per pound and the cost of cheese is $3.00 per pound.
\[
\text{Cost of meat} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times \$7.00 \text{ per pound} = \$35.00
\]
\[
\text{Cost of cheese} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times \$3.00 \text{ per pound} = \$15.00
\]

**Total cost:**

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of cannolis**: Allan initially has 40 cannolis.
2. **Cannolis after buying more**: Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new total of cannolis is:
   \[
   40 + 60 = 100 \text{ cannolis}
   \]
3. **Initial number of corns**: The problem states that there is twice as much corn as cannolis. Since initially there are 40 cannolis, the initial number of corns is:
   \[
   2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ corns}
   \]
4. **Corn after buying fewer**: Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis, so the new total of corns is:
   \[
   100 - 40 = 60 \text{ corns}
   \]
5. **Combined total of corns and cannolis**: Now, we add the new total of corns and cannolis:
   \[
   60 \text{ corns} + 100 \text{ cannolis} = 160
   \]

Therefore, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:

"To determine how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of steps Elliott had planned to take.
2. Determine how many steps he had taken before his jog.
3. Use the information about the remaining steps to find out how many steps he took during his jog.

First, Elliott planned to take 10,000 steps a day. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which means he took 5,000 steps on his walks to and from school. He then took an additional 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. Let's denote the number of steps he took during his jog as \( x \).

After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take. Therefore, the total number of steps he had taken before his jog can be expressed as:
\[ 5000 + 1000 + x = 10000 - 2000 \]
\[ 6000 + x = 8000 \]
\[ x = 8000 - 6000 \]
\[ x = 2000 \]

So, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is \(\boxed{2000}\)."

Next, we need to determine how long it will take Toby to read the entire book. Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute. Therefore, the time it takes to read the book is:
\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby plans to leave as soon as he finishes the book and it takes him 10 minutes to get to the airport. Therefore, the total time Toby will spend from starting to read until he reaches the airport is:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby has 60 minutes until he needs to be at the airport. Therefore, the number of minutes early Toby will be is:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 40 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by employees in May:**
   - Number of employees in May: 40
   - Hours worked per employee per week: 40
   - Weeks in May: 4 (assuming May has 4 weeks)
   - Total hours worked by employees in May: \( 40 \text{ employees} \times 40 \text{ hours/employee/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 6400 \text{ hours} \)

2. **Calculate the total amount of money paid to employees in May:**
   - Hourly wage: $15
   - Total amount paid in May: \( 6400 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 96000 \text{ dollars} \)

3. **Calculate the number of employees whose contracts expired in June:**
   - Number of employees whose contracts expired: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \)

4. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by employees in June:**
   - Number of employees remaining in June: \( 40 - 10 = 30 \)
   - Total hours worked by employees in June: \( 30 \text{ employees} \times 40 \text{ hours/employee/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 4800 \text{ hours} \)

5. **Calculate the total amount of money paid to employees in June:**
   - Total amount paid in June: \( 4800 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 72000 \text{ dollars} \)

6. **Calculate the total amount of money paid to employees in both months:**
   - Total amount paid in May and June: \( 96000 \text{ dollars} + 72000 \text{ dollars} = 168000 \text{ dollars} \)

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is sold in a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. Sally bought 2 pounds of taffy.

For the first pound, the cost is $3.
For the second pound, the cost is $3 - $1.50 = $1.50 (since it's half off).

So, the total cost for the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50 and the magnets cost $0.25 each. Sally bought 4 magnets, so the cost for the magnets is $0.25 * 4 = $1.00.

The total cost for the seashells and magnets is $1.50 + $1.00 = $2.50.

Now, let's add the cost of the taffy, seashells, and magnets to find the total amount spent:
$4.50 (taffy) + $2.50 (seashells and magnets) = $7.00.

Sally's parents gave her $10 to spend. So, the amount of money Sally has left is:
$10 - $7.00 = $3.00.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}

"First, let's calculate the cost of the two packs of fireworks. The first pack costs $400, and the second pack costs twice as much, which is $800. Adding these together gives:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost of the two packs of fireworks. A 20% discount means Tim pays 80% of the original cost. So, we calculate 80% of $1200:

\[ 1200 \times 0.80 = 960 \]

Now, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted cost of the fireworks:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is:

\[ \boxed{1110} \]"
"Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies a night. Over 30 days, she will eat:
\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, the number of dozens she needs to make is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. We know that 5% of the candles are dangerous and have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. Additionally, 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode. Therefore, 1% of the candles are dangerous and do not have the defect.

First, let's find out how many candles are dangerous:
\[ 50000 \times 0.05 = 2500 \text{ candles} \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these dangerous candles also have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. Since 5% of the candles are dangerous and have the defect, we calculate:
\[ 2500 \times 0.05 = 125 \text{ candles} \]

Thus, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is:
\[ \boxed{125} \]"
"First, we need to determine the discount price for each blouse. The regular price of each blouse is $20, and there is a 30% discount.

To find the discount amount, we calculate 30% of $20:
\[ 0.30 \times 20 = 6 \]

Subtract the discount amount from the regular price to find the sale price of each blouse:
\[ 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so we need to find the total cost for 4 blouses at the sale price of $14 each:
\[ 4 \times 14 = 56 \]

Thus, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:
\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees as \( A_{\text{tall}} \), from the shortest trees as \( A_{\text{short}} \), and from the average trees as \( A_{\text{avg}} \).

From the problem, we know:
- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, so \( A_{\text{tall}} = 30 \).
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, so \( A_{\text{short}} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \).
- Joanne gathers \( A_{\text{avg}} \) apples from the average trees.

Her sister gathers:
- Twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
- Three times as many apples from the shortest trees, so \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
- No apples from the average trees, so \( 0 \) apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne and her sister is 500. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total apples gathered as:
\[ A_{\text{tall}} + A_{\text{short}} + A_{\text{avg}} + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 30 + 15 + A_{\text{avg}} + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Simplifying the left side:
\[ 150 + A_{\text{avg}} = 500 \]

Solving for \( A_{\text{avg}} \):
\[ A_{\text{avg}} = 500 - 150 \]
\[ A_{\text{avg}} = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{350} \]"
"Let's denote the number of camels as \( C \) and the number of dromedaries as \( D \).

From the problem, we have two equations:
1. The total number of heads: \( C + D = 180 \)
2. The total number of humps: \( 2C + D = 304 \)

We can solve these equations step by step. First, we'll subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( D \):

\[ (2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180 \]
\[ 2C + D - C - D = 124 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

Now that we know the number of camels, we can substitute \( C = 124 \) back into the first equation to find \( D \):

\[ 124 + D = 180 \]
\[ D = 180 - 124 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 56 \]"
"To determine the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we need to break down the distances traveled each day and then sum them up.

1. **First 4 days:**
   - Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the first 4 days: \( 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \).

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - Tom traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days.
   - Distance traveled in the next 2 days: \( 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \).

3. **The fifth day:**
   - Tom did not travel at all.
   - Distance traveled on the fifth day: \( 0 \text{ km} \).

4. **The sixth day:**
   - Tom traveled 300 kilometers.
   - Distance traveled on the sixth day: \( 300 \text{ km} \).

5. **The seventh day:**
   - Tom traveled 300 kilometers.
   - Distance traveled on the seventh day: \( 300 \text{ km} \).

Now, we sum up all the distances:
- First 4 days: \( 800 \text{ km} \)
- Next 2 days: \( 240 \text{ km} \)
- Fifth day: \( 0 \text{ km} \)
- Sixth day: \( 300 \text{ km} \)
- Seventh day: \( 300 \text{ km} \)

Total distance: \( 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 300 \text{ km} + 300 \text{ km} = 1640 \text{ km} \).

The total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is \( 1640 \text{ km} \)."
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to work backwards from the information given about Peter's locker.

1. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. If Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, then Zack's locker is:
\[ \text{Zack's locker} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches} \]

2. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. If Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches, then Timothy's locker is:

So, the size of Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches."
"Stanley's comb fell from an elevation of 10,000 feet to 6,000 feet (10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet). Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet - 6,000 feet = -3,000 feet. However, since the question asks how many feet Oliver must climb, and climbing cannot be negative in this context, the answer is that Oliver must descend 3,000 feet.

"First, let's determine how much money Mr. Josue received from the second bank. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is $4000. Therefore, the amount from the second bank is:
\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Mr. Josue received from both banks:
\[ 4000 + 8000 = 12000 \]

Now, we add the total amount of money he received from the banks to his initial capital:
\[ 5000 + 12000 = 17000 \]

Thus, the total capital Mr. Josue has now is:
\[ \boxed{17000} \]"
"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, which means a total of \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cats were taken away. Therefore, the number of cats remaining on the rock is \(50 - 20 = 30\).

Later, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse they'd seen. The number of cats that ran away is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \). Thus, the number of cats left on the rock is \(30 - 18 = 12\).

"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service with the given pricing structure, we need to break down the cost into segments based on the different rates.

1. **First 6 months**: The cost is $8 per month.
   \[
   6 \text{ months} \times \$8/\text{month} = \$48
   \]

2. **Next 2 months (months 7 and 8)**: The cost is the normal rate of $12 per month.
   \[
   2 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$24
   \]

3. **Next 8 months (months 9 to 16)**: The cost is the increased rate of $14 per month.
   \[
   8 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$112
   \]

4. **Remaining 4 months (months 17 to 20)**: The cost is the increased rate of $14 per month.
   \[
   4 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$56
   \]

Now, we sum up all these costs to find the total cost for 2 years:
\[
\$48 + \$24 + \$112 + \$56 = \$240
\]

The total cost for 2 years of the service is \(\boxed{240}\)."
"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:
\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much Cole saved from each type of jeans. Cole saved a total of $6, and he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. This means he saved:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]
from the jogger jeans, and:
\[ 6 - 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]
from the tattered jeans.

Now, let's verify the savings. The cost of the tattered jeans is $28, and Cole saved $4 from it. The cost of the jogger jeans is $22, and Cole saved $2 from it. The total savings are:
\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]
which matches the given total savings.

The question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. The original cost of the jogger jeans is $22, and the original cost of the tattered jeans is $28. The difference is:
\[ 28 - 22 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 more than the tattered jeans. The final numerical answer is:

Next, we calculate the capacity of the minibusses:
\[ 6 \text{ minibusses} \times 30 \text{ employees per minibus} = 180 \text{ employees} \]

Then, we calculate the capacity of the minivans:
\[ 10 \text{ minivans} \times 15 \text{ employees per minivan} = 150 \text{ employees} \]

Finally, we sum the capacities of all the vehicles:
\[ 240 \text{ employees} + 180 \text{ employees} + 150 \text{ employees} = 570 \text{ employees} \]

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is:

"First, let's determine the total number of bird feeders Lillian has. She builds 3 and buys 3 more, so she has a total of 3 + 3 = 6 bird feeders.

Next, we need to calculate the number of birds that each type of feeder attracts. The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each, and the bird feeders Lillian made attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, which means they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

Now, we can calculate the total number of birds that can be expected to visit the garden each day. Since there are 3 store-bought feeders and 3 bird feeders Lillian made, the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders is 3 * 20 = 60 birds, and the total number of birds attracted by the bird feeders Lillian made is 3 * 30 = 90 birds.

Adding these together, the total number of birds expected to visit the garden each day is 60 + 90 = 150 birds.

"First, let's determine the cost of the soup. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. Since the bagel costs $4, we can calculate the cost of the soup as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of soup} = \text{Cost of bagel} + 0.25 \times \text{Cost of bagel} \]
\[ \text{Cost of soup} = 4 + 0.25 \times 4 \]
\[ \text{Cost of soup} = 4 + 1 \]
\[ \text{Cost of soup} = 5 \]

Next, we know the cake costs half the price of the bagel. Since the bagel costs $4, the cake costs:

\[ \text{Cost of cake} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cost of bagel} \]
\[ \text{Cost of cake} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 \]
\[ \text{Cost of cake} = 2 \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the dinner by adding the cost of the soup, the bagel, and the cake:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of soup} + \text{Cost of bagel} + \text{Cost of cake} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 5 + 4 + 2 \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 11 \]

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for the dinner she ordered."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of cards Kenny started with. Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( x \).

Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards, so he sells 2/3 of them. The number of cards he sells is \( \frac{2}{3}x \). He sells each card for $1.5, so the total amount of money he earns from selling the cards is \( 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}x = x \).

According to the problem, after selling the cards, Kenny has $50 in spending cash and the remaining $50 to buy the ticket to the amusement park, which costs $100. This means the total amount of money he has after selling the cards is $100. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x = 100 \]

So, Kenny started with \( x = 100 \) cards.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many hotdogs the caterer initially prepared. Since half of the 40 guests would have two hotdogs each, we calculate:

\[
\frac{40}{2} \times 2 = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ hotdogs}
\]

The caterer prepared 40 hotdogs, but 40 guests showed up, and each guest wanted a second hotdog. This means that the caterer needs to provide 40 more hotdogs to satisfy the second hotdog request for each of the 40 guests. However, the caterer only has 40 hotdogs, so he can only provide one hotdog to each guest.

Since there are 40 guests and the caterer can only provide one hotdog per guest, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:

\[
40 - 40 = 0
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- The pot and pans set costs $120.00.
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so the total for the utensils is $5.00 * 5 = $25.00.

Adding these together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[ 120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $165.00:
\[ 0.20 \times 165.00 = 33.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Charlotte has to pay:

"First, we need to determine how much gas is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we can calculate the amount of gas per container as follows:

\[ \text{Gas per container} = \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5 \text{ containers}} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Josey needed \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a container, so we calculate the amount of gas she needed in gallons:

\[ \text{Gas needed by Josey} = \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to convert gallons to pints. Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we can convert \( \frac{3}{4} \) gallons to pints as follows:

\[ \text{Gas needed by Josey in pints} = \frac{3}{4} \times 8 \text{ pints} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine how much money George spent on chips. We know that George got 3 bags of chips and each bag costs 40 cents. Therefore, the total cost for the chips is:
\[ 3 \times 40 \text{ cents} = 120 \text{ cents} \]

Next, we need to find out how much money George had initially. We know that after spending 120 cents on chips, he had 1% of his initial money left. This means that 89% of his initial money was spent on chips. Let's denote the initial amount of money George had as \( M \) cents. Therefore, we have:
\[ 0.89M = 120 \text{ cents} \]

To find \( M \), we solve the equation:
\[ M = \frac{120}{0.89} \approx 134.83 \text{ cents} \]

Since George spent $5, which is 500 cents, we can verify that:
\[ 0.89 \times 500 = 445 \text{ cents} \]
This means George had 500 cents initially, and after spending 445 cents on chips, he had 55 cents left, which is indeed 1% of 500 cents.

Now, we need to determine how many candy bars George bought. Each candy bar costs 75 cents. The amount of money George spent on candy bars is:
\[ 500 - 120 = 380 \text{ cents} \]

The number of candy bars he bought is:
\[ \frac{380}{75} = \frac{380 \div 5}{75 \div 5} = \frac{76}{15} \approx 5.07 \]

Since George can only buy whole candy bars, he bought 5 candy bars. Therefore, the number of candy bars George bought is:

Therefore, everyone will get \(\boxed{7}\) oranges."
"First, let's determine the amount of onions Antoine uses. The recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, and he doubles that amount:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00 \text{ per pound} = \$8.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box is $2.00:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00 \text{ per box} = \$4.00 \]

Adding the cost of the onions and the beef stock gives us the total cost:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

\[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00 \text{ per serving} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes for Bernadette to drive to the theater. The problem states that the drive from Bernadette’s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne’s hotel. Therefore, the time it takes for Bernadette to drive to the theater is:
\[ 4 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne will take 4 minutes to drive to the theater, Bernadette should leave 5 minutes before the time Wayne leaves. Therefore, Bernadette should leave:
\[ 4 \text{ minutes} - 5 \text{ minutes} = -1 \text{ minute} \]

Since Bernadette cannot leave negative time before Wayne, we interpret this as Bernadette should leave 1 minute before Wayne to ensure she arrives 5 minutes before him. Thus, Bernadette should leave 1 minute before Wayne.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to convert the length from yards to feet and then use the area to find the width. Finally, we will calculate the perimeter.

1. **Convert the length from yards to feet:**
   - 1 yard = 3 feet
   - Length = 3 yards = 3 * 3 feet = 9 feet

2. **Calculate the width using the area formula:**
   - Area = Length * Width
   - 360 square feet = 9 feet * Width
   - Width = 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet

3. **Calculate the perimeter:**
   - Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
   - Perimeter = 2 * (9 feet + 40 feet) = 2 * 49 feet = 98 feet

The final numerical answer is 98 feet."
"First, let's calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

So, the total number of beads Elizabeth bought is:
\[ 1 \text{ pack of red} + 2 \text{ packs of clear} = 1 \times 20 + 2 \times 20 = 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ beads} \]

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

So, the total number of beads Margareth bought is:
\[ 3 \text{ packs of blue} + 4 \text{ packs of red} = 3 \times 20 + 4 \times 20 = 60 + 80 = 140 \text{ beads} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:
\[ 140 \text{ beads} - 60 \text{ beads} = 80 \text{ beads} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we calculate the temperature increase due to the oven. Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour. Therefore, the total temperature increase from the oven is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, we calculate the temperature decrease due to the window. Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Therefore, the total temperature decrease from the window is:
\[ \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 3 \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 6 \text{ degrees} \]

Now, we add the temperature increase from the oven and the temperature decrease from the window to find the final temperature of the house:
\[ 40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees} \]

The house's final temperature is:

"First, let's convert all times to minutes for easier calculation:
- Jon's total time: \(40 + 100 + 50 = 190\) minutes.
- James' swim time: \(40 \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36\) minutes.
- James' bike time: \(100 + 5 = 105\) minutes.
- James' run time: unknown, let's call it \(R\) minutes.

James' total time is the sum of his swim, bike, and run times:
\[36 + 105 + R = 141 + R\]

We know that Jon won the race by 10 minutes, so James' total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[141 + R = 190 + 10\]
\[141 + R = 200\]
\[R = 200 - 141\]
\[R = 59\]

So, James took 59 minutes to do the run. The final numerical answer is:
\[59\]"
"First, let's convert the length of Movie C into minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 1.25 hours is equal to \(1.25 \times 60 = 75\) minutes.

Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so the length of Movie B is \(75 + 5 = 80\) minutes.

Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, so the length of Movie A is \(\frac{80}{4} = 20\) minutes.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 20."
"First, we need to determine how many miles the horse runs. The horse runs at a speed of 32 miles per hour for 30 minutes, which is half an hour. Therefore, the distance the horse runs is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 32 \, \text{MPH} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 16 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of hay the horse eats. Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, the total amount of hay eaten is:

\[ \text{Total Hay} = 16 \, \text{miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \, \text{bail/mile} = 8 \, \text{bails} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the hay. Since each bail of hay costs $3, the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 8 \, \text{bails} \times 3 \, \text{dollars/bail} = 24 \, \text{dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which amount to:

\[ \text{Total Money} = 6 \times 5 = 30 \, \text{dollars} \]

The change Michael has after buying the hay is:

\[ \text{Change} = 30 \, \text{dollars} - 24 \, \text{dollars} = 6 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of eggs Rozanne has. She uses 4 dozen eggs, and since one dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs equal \(4 \times 12 = 48\) eggs. She also has 2 loose eggs. Therefore, the total number of eggs is \(48 + 2 = 50\) eggs.

Next, we need to find out how many glasses of eggnog she can make. Since each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs, the number of glasses she can make is \(50 \div 5 = 10\) glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog, the number of trays she can put out is \(10 \div 5 = 2\) trays.

The final numerical answer is:

Difference in points = Joey's new score - Marcy's new score
Difference in points = 240 - 235 = 5

Joey is now winning by 5 points."
"First, let's calculate the cost price per sneaker:
\[ \text{Cost price per sneaker} = \frac{\$576}{48 \text{ sneakers}} = \$12 \text{ per sneaker} \]

Next, let's calculate the revenue from the flash sale:
\[ \text{Revenue from flash sale} = 17 \text{ sneakers} \times \$20 = \$340 \]

Now, let's determine the number of sneakers sold to the department store:
\[ \text{Number of sneakers sold to department store} = 48 \text{ sneakers} - 17 \text{ sneakers} = 31 \text{ sneakers} \]

Then, let's calculate the revenue from the department store:
\[ \text{Revenue from department store} = 31 \text{ sneakers} \times \$25 = \$775 \]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = \text{Revenue from flash sale} + \text{Revenue from department store} = \$340 + \$775 = \$1115 \]

Finally, let's calculate the profit:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = \$1115 - \$576 = \$539 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the regular price of the popcorn as \( P \).

The cost of the movie ticket and the popcorn and soda together with the super ticket is:
\[ 20 + 1 = 21 \]

The cost of the movie ticket and the popcorn and soda separately is:
\[ 12 + P + 3 = 15 + P \]

According to the problem, you saved $2 by choosing the separate purchase over the super ticket. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 21 - (15 + P) = 2 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 21 - 15 - P = 2 \]
\[ 6 - P = 2 \]
\[ P = 6 - 2 \]
\[ P = 4 \]

So, the regular price of the popcorn is \( \$4 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the initial cost per balloon and then calculate the new cost per balloon after the price increase. Finally, we will use this new cost to find out how much Bentley paid for 170 balloons.

First, let's find the initial cost per balloon. The total cost for 20 balloons was $900. Therefore, the cost per balloon initially is:
\[
\text{Initial cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars}
\]

Two days later, the cost per balloon increased by $20. So, the new cost per balloon is:
\[
\text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we need to find out how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons at the new price. The total cost for 170 balloons at the new price is:
\[
\text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = 170 \times 65
\]

Let's calculate this:
\[
170 \times 65 = 170 \times (60 + 5) = 170 \times 60 + 170 \times 5 = 10200 + 850 = 11050

"To find the average speed of the car during the entire trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

First, calculate the distance for each segment of the trip:
- For the first segment: \(60 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles}\)
- For the second segment: \(30 \text{ mph} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 30 \text{ miles}\)

Next, add the distances to find the total distance:
- Total distance = \(120 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 150 \text{ miles}\)

Now, calculate the total time taken:
- Total time = \(2 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} = 3 \text{ hours}\)

Finally, calculate the average speed:
- Average speed = \(\frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ mph}\)

The car's average speed during the trip is \(50 \text{ mph}\)."
"First, let's determine how many sapphires Jenna has left after the trade. Jenna starts with 8 sapphires and trades 3 of them, so she has:

\[ 8 - 3 = 5 \text{ sapphires} \]

Next, we calculate the value of the sapphires Jenna has left. Since each sapphire is worth $800, the value of the 5 sapphires is:

\[ 5 \times 800 = 4000 \text{ dollars} \]

Jenna trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. Now, we need to determine the value of the 2 rubies. Since each ruby is worth $1200, the value of the 2 rubies is:

\[ 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the total value of all Jenna's jewels, we add the value of the sapphires and the value of the rubies:

"First, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the raised bed) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{height} \]

For one raised bed, the volume is:

\[ V = 2 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:

\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 \, \text{cubic feet} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet per bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{dollars per bag} = 1920 \, \text{dollars} \]

Thus, the total cost for the potting soil is:

"First, let's determine the number of green cards. We know there are 15 red cards and that the number of green cards is 60% more than the number of red cards.

The number of green cards can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + (0.60 \times 15) \]

Let's calculate this:
\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + (0.60 \times 15) = 15 + 9 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find the number of yellow cards. According to the problem, the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the number of red and green cards.

The number of yellow cards can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Number of yellow cards} = \text{Number of red cards} + \text{Number of green cards} \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Number of yellow cards} = 15 + 24 = 39 \]

Now, we can find the total number of cards by adding the number of red, green, and yellow cards:
\[ \text{Total number of cards} = \text{Number of red cards} + \text{Number of green cards} + \text{Number of yellow cards} \]
\[ \text{Total number of cards} = 15 + 24 + 39 \]

Let's calculate this:

2. After 20 minutes, one of her friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there. Since Katelyn saw 50 fairies, half of that is:
   \[
   \frac{50}{2} = 25
   \]
   So, 25 fairies joined the 50 fairies that were already there.
3. The total number of fairies after the new fairies joined is:
   \[
   50 + 25 = 75
   \]
4. Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. So, the number of fairies remaining is:

"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of the feed.

1. **Sugar Cubes:**
   - Each box weighs 1 pound.
   - He buys 2 boxes.
   - Total weight of sugar cubes = 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

2. **Carrots:**
   - Each bag weighs 12 pounds.
   - He buys 4 bags.
   - Total weight of carrots = 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

3. **Hay:**
   - Each bale weighs 75 pounds.

   - Total weight of hay = 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

4. **Oats:**
   - Each sack weighs 65 pounds.
   - He buys 20 sacks.
   - Total weight of oats = 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

Now, we sum the weights of all the feed items to find the total weight:
\[
\text{Total weight} = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 \text{ pounds}
\]

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find the number of trips needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since partial trips are not possible):
\[
\text{Number of trips} = \left\lceil \frac{4500}{2250} \right\rceil = \left\lceil 2 \right\rceil = 2
\]

Thus, the farmer needs to make \(\boxed{2}\) trips to transport all the feed."

"First, let's calculate the total number of pencils the class started with. Since there are 30 students and each student started with 10 pencils, the total number of pencils is:

\[ 30 \times 10 = 300 \]

After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. So, the number of pencils used is:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 300 = 60 \]

This means the number of pencils remaining after two months is:

\[ 300 - 60 = 240 \]

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. So, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 240 = 80 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 80 \]"
"Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of cookies Matt can have is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Cookies} = \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know that Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total. So, we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first isolate \( \frac{x}{2} \) by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ \frac{x}{2} = 5 - 2 \]
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ x = 3 \times 2 \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll use inches.

1 foot = 12 inches

The shark's length is 10 feet, which is:
\[ 10 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 120 \text{ inches} \]

Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is:
\[ 2 \times 6 \text{ inches} = 12 \text{ inches} \]

To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Length of remoras}}{\text{Length of shark}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{120 \text{ inches}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{10} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many kids are not allergic to anything, we need to first determine how many kids are allergic to at least one of the allergens (dairy or peanuts).

Given:
- 9 kids are allergic to dairy.
- 6 kids are allergic to peanuts.
- 3 kids are allergic to both dairy and peanuts.

We can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find the number of kids allergic to at least one of the allergens:
\[ \text{Allergic to dairy or peanuts} = \text{Allergic to dairy} + \text{Allergic to peanuts} - \text{Allergic to both} \]
\[ \text{Allergic to dairy or peanuts} = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to at least one of the allergens. Since there are 32 kids in total, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:
\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Cost of Razors:**
   - Heather buys 2 packs of razors.
   - Each pack costs $4.00.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 2 packs without any discounts is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) dollars.

2. **Discount Application:**
   - The discount is ""buy one get one free,"" which means for every pack she buys, she gets another pack for free.
   - Since she buys 2 packs, she gets 2 packs for free.
   - This means she only pays for 2 packs, but gets 4 packs in total.
   - The total cost remains $8.00.

3. **Coupon Application:**
   - Heather has a $2.00 coupon.
   - After applying the coupon, the total cost is \(8.00 - 2.00 = 6.00\) dollars.

4. **Total Number of Razors:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors.
   - Therefore, 2 packs contain \(2 \times 4 = 8\) razors.

5. **Cost per Individual Razor:**
   - The total cost is $6.00 for 8 razors.
   - To find the cost per razor, divide the total cost by the number of razors: \(\frac{6.00}{8} = 0.75\) dollars.

6. **Convert to Cents:**
   - Since 1 dollar is 100 cents, 0.75 dollars is \(0.75 \times 100 = 75\) cents.

Therefore, the final numerical answer in cents is:
\[
\boxed{75}

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total height of the human pyramid based on the heights of the cheerleaders.

First, let's determine the average height of the cheerleaders. There are 10 cheerleaders, with 9 of them being 64 inches tall and 1 being 60 inches tall. The average height is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Average height} = \frac{(9 \times 64) + 60}{10} = \frac{576 + 60}{10} = \frac{636}{10} = 63.6 \text{ inches}
\]

Now, we need to find the total height of the human pyramid. The pyramid consists of 4 girls on the bottom, 3 girls on the next level, 2 girls on the next level, and 1 girl at the top. The heights of the girls are 64 inches, 64 inches, 64 inches, 64 inches, 60 inches, and the average height of the other 6 girls is 63.6 inches.

The total height of the pyramid is the sum of the heights of all the girls:

\[
\text{Total height} = 4 \times 64 + 3 \times 64 + 2 \times 64 + 1 \times 60 + 6 \times 63.6
\]

Calculating each term:

\[
4 \times 64 = 256
\]
\[
3 \times 64 = 192
\]
\[
2 \times 64 = 128
\]
\[
1 \times 60 = 60
\]
\[
6 \times 63.6 = 381.6
\]

Adding these together:

\[
256 + 192 + 128 + 60 + 381.6 = 1017.6 \text{ inches}
\]

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):

\[
\text{Total height in feet} = \frac{1017.6}{12} = 84.8 \text{ feet}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the number of guests for which the costs of the two venues are equal, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let \( n \) be the number of guests.

**Cost at the first venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Cost of food per guest: $5
- Total cost at the first venue: \( 200 + 5n \)

**Cost at the second venue:**
- Cost per guest: $25
- Cost of food per guest: $0 (included in the price)
- Total cost at the second venue: \( 25n \)

We need to find the value of \( n \) for which the costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5n = 25n \]

To solve for \( n \), we first isolate \( n \) on one side of the equation:
\[ 200 + 5n = 25n \]
\[ 200 = 25n - 5n \]
\[ 200 = 20n \]

Next, we divide both sides by 20:
\[ n = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ n = 10 \]

Thus, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \( 10 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \( D \). According to the problem, Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects. Additionally, David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects. The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides to isolate the term with \( D \):

\[ 4D = 36 \]

Now, divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( D \):

\[ D = 9 \]

Since David found 9 insects, Lily found \( D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \) insects. Therefore, the number of insects Lily found is:

"To determine the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his sled dogs, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
2. Determine how many pairs of snowshoes are needed.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of pairs of snowshoes.

First, we know that each dog has 4 legs and there are 6 dogs:
\[ 6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Since each pair of snowshoes covers one leg, Mario will need 24 pairs of snowshoes:
\[ 24 \text{ pairs of snowshoes} \]

Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, so the total cost is:
\[ 24 \text{ pairs} \times 12 \text{ dollars per pair} = 288 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is:
\[ \boxed{288} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of Janet's current bus trips. She takes two bus trips each day and does this five days a week. Therefore, the number of bus trips she takes in a week is:

\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 10 \text{ trips/week} \]

The cost of each bus trip is $2.20, so the total cost for her current bus trips in a week is:

\[ 10 \text{ trips/week} \times \$2.20/\text{trip} = \$22.00 \text{ per week} \]

Next, we compare this to the cost of a weekly bus pass, which is $20. The savings from buying the bus pass instead of paying for individual trips each week is:

\[ \$22.00 - \$20.00 = \$2.00 \]

So, Janet would save $2.00 by buying the weekly bus pass."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Farm Cows and Sheep:**
   - The farm has 30 cows.
   - The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has \(2 \times 30 = 60\) cows.

2. **Zoo Sheep:**
   - The zoo has 20 sheep.
   - The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has \(\frac{20}{2} = 10\) sheep.

3. **Total Animals:**
   - The farm has 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.
   - The zoo has 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.
   - Combined, the farm and zoo have 40 + 80 = 120 animals.

The final numerical answer is:
120"
"To determine how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we start by understanding the relationship between the quantities bought by Sophia and Rose. According to the problem, Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.

Given:
- Rose bought 12 onions.
- Rose bought 4 potatoes.

Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as \( S_o \) and the number of potatoes Sophia bought as \( S_p \).

From the problem, we know:
\[ 4 \times (S_o + S_p) = 12 + 4 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[ 4 \times (S_o + S_p) = 16 \]

Next, we solve for \( S_o + S_p \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ S_o + S_p = \frac{16}{4} \]
\[ S_o + S_p = 4 \]

Therefore, Sophia bought a total of 4 onions and potatoes. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we first need to calculate the total number of calories he needs to burn to lose 30 pounds. Given that he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose one pound, the total calories he needs to burn to lose 30 pounds is:

\[ 3500 \text{ calories/pound} \times 30 \text{ pounds} = 105000 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to determine the number of days from December 31st to July 19th. Counting the days:

- December has 31 days, so from December 31st to December 19th is 19 days.
- January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 19th is 19 days.
- February has 28 days in a non-leap year, so from February 1st to February 19th is 19 days.
- March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 19th is 19 days.
- April has 30 days, so from April 1st to April 19th is 19 days.
- May has 31 days, so from May 1st to May 19th is 19 days.
- June has 30 days, so from June 1st to June 19th is 19 days.
- July 1st to July 19th is 19 days.

Adding these up, the total number of days from December 31st to July 19th is:

\[ 19 + 19 + 19 + 19 + 19 + 19 + 19 + 19 = 152 \text{ days} \]

Now, to find the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to maintain, we divide the total calories he needs to burn by the number of days:

\[ \frac{105000 \text{ calories}}{152 \text{ days}} \approx 690.13 \text{ calories/day} \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, Andy needs to maintain a daily calorie deficit of approximately 690 calories."
"Gerald earns $30 per day and works for 7 days in a week. Therefore, his total earnings for the week are:

\[ 30 \times 7 = 210 \]

He spent a total of $100. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings:

\[ 210 - 100 = 110 \]

\[ 8 \text{ laps} \times 0.25 \text{ km/lap} = 2 \text{ km} \]

Next, we need to determine how much water Hannah needs to drink. She needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs. Therefore, for 2 km, the total amount of water she needs to drink is:

\[ 2 \text{ km} \times 60 \text{ ml/km} = 120 \text{ ml} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 120 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much money Julie spent on clothes. She spent 20% of $500 on clothes:

\[ 0.20 \times 500 = 100 \]

So, the remaining money after buying clothes is:

\[ 500 - 100 = 400 \]

Next, Julie spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs:

\[ 0.25 \times 400 = 100 \]

Therefore, the remaining money after buying CDs is:

\[ 400 - 100 = 300 \]

So, the final amount of money Julie had left is:

\[ 300 \]"
"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, the house cost three times as much as the lot, so we can write:

\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]

Combining like terms, we have:

\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

To find \( L \), we divide both sides by 4:

\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000 \]

Now that we know the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):

\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000 \]

So, the cost of the house is \( 90,000 \).

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 90,000 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the canvas bags that Tara bought. She bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each, and each pack costs $4.

Total cost = Number of packs × Number of bags per pack × Cost per pack
Total cost = 8 × 5 × $4
Total cost = 40 × $4
Total cost = $160

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the canvas bags. Tara sold each of the 40 bags for $8.

Total revenue = Number of bags sold × Price per bag
Total revenue = 40 × $8
Total revenue = $320

Now, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $320 - $160
Profit = $160

The final numerical answer is $160."

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has. He has four $10 bills and six $20 bills.

The total amount from the $10 bills is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

The total amount from the $20 bills is:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of money Ali has:
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \]

Next, Ali gives half of this total amount to his sister. So, the amount given to his sister is:
\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \]

The remaining amount of money Ali has after giving half to his sister is:
\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \]

Ali then uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining amount to buy dinner. The amount used for dinner is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = \frac{3 \times 80}{5} = \frac{240}{5} = 48 \]

The amount of money Ali has left after buying dinner is:
\[ 80 - 48 = 32 \]

Therefore, the final amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is:

"To determine the total number of skeins of wool Martha will need, we first calculate the number of each item she needs to knit for her 3 grandchildren. Then, we multiply the number of each item by the number of skeins required for that item.

- Hats: 3 hats × 2 skeins per hat = 6 skeins
- Scarves: 3 scarves × 4 skeins per scarf = 12 skeins
- Sweaters: 3 sweaters × 12 skeins per sweater = 36 skeins
- Mittens: 3 pairs × 1 skein per pair = 3 skeins
- Socks: 3 pairs × 2 skeins per pair = 6 skeins

Now, we sum up all the skeins needed:
6 (hats) + 12 (scarves) + 36 (sweaters) + 3 (mittens) + 6 (socks) = 63 skeins

Therefore, Martha will need to buy 63 skeins of wool."
"First, let's calculate the number of problems Chris completes on Tuesday. Since he completes 3 times as many problems on Tuesday as he did on Monday, and he completed 12 problems on Monday, the number of problems he completes on Tuesday is:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of problems completed by the end of Tuesday. Adding the problems completed on Monday and Tuesday, we get:
\[ 12 + 36 = 48 \]

Now, we determine the number of problems remaining after Tuesday. Since Chris had 100 problems initially, the number of problems left after Tuesday is:
\[ 100 - 48 = 52 \]

On Wednesday, Chris completes one-quarter of the remaining problems. Therefore, the number of problems he completes on Wednesday is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 52 = 13 \]

Finally, we calculate the number of problems left to complete on Thursday by subtracting the problems completed on Wednesday from the remaining problems after Tuesday:
\[ 52 - 13 = 39 \]

Thus, the number of math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday is:
\[ \boxed{39} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of quarts each person can pick per hour:

- Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.
- Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
- Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick \(5 \times 2 = 10\) quarts per hour.
- Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than does Kathy, so Ricky can pick \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, let's add up the quarts picked per hour by all four individuals:

- Tony: 6 quarts
- Bobby: 5 quarts
- Kathy: 10 quarts
- Ricky: 8 quarts

Total quarts picked per hour = \(6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29\) quarts.

"To calculate the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily consumption before adding the new device.
2. Calculate the daily consumption after adding the new device.
3. Calculate the weekly consumption before and after adding the new device.
4. Calculate the weekly cost before and after adding the new device.
5. Find the difference between the weekly costs.

**Step 1: Daily consumption before adding the new device**
- Daily consumption = 12 kilowatts per hour

**Step 2: Daily consumption after adding the new device**
- Daily consumption = 12 kilowatts per hour + 2 kilowatts per hour = 14 kilowatts per hour

The difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is $21."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which the painters work and then use that rate to find out how long it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house.

First, let's find out how much one person can paint in one day. Since one person can paint half a house in 5 days, in one day, one person can paint:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \text{ house} \div 5 \text{ days} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ house per day}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much one person can paint in one hour. Since there are 24 hours in a day, one person can paint:
\[
\frac{1}{10} \text{ house per day} \div 24 \text{ hours per day} = \frac{1}{240} \text{ house per hour}
\]

Now, if we have 5 people working together, the combined rate of painting is:
\[
5 \times \frac{1}{240} \text{ house per hour} = \frac{5}{240} \text{ house per hour} = \frac{1}{48} \text{ house per hour}
\]

To find out how many hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house, we take the reciprocal of the combined rate:
\[
\frac{1 \text{ house}}{\frac{1}{48} \text{ house per hour}} = 48 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house. The final numerical answer is:
\[

"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and relationships given in the problem.

Let \( S_O \) be the number of sofas Ophelia has, and \( C_O \) be the number of chairs Ophelia has. Similarly, let \( S_J \) be the number of sofas Jenna has, and \( C_J \) be the number of chairs Jenna has.

From the problem, we know:
1. Ophelia has 20 sofas, so \( S_O = 20 \).
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so \( S_O = C_O - 2 \).
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so \( C_J = 3C_O \).
4. Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so \( S_J = C_J - 2 \).

First, we can find the number of chairs Ophelia has:
\[ S_O = C_O - 2 \]
\[ 20 = C_O - 2 \]
\[ C_O = 22 \]

Next, we can find the number of chairs Jenna has:
\[ C_J = 3C_O \]
\[ C_J = 3 \times 22 \]
\[ C_J = 66 \]

Now, we can find the number of sofas Jenna has:
\[ S_J = C_J - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 66 - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 64 \]

Finally, we can find the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together:
\[ \text{Total} = S_O + C_O + S_J + C_J \]
\[ \text{Total} = 20 + 22 + 64 + 66 \]
\[ \text{Total} = 172 \]

The total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have is \(\boxed{172}\)."
"To determine how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had not purchased the headphone set, we first need to find out how much money he spent on the headphone set.

Total amount paid: $48
Cost of the CD: $4

Amount spent on the headphone set = Total amount paid - Cost of the CD
Amount spent on the headphone set = $48 - $4 = $44

Now, we need to find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with the $44 he spent on the headphone set.

Cost of one CD: $4

Number of CDs Tom could have bought with $44 = Amount spent on headphone set / Cost of one CD
Number of CDs Tom could have bought with $44 = $44 / $4 = 11

Therefore, if Tom had not bought the headphone set, he would have been able to buy 11 more CDs.

The final numerical answer is 11."
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we need to account for the hours he worked out each week, considering the exceptions.

First, let's calculate the total hours if he worked out 4 hours every week:
\[ 4 \text{ hours/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to account for the additional hours he worked out in the two weeks where he worked out 5 hours each week:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

Then, we account for the additional hour he worked out in one week where he worked out 6 hours:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/week} \times 1 \text{ week} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we sum up all the hours:
\[ 32 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, his current age is \( 27 - 5 = 22 \) years.

2. **Determine the age of Jame's cousin in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 27 + 8 = 35 \) years old.
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \( 2 \times 35 = 70 \).
   - Therefore, Jame's cousin will be \( 70 - 5 = 65 \) years old in 8 years.

3. **Determine Jame's cousin's current age:**
   - If Jame's cousin will be 65 in 8 years, then his current age is \( 65 - 8 = 57 \) years.

4. **Calculate the age difference between Jame and his cousin:**

"Let's denote the cost of the computer as \( C \), the cost of the printer as \( P \), and the cost of one monitor as \( M \).

Given:
- The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400.
- The cost of the computer is $1,100.
- The cost of the printer is $400 less than the cost of the computer.

From the given information, we can write the following equations:
1. \( C + 2M + P = 2400 \)
2. \( C = 1100 \)
3. \( P = C - 400 \)

First, substitute the value of \( C \) into the third equation:
\[ P = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

Now, substitute the values of \( C \) and \( P \) into the first equation:
\[ 1100 + 2M + 700 = 2400 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 1800 + 2M = 2400 \]

Subtract 1800 from both sides:
\[ 2M = 600 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ M = 300 \]

Thus, the cost of one monitor is \( \boxed{300} \) dollars."
"To find out how many seashells each girl brought, we first need to determine the number of boys and girls. Since there are 20 kids in total and they are divided into two equal groups, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

Each boy brought back 60 seashells. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is:
\[ 10 \text{ boys} \times 60 \text{ seashells/boy} = 600 \text{ seashells} \]

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. So, the total number of seashells brought by the girls is:
\[ 600 \text{ seashells} + 4 \times 600 \text{ seashells} = 600 \text{ seashells} + 2400 \text{ seashells} = 3000 \text{ seashells} \]

Since there are 10 girls, the number of seashells each girl brought is:
\[ \frac{3000 \text{ seashells}}{10 \text{ girls}} = 300 \text{ seashells/girl} \]

Thus, the number of seashells brought by each girl is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and then sum them up.

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so its thickness is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so its thickness is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm.

Now, we sum the thicknesses of all four books:
\[31 + 50 + 45 + 62\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[31 + 50 = 81\]
\[81 + 45 = 126\]
\[126 + 62 = 188\]

Therefore, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many more vlogs Emma needs to make to complete her monthly goal of 72 vlogs, we can subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her monthly goal.

Vlogs made so far: 18 (first week) + 21 (second week) + 15 (third week) = 54 vlogs

Monthly goal: 72 vlogs

Vlogs still needed: 72 - 54 = 18 vlogs

So, the final numerical answer is 18."
"First, we need to calculate the tip. The tip is 20% of the dinner bill. The dinner bill is $50.

\[ \text{Tip} = 50 \times \frac{20}{100} = 50 \times 0.20 = 10 \]

Next, we add the tip to the original dinner bill to find out the total amount paid.

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 50 + 10 = 60 \]

So, the final amount you ended up paying is $60."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Sharing:**
   - The total amount is $18.
   - It is shared among 3 boys.
   - Each boy's initial share is \(\frac{18}{3} = 6\) dollars.

2. **Eldest Boy's Actions:**
   - The eldest boy adds $5 to his initial share.
   - His new share is \(6 + 5 = 11\) dollars.
   - The following day, he adds another $10.
   - His total after adding $10 is \(11 + 10 = 21\) dollars.

3. **Spending:**
   - The eldest boy spends $8.
   - His remaining amount is \(21 - 8 = 13\) dollars.

4. **Tripling the Remaining Amount:**
   - He triples the remaining amount.
   - His new total is \(13 \times 3 = 39\) dollars.

Therefore, the final amount the eldest boy has is \(\boxed{39}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable parts. Let's denote the daily savings in the first half of April as \( x \). Therefore, the daily savings in the second half of April would be \( 2x \).

April has 30 days, so the first half of April consists of 15 days and the second half also consists of 15 days.

The total savings in April can be calculated as follows:
- Savings in the first half: \( 15x \)
- Savings in the second half: \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \)

The total savings for the month of April should be $1125:
\[ 15x + 30x = 1125 \]
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 45:
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Elvis needs to save $25 each day in the first half of April. For the second half of April, he needs to save:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save $50 for each day in the second half of the month."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the apples:
\[ 3 \text{ apples} \times \$1.50 \text{ per apple} = \$4.50 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the oranges:

"First, let's calculate how much Jairus earns for completing 20 tasks. Jairus earns $0.8 for each task, so for 20 tasks, he earns:
\[ 0.8 \times 20 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate how much Jenny earns for completing 20 tasks. Jenny earns $0.5 for each task, so for 20 tasks, she earns:
\[ 0.5 \times 20 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much more Jairus earns than Jenny, we subtract Jenny's earnings from Jairus's earnings:
\[ 16 - 10 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \]"
"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars. The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's amount as follows:

\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 80 \]"
"Jeff walks 6 miles to work one way. Since he walks to work and back home each day, he walks 12 miles per day (6 miles each way). If he has to work 5 times a week, then the total miles he walks in a week is 60 miles (12 miles/day * 5 days/week).

"To determine the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Rewriting**: Elise writes the entire alphabet twice.
   - The alphabet has 26 letters.
   - Therefore, writing it twice means \(26 \times 2 = 52\) letters.

2. **Second Rewriting**: Elise writes half of the alphabet once.
   - Half of the alphabet is \(26 / 2 = 13\) letters.
   - Therefore, writing half of the alphabet once means \(13\) letters.

3. **Third Rewriting**: Elise rewrites everything she has already written.
   - This includes the two full alphabets and the half alphabet.
   - The total number of letters already written is \(52 + 13 = 65\).
   - Rewriting everything means writing \(65\) letters again.

Now, we sum up all the letters written:
- First rewriting: \(52\) letters.
- Second rewriting: \(13\) letters.
- Third rewriting: \(65\) letters.

Adding these together:
\[ 52 + 13 + 65 = 130 \]

Thus, the total number of letters Elise has written is \(\boxed{130}\)."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many toys Jonathan currently has. Let's break down the information given:

1. James's play set has 80 toys.
2. Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have enough toys to make a sorted play set five times larger than James's play set.

First, calculate the size of the play set that is five times larger than James's play set:
\[ 5 \times 80 = 400 \text{ toys} \]

Jonathan needs 400 toys to have a play set five times larger than James's. Let \( x \) be the number of toys Jonathan currently has. According to the problem, Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he currently has to reach 400 toys:
\[ x + 2 = 400 \]

"First, let's calculate the total cost of each item before the discount:

- The cost of five notebooks is \(5 \times \$1.50 = \$7.50\).
- The cost of two pens is \(2 \times \$0.25 = \$0.50\).
- The cost of one calculator is \(1 \times \$12 = \$12\).
- The cost of one geometry set is \(1 \times \$10 = \$10\).

Next, we sum these amounts to find the total cost before the discount:
\[
\$7.50 + \$0.50 + \$12 + \$10 = \$20
\]

Now, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
\[
10\% \text{ of } \$20 = 0.10 \times \$20 = \$2

"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break down the commission structure into two parts: the commission for the first $1000 and the additional commission for the amount over $1000.

1. For the first $1000, the commission is 30%.
2. For the amount over $1000 (which is $1500 in this case), the commission is an additional 10% on top of the 30%.

Let's calculate each part:

- Commission on the first $1000: \(1000 \times 0.30 = 300\)
- Commission on the amount over $1000: \(1500 \times 0.10 = 150\)

Now, we add these two amounts to find the total commission:

- Total commission: \(300 + 150 = 450\)

Therefore, Antonella earned $450 from her sales."
"First, let's calculate the total number of bottles Bill currently has. He has 2 cases of water, and each case contains 24 bottles. Therefore, the total number of bottles he currently has is:

\[ 2 \text{ cases} \times 24 \text{ bottles/case} = 48 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of bottles Bill needs for his 70 guests, with each guest receiving 2 bottles of water:

\[ 70 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ bottles/guest} = 140 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, we subtract the number of bottles Bill currently has from the total number of bottles he needs to find out how many additional bottles he needs to buy:

"First, let's determine how long it takes Ray to swim a mile when the water is warm.

Given:
- When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.
- When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold.

Let's calculate the time it takes to swim a mile in warm water:
- Twice the time it takes to swim a mile in cold water is \(2 \times 16 = 32\) minutes.
- Adding 2 minutes to this gives \(32 + 2 = 34\) minutes.

So, it takes Ray 34 minutes to swim a mile in warm water.

Next, we calculate the time it takes to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water:
- In cold water, it takes \(16 \times 3 = 48\) minutes to swim 3 miles.
- In warm water, it takes \(34 \times 3 = 102\) minutes to swim 3 miles.

Finally, we find the difference in time between swimming 3 miles in warm water and cold water:
- The difference is \(102 - 48 = 54\) minutes.

Therefore, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate how much John earns in a day. He earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day, so his daily earnings are:
\[ 2 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours/day} = 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \]

Next, let's calculate his weekly earnings. He works 4 days a week, so his weekly earnings are:
\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 4 \, \text{days/week} = 40 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Now, we need to determine how many weeks it will take for John to save $80. We do this by dividing the total amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:
\[ \frac{80 \, \text{dollars}}{40 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 2 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80."

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes in all the buttons.

First, we know that there are 21 buttons in total. Out of these, 7 buttons have 2 holes each. So, the number of holes in these 7 buttons is:
\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ holes} \]

The rest of the buttons have 4 holes each. Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 of them have 2 holes, the number of buttons with 4 holes is:
\[ 21 - 7 = 14 \text{ buttons} \]

The number of holes in these 14 buttons is:
\[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \text{ holes} \]

"First, let's determine the daily recommended cups of coffee for Octavia. Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, if we denote the daily recommended cups of coffee as \( R \), then Octavia drinks \( \frac{R}{2} \) cups of coffee.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks. Therefore, Juan drinks \( 10 \times \frac{R}{2} = 5R \) cups of coffee.

According to Juan's doctor, Juan's coffee intake should be reduced to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. This means Juan needs to reduce his coffee intake from \( 5R \) cups to 4 cups.

To find out by how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we calculate the difference between his current intake and the recommended intake:
\[ 5R - 4 \]

Since \( R \) is the daily recommended cups of coffee, the reduction Juan must make is:
\[ 5R - 4 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

   - Therefore, the total cost for 4 packs is \(4 \times 3 = 12\).

James spends $12 on candles."
"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the pages read in the first week and add it to the pages read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week. She read for 15 minutes each night for 7 nights, so the total reading time in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pages she can read in 105 minutes. Since she can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, we first find out how many 1.5-minute intervals are in 105 minutes:
\[ \frac{105 \text{ minutes}}{1.5 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 70 \text{ intervals} \]

Since she reads 2 pages in each 1.5-minute interval, the total number of pages read in the first week is:
\[ 70 \text{ intervals} \times 2 \text{ pages/interval} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

Now, we know that in the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equation based on the information given.

Let \( x \) be the nephew's current age.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( 44 + 7 = 51 \) years old.

In 7 years, the nephew's age will be \( x + 7 \).

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. This gives us the equation:
\[ 51 = 3(x + 7) \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ 51 = 3(x + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3x + 21 \]
\[ 51 - 21 = 3x \]
\[ 30 = 3x \]
\[ x = 10 \]

"To find out how many goals all three teenagers scored, we need to determine the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna based on the information given.

First, we know that Richie scored 80 goals. According to the problem, Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. Therefore, we can calculate the number of goals Mark scored as follows:
\[ \text{Goals scored by Mark} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 20 = 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Next, we know that Richie also scored 45 more goals than Anna. Therefore, we can calculate the number of goals Anna scored as follows:
\[ \text{Goals scored by Anna} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 45 = 80 - 45 = 35 \]

Now, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers by adding the goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna:
\[ \text{Total goals} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} + \text{Goals scored by Mark} + \text{Goals scored by Anna} = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 \]

\[ 84 \text{ dollars} - 63 \text{ dollars} = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 21 \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Peter spends on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. Since he spends an equal amount each day and there are 4 days (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday), we can calculate the total amount spent on wooden action figures as follows:

\[ \text{Total spent on wooden action figures} = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Peter started with $70, so after buying the wooden action figures, he has:

\[ \text{Remaining money} = 70 - 20 = 50 \]

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Sunday), Peter will buy plastic action figures. There are 3 days (Thursday, Friday, and Saturday) during which he will spend his remaining money on plastic action figures. Each plastic action figure costs $2, so the number of plastic action figures he can buy is:

\[ \text{Number of plastic action figures} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week. He bought 4 wooden action figures and 25 plastic action figures, so the total number of action figures is:

The total cost for Leah so far is $308."
"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we first need to calculate the total number of roses he grows in a week and then compare it to the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops.

Ford grows 40 roses every week. The flower shops order a total of:
- The first flower shop orders 20 roses.
- The second flower shop orders 15 roses.
- The third flower shop orders 30 roses.

So, the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week is:
\[ 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \]

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops in a month is:
\[ 65 \times 4 = 260 \]

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so in a month, he grows:
\[ 40 \times 4 = 160 \]

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the number of roses he grows from the number of roses ordered:
\[ 260 - 160 = 100 \]

Thus, the number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"To determine how much money Katina will have remaining in her savings account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount she removes over that period and subtract it from her initial amount.

First, calculate the total number of months in 2 years:
\[ 2 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ months} \]

Next, calculate the total amount removed from the account over 24 months:
\[ 24 \text{ months} \times 100 \text{ dollars/month} = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in the account:

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"To calculate the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet, we need to consider the cost of the carpet, the cost of padding, the cost of removing the old carpet, and the cost of installing the new carpet.

First, let's calculate the area of the bedroom:
\[ \text{Area} = 18 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the carpet:
\[ \text{Cost of carpet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times (12 + 2) \text{ dollars per square foot} = 216 \times 14 = 3024 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of padding:
\[ \text{Cost of padding} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times 2 \text{ dollars per square foot} = 432 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of removing the old carpet:
\[ \text{Cost of removing old carpet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times 4 \text{ dollars per square foot} = 864 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost of installing the new carpet:
\[ \text{Cost of installing new carpet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times 34 \text{ dollars per square foot} = 7344 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding all these costs together gives us the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 3024 + 432 + 864 + 7344 = 11664 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet is:
\[ \boxed{11664} \]"

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage error in Maggie's oven and then apply that same percentage to the 520 degrees she needs for her recipe.

First, let's calculate the percentage error for the 450 degrees setting:
- The actual temperature is 468 degrees.
- The error is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees.
- The percentage error is (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.

Now, we apply this 4% error to the 520 degrees required for her recipe:
- The error in degrees for 520 degrees is 520 * 0.04 = 20.8 degrees.
- The actual temperature she should set the oven to is 520 - 20.8 = 499.2 degrees.

Therefore, the temperature she should set the oven to is 499.2 degrees."
"To determine the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to add the duration of each movie together.

First, convert the duration of the first movie into minutes:
- The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long.
- 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes.
- Therefore, 1 hour and 30 minutes is \(60 + 30 = 90\) minutes.

Next, convert the duration of the second movie into minutes:
- The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long.
- 2 hours is equal to 120 minutes.
- Therefore, 2 hours and 5 minutes is \(120 + 5 = 125\) minutes.

Now, add the durations of both movies:
- The total duration is \(90 + 125 = 215\) minutes.

Thus, the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is 215 minutes."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we first need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and then subtract that from Herb's price.

Herb's house price = $76,000

30% of Herb's house price = 0.30 * $76,000 = $22,800

Juan's house price = Herb's house price - 30% of Herb's house price
Juan's house price = $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

Now, we add the prices of both houses to find the combined value:

Combined value = Herb's house price + Juan's house price
Combined value = $76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200

The value of the two houses combined is $129,200."
"First, let's determine the number of cups and dishes Judy initially bought.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups.

She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.

At the event, her friend brought 40 cups. Since Judy initially bought 12 cups, her friend brought \(40 - 12 = 28\) more cups than Judy bought.

Her friend also brought 20 more dishes than Judy bought. Since Judy bought 24 dishes, her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend.

Judy's total cups: \(12\) (bought) + \(28\) (brought by friend) = \(40\) cups.
Judy's total dishes: \(24\) (bought) + \(44\) (brought by friend) = \(68\) dishes.

The total number of utensils (cups and dishes) brought by the two is:
\[40 \text{ cups} + 68 \text{ dishes} = 108 \text{ utensils}\]

"First, let's calculate the discounted price of one box of contacts. The original price of one box is $100.00, and it is currently 10% off. The discount amount is:

\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the discounted price of one box is:

\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost for the 2 boxes is:

\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Since each box contains 90 single use contacts, 2 boxes will contain:

\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \]

The cost per pair of contacts (which is 90 contacts) is:

\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total hours Jill worked.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so:
\[ \text{Total hours Jill worked} = 2 + 1 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total hours John worked.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so:
\[ \text{John's hours on Saturday} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so:
\[ \text{John's hours on Sunday} = 3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Adding these together gives John's total hours worked:
\[ \text{Total hours John worked} = 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the total earnings for both Jill and John.

Jill's earnings:
\[ \text{Jill's earnings} = 3 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = 3 \times 10 = \$30 \]

John's earnings:
\[ \text{John's earnings} = 7 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = 7 \times 10 = \$70 \]

Finally, we find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill:
\[ \text{Difference in earnings} = \$70 - \$30 = \$40 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total calories burned from aerobics:
- Hannah spends 2 hours doing aerobics.
- Aerobics burn 500 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from aerobics = 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.

Next, let's calculate the total calories burned from running:
- Hannah spends 1 hour running.
- Running burns 600 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from running = 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.

Now, let's find the total calories burned:
- Total calories burned = calories burned from aerobics + calories burned from running
- Total calories burned = 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories.

Finally, let's calculate the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink:
- Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned.
- Total water needed = (Total calories burned / 200 calories) * 100 ml
- Total water needed = (1600 calories / 200 calories) * 100 ml = 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml.

The final numerical answer is 800 ml."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the note, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \). Similarly, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of the red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \), we divide both sides by 3:
\[ B = 1500 \]

Now we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
- The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \).
- The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \).

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:
\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 30 \]"

"First, let's calculate the total cost for the boots on Amazon.com:
- The cost of the boots on Amazon.com is $16.
- The shipping cost on Amazon.com is $4.
- Therefore, the total cost on Amazon.com is $16 + $4 = $20.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the boots on eBay:
- The cost of the boots on eBay is $13.
- The shipping cost on eBay is twice the shipping cost on Amazon.com. Since the shipping cost on Amazon.com is $4, the shipping cost on eBay is 2 * $4 = $8.
- Therefore, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

Now, let's find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon.com:
- The total cost on Amazon.com is $20.
- The total cost on eBay is $21.
- The difference in cost is $21 - $20 = $1.

"To determine how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms every day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of protein John gets from 200 grams of mushrooms in one day.
2. Multiply the daily protein intake by the number of days in a week (7 days).

First, we find the protein content per 200 grams of mushrooms:
- 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein.
- Therefore, 200 grams of mushrooms will contain \( \frac{200}{100} \times 3 = 2 \times 3 = 6 \) grams of protein per day.

Next, we calculate the total protein intake for a week:
- John eats 6 grams of protein per day.
- In a week, he will consume \( 6 \times 7 = 42 \) grams of protein.

Thus, the total grams of protein John gets per week is 42 grams."
"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Expanding and simplifying the equation:
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
\[ J - 2J = -10 \]
\[ -J = -10 \]
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

George needs 2 implants, each with a base price of $2000. Therefore, the cost for the implants is:
\[ 2 \times 2000 = 4000 \]

For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. Therefore, the total cost for the implants and the porcelain crown is:
\[ 4000 + 500 = 4500 \]

George has already put down a deposit of $600. Therefore, the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
\[ 4500 - 600 = 3900 \]

George makes $15 per hour at work. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
\[ \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \]

So, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 260 \]"
"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees, and the other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees. The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees, the angle that is twice the smallest angle is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees, and the angle that is three times the smallest angle is \( 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees. The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

"First, let's determine the total amount of money Colby has in cents. We know that:
- 1 quarter = 25 cents
- 1 dime = 10 cents
- 1 nickel = 5 cents
- 1 penny = 1 cent

Colby has:
- 8 quarters = 8 * 25 cents = 200 cents
- 6 dimes = 6 * 10 cents = 60 cents
- 14 nickels = 14 * 5 cents = 70 cents
- 15 pennies = 15 * 1 cents = 15 cents

Adding these amounts together gives:
200 cents + 60 cents + 70 cents + 15 cents = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can find out how many gumballs Colby can buy by dividing the total amount of money he has by the cost of one gumball:

2. On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
3. On Wednesday, he spends four times as much as on Tuesday, which is \(4 \times 16 = 64\) dollars.

Now, we sum up the total amount spent over the three days:
\[8 + 16 + 64 = 88\]

Howard originally had $100. After spending $88, the amount of money he has left is:
\[100 - 88 = 12\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}

"To calculate the total earnings from selling lemonade, we need to break down the problem into two parts based on the given time periods and then sum the earnings.

For the first four hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.

The total number of cups sold in the first four hours is:
\[ 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

The total earnings from the first four hours is:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = \$30 \]

For the next two hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.

The total number of cups sold in the next two hours is:
\[ 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

The total earnings from the next two hours is:
\[ 20 \text{ cups} \times \$0.60/\text{cup} = \$12 \]

Adding the earnings from both periods gives the total earnings:
\[ \$30 + \$12 = \$42 \]

So, the total money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours is:

"First, let's determine the total number of rotations the tires make in a month. Given that the car drives 400 miles a month and the tires rotate 725 times for every 2 miles, we can calculate the total rotations per month as follows:

\[ \text{Rotations per mile} = \frac{725}{2} \]
\[ \text{Rotations per month} = 400 \times \frac{725}{2} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of rotations per month:

\[ \text{Rotations per month} = 400 \times 362.5 = 145000 \]

Now, we know that each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations. To find out how many months the tires can last, we divide the total number of rotations each tire can handle by the number of rotations per month:

\[ \text{Months per tire} = \frac{10,440,000}{145000} \]

Let's calculate this value:

\[ \text{Months per tire} = 72 \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can determine the number of years the tires can last by dividing the number of months by 12:

\[ \text{Years per tire} = \frac{72}{12} = 6 \]

Therefore, the tires need to be replaced after 6 years. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To find out how much each pump costs, we first need to determine the total number of washes Jackie can get from one bottle of shampoo. Since the directions say 2 pumps give 120 washes, we can calculate the number of washes per pump:

\[ \text{Washes per pump} = \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washes per pump} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pumps are in the bottle. Since the bottle gives 120 washes and each pump gives 60 washes, the number of pumps in the bottle is:

\[ \text{Number of pumps} = \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{60 \text{ washes per pump}} = 2 \text{ pumps} \]

The total cost of the bottle is $24.00. To find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the number of pumps:

\[ \text{Cost per pump} = \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 12.00 \text{ dollars per pump} \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert dollars to cents (1 dollar = 100 cents):

\[ 12.00 \text{ dollars} = 12.00 \times 100 \text{ cents} = 1200 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the cost of each pump is:

\[ \boxed{1200} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the discounted price of the shirt and the shorts. The shirt originally costs $25 and there is a 30% off sale.

The discount on the shirt is:
\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]

So, the discounted price of the shirt is:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

The shorts originally cost $35 and there is also a 30% off sale.

The discount on the shorts is:
\[ 35 \times 0.30 = 10.50 \]

So, the discounted price of the shorts is:
\[ 35 - 10.50 = 24.50 \]

Next, we add the discounted prices of the shirt and the shorts to find the total cost of the outfit:
\[ 17.50 + 24.50 = 42.00 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. After purchasing the outfit, the amount of money he will have left is:
\[ 50 - 42.00 = 8.00 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 8.00 \]"
"To determine how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a week.
2. Determine the total amount of butter required based on the number of dozens.

First, Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week. There are 7 days in a week, so the total number of dozens of croissants he wants to make is:
\[ 4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we know that it takes \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. Therefore, for 28 dozen croissants, the total amount of butter needed is:
\[ 28 \text{ dozen} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total amount of butter Juan will need is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the cost to repave Monica's street. The cost per meter is $194, and the length of Monica's street is 150 meters.

\[
\text{Cost for Monica's street} = 150 \text{ meters} \times 194 \text{ dollars/meter} = 29100 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street. The length of Lewis' street is 490 meters.

\[
\text{Cost for Lewis' street} = 490 \text{ meters} \times 194 \text{ dollars/meter} = 94860 \text{ dollars}
\]

To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we subtract the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis' street.

\[
\text{Difference in cost} = 94860 \text{ dollars} - 29100 \text{ dollars} = 65760 \text{ dollars}

"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the funding into two parts: the initial funding and the additional funding.

1. **Initial Funding:**
   - John receives $100,000 for the first 5 months.
   - Therefore, the initial funding is $100,000.

2. **Total Duration of Research:**
   - The research takes 10 times the initial 5 months.
   - Therefore, the total duration is \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \) months.

3. **Additional Funding:**
   - The first 5 months cost $100,000.
   - The remaining 45 months (50 months total - 5 months initial) require 50% more funding per month.
   - Let \( F \) be the monthly funding for the first 5 months.
   - Therefore, \( F = \frac{100,000}{5} = 20,000 \) dollars per month.
   - The increased funding per month for the remaining 45 months is \( 20,000 \times 1.5 = 30,000 \) dollars per month.

4. **Total Funding for the Remaining Months:**
   - The total funding for the remaining 45 months is \( 45 \times 30,000 = 1,350,000 \) dollars.

5. **Total Cost of Research:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the initial funding and the additional funding.
   - Therefore, the total cost is \( 100,000 + 1,350,000 = 1,450,000 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of loads of laundry Gary does in a year.
2. Determine the total amount of water used in a year.
3. Calculate the total cost of the water used in a year.

First, Gary does laundry twice a week. There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total number of loads of laundry Gary does in a year is:
\[ 2 \text{ loads/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 104 \text{ loads/year} \]

Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water, so the total amount of water used in a year is:
\[ 104 \text{ loads/year} \times 20 \text{ gallons/load} = 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \]

A gallon of water costs $0.15, so the total cost of the water used in a year is:

Let's start with the first step:

1. The total number of seats in the auditorium is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total seats} = 4 \text{ rows} \times 18 \text{ seats per row} = 72 \text{ seats}
   \]

2. The number of seats occupied by the administrators is one-fourth of the total seats:
   \[
   \text{Seats occupied by administrators} = \frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18 \text{ seats}
   \]

3. The number of remaining seats after the administrators have been seated is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining seats} = 72 - 18 = 54 \text{ seats}
   \]

4. The number of seats occupied by the parents is one-third of the remaining seats:
   \[
   \text{Seats occupied by parents} = \frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18 \text{ seats}
   \]

5. The number of seats occupied by the students is the remaining seats after the administrators and parents have been seated:

"To calculate the total number of cars towed by the tow truck over the week, we can break down the problem into two parts: the first three days and the last four days.

For the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day. Therefore, the total number of cars pulled in the first three days is:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

For the remaining four days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day than it did on the first three days. Since it pulled 10 cars each day on the first three days, it pulled:
\[ 10 \text{ cars} - 4 \text{ cars} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]
Therefore, the total number of cars pulled in the last four days is:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Adding the number of cars pulled over the first three days and the last four days gives us the total number of cars towed that week:

"First, we need to convert Adam's current height from inches to feet to compare it with the required height. Adam is currently 40 inches tall. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert his height to feet as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ inches} = \frac{40}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The minimum height required to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. Therefore, Adam needs to grow:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Adam grows 2 inches per year, which is equivalent to \(\frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6}\) feet per year. To find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet, we divide \(\frac{2}{3}\) by \(\frac{1}{6}\):

\[ \frac{2}{3} \div \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Therefore, Adam will be tall enough to ride the roller coaster in 4 years. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 cars James sold:
\[ \text{Total cost of cars} = 10 \times \$25,000 = \$250,000 \]

Next, we calculate the amount the company paid to acquire these cars:
\[ \text{Cost to acquire the cars} = 30\% \times \$250,000 = 0.30 \times \$250,000 = \$75,000 \]

Now, we find the total profit from selling the cars:
\[ \text{Total profit} = \text{Total cost of cars} - \text{Cost to acquire the cars} = \$250,000 - \$75,000 = \$175,000 \]

James gets a 10% commission on the profits:
\[ \text{James's commission} = 10\% \times \$175,000 = 0.10 \times \$175,000 = \$17,500 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$17,500 \]"
"First, let's determine how many riders can stay upright on the wave. Since only 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright, we calculate:

\[ 100 \times 0.25 = 25 \]

So, 25 riders can stay upright on the wave.

Next, we need to find out how many of these 25 riders are women. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we calculate:

\[ 25 \times 0.60 = 15 \]

So, 15 riders are women who can stay upright on the wave.

To find out how many of these 25 riders are men, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is:

"First, let's determine the price of the gold jewel. Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000 and the price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

\[
\text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600
\]

Next, we need to find the price of the silver jewel. The problem states that the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of the gold jewel. Therefore, we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

\[
\text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
\]

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by summing the prices of the diamond jewel, the gold jewel, and the silver jewel:

\[
\text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800
\]

Thus, the total price for all three jewels is:

\[
\boxed{4800}

\[ 19 - 9 = 10 \]

Now, we can find the total number of stamps Max bought by adding the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps together:
\[ 16 + 19 + 10 = 45 \]

So, the total number of stamps Max bought is:
\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between him and Bob.

First, let's find the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap. Since Bob is driving at 55 mph and Tom is driving at 70 mph, Tom is closing the gap at a rate of:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is reducing the 75-mile gap by 15 miles every hour. To find out how long it will take for Tom to close the entire 75-mile gap, we divide the distance by the relative speed:

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the maximum cost per class and then find out how many classes he can attend without exceeding this cost.

First, let's denote the total cost of the 10 classes as \( C \). The total cost is given as $60. If the cost per class exceeds $10, his parents will not sign him up again. Therefore, we need to find the maximum number of classes \( n \) such that the cost per class is not more than $10.

The cost per class if he attends \( n \) classes is:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{n} \]

We need this cost to be less than or equal to $10:
\[ \frac{60}{n} \leq 10 \]

Solving for \( n \):
\[ 60 \leq 10n \]
\[ n \geq 6 \]

This means Manny can miss up to \( 10 - 6 = 4 \) classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we first need to find out how many customers each of them processes in a day.

Given that Jewel processes 50 customers per day, and Julie processes twice as many customers as Jewel, we can calculate the number of customers Julie processes per day as follows:
\[ \text{Customers processed by Julie per day} = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of customers processed by each of them in a week (7 days):
\[ \text{Customers processed by Jewel in a week} = 50 \times 7 = 350 \]
\[ \text{Customers processed by Julie in a week} = 100 \times 7 = 700 \]

Finally, we find the total weekly production by adding the number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel:
\[ \text{Total weekly production} = 350 + 700 = 1050 \]

Thus, the total weekly production for the two is:

"Let's denote the total amount Ariadne earned from selling green hats in the first month as \( G \). According to the problem, the sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount earned from selling green hats. Therefore, we can write:

\[ 400 = \frac{1}{2} G \]

From this equation, we can solve for \( G \):

\[ G = 400 \times 2 = 800 \]

So, the total amount Ariadne earned from selling green hats in the first month is $800.

Next, we need to find the total sales for the first month. The total sales for the first month is the sum of the sales from red and green hats:

\[ \text{Total sales for the first month} = 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

For the second month, her sales were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales of the first month:

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's denote:
- \( s \) as the number of sheep,
- \( g \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we know:
1. Each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, and the total number of legs is 70.
2. Each sheep and each goose has one head, and the total number of heads is 20.

This gives us the following equations:
\[ 4s + 2g = 70 \]
\[ s + g = 20 \]

We can solve this system of equations step by step. First, we can simplify the first equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2s + g = 35 \]

Now we have the simplified system:
\[ 2s + g = 35 \]
\[ s + g = 20 \]

Next, we can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate \( g \):
\[ (2s + g) - (s + g) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2s + g - s - g = 15 \]
\[ s = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep is \( s = 15 \).

To verify, we can substitute \( s = 15 \) back into the second equation:
\[ 15 + g = 20 \]
\[ g = 5 \]

Now we check the number of legs:
\[ 4s + 2g = 4(15) + 2(5) = 60 + 10 = 70 \]

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"

"First, we need to find the total amount of candy that Robert, Cindy, and Aaron have together. We do this by adding the amounts of candy each person has:

\[
3 \text{ pounds} + 5 \text{ pounds} + 4 \text{ pounds} = 12 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we need to divide the total amount of candy equally among the three people. We do this by dividing the total amount of candy by 3:

\[
\frac{12 \text{ pounds}}{3} = 4 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, each of them would have \(\boxed{4}\) pounds of candy."
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the candies Adam bought.

The cost of one candy of type A is $0.5, and Adam bought 7 candies of type A. Therefore, the total cost for type A candies is:
\[ 7 \times 0.5 = 3.5 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of one candy of type B is $0.75, and Adam bought 10 candies of type B. Therefore, the total cost for type B candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.75 = 7.5 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we add the costs of the candies to find the total amount Adam spent:
\[ 3.5 + 7.5 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

Adam paid the cashier $15. To find the change he received, we subtract the total cost from the amount he paid:
\[ 15 - 11 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the number of good days left in the month, we need to first calculate the total number of good days and then subtract the number of good days that have already occurred.

Christina had twelve good days in total over the thirty days. The distribution of these good days is as follows:
- First eight days: 8 good days
- Second eight days: 0 good days
- Third eight days: 0 good days

So, the number of good days that have already occurred is:
\[ 8 + 0 + 0 = 8 \]

The next three days are described as good, neutral, and good. This means there are 2 more good days in the remaining days of the month.

To find the number of good days left, we subtract the number of good days that have already occurred from the total number of good days:
\[ 12 - 8 = 4 \]

Thus, the number of good days left in the month is:
\[ 4 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \]"
"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Number of books Janey has} = 2S + 3 \]

We are given that Janey has 21 books. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 21 \]

To find \( S \), we first subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2S = 18 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 9 \]"
"First, we need to convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can calculate the current height in inches as follows:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine the difference in height needed for the bamboo to reach 600 inches:

\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

Given that the bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day, we can calculate the number of days required to grow 360 inches:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of toys James needs initially. He currently has 4 toys for 4 dogs, so he needs 4 more toys for the 8 new dogs that have arrived. This means he needs 4 toys for the 8 new dogs.

\[ \text{Toys needed for 8 new dogs} = 4 \]

After buying the toys for the 8 new dogs, the number of dogs in the shelter is now 4 (original dogs) + 8 (new dogs) = 12 dogs. James then finds that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left, which means there are now 24 dogs in the shelter. This means he needs to buy toys for 24 - 12 = 12 more dogs.

\[ \text{Toys needed for 12 more dogs} = 12 \]

When James came back again, 3 dogs were gone, so he no longer needed the toys for those 3 dogs. This means he can remove the 3 toys from the total count.

\[ \text{Final total toys needed} = 4 + 12 - 3 = 13 \]

So, the total number of toys James needs is 13.

\[
\boxed{13}

"Let's denote the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has as \( C \).

Given:
- Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max.
- Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster.
- Summer has 23 more cookies than Max.
- Katarina has 68 cookies.

From the information given:
1. Katarina's cookies = Max's cookies - 5
2. Max's cookies = Cookie Monster's cookies + 12
3. Summer's cookies = Max's cookies + 23

We know Katarina has 68 cookies, so:
\[ \text{Katarina's cookies} = 68 \]
\[ \text{Katarina's cookies} = \text{Max's cookies} - 5 \]
\[ 68 = \text{Max's cookies} - 5 \]
\[ \text{Max's cookies} = 68 + 5 = 73 \]

Now, we can find out how many cookies Max has:
\[ \text{Max's cookies} = 73 \]

Next, we find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has:
\[ \text{Max's cookies} = \text{Cookie Monster's cookies} + 12 \]
\[ 73 = \text{Cookie Monster's cookies} + 12 \]
\[ \text{Cookie Monster's cookies} = 73 - 12 = 61 \]

Finally, we find out how many cookies Summer has:
\[ \text{Summer's cookies} = \text{Max's cookies} + 23 \]
\[ \text{Summer's cookies} = 73 + 23 = 96 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of cookies they all have:

"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) centimeters.

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means she adds \( 0.5x \) to the original length. Additionally, she adds 20 cm to the bottom of the dress with a lace trim. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm.

So, the equation representing the final length of the dress is:
\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Now, divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} \]
\[ x = 80 \]

Therefore, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

\[
\boxed{80}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time Chris spent mowing half of his lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half in ""rabbit"" mode.

First, let's convert the times to a consistent unit. Since the question asks for the time in minutes, we'll use minutes for both modes:
- ""Turtle"" mode: 60 minutes
- ""Rabbit"" mode: 40 minutes

Chris mows half of his lawn in each mode. Therefore, the time spent mowing half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Similarly, the time spent mowing half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode is:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

To find the total time spent mowing the entire lawn, we add the time spent in both modes:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is:

Next, we find the total number of cookies baked by both Greta and Celinda:

\[ \text{Total cookies} = 30 + 60 = 90 \]

They eat 10 cookies while they are cooling, so we subtract these from the total:

\[ \text{Cookies left in the box} = 90 - 10 = 80 \]

Therefore, the number of cookies in the box is:

\[ 80 \]"
"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( Tr \). According to the problem, one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so we can write the first equation as:

\[ T = Tr + 7 \]

We also know that the combined ages of the twins and the triplets are 44, so we can write the second equation as:

\[ T + T + Tr + Tr + Tr = 44 \]

Simplifying the second equation, we get:

\[ 2T + 3Tr = 44 \]

Now, we substitute the expression for \( T \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[ 2(Tr + 7) + 3Tr = 44 \]

Expanding and simplifying this equation:

\[ 2Tr + 14 + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr = 30 \]
\[ Tr = 6 \]

Now that we know the age of one of the triplets (\( Tr = 6 \)), we can find the age of one of the twins using the first equation:

\[ T = Tr + 7 \]
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, the age of one of the twins is \( 13 \).

Therefore, John has 100 minutes to nap."
"First, let's determine the cost of one candy. We know that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20, and each lollipop costs $0.40. Therefore, the cost of five lollipops is:

\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

This means the cost of the four candies is:

\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

So, the cost of one candy is:

\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Now, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:

\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost of 10 candies is:

\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:

\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of coins each person has saved over ten years and then sum these amounts.

First, let's determine how many coins Rong has saved in ten years. Rong saves 20 coins per month. There are 12 months in a year, so in ten years, there are \(10 \times 12 = 120\) months. Therefore, the total number of coins Rong has saved is:
\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Next, we need to find out how many coins Neil has saved in ten years. Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong per month. This means Neil saves:
\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \text{ coins/month} \right) = 20 \text{ coins/month} + 8 \text{ coins/month} = 28 \text{ coins/month} \]
So, in ten years, Neil saves:
\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Now, we add the number of coins saved by Rong and Neil to find the total number of coins they have together after ten years:
\[ 2400 \text{ coins} + 3360 \text{ coins} = 5760 \text{ coins} \]

"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Since each vaccine costs $20 and John needs 2 vaccines, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \]

Next, let's denote the cost of the heartworm check as \( H \). According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as \( T \). Therefore, we have:
\[ H = 0.6T \]
Since the total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check, we can write:
\[ T = 40 + H \]
Substituting \( H = 0.6T \) into the equation for \( T \), we get:
\[ T = 40 + 0.6T \]
To find \( T \), we need to solve the equation:
\[ T - 0.6T = 40 \]
\[ 0.4T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.4} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"

First, let's determine the cost of each type of fruit:
- The price of one apple is $0.5.
- The price of one banana is twice the price of one apple, so it is \(2 \times 0.5 = 1\) dollar.
- The price of one orange is three times the price of one banana, so it is \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the total cost for each type of fruit in the crate:
- The cost of 5 bananas is \(5 \times 1 = 5\) dollars.
- The cost of 12 apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6\) dollars.
- The cost of 7 oranges is \(7 \times 3 = 21\) dollars.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry. We know that each female ate 3 dumplings and there were 6 females. Therefore, the total number of dumplings eaten by the females is:

\[ 6 \text{ females} \times 3 \text{ dumplings/female} = 18 \text{ dumplings} \]

Next, we need to find out how many dumplings each male ate. According to the problem, each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female. Since each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate:

\[ 3 \text{ dumplings} + 1 \text{ dumpling} = 4 \text{ dumplings} \]

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is:

\[ 8 \text{ males} \times 4 \text{ dumplings/male} = 32 \text{ dumplings} \]

To find the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry, we add the dumplings eaten by the females and the males:

\[ 18 \text{ dumplings} + 32 \text{ dumplings} = 50 \text{ dumplings} \]

Thus, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, we need to determine how much money Gerald and Julia received based on the given ratio of 3:2.

The total parts of the ratio are \(3 + 2 = 5\).

Since the total amount of money is $100, each part of the ratio is calculated as:
\[
\frac{100}{5} = 20
\]

Therefore, Gerald received:
\[
3 \times 20 = 60
\]

Julia received:
\[
2 \times 20 = 40
\]

Next, we account for the $10 Gerald spent on a book. The amount of money Gerald has left is:
\[
60 - 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[

"First, we need to determine the speed of Martha's turtle. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle and the cat runs at 15 feet per second, we can find the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5.

\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{\text{Cat's speed}}{5} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Next, we need to find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. We do this by multiplying the turtle's speed by the time.

\[ \text{Distance the turtle can crawl} = \text{Turtle's speed} \times \text{Time} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much more money the firefighters need to reach their goal and then calculate how many additional hours they need to work to raise that amount.

1. The goal is to raise $6300.
2. After 3 hours, they have raised $2100.
3. Therefore, the amount still needed is $6300 - $2100 = $4200.
4. Since they raised $2100 in 3 hours, they raise $2100 / 3 = $700 per hour.
5. To find out how many more hours they need to raise the remaining $4200, we divide the remaining amount by the amount raised per hour: $4200 / $700 = 6 hours.

So, they need to raise money for a total of 3 (already worked) + 6 (additional hours) = 9 hours.

The final numerical answer is 9."
"To find the percent of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the percentage of water used by the city for industrial purposes.
2. Subtract this percentage from 100% to find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes.

First, we know that Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. Out of this 40%, 80% is used for industrial purposes. Therefore, the percentage of water used by the city for industrial purposes is:
\[ 40\% \times 80\% = 40\% \times 0.80 = 32\% \]

Next, to find the percentage of water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the industrial usage percentage from the total usage percentage:
\[ 40\% - 32\% = 8\% \]

So, the percent of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is:
\[ 8\% \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"

"First, let's determine the production rate for each type of ice cream.

For chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for chocolate ice cream is \( \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

For vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for vanilla ice cream is \( \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Next, we calculate the total production for 48 hours.

For chocolate ice cream:
- At a rate of 50 quarts per hour, in 48 hours, the factory would produce \( 50 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts} \).

For vanilla ice cream:
- At a rate of 12.5 quarts per hour, in 48 hours, the factory would produce \( 12.5 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts} \).

Finally, we add the total quarts of chocolate and vanilla ice cream produced in 48 hours:
- Total quarts = 2400 quarts (chocolate) + 600 quarts (vanilla) = 3000 quarts.

The final numerical answer is:
3000"
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of baked good:

- Croissants: 5 croissants * $3.00 each = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls * $2.50 each = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches * $4.00 each = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 blueberry muffins * $1.00 each = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost before the discount:

Total cost before discount = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Marcus gets a 10% discount on his purchase. Let's calculate the discount amount:

Discount amount = 10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final bill:

Final bill = $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

So, Marcus' total bill is $45.00."
"First, let's determine the cost of the ice cream deal. For every 2 scoops bought, Erin gets 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50.

The cost for 2 scoops is:
\[ 2 \times 1.50 = 3.00 \]

With the deal, for every $3.00 spent, Erin gets 3 scoops (2 bought + 1 free).

Erin has $6.00. We need to find out how many sets of $3.00 she can spend with her $6.00:
\[ 6.00 \div 3.00 = 2 \]

This means Erin can take advantage of the deal 2 times. Each time she buys 2 scoops and gets 1 free, she gets 3 scoops in total.

Therefore, the total number of scoops Erin can buy is:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much more candy Amy has after two weeks compared to Ginger, we need to calculate the amount of candy each person eats over that period and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the number of days in two weeks:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ days} \]

Next, we calculate how much candy Ginger eats in 14 days:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Then, we calculate how much candy Amy eats in 14 days:
\[ 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we find out how much candy Ginger has left after 14 days:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces} \]

And how much candy Amy has left after 14 days:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces} \]

Finally, we determine how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger:
\[ 58 \text{ pieces} - 44 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy after two weeks. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost James incurred for picking the blueberries. The cost to go picking is $20, and the cost per pound is $1.5. He picked 30 pounds, so the cost for the blueberries is:

\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.5 \text{ per pound} = \$45 \]

Adding the initial cost to go picking, the total cost for James is:

\[ \$20 + \$45 = \$65 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the same 30 pounds of blueberries at the store. The store price is $2.5 per pound, so the total cost at the store is:

\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.5 \text{ per pound} = \$75 \]

To find out how much James saved compared to buying at the store, we subtract the total cost James incurred from the total cost at the store:

\[ \$75 - \$65 = \$10 \]

So, James saved $10 by picking the blueberries himself. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the original price of each computer. The company planned to buy each computer for $700, but the price increased by 10%. To find the new price, we calculate 10% of $700 and add it to the original price.

\[ \text{Increase in price} = 700 \times \frac{10}{100} = 700 \times 0.10 = 70 \]

So, the new price of each computer is:

\[ \text{New price} = 700 + 70 = 770 \]

Now, the company wanted to buy 500 computers at the new price of $770 each. To find the total amount of money they paid, we multiply the new price by the number of computers:

\[ \text{Total amount paid} = 770 \times 500 \]

Let's calculate this product:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of taps Helga makes with both her feet over the 5-minute period, considering the different tap rates for different parts of her dance.

First, let's calculate the number of taps when her arms are at her sides:
- Right foot tap rate: 300 taps per minute
- Left foot tap rate: 250 taps per minute
- Combined tap rate: 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute

For 3 minutes (since she raises her arms for 2 minutes, she has her arms at her sides for 5 - 2 = 3 minutes):
\[ 550 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 1650 \text{ taps} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of taps when her arms are raised:
- Right foot tap rate: 200 taps per minute
- Left foot tap rate: 200 taps per minute
- Combined tap rate: 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute

For 2 minutes:
\[ 400 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 800 \text{ taps} \]

Now, we add the taps from both parts of the dance:

"First, let's calculate the total cost if Ron fixes the pothole himself. 

The cost of fixing the pothole is $450.
The cost of 3 buckets of asphalt is $25 per bucket, so the total cost for the asphalt is \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.

Therefore, the total cost for Ron to fix the pothole himself is \(450 + 75 = 525\) dollars.

If the city council fines Ron $120 for unauthorized road maintenance, the net cost for Ron to fix the pothole himself is \(525 - 120 = 405\) dollars.

The city council will not fix the pothole, and it will do $450 worth of damage to Ron's car. Therefore, the amount of money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself is \(450 - 405 = 45\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:

Next, we calculate how many slices Bryce and two of his friends ate. They ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizzas:
\[ 2 \times 12 \times \frac{2}{3} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Then, we calculate how many slices the remaining two friends ate. They ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizzas:
\[ 2 \times 12 \times \frac{3}{4} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Now, we find the total number of slices eaten by all five friends:
\[ 16 + 18 = 34 \]

Finally, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices to find out how many slices are left:

"First, let's convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, Topher's shoe length of 8-feet and 4-inches is:

\[ 8 \times 12 + 4 = 96 + 4 = 100 \text{ inches} \]

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( x \) inches. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \( 10 \) inches. Let's confirm this by substituting \( x = 10 \) back into the original equation:

\[ 9(10) + 10 = 90 + 10 = 100 \]

The equation holds true, so the length of one of Bobby's shoes is indeed \( 10 \) inches. The final numerical answer is:

Next, let's calculate the number of windows in the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each teacher's car has 2 windows.
- Therefore, the total number of windows in the teachers' cars is \(32 \times 2 = 64\) windows.

Now, let's calculate the number of windows Hannah smashes in the students' cars:
- She smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.
- A quarter of 256 windows is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64\) windows.

Next, let's calculate the number of windows Hannah smashes in the teachers' cars:
- She smashes three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows.
- Three-quarters of 64 windows is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48\) windows.

Finally, let's add the number of windows smashed in the students' cars and the teachers' cars to find the total number of windows smashed:
- Total windows smashed = 64 (students) + 48 (teachers) = 112 windows.

Now, we add up the weights of all the books to find the total weight Cindy is carrying:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} + 7 \text{ pounds} + 6 \text{ pounds} = 17 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is:

"First, let's calculate the number of votes candidate B received. Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A. Since candidate A received 20% of the votes, we can calculate the votes for candidate B as follows:

Votes for candidate B = Votes for candidate A + 50% of Votes for candidate A
Votes for candidate B = 20% of 100 + 0.5 * 20% of 100
Votes for candidate B = 20 + 0.5 * 20
Votes for candidate B = 20 + 10
Votes for candidate B = 30

Now, we know the total number of votes is 100. The votes for candidate C can be found by subtracting the votes for candidates A and B from the total votes:

Votes for candidate C = Total votes - Votes for candidate A - Votes for candidate B
Votes for candidate C = 100 - 20 - 30
Votes for candidate C = 50

So, candidate C received 50 votes."
"First, let's determine how many apples Beck has initially. Since Boris has 100 apples and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, we can calculate the number of apples Beck has as follows:

\[ \text{Beck's initial apples} = \text{Boris's apples} - 23 = 100 - 23 = 77 \]

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. So, we need to update the number of apples each person has after this transaction:

\[ \text{Boris's apples after giving 10 to Beck} = 100 - 10 = 90 \]
\[ \text{Beck's apples after receiving 10 from Boris} = 77 + 10 = 87 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after this transaction:

\[ \text{Difference in apples} = \text{Boris's apples} - \text{Beck's apples} = 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of water used for the giant cubes. Peter makes 3 giant cubes, and each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water. Therefore, the total water used for the giant cubes is:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of water used for the medium cubes. Peter makes 7 medium cubes, and each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water. Therefore, the total water used for the medium cubes is:
\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ ounces} \]

Then, let's calculate the total amount of water used for the small cubes. Peter makes 8 small cubes, and each small cube uses 0.5 ounces of water. Therefore, the total water used for the small cubes is:
\[ 8 \times 0.5 = 4 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, let's add up the total amount of water used for all the cubes:
\[ 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. After using 30 ounces, the amount of water left is:
\[ 32 - 30 = 2 \text{ ounces} \]

"To solve this problem, let's start by determining how many books Steven has. We know that Clara has two times as many books as Steven and Clara has 20 books. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find out how many books Steven has:

\[ 2 \times \text{Steven's books} = 20 \]

Solving for Steven's books:

\[ \text{Steven's books} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Now, we know Steven has 10 books. Since Alice has 6 more books than Steven, we can calculate the number of books Alice has:

\[ \text{Alice's books} = \text{Steven's books} + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16 \]

Next, we need to find out how many more books Clara has than Alice. Clara has 20 books and Alice has 16 books, so we calculate the difference:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Clara's books} - \text{Alice's books} = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, Clara has 4 more books than Alice. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many marbles Carl has. Since Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, and Sean has 56 marbles, we can calculate Carl's marbles as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's marbles} = 4 \times \text{Sean's marbles} = 4 \times 56 = 224 \]

Next, we need to find out how many marbles Cal has. We know that Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, so we can calculate Cal's marbles as follows:

\[ \text{Sean's marbles} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cal's marbles} \]
\[ 56 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cal's marbles} \]
\[ \text{Cal's marbles} = 56 \times 2 = 112 \]

Now, we can find the total number of marbles that Carl and Cal have combined:

\[ \text{Total marbles} = \text{Carl's marbles} + \text{Cal's marbles} = 224 + 112 = 336 \]

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many students would be in each group if the activity is divided into 12 groups.

Given:
- Total number of students = 54
- Total number of groups required = 12

To find the number of students per group when divided into 12 groups:
\[ \text{Number of students per group} = \frac{54}{12} = 4.5 \]

Since the number of students per group must be a whole number, it's clear that 12 groups of 54 students each is not possible. Therefore, we need to find out how many more groups are needed to form groups of equal size.

To find the number of groups needed to form groups of equal size, we need to find the smallest number of groups that can accommodate 54 students with each group having the same number of students. This number is the smallest divisor of 54 that is greater than 1 (since 1 group is not practical).

The divisors of 54 are: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54.

The smallest divisor greater than 1 is 2. Therefore, the smallest number of groups needed is 27 (since \(54 \div 27 = 2\)).

Now, we need to find out how many more groups are needed to go from 12 groups to 27 groups:
\[ 27 - 12 = 15 \]

Thus, the number of additional groups needed is:

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during a single weekday and a single weekend day:
- During weekdays, 60 chairs are rented each day.
- During weekends, 100 chairs are rented each day.

Next, we need to determine the number of weekdays and weekend days in a 4-week month:
- There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a single week.
- Therefore, in a 4-week month, there are \(5 \times 4 = 20\) weekdays and \(2 \times 4 = 8\) weekend days.

Now, we can calculate the total number of chairs rented during a 4-week month:
- Chairs rented during weekdays: \(60 \times 20 = 1200\)
- Chairs rented during weekends: \(100 \times 8 = 800\)
- Total chairs rented in one 4-week month: \(1200 + 800 = 2000\)

Finally, we need to find out the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months:
- Total chairs rented in two 4-week months: \(2000 \times 2 = 4000\)

Thus, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is 4000."

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The first house needs \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the second house, so the first house needs \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases.
- The third house needs double the first house, so the third house needs \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) cases.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{5}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{5} \):
\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{5} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. The third house needs double the first house, which is:
\[ 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = 2 \times \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

"First, let's determine how many books Ahmed read. According to the problem, Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in one hour. Since Ezra read 300 books, we can set up the following equation to find out how many books Ahmed read:

\[ \text{Ahmed's books} = \frac{\text{Ezra's books}}{2} = \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

So, Ahmed read 150 books in one hour. 

Next, we need to calculate the total number of books Ezra has read. Initially, Ezra read 300 books and then decided to read 150 more books. Therefore, the total number of books Ezra read is:

\[ \text{Ezra's total books} = 300 + 150 = 450 \]

Now, we add the number of books Ahmed and Ezra read to find the total number of books read by both of them:

\[ \text{Total books} = \text{Ahmed's books} + \text{Ezra's total books} = 150 + 450 = 600 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 600 \]"
"To calculate Tanya's earnings, we need to break down her earnings for each day based on the given conditions.

**Monday:**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She also earns an additional $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Monday:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} \times 5 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 20 \times 5 \times 15 = \$1500 \]

Next, calculate the additional earnings for Monday:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} > 3 \text{ classes} \]
\[ \text{Additional earnings} = \$5 \]

So, Tanya's total earnings for Monday are:
\[ \$1500 + \$5 = \$1505 \]

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She does not earn the additional $5 per day since she does not teach more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Wednesday:
\[ 2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 2 \times 2 \times 15 = \$60 \]

Since she does not teach more than 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5 per day.

So, Tanya's total earnings for Wednesday are:
\[ \$60 \]

Now, add the earnings from both days to find the total earnings for the two days:
\[ \$1505 + \$60 = \$1565 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$1565 \]"
"To determine how many more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total sales for each type of scent and then find the difference.

The perfume company sold 5 vanilla scents and 2 fruity scents by the end of the day.

Total vanilla scents sold = 5
Total fruity scents sold = 2

Now, we find the difference:
Difference = Total vanilla scents sold - Total fruity scents sold
Difference = 5 - 2
Difference = 3

Therefore, 3 more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents.

The final numerical answer is: 3"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Bennet makes from selling the eggplants.

He sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total from the eggplants is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

Bennet wants to make a total of $135. To find out how much more he needs to make from selling the corn, we subtract the amount he already has from the total he wants to make:
\[ 135 - 60 = 75 \]

Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for to make the remaining $75, we divide the remaining amount by the number of ears of corn:
\[ \frac{75}{25} = 3 \]

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours Tatiana has available over the weekend:

\[ 7 \text{ hours (Saturday)} + 5 \text{ hours (Sunday)} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we subtract the time she spends reading:

\[ 12 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours (reading)} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the time she spends playing video games. She plays video games for \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the remaining time after reading:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can find out how much time she spends playing soccer by subtracting the time spent on video games and reading from the total available time:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours (video games)} - 3 \text{ hours (reading)} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we calculate the percentage of the weekend Tatiana spends playing soccer:

\[ \frac{3 \text{ hours}}{12 \text{ hours}} \times 100\% = 25\% \]

So, the percentage of her weekend Tatiana spends playing soccer is:

\[ 25\% \]"
"First, let's determine how many pencils Anthony gave to Brandon. Since he gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon, we calculate:

\[ \text{Pencils given to Brandon} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \]

After giving 25 pencils to Brandon, Anthony has:

\[ 50 - 25 = 25 \]

Next, Anthony gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. The remaining pencils are 25, so we calculate:

\[ \text{Pencils given to Charlie} = \frac{3}{5} \times 25 = 15 \]

After giving 15 pencils to Charlie, Anthony has:

\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of pencils Anthony kept is:

\[ 10 \]"
"To calculate the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to consider both the time spent driving and the time spent at the museum.

First, let's calculate the time spent driving. The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and Jack drives at a speed of 75 mph. The time spent driving one way is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time spent driving to the museum is:

\[ \text{Time to museum} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Since the trip back is the same distance and speed, the time spent driving back is also 2 hours. Therefore, the total driving time is:

\[ \text{Total driving time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Jack spends 6 hours at the museum. Therefore, the total time Jack is gone from home is the sum of the driving time and the time spent at the museum:

\[ \text{Total time} = 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 10 \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total number of wheels required for the cars and motorcycles.

For the cars:
Henry needs 4 wheels for each car. Since he needs to assemble 57 cars, the total number of wheels needed for the cars is:
\[ 4 \times 57 = 228 \text{ wheels} \]

For the motorcycles:
Henry needs 2 wheels for each motorcycle. Since he needs to assemble 73 motorcycles, the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles is:
\[ 2 \times 73 = 146 \text{ wheels} \]

Next, we add the wheels needed for the cars and the motorcycles to find the total number of wheels required:
\[ 228 + 146 = 374 \text{ wheels} \]

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left after assembling all the toys, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the number of wheels Henry has:
\[ 650 - 374 = 276 \text{ wheels} \]

Thus, the number of wheels left is:
\[ 276 \]"
"To calculate the price after a 20% discount on a $1000 laptop, you first need to find out what 20% of $1000 is. 

\[ 20\% \text{ of } \$1000 = \frac{20}{100} \times 1000 = 0.20 \times 1000 = \$200 \]

Subtract this discount from the original price:

\[ \$1000 - \$200 = \$800 \]

So, after applying the 20% discount, you have to pay $800."
"First, let's determine the number of movies in various series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \]

This means there are 200 movies in series. Therefore, the number of movies that are not in series is:

\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining 400 movies are older movies. Since 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, we calculate:

\[ 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \]

This means there are 160 older movies. Therefore, the number of movies that are not older movies (and thus are newer movies) is:

\[ 400 - 160 = 240 \]

Now, we can calculate the cost of replacing the movies. The cost for the series movies is $6 each, and the cost for the newer movies is $10 each, while the older movies cost $5 each. Therefore, the total cost is:

\[ 200 \times 6 + 240 \times 10 + 160 \times 5 \]

Let's calculate each term separately:

\[ 200 \times 6 = 1200 \]
\[ 240 \times 10 = 2400 \]
\[ 160 \times 5 = 800 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost:

\[ 1200 + 2400 + 800 = 4400 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{4400} \]"

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance driven and the total distance hiked, and then sum these distances to find the total distance to the vacation spot.

First, let's determine the speed at which they hiked. The problem states that they hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Since they drove at an average of 50 miles per hour, half of this speed is:
\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ miles per hour} \]
So, their hiking speed is:
\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we calculate the distance they hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at a speed of 20 miles per hour, so the distance hiked is:
\[ 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we calculate the distance they drove. They drove for 6 hours at a speed of 50 miles per hour, so the distance driven is:
\[ 50 \times 6 = 300 \text{ miles} \]

The total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked:
\[ 300 + 30 = 330 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{330} \]"
"To determine the difference in scores between Ava and Emma, we need to calculate the points each of them earns based on the given conditions.

Let's denote:
- \( E \) as the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- \( B \) as the number of berries Emma collects.
- \( T \) as the time Emma finishes the level in seconds.

Ava's score can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Ava's score} = 10 \times (E + 8) + 5 \times (B + 3) + 30 \times (T + 4) \]

Emma's score can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Emma's score} = 10 \times E + 5 \times B + 30 \times T \]

The difference in their scores is:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Ava's score} - \text{Emma's score} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = [10 \times (E + 8) + 5 \times (B + 3) + 30 \times (T + 4)] - [10 \times E + 5 \times B + 30 \times T] \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 10 \times E + 80 + 5 \times B + 15 + 30 \times T + 120 - 10 \times E - 5 \times B - 30 \times T \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 80 + 15 + 120 \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 215 \]

Thus, the difference between their two scores is 215 points."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each. Then, we subtract this amount from the total cost to find the combined cost of the other two pizzas. Finally, we divide this amount by 2 to find the cost of each of the other two pizzas.

The total cost of the four pizzas is 64 dollars. The cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each is:
\[ 30 + 30 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting this from the total cost gives the combined cost of the other two pizzas:
\[ 64 - 60 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the combined cost by 2:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, each of the other two pizzas cost 2 dollars. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To solve this, let's break down the problem into parts:

1. **Normal Days (3 days):** Chase and Rider ride their bikes thrice a day.

   - Number of normal days = 3
   - Total rides on normal days = 3 rides/day * 3 days = 9 rides

2. **Special Days (2 days):** They ride twice the times they do on normal days.
   - Number of rides per special day = 3 * 2 = 6 rides
   - Number of special days = 2
   - Total rides on special days = 6 rides/day * 2 days = 12 rides

3. **Total rides in a week:**
   - Total rides = rides on normal days + rides on special days
   - Total rides = 9 rides + 12 rides = 21 rides

"Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as \( w \) and the number of orange fish he bought as \( o \). Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying more fish, he had a total of \( 3 + o \) orange fish and \( 4 + w \) white fish. According to the problem, he added 17 fish in total, so we have:

\[ o + w = 17 \]

After adding the new fish, the number of orange fish became \( 3 + o \) and the number of white fish became \( 4 + w \). The problem states that after adding the new fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us the equation:

\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( o + w = 17 \)
2. \( 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \)

Let's solve the second equation first:

\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]
\[ 3 + o = 8 + 2w \]
\[ o - 2w = 5 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( o + w = 17 \)
2. \( o - 2w = 5 \)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use elimination. First, we can eliminate \( o \) by subtracting the second equation from the first:

\[ (o + w) - (o - 2w) = 17 - 5 \]
\[ o + w - o + 2w = 12 \]
\[ 3w = 12 \]
\[ w = 4 \]

Now that we have \( w = 4 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( o \):

\[ o + 4 = 17 \]
\[ o = 13 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish and 13 orange fish. The number of white fish Bob bought at the store is:

\[
\boxed{4}

"First, let's calculate the total distance Andy travels in a week. Since he goes to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days. The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, so the round trip distance is \(5 \times 2 = 10\) miles per day. Therefore, the total distance he travels in a week is \(10 \times 5 = 50\) miles.

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of gas Andy consumes in a week. Given that his car's fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon, the number of gallons consumed per week is \(\frac{50 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons}\).

Finally, we calculate the cost of the gas consumed in a week. If the price of gas is $3 per gallon, then the cost for 5 gallons is \(5 \text{ gallons} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars}\).

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie received from her aunt.

Carrie received ten twenties, which means she received:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Carrie also received 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount from the quarters is:
\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate how much money Carrie spent. She spent all the quarters, which is $35, and 3/5 of the twenties. The amount spent on the twenties is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the amounts spent on quarters and twenties to find the total amount spent for lunch:
\[ 35 + 120 = 155 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is:
\[ \boxed{155} \]"
"To determine the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his garden, we need to calculate the yield from the tomato plants and the eggplant plants separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the yield from the tomato plants:
- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo planted 5 tomato plants.

\[
\text{Total tomatoes} = 5 \text{ plants} \times 22 \text{ tomatoes/plant} = 110 \text{ tomatoes}
\]

Next, we calculate the yield from the eggplant plants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo planted 8 eggplant plants.

\[
\text{Total eggplants} = 8 \text{ plants} \times 4 \text{ eggplants/plant} = 32 \text{ eggplants}
\]

Now, we sum the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits:

"To find out how many OLED TVs were sold, we first need to determine the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold, and then subtract these from the total sales.

Given:
- Total sales = 40 TVs
- One-fourth of the sales are smart TVs.
- One-eighth of the sales are analog TVs.

First, calculate the number of smart TVs sold:
\[ \text{Number of smart TVs} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

Next, calculate the number of analog TVs sold:
\[ \text{Number of analog TVs} = \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5 \]

Now, subtract the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total sales to find the number of OLED TVs sold:
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (\text{Number of smart TVs} + \text{Number of analog TVs}) \]
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (10 + 5) \]
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - 15 \]
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 25 \]

So, the number of OLED TVs sold is 25."
"To determine how much money John is missing, we first need to calculate the total cost of the trip and then subtract the amount of money he already has.

The total cost of the trip is $300. The school has agreed to cover half of this cost, so the school will cover:
\[ \frac{300}{2} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

This means John still needs to cover the remaining half of the trip cost:
\[ 300 - 150 = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

John currently has $50. To find out how much more money he needs, we subtract the amount he has from the total amount he still needs:

"First, we need to determine the temperature difference that needs to be prevented. The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. During the night, the temperature is 33 degrees colder than during the day, so the night temperature is:

\[ 45 - 33 = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

Since the pipes will freeze if the temperature drops below 32 degrees, we need to calculate how much the temperature needs to be raised to 32 degrees or above. The temperature difference needed is:

\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs are needed to raise the temperature by 20 degrees, we divide the required temperature increase by the temperature increase per log:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the hourly wages for both Billy and Sally, and then determine the total earnings for 20 hours for each. Finally, we will find the difference in their earnings.

First, let's determine Billy's hourly wage at each stage:
- Initial hourly wage: $10 per hour.
- After 2 months, the hourly wage increases by $0.50, so the new hourly wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.
- On his first anniversary, the hourly wage increases by another $1.00, so the new hourly wage is $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate Billy's total earnings for 20 hours:
- For the first 2 months (24 hours), Billy earns $10 per hour.
- For the next 20 hours, Billy earns $11.50 per hour.
- Total earnings for Billy = (24 hours * $10/hour) + (20 hours * $11.50/hour) = $240 + $230 = $470.

Next, let's determine Sally's hourly wage:
- Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's initial salary, so her starting hourly wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate Sally's total earnings for 20 hours:
- Sally earns $10.50 per hour for 20 hours.
- Total earnings for Sally = 20 hours * $10.50/hour = $210.

Finally, let's find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally:
- Difference in earnings = Billy's total earnings - Sally's total earnings = $470 - $210 = $260.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{260}

"First, let's calculate the cost of 3 loaves of bread:
- The cost of one loaf of bread is $2.
- Therefore, the cost of 3 loaves of bread is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of 2 bagels:
- The cost of one bagel is $1.
- Therefore, the cost of 2 bagels is \(2 \times 1 = 2\) dollars.

Now, we need to find out how much more 3 loaves of bread cost than 2 bagels:
- The difference in cost is \(6 - 2 = 4\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
4"
"To find the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita, we first need to determine how many points Nikita scored. According to the problem, Nikita scored 11 more than half as many points as Pierson.

Pierson's score is 278 points. Half of Pierson's score is:
\[ \frac{278}{2} = 139 \]

Nikita's score is 11 more than this value:
\[ 139 + 11 = 150 \]

Now, we add Pierson's and Nikita's scores together to find the total:
\[ 278 + 150 = 428 \]

The total points scored by Pierson and Nikita is:
\[ \boxed{428} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of students and teachers at Ashley's school.

The school has 40 classes with an average of 25 students per class:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 25 \text{ students/class} = 1000 \text{ students} \]

The school also has 40 classes with an average of 3 teachers per class:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 3 \text{ teachers/class} = 120 \text{ teachers} \]

Each child plants 1 tree, so the total number of trees planted by the students is:
\[ 1000 \text{ students} \times 1 \text{ tree/student} = 1000 \text{ trees} \]

Each teacher plants 2 trees, so the total number of trees planted by the teachers is:
\[ 120 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ trees/teacher} = 240 \text{ trees} \]

Adding the trees planted by the students and the teachers gives the total number of trees planted:
\[ 1000 \text{ trees} + 240 \text{ trees} = 1240 \text{ trees} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1240 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:

- Puppies: 3
- Koalas: 5
- Zebras: 2
- Frogs: 4

Total stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Let's denote the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy as \( x \).

After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30%. Therefore, the equation representing this situation is:

\[ \frac{x}{14 + x} = 0.30 \]

To solve for \( x \), we can rearrange the equation:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats."
"First, let's calculate the total hours Kris has already played.

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, so:
\[ 14 \text{ days} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/day} = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Next, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/day} = 14 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's add the hours from both periods to find the total hours played so far:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} + 14 \text{ hours} = 21 \text{ hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. Therefore, the number of hours she still needs to play is:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} - 21 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 9 \]"
"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled by the first car:
- The first car travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance traveled by the first car is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled by the second car:
- The second car travels at an average speed of 70 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance traveled by the second car is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_2 = 70 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled by the two cars:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_2 - \text{Distance}_1 = 140 \, \text{miles} - 120 \, \text{miles} = 20 \, \text{miles}
\]

Thus, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the ring before the premium is added. The cost of the diamond is $600 and the cost of the gold is $300. Adding these together gives:

\[ 600 + 300 = 900 \]

Next, we need to calculate the premium. The premium is 30% of the total cost of the ring. To find 30% of $900, we multiply $900 by 0.30:

\[ 900 \times 0.30 = 270 \]

Now, we add the premium to the total cost of the ring to find the final amount James paid:

\[ 900 + 270 = 1170 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1170 \]"
"First, let's calculate the pass rates for each grade:

- For third graders: \( \frac{340}{500} = 0.68 \) or 68%.
- For fourth graders: \( \frac{40}{100} = 0.40 \) or 40%.
- For fifth graders: The pass rate is twice that of fourth graders, so \( 2 \times 0.40 = 0.80 \) or 80%.

Next, we calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students:

- Third graders: 340
- Fourth graders: 40
- Fifth graders: 400

Total number of students who passed: \( 340 + 40 + 400 = 780 \)

Total number of students: \( 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 \)

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students:

\[ \text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{780}{1000} = 0.78 \]

So, the school's overall pass rate is 78%."
"First, let's determine how many glass chips Milo has in total. Since each bag contains 72 chips and he has two bags, the total number of chips is:
\[ 72 \text{ chips/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we need to find out how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make every square inch, the number of square inches he can make is:
\[ \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips/square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. To find out how many inches long he can make his mosaic, we use the fact that the area of the mosaic is the product of its length and height. Let \( L \) be the length of the mosaic in inches. The area of the mosaic is given by:
\[ L \times 3 \text{ inches} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{12 \text{ square inches}}{3 \text{ inches}} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

Each of the 4 students drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea consumed by these students is:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Each of the 16 students drank 2 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea consumed by these students is:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of tea consumed:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

We know that there are 10 quarts of tea left. Therefore, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we convert the total quarts to gallons:
\[ \frac{48}{4} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Dale initially had 100 candies and sold 150, which means he is short by 50 candies (150 - 100 = 50). After ordering 100 more candies, the total number of candies he has is 100 (initial) + 100 (new order) = 200 candies. To find out how many candies he still needs to sell, we subtract the number of candies he has from the total number of candies he ordered, which is 200 - 150 = 50 candies.

The final numerical answer is:
50"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students on campus at the end of each month and then determine the total number of additional students who joined by the end of May.

Starting with 10 students at the beginning of the year, the number of students doubles every month.

- At the end of January: \(10 \times 2 = 20\) students
- At the end of February: \(20 \times 2 = 40\) students
- At the end of March: \(40 \times 2 = 80\) students
- At the end of April: \(80 \times 2 = 160\) students
- At the end of May: \(160 \times 2 = 320\) students

Now, we calculate the total number of additional students who joined by the end of May:

- Additional students in January: \(20 - 10 = 10\)
- Additional students in February: \(40 - 20 = 20\)
- Additional students in March: \(80 - 40 = 40\)
- Additional students in April: \(160 - 80 = 80\)
- Additional students in May: \(320 - 160 = 160\)

Summing these additional students:
\[10 + 20 + 40 + 80 + 160 = 310\]

Thus, the number of additional students who would have joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year, is 310."
"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we first need to determine the total number of branches he climbed during the week.

Given that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs and he made $105 during the week, we can calculate the total number of branches he climbed by dividing the total earnings by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} = 420 \text{ branches} \]

Since this was the total for the week, and there are 7 days in a week, we can find the average number of branches climbed per day by dividing the total branches by the number of days:

\[ \text{Branches climbed per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches climbed}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{420}{7} = 60 \text{ branches per day} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 60 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose initially picks:

- For the first 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals.
- For the next 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals.
- For the next 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals.
- For the last 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals.

Adding these together gives the total number of petals before any are dropped:
\[15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\] petals.

Rose drops 1 flower of each type, so she drops:
- 1 flower with 5 petals,
- 1 flower with 6 petals,
- 1 flower with 4 petals,
- 1 flower with 7 petals.

The total number of petals dropped is:
\[5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\] petals.

Therefore, the number of petals remaining in the vase is:
\[101 - 22 = 79\] petals.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean to make S'mores. John makes 9 S'mores and DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so together they make:

\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \text{ S'mores} \]

This means they use 18 marshmallows. Since the bag originally had 35 marshmallows and they dropped 3 on the ground, the number of marshmallows left is:

\[ 35 - 18 - 3 = 14 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Now, we need to determine how many S'mores each can have with the remaining 14 marshmallows. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, each can have:

\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ S'mores} \]

So, each kid can have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the play times for each person:

- Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter.
- One friend can play for half as long as Jack, which is \(20 \div 2 = 10\) minutes.
- Another friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which is \(20 \times 1.5 = 30\) minutes.
- The third friend is significantly worse and can play for half as long as the friend who can play 10 minutes, which is \(10 \div 2 = 5\) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the total play time in minutes:
- Jack plays for 20 minutes.
- The friend who can play 10 minutes plays for 10 minutes.
- The friend who can play 30 minutes plays for 30 minutes.
- The friend who can play 5 minutes plays for 5 minutes.

Adding these times together:
\[ 20 + 10 + 30 + 5 = 65 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to determine how many quarters are used. Since each quarter allows for 20 minutes of play:
\[ \frac{65 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes per quarter}} = 3.25 \text{ quarters} \]

Since Jack and his friends can only use whole quarters, they will use 4 quarters in total.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the amount of each ingredient Tanya uses as follows:
- Let \( S \) be the amount of salt.
- Let \( O \) be the amount of oil.
- Let \( F \) be the amount of fragrance.
- Let \( C \) be the amount of citrus zest.
- Let \( G \) be the amount of sugar.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S = G \) (same amount of salt as sugar)
2. \( O = 2S \) (twice as much oil as salt)
3. \( F = C \) (same amount of fragrance as citrus zest)
4. \( S = C \) (same amount of salt as citrus zest)

Since \( S = C \) and \( F = C \), we can say \( S = F = C \).

The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, so we can write the equation:
\[ S + O + F + C + G = 10 \]

Substituting the relationships into the equation:
\[ S + 2S + S + S + S = 10 \]
\[ 6S = 10 \]
\[ S = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \]

Since \( O = 2S \):
\[ O = 2 \times \frac{5}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \]

Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \(\frac{10}{3}\) ounces. Converting this to a decimal, we get approximately 3.33 ounces, but the exact answer is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{10}{3}} \]"

"First, let's determine how many cars Joe initially has. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. The number of cars he sells is:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

After selling 8 cars, Joe has:

\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \text{ cars} \]

Then, Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

After giving away 16 cars, Joe has:

\[ 32 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, the final number of cars Joe remains with is:

"To calculate the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days in minutes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of hours Sandy walked on the second day.
2. Calculate the total number of hours walked over the two days.
3. Convert the total hours into minutes.

First, Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day. On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she did on the first day. Therefore, the number of hours she walked on the second day is:
\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of hours walked over the two days:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total hours into minutes:
\[ 12 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days in minutes is:
\[ \boxed{720} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of cars in the parking lot during the lunch break before any left. Hunter initially counted 50 cars, and during the first break, he saw 20 more cars. Therefore, the total number of cars in the parking lot before the lunch break is:

\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \]

During the lunch break, half of the cars left the parking lot. So, the number of cars that left is:

\[ \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Therefore, the number of cars remaining in the parking lot during the lunch break is:

\[ 70 - 35 = 35 \]

So, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is:

Therefore, Kimberly bought \(\boxed{52}\) more tins of cat food than dog food."
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now we can find the number of cards Becca has:
\[ 3P + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

"First, let's determine the number of each color of eggs Cindy has:

- Cindy has 5 green eggs.
- She has twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she has \(2 \times 5 = 10\) blue eggs.
- She has one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so she has \(10 - 1 = 9\) pink eggs.
- She has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she has \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\) yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs:

- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: 10
- Pink eggs: 9
- Yellow eggs: 3

The total number of eggs is \(5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27\).

"First, let's calculate the shipping cost. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound plus $0.08 per mile.

The cost for the weight of the book is:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.35/\text{pound} = \$1.40 \]

The cost for the distance is:
\[ 20 \text{ miles} \times \$0.08/\text{mile} = \$1.60 \]

So, the total shipping cost is:
\[ \$1.40 + \$1.60 = \$3.00 \]

Next, we calculate the refundable amount from Amazon. Since Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price:
\[ 32 \text{ dollars} \times 0.75 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we determine the total cost Milly will incur:
\[ \text{Shipping cost} + \text{Cost of the book} = \$3.00 + 32 \text{ dollars} = \$35.00 \]

Finally, the amount of money Milly will lose is the total cost minus the refundable amount:
\[ 35 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

   - Each video is 4 minutes long.
   - Therefore, the time spent on TikTok videos each week is \(18 \times 4 = 72\) minutes.
   - For a month with four weeks, the total time spent on TikTok videos is \(72 \times 4 = 288\) minutes.

2. **Time spent writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Since 1 hour equals 60 minutes, 2 hours equal \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes.
   - For a month with four weeks, the total time spent writing songs is \(120 \times 4 = 480\) minutes.

3. **Time spent on makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup.
   - For a week, the total time spent on makeup is \(15 \times 6 = 90\) minutes.
   - For a month with four weeks, the total time spent on makeup is \(90 \times 4 = 360\) minutes.

Now, we sum up all the time spent:
- Time on TikTok videos: 288 minutes
- Time writing songs: 480 minutes
- Time on makeup: 360 minutes

Total time spent in a month is \(288 + 480 + 360 = 1128\) minutes.

The final numerical answer is 1128 minutes."
"To determine the cost for Angela, we need to calculate the cost of the additional items she needs installed.

First, let's calculate the cost of the additional mirrors and chandeliers:
- Angela needs 6 mirrors and 2 chandeliers.
- The cost for each additional item is $15.00.

The cost for the additional mirrors is:
\[ 6 \text{ mirrors} \times \$15.00/\text{mirror} = \$90.00 \]

The cost for the additional chandeliers is:
\[ 2 \text{ chandeliers} \times \$15.00/\text{chandelier} = \$30.00 \]

Next, we add the cost of the additional pictures:
- Angela needs 20 pictures.

The cost for the additional pictures is:
\[ 20 \text{ pictures} \times \$15.00/\text{picture} = \$300.00 \]

Now, we sum up all the additional costs:
\[ \$90.00 + \$30.00 + \$300.00 = \$420.00 \]

The base installation cost for the initial items (4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures) is $129.00. Adding the additional cost:
\[ \$129.00 + \$420.00 = \$549.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Angela is:

"To determine how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to work through the relationships given step by step.

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain \(12 \times 1 = 12\) inches.
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain \(4 \times 12 = 48\) inches.
4. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain \(10 \times 48 = 480\) inches.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert 480 inches to feet:
\[ 480 \text{ inches} \div 12 = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 40 \]"
"Mason travels at a rate of 8 miles per hour for 4 hours, so the distance he covers in the first part of his journey is:
\[ 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles} \]

Then, he travels for another 6 hours at the same rate, so the distance he covers in the second part of his journey is:
\[ 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \]

The total distance he has traveled is the sum of the distances from both parts of his journey:

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the number of animals, their speed, and the time it takes for them to complete the journey.

First, let's establish the relationship for the kangaroos:
- Let the speed of one kangaroo be \( v \).
- The total time taken by 3 kangaroos to travel across the highway is 18 hours.

The total distance \( D \) can be calculated using the formula:
\[ D = \text{speed} \times \text{time} \]
For the kangaroos:
\[ D = 3v \times 18 \]
\[ D = 54v \]

Now, we need to find out how long it will take for 4 turtles to travel the same distance \( D \). Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).

The time \( t \) it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \) is given by:
\[ t = \frac{D}{\text{speed of one turtle}} \]
\[ t = \frac{54v}{\frac{v}{2}} \]
\[ t = 54v \times \frac{2}{v} \]
\[ t = 54 \times 2 \]
\[ t = 108 \]

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 108 hours to travel across the highway.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the final price of the laptop after the trade-in discount. The original price of the laptop is $600, and the trade-in discount is $200. Therefore, the final price is:

\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means she currently has:

\[ 400 - 50 = 350 \]

Erika has received money from three sources: her part-time job, her mom, and her savings in her purse. Let's denote the amount of money she has in her purse as \( x \). According to the problem, the total amount of money she has is:

\[ x + 150 + 80 = 350 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 230 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 350 - 230 = 120 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of slices Adam gets from the large apples. Since each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces and Adam slices 3 large apples, the total number of slices from the large apples is:
\[ 3 \text{ apples} \times 5 \text{ slices/apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of slices Adam gets from the small apples. Since each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces and Adam slices 5 small apples, the total number of slices from the small apples is:
\[ 5 \text{ apples} \times 3 \text{ slices/apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's find the total number of slices Adam has after slicing all the apples:
\[ 15 \text{ slices from large apples} + 15 \text{ slices from small apples} = 30 \text{ slices} \]

"First, let's determine how much milk the farmer currently produces with his 3 cows. Since each cow provides 5 liters of milk a day, the total milk production from 3 cows is:

\[ 5 \text{ liters/cow/day} \times 3 \text{ cows} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. To find out how much more milk is needed, we subtract the current production from the desired production:

\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Now, we need to determine how many additional cows are required to produce the additional 10 liters of milk a day. Since each cow provides 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed is:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow/day}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs to have 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the ages as follows:
- Let \( S \) be my age.
- Let \( B \) be my brother's age.
- Let \( M \) be my mom's age.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. I am three years younger than my brother: \( S = B - 3 \).
2. I am two years older than my sister: \( S = T + 2 \), where \( T \) is my sister's age.
3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age: \( M = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of our ages is 87: \( S + B + T + M = 87 \).

Since \( S = T + 2 \), we can substitute \( T \) with \( S - 2 \). Now, substituting the expressions for \( S \), \( B \), and \( M \) into the sum of the ages equation, we get:
\[ S + B + (S - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87. \]
Simplifying the left side, we have:
\[ 2S + 4B - 3 = 87. \]
Adding 3 to both sides, we get:
\[ 2S + 4B = 90. \]
Dividing the entire equation by 2, we get:
\[ S + 2B = 45. \]
From the first relationship \( S = B - 3 \), we can substitute \( S \) in the equation \( S + 2B = 45 \):
\[ (B - 3) + 2B = 45. \]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3B - 3 = 45. \]
Adding 3 to both sides, we get:
\[ 3B = 48. \]
Dividing by 3, we get:
\[ B = 16. \]
Now, substituting \( B = 16 \) back into the equation \( S = B - 3 \):
\[ S = 16 - 3 = 13. \]
So, my age is \( 13 \).

"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first calculate the total number of glue sticks required. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks needed is:

\[ 27 \times 2 = 54 \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of glue sticks are required to get at least 54 glue sticks. Since glue sticks come in packs of 8, we divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:

\[ 54 \div 8 = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks. To ensure he has enough, we calculate the total number of glue sticks in 7 packs:

\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 \]

Since 56 is more than the 54 glue sticks needed, Mr. Jackson will have 2 extra glue sticks. Thus, the number of packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of new infections each day and add them to the total number of infected people.

- **Day 0**: Initially, there are 10 infected people.
- **Day 1**: Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others, so the number of new infections is \(10 \times 6 = 60\). Therefore, the total number of infected people after Day 1 is \(10 + 60 = 70\).
- **Day 2**: Now there are 70 infected people, and each of them infects 6 others. So, the number of new infections is \(70 \times 6 = 420\). Therefore, the total number of infected people after Day 2 is \(70 + 420 = 490\).
- **Day 3**: Now there are 490 infected people, and each of them infects 6 others. So, the number of new infections is \(490 \times 6 = 2940\). Therefore, the total number of infected people after Day 3 is \(490 + 2940 = 3430\).

Thus, the number of people infected after three days is \(\boxed{3430}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Rafaela received as tips. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate the total as follows:

\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/badge}} = 6 \text{ badges} \]

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. Since Claire earns 12 badges in a year, Wendy earns:
\[ 3 \times 12 \text{ badges} = 36 \text{ badges} \]

Now, to find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns:
\[ 36 \text{ badges} - 6 \text{ badges} = 30 \text{ badges} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much Paige raised, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours Paige baked.
2. Determine the total number of banana bread loaves baked.
3. Calculate the total number of slices.
4. Find out the total revenue from selling the slices.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours Paige baked.**
Paige baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM. The total number of hours is:
\[ 6:00 \text{ PM} - 1:00 \text{ PM} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of banana bread loaves baked.**
Paige can bake 2 banana bread loaves per hour. Over 5 hours, the total number of loaves is:
\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of slices.**
Each loaf is cut into 8 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices is:
\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

**Step 4: Find out the total revenue from selling the slices.**
Each slice is sold for 50 cents. The total revenue in cents is:
\[ 80 \text{ slices} \times 50 \text{ cents/slice} = 4000 \text{ cents} \]
Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, the total revenue in dollars is:
\[ \frac{4000 \text{ cents}}{100 \text{ cents/dollar}} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"If Gretchen has 70 gold coins and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, then she has \(70 - 30 = 40\) silver coins. The total number of coins Gretchen has is the sum of the gold coins and the silver coins, which is \(70 + 40 = 110\).

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we first need to calculate the total number of burritos given to the students and the number of burritos Mr. George ate.

Each of the 50 students was given 10 burritos, so the total number of burritos given to the students is:
\[ 50 \times 10 = 500 \]

Mr. George ate 20 burritos. Therefore, the total number of burritos consumed (either by the students or Mr. George) is:
\[ 500 + 20 = 520 \]

George ordered 600 burritos in total. To find the number of leftover burritos, we subtract the total number of burritos consumed from the total number of burritos ordered:
\[ 600 - 520 = 80 \]

Thus, the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is:
\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of each type of car in the bumper car rink.

- The number of red cars is given as 12.
- The number of green cars is 2 fewer than the number of red cars. Therefore, the number of green cars is \(12 - 2 = 10\).
- The number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars. Therefore, the number of blue cars is \(3 \times 10 = 30\).

Now, let's calculate the total number of red, green, and blue cars:
- Red cars: 12
- Green cars: 10
- Blue cars: 30

Adding these together gives:
\[ 12 + 10 + 30 = 52 \]

The total number of cars in the rink is 75. To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:
\[ 75 - 52 = 23 \]

Therefore, the number of yellow cars is 23.

\[
\boxed{23}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of books Anne has as \( A \). According to the problem, Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has \( A + 25 \) books. Additionally, Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Fawn has \( A + 12 \) books.

The total number of books that Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have together is 85. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ (A + 25) + A + (A + 12) = 85 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 3A + 37 = 85 \]

Next, we solve for \( A \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. Subtract 37 from both sides:
\[ 3A = 48 \]

Then, divide both sides by 3:
\[ A = 16 \]

So, Anne has 16 books. Since Fawn has 12 more books than Anne, we calculate the number of books Fawn has as follows:
\[ A + 12 = 16 + 12 = 28 \]

Therefore, the number of books Fawn has is \(\boxed{28}\)."
"First, we need to determine the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, the weight of the sweet potatoes is:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find the weight of the carrots. The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes. Therefore, the weight of the carrots is:
\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the number of pounds of carrots Daisy bought is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of jello cups Greg needs to make. Since there are 30 kids and each kid should have 4 jello cups, the total number of jello cups required is:
\[ 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ jello cups per kid} = 120 \text{ jello cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how many three-ounce boxes of jello are required to make 120 jello cups. Since one box makes 10 jello cups, the number of boxes needed is:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ jello cups}}{10 \text{ jello cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Each box of jello costs $1.25, so the total cost for 12 boxes is:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \times 1.25 \text{ dollars per box} = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 15 \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the 5 phones. Each phone costs $700, so the total cost is:
\[ 5 \times 700 = 3500 \]

The seller received $4000 in dollar bills. To find out how much change the seller will give back, we subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount received:
\[ 4000 - 3500 = 500 \]

Therefore, the seller will give back \(\boxed{500}\) in change."
"To determine how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to calculate how much Madeline and Keenan each pay per month, and then find out how much Keenan pays per week.

1. Calculate Madeline's monthly payment:
   Madeline pays 60% of the $400 monthly cost.
   \[
   \text{Madeline's monthly payment} = 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Calculate Keenan's monthly payment:
   Since the total monthly cost is $400 and Madeline pays $240, Keenan pays the remaining amount.
   \[
   \text{Keenan's monthly payment} = 400 - 240 = 160 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Calculate Keenan's weekly payment:
   There are approximately 4 weeks in a month, so we divide Keenan's monthly payment by 4 to find his weekly payment.
   \[
   \text{Keenan's weekly payment} = \frac{160}{4} = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, Keenan spends \(\boxed{40}\) dollars per week."
"First, let's calculate how many pieces Tobias ate on the first day. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 pieces:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ pieces}
\]

After the first day, the number of pieces remaining is:

\[
60 - 24 = 36 \text{ pieces}
\]

On the second day, Tobias ate 10 pieces, so the number of pieces remaining after the second day is:

\[
36 - 10 = 26 \text{ pieces}
\]

On the third day, Tobias ate \( \frac{7}{13} \) of the remaining 26 pieces:

\[
\frac{7}{13} \times 26 = 14 \text{ pieces}

"First, let's find the cost of one bottle of soda. Since seven bottles of soda cost $21.00, the cost of one bottle of soda is:

\[ \text{Cost of one bottle of soda} = \frac{21.00}{7} = 3.00 \]

Next, let's find the cost of one bottle of water. Since four bottles of water cost $8, the cost of one bottle of water is:

\[ \text{Cost of one bottle of water} = \frac{8.00}{4} = 2.00 \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost for David to buy 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:

\[ \text{Total cost} = (3 \times 3.00) + (2 \times 2.00) = 9.00 + 4.00 = 13.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to find out how many marbles Paul has after his friend gives him more marbles. Paul initially has 52 marbles and his friend gives him 28 more marbles. So, we add these two quantities together:

\[ 52 + 28 = 80 \]

Next, Paul loses \(\frac{1}{4}\) of his marbles. To find out how many marbles he loses, we calculate \(\frac{1}{4}\) of 80:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20 \]

Now, we subtract the number of marbles he lost from the total number of marbles he had after his friend gave him more marbles:

\[ 80 - 20 = 60 \]

So, the number of marbles Paul has left is:

"To determine how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Use the total revenue to find the cost of the chickens.

First, we calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell. He plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his 300 chickens:
\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \text{ chickens}
\]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling these 180 chickens at $50 per chicken:
\[
180 \times 50 = 9000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, the total cost of the chickens must be the total revenue minus the profit:
\[
9000 - 2000 = 7000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the amount of money Isaias bought the chickens for is:
\[
\boxed{7000}

"First, let's determine how many glasses of lemonade Micah sold. We know that Julie, Micah, and Mitchell together sold 32 glasses of lemonade, and Julie sold 14 glasses. Therefore, the number of glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell together is:

\[ 32 - 14 = 18 \]

Since the boys (Micah and Mitchell) sold an equal number of glasses, we can divide the 18 glasses equally between them:

\[ \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

So, Micah sold 9 glasses of lemonade. Now, we need to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah:

\[ 14 - 9 = 5 \]

Thus, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah. The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the rope Sarah has. The rope is 20 meters long and costs $2 per meter. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times 2 \text{ dollars/meter} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Sarah plans to use the profit from selling the rope to buy a new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter. To find out how many meters of the new rope she can buy, we need to determine how many meters of the original rope she can sell. Since the original rope costs $2 per meter, the number of meters she can sell is:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ dollars}}{2 \text{ dollars/meter}} = 20 \text{ meters} \]

With 20 meters of the original rope, she can buy:
\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars/meter} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

This $30 is the amount she will spend on the new rope. Since she initially had $40, the amount of money she will have left over after buying the new rope is:
\[ 40 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

"To solve this problem, let's denote Melanie's current age as \( x \).

According to the problem, in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 10 = 18 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 18 - 10 \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

We need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. Let's denote the number of years from now as \( y \). At that time, her age will be \( 8 + y \), and we want this to be three times her current age:
\[ 8 + y = 3 \times 8 \]
\[ 8 + y = 24 \]

Solving for \( y \):
\[ y = 24 - 8 \]
\[ y = 16 \]

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

"First, let's calculate the cost of each item Kelly is purchasing.

1. **Cost of Bacon:**
   Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total.
   \[
   \text{Cost per pack of bacon} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of Chicken:**
   Each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   \[
   \text{Cost per pack of chicken} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Kelly has 6 packs of chicken.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of chicken} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of Strawberries:**
   Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of strawberries} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Cost of Apples:**
   Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   \[
   \text{Cost per pack of apples} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Kelly has 7 packs of apples.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of apples} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}

"First, let's calculate the total number of petals on the orchids. Joelle has 5 orchids, and each orchid has 5 petals. Therefore, the total number of petals on the orchids is:
\[ 5 \text{ orchids} \times 5 \text{ petals/orchid} = 25 \text{ petals} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals on the African daisies. Joelle has 4 African daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals. Therefore, the total number of petals on the daisies is:
\[ 4 \text{ daisies} \times 10 \text{ petals/daisy} = 40 \text{ petals} \]

Now, to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies:

"First, let's determine the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants, so we calculate:

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. We find the number of flowering plants by subtracting the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:

\[ \text{Number of flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25 \]

To find what percent of the total plants are flowering plants, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Tasha earned from mowing lawns and then subtract that amount from her total earnings to find out how much she made from lemonade sales.

First, let's establish the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn. Since Joe paid her $6 and we don't have the rate per mow, we can infer that the payment is directly proportional to the number of times she mowed the lawn. Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( x \). Therefore, the payment from Joe is \( 6x = 6 \), which simplifies to \( x = 1 \). So, Tasha mowed Joe's lawn once.

Next, we calculate the number of times she mowed Kamala's lawn. According to the problem, she mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as she did Joe's lawn. Since she mowed Joe's lawn once, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3 \times 1 = 3 \) times.

Then, we calculate the number of times she mowed Alba's lawn. The problem states that she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's lawn. Since she mowed Joe's lawn once, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5 \times 1 = 5 \) times.

Now, we can calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns. The payment for mowing Joe's lawn is $6, for Kamala's lawn it is \( 3 \times 6 = 18 \) dollars, and for Alba's lawn it is \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \) dollars. Adding these amounts together gives the total earnings from mowing lawns:
\[ 6 + 18 + 30 = 54 \text{ dollars} \]

Tasha's total earnings for the month were $80. Therefore, the amount she made from lemonade sales is:
\[ 80 - 54 = 26 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \text{Carl's weight} = 55 \, \text{kg} + 16 \, \text{kg} = 71 \, \text{kg} \]

Next, we find Christian's weight, which is 8 kg more than Carl's weight:
\[ \text{Christian's weight} = \text{Carl's weight} + 8 \]
\[ \text{Christian's weight} = 71 \, \text{kg} + 8 \, \text{kg} = 79 \, \text{kg} \]

Finally, we determine Harry's weight, which is 5 kg less than Christian's weight:
\[ \text{Harry's weight} = \text{Christian's weight} - 5 \]
\[ \text{Harry's weight} = 79 \, \text{kg} - 5 \, \text{kg} = 74 \, \text{kg} \]

The weight of Harry is 74 kg."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours John rents his car out in a month. He rents his car 10 times a month, and each time for 3 hours. Therefore, the total number of hours rented in a month is:

\[ 10 \text{ times/month} \times 3 \text{ hours/time} = 30 \text{ hours/month} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money John earns from renting his car in a month. He gets paid $25 per hour, so:

\[ 30 \text{ hours/month} \times 25 \text{ dollars/hour} = 750 \text{ dollars/month} \]

Now, we need to determine John's profit. His profit is the total earnings minus his monthly car payment. His car payment is $500 per month, so:

\[ 750 \text{ dollars/month} - 500 \text{ dollars/month} = 250 \text{ dollars/month} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 250 \]"
"Martha originally had 7 - 5 = 2 notebooks.
Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha originally, he had 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks.
Now, Martha has 7 notebooks and Joseph has 6 notebooks.
Therefore, Martha has 7 - 6 = 1 more notebook than Joseph.

The final numerical answer is 1."
"First, we need to determine how many miles Anis rowed. We know that Anis rowed \(\frac{1}{5}\) times more miles than Dijana. Since Dijana rowed 50 miles, we can calculate the additional miles Anis rowed as follows:

\[
\text{Additional miles Anis rowed} = \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles}
\]

Adding this to the 50 miles Dijana rowed gives us the total distance Anis rowed:

\[
\text{Total miles Anis rowed} = 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles}
\]

Next, we calculate the total distance both Dijana and Anis rowed together:

\[
\text{Total distance} = \text{Distance Dijana rowed} + \text{Distance Anis rowed} = 50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the total distance the two of them rowed on that day is:

\[
\boxed{110}

"First, let's determine how many pages each person read over the two days.

Yesterday:
- Denise read 10 pages.
- Daniel read 13 pages.

Today:
- Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.
- Daniel was not able to read any pages today, so he read 0 pages today.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages each person read over the two days:
- Denise's total: \(10 + 18 = 28\) pages.
- Daniel's total: \(13 + 0 = 13\) pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total number of pages Daniel read from the total number of pages Denise read:
\[ 28 - 13 = 15 \]

Thus, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{15}

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup, we first need to understand the capacity of the pot in terms of adult and child bowls.

The pot can fill:
- 4 adult's bowls
- 8 child's bowls

Since Calvin is an adult, he will have one bowl of soup. His wife is also an adult, so she will have one bowl of soup as well. This accounts for 2 adult bowls. The remaining bowls will be for the two children.

The pot can fill 8 child's bowls, and we have already used 2 adult bowls (1 for Calvin and 1 for his wife). Therefore, the number of child's bowls available is:
\[ 8 - 2 = 6 \]

Calvin and his two children each get one bowl of soup. So, the total number of bowls used is:
\[ 1 \text{ (Calvin)} + 1 \text{ (wife)} + 2 \text{ (children)} = 4 \]

Since there are 6 child's bowls available, the number of times each child can have a bowl of soup is:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Thus, each child can have a bowl of soup 3 times. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"

"To determine the amount of material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we first need to calculate the material required for each type of mask.

For small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \) yards.
- For 20 small masks, the material needed is \( 20 \times 0.5 = 10 \) yards.

For large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25}{3} = 0.75 \) yards.
- For 8 large masks, the material needed is \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \) yards.

Adding the material needed for both types of masks:
- Total material needed = material for small masks + material for large masks
- Total material needed = 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards.

"To determine Harold's free time, we need to calculate the total time he spends on his activities and subtract that from the total hours in a day.

1. Harold sleeps for 10 hours.
2. He works for 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.
3. He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

First, we sum up the time spent on these activities:
\[ 10 \text{ (sleep)} + 8 \text{ (work)} + 1 \text{ (walk dog)} = 19 \text{ hours} \]

A day has 24 hours, so the free time Harold has left is:

Next, let's find out how many red shoe boxes Tim uses. He uses 1/3 of his red shoe boxes:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 \text{ red shoe boxes} = 3 \text{ red shoe boxes} \]

Now, let's calculate the number of red shoe boxes left:
\[ 9 \text{ red shoe boxes} - 3 \text{ red shoe boxes} = 6 \text{ red shoe boxes} \]

Finally, we add the remaining blue and red shoe boxes to find the total number of shoe boxes left:

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information provided.

Let \( D \) be Duncan's age eight years ago and \( A \) be Adam's age four years ago.

From the problem, we know:
1. Duncan's current age is 60.
2. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( 60 - 8 = 52 \).
3. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was two times Adam's age four years ago.

So, we can write the equation:
\[ D = 2A \]
\[ 52 = 2A \]

From this, we can solve for \( A \):
\[ A = \frac{52}{2} = 26 \]

This means Adam's age four years ago was 26. To find Adam's current age, we add 4 to 26:
\[ \text{Adam's current age} = 26 + 4 = 30 \]

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
\[ \text{Adam's age in 8 years} = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the size of Farmer Smith's farm. Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

To find twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm:
\[ 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ acres} \]

Now, add 100 acres to this amount to find the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \text{ acres} \]

Next, we need to find the total number of acres for both farms combined. We add the size of Farmer Brown's farm to the size of Farmer Smith's farm:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of yellow balloons based on the given information.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( r \) be the number of red balloons.
- Let \( y \) be the number of yellow balloons.

From the problem, we know:
- Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
- Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
- Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna.
- There are 20 red balloons.

We can set up the following equations based on the information provided:
1. The total number of red balloons is 20:
   \[
   r = 20
   \]
2. The total number of pieces of bologna thrown is 58:
   \[

"First, let's calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class. Since there are 30 students and each student sold an average of 10 lollipops, the total number of lollipops sold is:

\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops. Each lollypop was sold for $0.8, so the total revenue is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollypop} = \$240 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops. Each lollypop was bought for $0.5, so the total cost is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollypop} = \$150 \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ \$240 - \$150 = \$90 \]

Therefore, the class was able to raise \(\boxed{90}\) dollars from the profit of selling lollipops."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cups of chamomile and mint tea Lana brews in each row, and then find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row.

First, let's determine the total number of cups of chamomile and mint tea. Since Lana has 27 cups and she uses 15 of them for cinnamon tea, the remaining cups are:
\[ 27 - 15 = 12 \]
These 12 cups are divided equally between chamomile and mint tea. Therefore, the number of cups of chamomile tea and mint tea is:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]
So, there are 6 cups of chamomile tea and 6 cups of mint tea.

Next, we need to determine how many cups of chamomile and mint tea are in each row. Since the 6 cups of chamomile tea and 6 cups of mint tea are divided into 3 rows, the number of cups of chamomile tea and mint tea in each row is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which the sloth picks berries and then use that rate to find out how many berries he can pick up in the given time.

First, let's break down the information:
- The sloth takes 4 hours to make a trip down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up.
- The sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

Since the sloth takes 4 hours to pick up berries, we can calculate the number of berries he picks up in 4 hours. Let's denote the number of berries he picks up per trip as \( x \).

Given that he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 2 \times 4x = 24 \]
This equation accounts for the fact that he makes 2 trips in 8 hours (since 8 hours is twice the time of one trip).

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ 8x = 24 \]
\[ x = \frac{24}{8} \]
\[ x = 3 \]

Therefore, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip is 3.

"First, we need to determine the amount of water in the tank. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons of water, the tank will have:

\[ \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much water will be left in the tank after 6 days, given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. The total amount of water removed from the tank over 6 days is:

\[ 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Subtracting this amount from the initial amount of water in the tank gives us the remaining amount of water:

\[ 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many more movies Colby can see, we need to calculate his remaining budget after accounting for the items he has already purchased.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items he has already bought:
- 2 tubs of popcorn: \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars
- 4 boxes of candy: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars
- 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday: \(5 \times 10 = 50\) dollars
- 8 movies on other days: \(8 \times 7 = 56\) dollars

Adding these together gives the total spent:
\[16 + 8 + 50 + 56 = 120\] dollars

Colby starts with $150, so his remaining budget is:
\[150 - 120 = 30\] dollars

Now, we need to determine how many more movies he can see with the remaining $30. Each movie ticket costs $7, so we divide the remaining budget by the cost of a movie ticket:
\[30 \div 7 = 4.2857\]

Since Colby can only see whole movies, he can see 4 more movies.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine the number of calories in a mini cinnamon roll and a mini blueberry muffin.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, so a mini cinnamon roll, which has 1/3rd of the calories, has:
\[ \frac{600}{3} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, so a mini blueberry muffin, which has 1/3rd of the calories, has:
\[ \frac{450}{3} = 150 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we calculate the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins.

The total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls is:
\[ 200 \text{ mini cinnamon rolls} \times 200 \text{ calories per mini cinnamon roll} = 40000 \text{ calories} \]

The total calories from the mini blueberry muffins is:
\[ 300 \text{ mini blueberry muffins} \times 150 \text{ calories per mini blueberry muffin} = 45000 \text{ calories} \]

Adding these together gives the total calories from all the pastries:

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the five days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, which is \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs per day. Therefore, for both Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed \(78 + 78 = 156\) Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, we sum the number of Junebugs removed over the five days:
\[39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300\]

To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days (which is 5):

Thus, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"First, we calculate the distance traveled by the bus. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For the bus:
\[ \text{Speed} = 60 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, the distance traveled by the bus is:
\[ 60 \text{ miles per hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance traveled by the car:
\[ \text{Speed} = 30 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

So, the distance traveled by the car is:
\[ 30 \text{ miles per hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 240 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:
\[ 300 \text{ miles} - 240 \text{ miles} = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the bus went 60 miles farther than the car. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 60 \]"
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to add up all the toys Sophie already has and then subtract that total from the new total number of toys.

The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks.
The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals.
The tower of stacking rings has 9 multicolored rings.

Adding these together gives:
31 (blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (rings) = 48 toys.

Sophie's new total number of toys is 62. To find out how many bouncy balls were in the tube, we subtract the number of toys she already had from the new total:

62 (total toys) - 48 (existing toys) = 14 bouncy balls.

So, the number of bouncy balls that came in the tube is 14."
"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old:
   \[
   P + Pa + J = 100
   \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   Pa = J + 10
   \]

3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = Pa + J
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now, we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[
Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the age of Peter is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"Initially, Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons, which totals to \(4 \times 2 = 8\) water balloons. Maria also received 2 water balloons, so the total number of water balloons at this point is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Her mom then gave each person 3 more water balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional water balloons is \(5 \times 3 = 15\).

Adding these to the previous total, the girls had \(10 + 15 = 25\) water balloons in total.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes of stuff available for the yard sale.

Each of the 10 people donates 5 boxes, so the total donation is:
\[ 10 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ boxes/person} = 50 \text{ boxes} \]

They also have 10 boxes already owned by the charity group. Therefore, the total number of boxes available is:
\[ 50 \text{ boxes} + 10 \text{ boxes} = 60 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many tables are required to fit all the boxes. Each table can hold 2 boxes of stuff. So, the number of tables needed is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ boxes}}{2 \text{ boxes/table}} = 30 \text{ tables} \]

The charity group already owns 15 tables. To find out how many new tables are needed, we subtract the number of tables they already have from the total number of tables required:
\[ 30 \text{ tables} - 15 \text{ tables} = 15 \text{ new tables} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 15 \]"
"First, we calculate the total distance Zoey spits her seeds. Zoey has 40 seeds and spits each one 10 feet. Therefore, the total distance Zoey spits is:
\[ 40 \text{ seeds} \times 10 \text{ feet/seed} = 400 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the total distance Sydney spits her seeds. Sydney has 35 seeds and spits each one 12 feet. Therefore, the total distance Sydney spits is:
\[ 35 \text{ seeds} \times 12 \text{ feet/seed} = 420 \text{ feet} \]

To find the average total distance spat, we add the total distances spat by Zoey and Sydney and then divide by 2:
\[ \text{Average total distance} = \frac{400 \text{ feet} + 420 \text{ feet}}{2} = \frac{820 \text{ feet}}{2} = 410 \text{ feet} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 410 \]"
"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the daily, monthly, and total widget production for each machine and then find the difference in revenue.

First, let's calculate the daily widget production for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: \(60 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 1440 \text{ widgets/day}\)
- WidgetMaster 9000: \(45 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 1080 \text{ widgets/day}\)

Next, let's calculate the monthly widget production for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: \(1440 \text{ widgets/day} \times 30 \text{ days/month} = 43200 \text{ widgets/month}\)
- WidgetMaster 9000: \(1080 \text{ widgets/day} \times 30 \text{ days/month} = 32400 \text{ widgets/month}\)

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling the widgets for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: \(43200 \text{ widgets} \times \$6/\text{widget} = \$259200\)
- WidgetMaster 9000: \(32400 \text{ widgets} \times \$6/\text{widget} = \$194400\)

Finally, let's find the difference in revenue:
- Difference: \(\$259200 - \$194400 = \$64800\)

Therefore, Fern will make \(\$64800\) more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000."
"To determine how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the total cost of his stay under both options and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost if Cameron pays for a 24-hour stay:
- The initial 12-hour stay costs 1600 pesos.
- The additional 12 hours cost 12 * 70 pesos = 840 pesos.
- Therefore, the total cost for a 24-hour stay is 1600 + 840 = 2440 pesos.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Cameron pays for the additional hours after the first 12 hours:
- The initial 12-hour stay costs 1600 pesos.
- The additional hours from 12 pm to 10 am the next morning is 10 pm - 12 pm = 10 hours.
- The cost for these additional hours is 10 * 70 pesos = 700 pesos.
- Therefore, the total cost for the additional hours is 1600 + 700 = 2300 pesos.

Now, we find the savings by subtracting the total cost for the additional hours from the total cost for a 24-hour stay:
- Savings = 2440 - 2300 = 140 pesos.

The final numerical answer is:
140"
"First, let's determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Therefore, the amount of hay each sheep needs is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Hay per sheep} = 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats. There are 15 goats, and each goat needs 5 pounds of hay:

\[ \text{Total hay for goats} = 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep. There are 12 sheep, and each sheep needs 7 pounds of hay:

\[ \text{Total hay for sheep} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the total amount of hay Nate needs:

\[ \text{Total hay needed} = 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{159} \]"
"First, let's calculate John's total earnings for the week:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Hourly wage} \times \text{Hours worked} = 50 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the cost of gas from his total earnings:
\[ \text{Remaining money after gas} = \text{Total earnings} - \text{Cost of gas} = 300 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 250 \, \text{dollars} \]

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so we subtract that from his remaining money:
\[ \text{Money left after deposit} = \text{Remaining money after gas} - \text{Deposit} = 250 \, \text{dollars} - 100 \, \text{dollars} = 150 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, we need to account for the cost of the pencils. Each pencil costs 10 dollars and he buys 5 pencils:
\[ \text{Cost of pencils} = \text{Number of pencils} \times \text{Cost per pencil} = 5 \times 10 \, \text{dollars} = 50 \, \text{dollars} \]

Subtract the cost of the pencils from the remaining money:
\[ \text{Money left after buying pencils} = \text{Money left after deposit} - \text{Cost of pencils} = 150 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 100 \, \text{dollars} \]

Finally, we determine how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with the remaining money:
\[ \text{Number of pens} = \frac{\text{Money left after buying pencils}}{\text{Cost per pen}} = \frac{100 \, \text{dollars}}{25 \, \text{dollars/pen}} = 4 \, \text{pens} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of letters Craig has spelled out. Craig has spelled out 20 words with 15 letters each. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig has spelled out is:

\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled out. According to the problem, Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled out is:

\[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]

Now, to find the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds, we add the total number of letters spelled out by Craig and his brother:

\[ 300 + 350 = 650 \]

Thus, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is:

Next, calculate the number of children in one school:
\[ 8 \text{ children/row} \times 7 \text{ rows/school} = 56 \text{ children/school} \]

Finally, calculate the total number of children for all 5 schools:
\[ 56 \text{ children/school} \times 5 \text{ schools} = 280 \text{ children} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 280 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can redeem with her coupons. The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. Therefore, the total number of bottles from the coupons is:

\[ 9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles/coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles of apple juice are given to the students. There are 29 pupils, and each student receives 2 bottles of apple juice. Therefore, the total number of bottles given to the students is:

\[ 29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles/student} = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher has to find out how many bottles the teacher has left for herself:

\[ 900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

Thus, the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself is:

\[ \boxed{842} \]"
"To calculate the total charge for Patty's Plumbing, we need to consider the visit fee, the labor cost, and the cost of parts.

1. The visit fee is $40.
2. The labor cost is $35 per hour. Since the job took 2.25 hours, the labor cost is \(2.25 \times 35\).
3. The cost of parts is $60.

Let's calculate the labor cost first:
\[ 2.25 \times 35 = 78.75 \]

Now, we add the visit fee, the labor cost, and the cost of parts:
\[ 40 + 78.75 + 60 = 178.75 \]

Therefore, Patty charged:
\[ \boxed{178.75} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount. James gets 10 new CDs, and each CD costs $15. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 10 \times 15 = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we apply the 40% discount to the total cost. A 40% discount means he pays 60% of the original price. So, the cost after the discount is:
\[ 150 \times 0.60 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

James decides he doesn't like 5 of the CDs and sells them for $40. This means he loses the $40 from selling the CDs he doesn't like. Therefore, the total amount of money he is out is the cost of the CDs after the discount minus the money he gets from selling the 5 CDs:
\[ 90 - 40 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To calculate the total earnings, we need to multiply the number of each type of root crop by its respective price and then sum up all the earnings.

6 yams * $1.5 per yam = $9.00

For the sweet potatoes:
10 sweet potatoes * $2 per sweet potato = $20.00

For the carrots:
4 carrots * $1.25 per carrot = $5.00

Now, we add up all the earnings:
$9.00 + $20.00 + $5.00 = $34.00

So, Jen will earn $34.00 if she sells everything."
"First, let's calculate the distance James swims. He swims 60% of the 20-mile lake, which is:
\[ 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes for James to swim 12 miles at a pace of 2 miles per hour:
\[ \text{Time to swim 12 miles} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

James then rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is:
\[ \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

After resting, James swims the remaining 8 miles (since 20 - 12 = 8) at half the speed, which is:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour} \]

The time it takes for James to swim the remaining 8 miles at 1 mile per hour is:
\[ \text{Time to swim remaining 8 miles} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Adding up all the times, the total time taken is:
\[ \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total commission Cayley will earn, we need to calculate the commission for each newspaper separately and then sum them up.

For the New York Times:
- Number of copies sold: 6
- Cost per copy: $5
- Commission rate: 10%

The commission per New York Times copy is:
\[ 5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \]

The total commission for 6 copies of the New York Times is:
\[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \]

For the Wall Street Journal:
- Number of copies sold: 10
- Cost per copy: $15
- Commission rate: 8%

The commission per Wall Street Journal copy is:
\[ 15 \times 0.08 = 1.20 \]

The total commission for 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal is:
\[ 10 \times 1.20 = 12.00 \]

"To find Marcus's age, we start with the information that Deanna is 26 years old and Deanna is five years older than Marcus. Therefore, we can calculate Marcus's age as follows:

\[ \text{Marcus's age} = \text{Deanna's age} - 5 = 26 - 5 = 21 \]

Next, we know that Marcus is half of Leo's age. Therefore, we can find Leo's age by doubling Marcus's age:

\[ \text{Leo's age} = 2 \times \text{Marcus's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 42 \]"
"Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as \( A \). According to the problem, Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Bahati's points can be represented as \( A + 20 \). Additionally, Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, so Dinar's points can be represented as \( (A + 20) - 10 = A + 10 \).

The total points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar is 45. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ (A + 20) + A + (A + 10) = 45 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ A + 20 + A + A + 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]

Subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 3A = 15 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored \( 5 \) points. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"

"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up early.

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Converting this to minutes, we get:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes} \]

On the day in question, Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m. instead of 6 a.m. Additionally, she sleepwalked from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is:
\[ 2:38 \text{ a.m.} - 2:15 \text{ a.m.} = 23 \text{ minutes} \]

The total time she was not sleeping on her bed that day is the time she woke up early plus the time she sleepwalked:
\[ 5 \text{ minutes} + 23 \text{ minutes} = 28 \text{ minutes} \]

Subtracting this from her total sleep time gives the time she slept on her bed:
\[ 480 \text{ minutes} - 28 \text{ minutes} = 452 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the number of minutes Kim slept on her bed that day is:
\[ 452 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of measuring cups Jonathan has. Since he has two dozen measuring cups, we calculate:

\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \]

Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons he has is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \]

Now, we add the number of measuring cups and the remaining number of measuring spoons to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining:

\[ 24 + 10 = 34 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 34 \]"
"First, let's determine the initial number of occupied beds in the hospital. Given that the hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied, we can calculate the initial number of occupied beds as follows:

\[ \text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of patients admitted over 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, the total number of patients admitted over 2 weeks (14 days) is:

\[ \text{Total patients admitted} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

Now, we can find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks by adding the initial number of occupied beds to the total number of patients admitted:

\[ \text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Finally, to find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the total number of occupied beds from the total capacity of the hospital:

\[ \text{Unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 900 = 100 \]

The total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of emails that are not work emails. Since Robyn sends sixteen emails a day and seven of them are work emails, the number of non-work emails is:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these non-work emails are to family. According to the problem, two-thirds of the remainder (which is 9 emails) are to family. So, the number of family emails is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

Now, we subtract the number of family emails from the total non-work emails to find out how many emails are left:

\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

These remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. According to the problem, one-third of these remaining emails are to her boyfriend. So, the number of emails sent to her boyfriend is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

Thus, the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day is:

"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate the number that is 20% less than the number reported by Courtney.

Courtney reported 48 people attended the concert. Kelly states that this number is 20% too high. Therefore, we need to find 20% of 48 and subtract it from 48.

First, calculate 20% of 48:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 48 = \frac{20}{100} \times 48 = 0.2 \times 48 = 9.6 \]

Now, subtract this value from the reported number:
\[ 48 - 9.6 = 38.4 \]

Since the number of people must be a whole number, and typically such scenarios assume rounding to the nearest whole number, we round 38.4 to 38.

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is:
\[ 38 \]"
"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \). According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls. We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so we can set up the equation \( 2J = 2 \). Solving for \( J \), we get \( J = 1 \). Therefore, Jeffrey carried 1 ball, Jason carried \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) balls, and Jordan carried \( 4 \times 1 = 4 \) balls. The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey, which is \( 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 \) balls. Since the three boys picked up and carried all the balls in one trip, the total number of balls the coach brought to practice is 7.

The final numerical answer is:

4. According to the problem, by the end of the third day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day:
   \[
   4 \times 10 \text{ holes} = 40 \text{ holes}
   \]

5. Let \( x \) be the number of holes dug on the fourth day. The total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is:
   \[
   21 \text{ holes} + x \text{ holes} = 40 \text{ holes}
   \]

6. Solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 40 \text{ holes} - 21 \text{ holes} = 19 \text{ holes}
   \]

Therefore, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of corn chips given the conditions provided.

1. Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips.
2. Collins received 15 more corn chips than the number Amora and Lainey received.

First, calculate the number of corn chips Collins received:
\[ \text{Collins' chips} = 70 + 15 = 85 \]

Next, calculate the total number of corn chips by summing the chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:
\[ \text{Total chips} = 70 + 70 + 85 \]

Now, perform the addition:
\[ 70 + 70 = 140 \]
\[ 140 + 85 = 225 \]

Thus, the total number of corn chips is:
\[ \boxed{225} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the cost of the travel tickets. The problem states that the travel tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. The supplies cost $400 in total.

To find 50% of $400:
\[ 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the additional cost for the travel tickets is $200. Adding this to the cost of the supplies gives us the total cost of the travel tickets:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the travel is $600.

\[
\boxed{600}

"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( X = S + 5 \)
2. \( S = 4A - 13 \)
3. \( X + S + A = 339 \)

First, we substitute the expressions for \( X \) and \( S \) from the first two equations into the third equation.

Substituting \( X = S + 5 \) and \( S = 4A - 13 \) into \( X + S + A = 339 \):

\[ (4A - 13) + 5 + (4A - 13) + A = 339 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 4A - 13 + 5 + 4A - 13 + A = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Add 21 to both sides:

\[ 9A = 360 \]

Divide by 9:

\[ A = 40 \]

Now, we can find \( S \) using \( S = 4A - 13 \):

\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{147} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the length of each episode**: Each episode is 20 minutes long.
2. **Determine the number of episodes**: There are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. Since each episode is 20 minutes long, the number of episodes is \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) episodes.
3. **Calculate the total time spent watching the show**: If John watches every episode, the total time spent is the number of episodes multiplied by the length of each episode. So, \( 10 \text{ episodes} \times 20 \text{ minutes/episode} = 200 \text{ minutes} \).

Therefore, the total time John will spend watching the show is 200 minutes.

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance flown in the southerly and northerly directions separately and then sum these distances.

1. **Southerly Flight:**
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Northerly Flight:**
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \)

3. **Final Southerly Flight:**
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \)

Now, we sum the distances flown in the southerly direction:
\[ 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[ \boxed{410} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of brownies Greta had initially.

1. Greta made a batch for herself: 1 dozen brownies.
   \[
   1 \text{ dozen} = 12 \text{ brownies}
   \]

2. At her office, she received 1/2 a dozen brownies.
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \text{ dozen} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ brownies}
   \]

3. At her friends' surprise party, she received 4 dozen brownies.
   \[
   4 \text{ dozen} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ brownies}
   \]

Next, we sum up all the brownies received:
\[
12 \text{ (initial batch)} + 6 \text{ (from office)} + 48 \text{ (from friends)} = 66 \text{ brownies}
   \]

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten:
\[
1 \frac{1}{2} \text{ dozen} = 1.5 \times 12 = 18 \text{ brownies}
   \]

Subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies received:
\[
66 \text{ (total brownies)} - 18 \text{ (eaten brownies)} = 48 \text{ brownies}
   \]

Thus, the number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is:
\[

"First, let's determine the ages of Nani's brother and sister.

Nani's age is 8 years.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so:
\[ \text{Brother's age} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ years} \]

Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani, which means she is 75% of Nani's age:
\[ \text{Sister's age} = 0.75 \times 8 = 6 \text{ years} \]

Now, let's calculate the total age of all three family members:
\[ \text{Total age} = \text{Nani's age} + \text{Brother's age} + \text{Sister's age} \]
\[ \text{Total age} = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 \text{ years} \]

"To determine the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[
P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
\]

Given the dimensions of the fence:
- Length = 15 feet
- Width = 10 feet

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[
P = 2 \times (15 + 10) = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ feet}
\]

Next, we know that Robert needs 2 wooden slats for every foot of fencing. Therefore, the total number of wooden slats required is:

"First, we need to determine the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington initially had, which is 12 boxes.

Next, we calculate the number of boxes she gave to her mom and her sister. She gave each 2 boxes, so:
\[ 2 \text{ boxes} + 2 \text{ boxes} = 4 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, we subtract the boxes given away from the total number of boxes to find out how many boxes she kept:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} - 4 \text{ boxes} = 8 \text{ boxes} \]

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges, so we need to find out how many boxes that represents:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 \text{ boxes} = 3 \text{ boxes} \]

This means she kept 3 boxes, and thus sold the remaining boxes:
\[ 8 \text{ boxes} - 3 \text{ boxes} = 5 \text{ boxes} \]

Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she sold is:
\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 20 \text{ oranges/box} = 100 \text{ oranges} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 100 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the number of states in the USA. According to the latest data, the United States has 50 states.

Given that India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, we can calculate the number of states in India as follows:
- Half the number of states in the USA is \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \).
- India has 4 more than this, so the number of states in India is \( 25 + 4 = 29 \).

Now, to find the total number of states in both countries, we add the number of states in India and the number of states in the USA:
- Total number of states = Number of states in India + Number of states in the USA
- Total number of states = 29 + 50 = 79

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Tyler wants to buy:
- Dictionary: $18
- Dinosaur book: $13
- Children's cookbook: $8

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Tyler has already saved $14. Therefore, the additional amount he needs to earn is:
Additional amount needed = Total cost - Amount saved
Additional amount needed = $39 - $14 = $25

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn the additional $25, we divide the additional amount needed by his hourly wage:
Hours needed = Additional amount needed / Hourly wage
Hours needed = $25 / $5 = 5 hours

The final numerical answer is 5 hours."
"First, let's determine how many cherries Richard has. We know that Robert has 30 cherries and that he has 10 more cherries than Richard. Therefore, we can calculate the number of cherries Richard has as follows:

\[ \text{Cherries Richard has} = \text{Cherries Robert has} - 10 = 30 - 10 = 20 \]

Next, we know the total number of cherries is 60. We can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting the number of cherries Richard and Robert have from the total number of cherries:

\[ \text{Cherries Jerry has} = \text{Total cherries} - (\text{Cherries Richard has} + \text{Cherries Robert has}) = 60 - (20 + 30) = 60 - 50 = 10 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Cherries Robert has} - \text{Cherries Jerry has} = 30 - 10 = 20 \]

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's define the current ages of Emil's dad and brother as \(D\) and \(B\) respectively.

Given:
- Emil is currently 19 years old.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.

First, let's determine Emil's age when he turns 24:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \text{ years} \]

At that time, Emil's dad's age will be:
\[ 19 + 5 = 24 \]
So, Emil's dad's age will be 24 when Emil is 24. According to the problem, at that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad:
\[ 24 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Dad's age} \]
\[ 24 = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 \]
This confirms that Emil's dad's age will indeed be 24 when Emil is 24.

Next, Emil's age at that time will be twice his brother's age:
\[ 24 = 2 \times \text{Brother's age} \]
\[ \text{Brother's age} = \frac{24}{2} = 12 \]

Now, we need to find the current ages of Emil's dad and brother:
- Emil's dad is currently:
\[ 24 - 5 = 19 \]
- Emil's brother is currently:
\[ 12 - 5 = 7 \]

Finally, the sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother is:

"First, let's convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches to match the units of the flower width. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the flower bed is:
\[ 111 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 1332 \text{ inches} \]

Each flower is 12 inches wide, and there needs to be 1.5 feet (which is 18 inches) between every plant. Therefore, the total space taken by one plant and the space between it and the next plant is:
\[ 12 \text{ inches} + 18 \text{ inches} = 30 \text{ inches} \]

To find out how many plants can fit in the flower bed, we divide the total length of the flower bed by the space taken by one plant and the space between it and the next plant:
\[ \frac{1332 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/plant}} = 44.4 \text{ plants} \]

Since Pat cannot plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number, which means she can plant 44 plants. Pat already owns 17 plants, so the number of additional plants she needs to buy is:
\[ 44 - 17 = 27 \text{ plants} \]

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional plants is:

"First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, the time required to peel 90 shrimp is:

\[ \text{Time to peel} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to saute 30 shrimp. Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, the time required to saute 90 shrimp (which is three times 30 shrimp) is:

\[ \text{Time to saute} = 3 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Since the tasks of peeling and sauteing are independent, the total time required to peel and saute 90 shrimp is the sum of the time taken for each task:

\[ \text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

   - Cooling rate: 2 degrees per hour
   - Time: 3 hours
   - Total cooling: \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ degrees}\)

2. **High setting for 4 hours:**
   - Cooling rate: 3 degrees per hour
   - Time: 4 hours
   - Total cooling: \(3 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ degrees}\)

3. **No air conditioner for 2 hours:**
   - Temperature increase: 2 degrees per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Total increase: \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ degrees}\)

Now, let's sum up the total cooling and the total increase in temperature:

"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to break down the information given and calculate each category of checks.

1. **Electric Bill**: Buford writes a check once per month for the electric bill. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes 12 electric bill checks per year.
2. **Gas Bill**: Buford writes a check once per month for the gas bill. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes 12 gas bill checks per year.
3. **Church**: Buford writes a check twice per month to the church. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes \(2 \times 12 = 24\) church checks per year.
4. **Pest and Lawn Service**: Buford writes a check quarterly (every 3 months) to the pest and lawn service. There are 4 quarters in a year, so he writes 4 pest and lawn service checks per year.

Now, we sum up all the checks:
- Electric bill checks: 12
- Gas bill checks: 12
- Church checks: 24
- Pest and lawn service checks: 4

Total number of checks per year:
\[ 12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 52 \]"
"Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as \( F \). According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4}F \). The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany, so the number of flights to France is \( \frac{1}{4}F \) and the number of flights to Germany is also \( \frac{1}{4}F \).

The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, which is half the number of flights the first plane makes in a day. Therefore, we can write:
\[ \frac{1}{2}F = 44 \]
Solving for \( F \), we get:
\[ F = 44 \times 2 = 88 \]

Now, we need to find the number of flights to France made by the first plane. Since the first plane makes 88 flights in a day and \( \frac{1}{4} \) of these flights are to France, the number of flights to France is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 88 = 22 \]

Thus, the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"First, let's determine the duration of each wolf's howl.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so:
\[ \text{Chikote's howl duration} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Igneous howls for as long as Tobias and Chikote combined, so:
\[ \text{Igneous's howl duration} = 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, let's find the combined duration of all three wolves' howls in seconds:
\[ \text{Combined duration} = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 \text{ seconds} \]

To convert the combined duration from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):
\[ \text{Combined duration in minutes} = \frac{120}{60} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Adam's parents gave him. Adam's mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much, which is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) dollars.

So, the total amount of money given by his parents is \(6 + 12 = 18\) dollars.

Adam spent $30 on trousers. To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount given by his parents from the cost of the trousers.

Therefore, the amount Adam had to contribute from his savings is \(30 - 18 = 12\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
12"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the age of Wilfred. Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \(A\), \(B\), \(H\), and \(W\) respectively. We know the following:

1. \(A = 3\)
2. \(B = 4\)
3. The total age of the children is 20, so \(A + B + H + W = 20\).
4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is \(\frac{20}{4} = 5\). Therefore, \(H = 2 \times 5 = 10\).

Now we can substitute the known values into the total age equation:
\[3 + 4 + 10 + W = 20\]
\[17 + W = 20\]
\[W = 20 - 17\]
\[W = 3\]

So, the age of Wilfred is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Walter has collected from his neighbors and the online fund:
- From neighbors: $500
- From online fund: $1500

Total collected so far: $500 + $1500 = $2000

Next, we need to determine how much Walter's friend will contribute. The friend is going to give Walter $200.

Now, let's calculate the total amount collected after the friend's contribution:
- Total collected so far: $2000
- Contribution from friend: $200

Total amount collected: $2000 + $200 = $2200

The lawyer will donate three times as much as everyone else donates. To find out how much the lawyer will donate, we need to determine how much everyone else has donated. Since everyone else has donated a total of $2200, the lawyer will donate three times this amount:
- Amount donated by everyone else: $2200
- Amount donated by lawyer: 3 * $2200 = $6600

Therefore, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6600."
"First, we need to calculate the total number of cookies. Since there were 100 guests and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies/guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies} \]

The bride decided to give half of the cookies to the church next door. Therefore, the number of cookies given to the church next door is:

\[ \frac{1500 \text{ cookies}}{2} = 750 \text{ cookies} \]

Each person in the church next door got 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church next door, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people} \]

So, the number of people in the church next door is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the distribution of the watermelon slices among the family members. Let's denote the total volume of the watermelon as \( V \).

Given that there are 2 adults and 4 kids, and each adult's slice is twice as big as each kid's slice, we can represent the volume of each adult's slice as \( 2x \) and the volume of each kid's slice as \( x \).

The total volume of the watermelon is the sum of the volumes of all slices:
\[ 2(2x) + 4(x) = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

Since the total volume of the watermelon is \( V \), we have:
\[ 8x = V \]

Each adult's slice is \( 2x \), so the total volume of the slices for the adults is:
\[ 2(2x) = 4x \]

To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we calculate:
\[ \frac{4x}{V} \times 100\% \]

Since \( 8x = V \), we can substitute \( V \) with \( 8x \):
\[ \frac{4x}{8x} \times 100\% = \frac{1}{2} \times 100\% = 50\% \]

Thus, each adult gets 50% of the watermelon. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 50 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones will spend on inpatient rounds. He has 9 inpatients, and each round takes 20 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent on inpatient rounds is:
\[ 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes per inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time he will spend on appointments. He has 10 appointments, and each appointment takes 30 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent on appointments is:
\[ 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes per appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's add the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments to find the total time spent on these activities:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 480 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Doctor Jones is spending 9 hours at the clinic, we need to convert this time into minutes to make the addition easier:
\[ 9 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 540 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments from the total time spent at the clinic to find out how many minutes Doctor Jones will have left to update his records:
\[ 540 \text{ minutes} - 480 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we convert the remaining minutes back into hours:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, the number of hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to complete all the steps involved in making the cake.

1. Making the cake batter: 20 minutes
2. Baking the cake: 30 minutes
3. Cooling the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
4. Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

Adding these times together:
\[ 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Since 180 minutes is equivalent to 3 hours, Jordan needs 3 hours to complete the cake from start to finish.

If the cake needs to be ready by 5:00 pm, we subtract the 3 hours from 5:00 pm:
\[ 5:00 \text{ pm} - 3 \text{ hours} = 2:00 \text{ pm} \]

Therefore, the latest time of day that Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

The final numerical answer is:

- Fixed cost per session: $25
- Variable cost per student per session: $1.50
- Number of students: 10
- Total variable cost per session: $1.50 * 10 = $15
- Total cost per session: $25 + $15 = $40

Next, we need to determine the number of sessions in a month. Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks:
- Sessions per week: 3
- Weeks in a month: 4
- Total sessions in a month: 3 * 4 = 12

Now, we can calculate the total earnings for the month:
- Total cost per session: $40
- Total sessions in a month: 12
- Total earnings in a month: $40 * 12 = $480

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"To find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we first need to determine the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes.

For Peter:
- He has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars.
- Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes is \( \frac{64}{4} = 16 \).

For Martha:
- She has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars.
- Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes is \( \frac{56}{7} = 8 \).

Now, to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha:
- The difference is \( 16 - 8 = 8 \).

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of female porcupines in the park. Given that the total population of porcupines is 50 and the number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population, we can calculate the number of female porcupines as follows:

\[ \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the number of babies born each month is:

\[ \text{Number of babies born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120 \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[ \text{Total number of babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440 \]

The initial population of porcupines is 50. After a year, the total number of porcupines in the park will be the initial population plus the total number of babies born in a year:

\[ \text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1490 \]"
"To determine the cost to fill the swimming pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet.
2. Multiply the volume by 5.9 to convert it to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost based on the number of gallons and the cost per gallon.

First, let's calculate the volume of the pool. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:
\[ V = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions:
- Width = 14 feet
- Length = 25 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

Substituting these values into the formula:
\[ V = 14 \times 25 \times 4 \]

Now, let's perform the multiplication:
\[ V = 14 \times 25 = 350 \]
\[ V = 350 \times 4 = 1400 \]

So, the volume of the pool is 1400 cubic feet.

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. We know that 1 cubic foot is approximately 7.48 gallons. Therefore, the volume in gallons \( G \) is:
\[ G = V \times 7.48 \]

Substituting the volume in cubic feet:
\[ G = 1400 \times 7.48 \]

Now, let's perform the multiplication:
\[ G = 1400 \times 7.48 = 10472 \]

So, the pool needs 10472 gallons of water.

Finally, we calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost per gallon is $0.10. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:
\[ C = G \times 0.10 \]

Substituting the volume in gallons:
\[ C = 10472 \times 0.10 \]

Now, let's perform the multiplication:
\[ C = 10472 \times 0.10 = 1047.2 \]

Thus, the cost to fill the pool is $1047.20.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{1047.20} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of blue sticks. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, and there are 9 red sticks, we can calculate the number of blue sticks as follows:

Number of blue sticks = Number of red sticks + 5
Number of blue sticks = 9 + 5
Number of blue sticks = 14

Next, we need to find the number of yellow sticks. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks:

Number of yellow sticks = Number of blue sticks - 3
Number of yellow sticks = 14 - 3
Number of yellow sticks = 11

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together:

Total number of sticks = Number of red sticks + Number of blue sticks + Number of yellow sticks
Total number of sticks = 9 + 14 + 11
Total number of sticks = 34

So, the total number of sticks they have is 34."
"First, we calculate the distance Matteo traveled. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Matteo:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 55 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance Shandy traveled:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} = 45 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the distance Matteo traveled from the distance Shandy traveled:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 230 \]"

2. **Students over 16 years old**: Half of the total students.
   \[
   \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
   \]

3. **Students under 16 years old**: The other half of the total students.
   \[
   \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
   \]

4. **Male students over 16 years old**: One-fourth of the students over 16 years old.
   \[
   \frac{1500}{4} = 375
   \]

5. **Female students over 16 years old**: The remaining three-fourths of the students over 16 years old.
   \[
   1500 - 375 = 1125
   \]

6. **Male students under 16 years old**: One-half of the students under 16 years old.
   \[
   \frac{1500}{2} = 750
   \]

7. **Female students under 16 years old**: The remaining half of the students under 16 years old.
   \[
   1500 - 750 = 750
   \]

8. **Total female students**: Sum of female students over 16 years old and under 16 years old.
   \[
   1125 + 750 = 1875
   \]

Thus, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is 1875."
"First, let's determine how many laps each person can run:

- Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
- Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps.
- Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) laps.
- Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps.

Now, to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run:

\[10 - 5 = 5\]

So, Bethany can run 5 more laps than Quinn. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days and then subtract this from the tank's total capacity.

First, let's determine the amount of water Wanda pumped on the first day:
- Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity on the first day.
- The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons.
- Therefore, Wanda pumped \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons on the first day.

Next, we calculate the amount of water Ms. B pumped on the first day:
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda.
- Therefore, Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons on the first day.

Now, let's determine the amount of water Wanda pumped on the second day:
- Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
- Therefore, Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons on the second day.

Next, we calculate the amount of water Ms. B pumped on the second day:
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
- Therefore, Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons on the second day.

Now, we sum up the total amount of water pumped into the tank over the two days:
- Total water pumped by Wanda: \( 4500 + 3000 = 7500 \) gallons.
- Total water pumped by Ms. B: \( 3375 + 1125 = 4500 \) gallons.
- Total water pumped into the tank: \( 7500 + 4500 = 12000 \) gallons.

Finally, we determine the remaining amount of water needed to fill the tank:
- The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons.
- The amount of water already pumped into the tank is 12000 gallons.
- Therefore, the remaining amount of water needed is \( 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \) gallons.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{6000}

"Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as \( C \).

First, we know that the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour for 5 hours. This means that after 5 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ C \times (1 - 0.09)^5 = C \times 0.91^5 \]

Calculating \( 0.91^5 \):
\[ 0.91^5 \approx 0.6055 \]
So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is approximately:
\[ C \times 0.6055 \]

Next, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour for 3 hours. This means that after another 3 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ C \times 0.6055 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = C \times 0.6055 \times 0.93^3 \]

Calculating \( 0.93^3 \):
\[ 0.93^3 \approx 0.8174 \]
So, after 3 more hours, the charge remaining is approximately:
\[ C \times 0.6055 \times 0.8174 \approx C \times 0.4947 \]

We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%, or 0.28. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ C \times 0.4947 = 0.28 \]

Solving for \( C \):
\[ C = \frac{0.28}{0.4947} \approx 0.566 \]

So, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately \( 0.566 \) or 56.6%."
"First, let's calculate Janet's total weekly earnings. She earns $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, so her total weekly earnings are:

\[ 10 + 15 = 25 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are:

\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ dollars per week} \]

Next, we need to determine how much she needs to save to buy the car. The down payment for the car is $10,000. She wants to save 20% of this amount:

\[ 10000 \times 0.20 = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to save $2000 at a rate of $1000 per week. We do this by dividing the total amount she needs to save by her weekly savings:

\[ \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

So, the number of weeks Janet will need to work to save the down payment is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased:

- Peaches: 3 peaches * $0.50/peach = $1.50
- Pears: 4 pears * $0.50/pear = $2.00
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00/kiwi = $2.00
- Apples: 5 apples * $0.75/apple = $3.75

Now, let's add up the cost of these fruits:

Total cost so far = $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar has $10 to spend, so the remaining amount he can spend on plums is:

Remaining amount = $10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums he can buy is:

Number of plums = $0.75 / $0.25/plum = 3 plums

So, the final numerical answer is 3."
"First, we need to determine the total number of pieces of sweets Anne purchased. Since she bought a box containing 15 packs and each pack has 60 pieces, we calculate the total number of pieces as follows:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs Anne gave to her friends. Since she kept 2 packs, the number of packs she gave away is:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} - 2 \text{ packs} = 13 \text{ packs} \]

These 13 packs are given to her 10 friends equally. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide the number of packs given away by the number of friends:

\[ \frac{13 \text{ packs}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 1.3 \text{ packs per friend} \]

Since each pack contains 60 pieces, the number of pieces each friend received is:

\[ 1.3 \text{ packs per friend} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 78 \text{ pieces per friend} \]

Thus, the number of pieces of sweets each of her friends received is:

\[ \boxed{78} \]"
"To calculate the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating compounded price increases:

\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (1 + \text{Rate})^{\text{Number of Years}} \]

Given:
- Initial Price = $120
- Rate = 5% = 0.05
- Number of Years = 3

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 139 \]

So, the price of carrots after three years would be $139."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many selfies and portraits Olivia uploaded to her albums. We know that she uploaded a total of 72 pictures into 8 albums, with 3 albums dedicated to selfies and 2 albums to portraits.

First, let's find out how many pictures were placed in each album. Since the total number of pictures is 72 and they are distributed equally among 8 albums, we can calculate the number of pictures per album as follows:

\[ \text{Number of pictures per album} = \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Now, we know that 3 albums are for selfies and 2 albums are for portraits. Since each album contains 9 pictures, the number of selfies is:

\[ \text{Number of selfies} = 3 \times 9 = 27 \]

And the number of portraits is:

\[ \text{Number of portraits} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

To find the total number of portraits and selfies, we add the number of selfies and portraits together:

\[ \text{Total number of selfies and portraits} = 27 + 18 = 45 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how long James spends reading, we first need to find out how many minutes it takes him to read one page. Since it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can calculate the time it takes to read one page by dividing 10 minutes by 3 pages:

\[ \text{Time per page} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} \approx 3.33 \text{ minutes per page} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages. We do this by multiplying the time it takes to read one page by 18:

\[ \text{Time to read 18 pages} = 18 \text{ pages} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, James spends 60 minutes reading. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.
2. 24 guests checked out early, reducing the number of guests by 24.
3. 15 guests checked out late, reducing the number of guests by 15.
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, twice this number is \(2 \times 15 = 30\). So, 30 new guests checked in.
5. After dinner, 7 more guests checked in.

Now, let's calculate the number of guests step by step:

- Initial guests: 100
- After early checkouts: \(100 - 24 = 76\)
- After late checkouts: \(76 - 15 = 61\)
- After new guests checked in: \(61 + 30 = 91\)
- After additional guests checked in: \(91 + 7 = 98\)

Therefore, the final number of guests in the hotel is 98."
"To find out how many bananas John has, we need to add up the bananas he picked on each day.

On Wednesday, John picks 4 bananas.
On Thursday, John picks 6 bananas.
On Friday, John picks triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) bananas.

Now, we add the bananas picked on each day:
\[4 + 6 + 12 = 22\]

So, the total number of bananas John has is 22."
"First, let's determine the number of easy, average, and difficult questions in the quiz.

- Total number of questions: 60
- Percentage of easy questions: 40%
- Number of easy questions: \( 60 \times 0.40 = 24 \)

The rest of the questions are equally divided into average and difficult questions:
- Number of average questions: \( \frac{60 - 24}{2} = \frac{36}{2} = 18 \)

"First, let's determine the price of a large stuffed animal. Since each small stuffed animal costs $4 and large stuffed animals cost three times as much, the price of a large stuffed animal is:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( L \). According to the problem, the number of small stuffed animals sold is twice the number of large stuffed animals sold, so the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2L \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as the sum of the earnings from the large stuffed animals and the small stuffed animals. The earnings from the large stuffed animals are \( 12L \) dollars, and the earnings from the small stuffed animals are \( 4 \times 2L = 8L \) dollars. The total earnings are given as $120, so we can set up the following equation:
\[ 12L + 8L = 120 \]
\[ 20L = 120 \]
\[ L = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

Since the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2L \), we have:
\[ 2L = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine the total number of sandwiches eaten by the family in one week, we first calculate the daily total and then multiply by the number of days in a week.

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, the wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and the son eats 2 sandwiches per day. Therefore, the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by the family is:
\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \text{ sandwiches per day} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of sandwiches eaten in one week is:
\[ 11 \times 7 = 77 \text{ sandwiches} \]

"First, let's calculate Suzanne's earnings from selling cookies and cupcakes.

Earnings from cookies = Number of cookies sold × Price per cookie
Earnings from cookies = 80 × $1
Earnings from cookies = $80

Earnings from cupcakes = Number of cupcakes sold × Price per cupcake
Earnings from cupcakes = 60 × $4
Earnings from cupcakes = $240

Total earnings = Earnings from cookies + Earnings from cupcakes
Total earnings = $80 + $240
Total earnings = $320

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave away a total of:
Total given away = $10 × 2
Total given away = $20

Money left = Total earnings - Total given away
Money left = $320 - $20
Money left = $300

The final numerical answer is $300."
"The Smith twins found a total of 30 + 30 = 60 eggs. Since all the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends, the number of eggs found by the friends is 100 - 60 - 10 = 30 eggs. 

The final numerical answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the daily ore mining capacity of a dwarf with a steel pickaxe and then scale it up to 40 dwarves working for 30 days.

1. A dwarf with a bare hands can mine 12 pounds of ore per day.
2. A dwarf with an iron pickaxe can mine twice as much as a bare hands dwarf, which is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) pounds per day.
3. A dwarf with a steel pickaxe can mine 50% more than a dwarf with an iron pickaxe. Therefore, the daily mining capacity of a dwarf with a steel pickaxe is \(24 + (24 \times 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36\) pounds per day.

Now, we need to calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in 30 days.

The total ore mined by one dwarf with a steel pickaxe in 30 days is:
\[36 \text{ pounds/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 1080 \text{ pounds}.\]

Therefore, the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in 30 days is:
\[1080 \text{ pounds/dwarf} \times 40 \text{ dwarves} = 43200 \text{ pounds}.\]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to use the information that the prices are proportional. Let's denote the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches as \( x \).

First, we calculate the cost per sandwich for each package:
- For the first package with 2 sandwiches for $3, the cost per sandwich is:
  \[
  \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
  \]
- For the second package with 4 sandwiches for $6, the cost per sandwich is:
  \[
  \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
  \]

Since the prices are proportional, the cost per sandwich for the third package (8 sandwiches) should also be $1.5. Therefore, we can find the cost of the third package by multiplying the cost per sandwich by the number of sandwiches:
\[
1.5 \times 8 = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost \(\boxed{12}\) dollars."
"First, we need to determine the net cost of the new bedroom set after Tom sells his old one. Tom sells his old bedroom for $1000 and uses this amount to pay part of the new bedroom set. Therefore, the net cost of the new bedroom set is:

\[ 3000 - 1000 = 2000 \]

Next, Tom has to pay 10% of this net cost per month. To find out how much he has to pay per month, we calculate 10% of $2000:

\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the amount Tom has to pay per month is:

\[
\boxed{200}

"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst due to the gust of wind. Sally initially had 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst.

\[ 40\% \text{ of } 25 = 0.40 \times 25 = 10 \text{ red balloons burst} \]

So, the number of red balloons remaining is:

\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \text{ red balloons} \]

Next, Sally accidentally released half of the yellow balloons. She initially had 12 yellow balloons.

\[ \frac{1}{2} \text{ of } 12 = 6 \text{ yellow balloons released} \]

So, the number of yellow balloons remaining is:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \text{ yellow balloons} \]

Sally found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch of balloons.

\[ 75\% \text{ of } 8 = 0.75 \times 8 = 6 \text{ blue balloons added} \]

So, the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school is the sum of the remaining red, yellow, and the added blue balloons:

\[ 15 \text{ (red)} + 6 \text{ (yellow)} + 6 \text{ (blue)} = 27 \text{ balloons} \]

"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of the different scenarios and their outcomes.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of the substitute teacher collecting the homework: 50% or 0.50
   - Therefore, the probability of the substitute teacher not collecting the homework: 50% or 0.50

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having the normal teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension: 40% or 0.40
   - Therefore, the probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension: 60% or 0.60
   - If the normal teacher does not give an extension, Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment with a 20% chance or 0.20
   - Therefore, the probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension and Marcus not getting an extension: 60% or 0.60 * 0.80 = 0.48
   - The probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension and Marcus getting an extension: 60% or 0.60 * 0.20 = 0.12

Now, we sum up the probabilities of all scenarios where Marcus will have to turn in his homework:
- Substitute teacher not collecting: 50% or 0.50
- Normal teacher not giving an extension and Marcus not getting an extension: 48% or 0.48
- Normal teacher not giving an extension and Marcus getting an extension: 12% or 0.12

Total probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework:
\[ 0.50 + 0.48 + 0.12 = 1.10 \]

Since probabilities cannot exceed 100%, we need to re-evaluate the calculation. The correct approach is to consider the complementary probability (i.e., the probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework) and subtract it from 100%.

The probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework is:
\[ 0.50 + 0.48 = 0.98 \]

Therefore, the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is:
\[ 1 - 0.98 = 0.02 \]

Converting this to a percentage:
\[ 0.02 \times 100 = 2\% \]

Thus, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:
\[ \boxed{2\%} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of seats that are not occupied by graduates and faculty. The total capacity of the Fine Arts Center is 6000 seats. After accounting for the 950 seats for graduates and the 300 seats for faculty, the number of seats available for distribution to graduates' friends and family is calculated as follows:

\[ 6000 - 950 - 300 = 5750 \]

Next, we need to find out how many tickets each graduate will receive if the 5750 seats are split equally among the 950 graduates. We do this by dividing the number of available seats by the number of graduates:

\[ \frac{5750}{950} = 6.052631578947368 \]

Since the number of tickets must be a whole number, we round 6.052631578947368 to the nearest whole number, which is 6. Therefore, each graduate will receive 6 tickets to give to their friends and family.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we first need to calculate the number of soda bottles he will place along the driveway.

The width of the driveway is 24 feet, and he wants to place a bottle every 3 feet. Therefore, the number of bottles is calculated as follows:
\[
\frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet per bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles}
\]

Richard will need to go from one bottle to the next to drop the candy in. Since he starts at the first bottle and goes to the next 7 times, the total number of trips he will make is:
\[
8 - 1 = 7 \text{ trips}
\]

Each trip takes 5 seconds, so the total time for all trips is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the Parmesan cheese:
- The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound.
- Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese.
- Therefore, the cost for the Parmesan cheese is \( 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$11/\text{pound} = \$22 \).

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mozzarella cheese:
- The price of mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound.
- Amor buys 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese.
- Therefore, the cost for the mozzarella cheese is \( 3 \text{ pounds} \times \$6/\text{pound} = \$18 \).

Now, let's find the total cost of the cheese Amor bought:
- The total cost is the sum of the cost of Parmesan cheese and the cost of mozzarella cheese.
- Total cost = \$22 + \$18 = \$40.

Amor starts with $50. To find out how much money she has left after buying the cheese, we subtract the total cost from her initial amount:
- Money left = \$50 - \$40 = \$10.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Jim borrowed and the total income he would have earned if he had not gone to college.

First, let's calculate the total amount of loans Jim took out:
- Jim took out $50,000 per year for 4 years.
- Total loan amount = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000.

Next, let's calculate the total income Jim would have earned if he had not gone to college:
- Before college, Jim had a $25,000 annual income.
- If he had not gone to college, he would have earned $25,000 per year for 4 years.
- Total income if he had not gone to college = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000.

Now, let's calculate the total income Jim would have earned during his college years:
- During college, Jim's income is tripled, so he earns $75,000 per year.
- Total income during college = $75,000 * 4 = $300,000.

Now, let's calculate the total income Jim would have earned if he had not gone to college minus the income he earned during college:
- Income lost = Total income if he had not gone to college - Total income during college.
- Income lost = $100,000 - $300,000 = -$200,000.

Since the income lost is negative, it means Jim actually gained $200,000 in terms of income by going to college. Now, we need to calculate how long it would take for Jim to earn back the $200,000 in loans and the $200,000 in income he lost.

The total amount Jim needs to earn back is:
- Total amount to earn back = $200,000 (loan amount) + $200,000 (income lost) = $400,000.

If Jim earns $75,000 per year during college, we need to find out how many years it will take to earn $400,000:
- Number of years = Total amount to earn back / Annual income during college.
- Number of years = $400,000 / $75,000 = 5.3333.

Since Jim cannot work a fraction of a year, we round up to the next whole number:
- Number of years = 6.

Therefore, it would take Jim 6 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the income lost from not working while in school.

The final numerical answer is 6."
"To determine the total square feet of fabric Jim needs, we first calculate the dimensions of each piece of fabric he requires. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each piece of fabric is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

First, calculate the dimensions of one piece of fabric:
- Length: \( 6 + 2 = 8 \) feet
- Width: \( 8 + 2 = 10 \) feet

Next, calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
\[
\text{Area of one piece} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 8 \times 10 = 80 \text{ square feet}
\]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[
\text{Total area} = 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ square feet}
\]

Thus, the total square feet of fabric Jim needs to buy is:
\[
\boxed{160}

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered on each day and then sum them up.

First, let's determine the number of letters delivered on Tuesday. According to the problem, Tuesday's delivery is 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery. Monday's delivery was 425 letters.

One-fifth of Monday's delivery is:
\[ \frac{425}{5} = 85 \]

So, Tuesday's delivery is:
\[ 85 + 17 = 102 \]

Next, we calculate the number of letters delivered on Wednesday. Wednesday's delivery is 5 more than twice Tuesday's delivery.

Twice Tuesday's delivery is:
\[ 2 \times 102 = 204 \]

So, Wednesday's delivery is:
\[ 204 + 5 = 209 \]

Now, we sum the deliveries from Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday:
\[ 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 \]

Therefore, the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is:
\[ \boxed{736} \]"

"To find out how much Johnny's dad lost on average that day, we need to calculate the total amount lost and then divide by the number of races.

1. **First Race:**
   - Johnny's dad lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost.
   - Amount lost in the first race = $5.
   - Twice the amount lost = $5 * 2 = $10.
   - Amount won in the second race = $10 + $1 = $11.
   - Since he won, this is a positive amount, but for the purpose of calculating loss, we consider the negative of this amount.
   - Amount lost in the second race = -$11.

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Amount won in the second race = $11.
   - 1.5 times the amount won = 1.5 * $11 = $16.5.
   - Amount lost in the third race = $16.5.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost:
- Total amount lost = Amount lost in the first race + Amount lost in the second race + Amount lost in the third race.
- Total amount lost = $5 + (-$11) + $16.5 = $5 - $11 + $16.5 = $10.5.

To find the average amount lost per race, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races:
- Number of races = 3.
- Average amount lost per race = Total amount lost / Number of races = $10.5 / 3 = $3.5.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to convert all measurements to the same unit for easier comparison. Let's use inches.

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, Xavier's height in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Xavier grew 3 inches, so his current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole's initial height was 50 inches. Cole grew 2 inches, so his current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:

"Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( 420 \).

"To determine the number of hours each painter worked, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of days the painters worked:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - The painters worked for 3 weeks.
   - Therefore, the total number of days worked is \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \) days.

2. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by the team:**
   - Each day, the team worked \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day.
   - Therefore, the total number of hours worked by the team is \( 21 \times \frac{3}{8} \).

3. **Perform the multiplication:**
   \[
   21 \times \frac{3}{8} = \frac{21 \times 3}{8} = \frac{63}{8} = 7.875 \text{ hours}

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, Rory retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2}) = 2 \cdot 19 \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now that we know \( x = 6 \), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation year by year from 2007 to 2010.

The formula for depreciation is:
\[ P = P_0 \times (1 - r)^t \]
where:
- \( P \) is the price after \( t \) years,
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price,
- \( r \) is the annual depreciation rate,
- \( t \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 20000 \) dollars,
- \( r = 0.21 \),
- \( t = 2010 - 2007 = 3 \) years.

Substituting the values into the formula:
\[ P = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ P = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]
\[ P = 20000 \times 0.493039 \]
\[ P = 9860.78 \]

Therefore, the price of the car in the year 2010 is approximately $9860.78."
"First, let's determine the number of English books. Since half of the 50 books are written in English, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of English books} = \frac{50}{2} = 25
\]

Next, we calculate the number of German books. Since 10% of the books are written in German, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of German books} = 10\% \times 50 = 0.10 \times 50 = 5
\]

Now, to find the number of Spanish books, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:

\[
\text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - \text{Number of English books} - \text{Number of German books} = 50 - 25 - 5 = 20
\]

Thus, the number of Spanish books is:

\[
\boxed{20}

"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we first need to determine how far she has already traveled. Bernice drove 325 kilometers over 4 days. 

The total distance from San Diego to New York City is approximately 1955 kilometers. To find out how much farther Bernice needs to drive, we subtract the distance she has already traveled from the total distance.

\[ \text{Distance remaining} = \text{Total distance} - \text{Distance already traveled} \]
\[ \text{Distance remaining} = 1955 \text{ km} - 325 \text{ km} \]
\[ \text{Distance remaining} = 1630 \text{ km} \]

So, Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers."
"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we first need to calculate the total number of cups she drinks in 30 days and then convert that into gallons.

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. Therefore, in 30 days, she drinks:
\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Given that there are 16 cups in a gallon, we can convert the total cups into gallons by dividing the total cups by the number of cups per gallon:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ cups}}{16 \text{ cups/gallon}} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 15 \]"
"To find the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we need to follow the sequence of events and update the number of people on the train accordingly.

1. Initially, there are 120 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train:
   \[
   120 + 20 = 140
   \]
3. At the second stop, 50 people disembark and twice that number (which is 100) board the train:
   \[
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190
   \]
4. At the third stop, 80 more people disembark:
   \[
   190 - 80 = 110
   \]

Therefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110."
"First, let's determine the cost of each item Alison bought:

1. Tank top: $10
2. Running shorts: $5 more than the tank top, so $10 + $5 = $15
3. Tennis shoes: Originally $48, but on sale for half price, so $48 / 2 = $24
4. Athletic socks: $8 original price, with a $2 coupon, so $8 - $2 = $6

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:

Tank top: $10
Running shorts: $15
Tennis shoes: $24
Athletic socks: $6

Total cost = $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55

Therefore, Alison spent $55 on athletic gear."
"To determine the cost of renovating the kitchen floor, we first need to calculate how many tiles are required. Since each tile is 1ft by 1ft, the area of each tile is 1 SqFt. Given that the total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt, we need 200 tiles.

Each tile costs $12. Therefore, the total cost is calculated by multiplying the number of tiles by the cost per tile:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = 200 \text{ tiles} \times \$12 \text{ per tile} = \$2400
\]

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{2400}
\]"
"To determine how much James pays for insurance a year after his accident, we first need to calculate the increased monthly cost and then find the annual cost.

The normal monthly cost of the insurance is $120. Since the cost increased by 60% due to the accident, we calculate the increased amount as follows:
\[ \text{Increased cost} = 120 \times \frac{60}{100} = 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

Adding this to the normal monthly cost gives the new monthly cost:
\[ \text{New monthly cost} = 120 + 72 = 192 \]

To find the annual cost, we multiply the new monthly cost by 12 (the number of months in a year):
\[ \text{Annual cost} = 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Thus, the amount James pays a year is:
\[ \boxed{2304} \]"
"To determine how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the number of loads required for the twin beds and the king size bed separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of loads for the twin beds:
- Greg has 4 twin beds.
- Each load can wash 2 twin sets of sheets.
- Therefore, the number of loads needed for the twin beds is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) loads.

Next, let's calculate the number of loads for the king size bed:
- Greg has 1 king size bed.
- Each load can wash 1 king set of sheets.
- Therefore, the number of loads needed for the king size bed is \( \frac{1}{1} = 1 \) load.

Now, we sum the loads for the twin beds and the king size bed:
- Total loads per week = 2 (twin beds) + 1 (king size bed) = 3 loads.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total number of loads in a year is:
- Total loads per year = 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads.

The final numerical answer is:
156"
"To determine the total number of movies Jill and her friends can watch in 4 weeks, we need to first calculate the number of movies they watch in one weekend and then extend that to four weekends.

On Saturday, they watch 4 movies.
On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) movies.

So, in one weekend, they watch \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) movies.

Since they watch movies every weekend, in 4 weeks, they will have 4 weekends. Therefore, the total number of movies they can watch in 4 weeks is \( 4 \times 6 = 24 \).

The final numerical answer is:
24"
"To determine the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection, we need to calculate the number of stickers he collected each year and add them to the number he had two years ago.

1. Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.
2. Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers.
3. This year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year (last year). Since he collected 50 stickers last year, this year he collected \(2 \times 50 = 100\) stickers.

Now, we sum up the stickers from each year:
- Two years ago: 100 stickers
- Last year: 50 stickers
- This year: 100 stickers

Adding these together:
\[ 100 + 50 + 100 = 250 \]

Therefore, the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection is 250."
"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we first need to calculate the total amount of cat food Imma's cats consume per day.

Imma has 3 cats, and each cat is fed 60 grams of cat food twice a day. Therefore, the total amount of cat food consumed per day is:
\[ 3 \text{ cats} \times 60 \text{ grams/cat} \times 2 \text{ feedings/day} = 360 \text{ grams/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:
\[ \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams/day}} = 2 \text{ days} \]

Thus, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days."
"First, let's determine how many slices Jake ate. We know that Becky ate 10 slices and that she ate 3 more slices than Jake. Therefore, Jake ate:

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we know that Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake. Therefore, Silvia ate:

\[ 2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by adding the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:

\[ 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 \text{ slices} \]

So, the total number of slices they ate is:

\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time for the meal is the sum of the times for both parts, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Next, we isolate \( D \) by subtracting 18 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Then, we solve for \( D \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's part as follows:

\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{58} \]"
"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to consider the following:

1. The cost of the cast: $200
2. The cost of the visit: $300/hour for 30 minutes. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the cost is $300 / 2 = $150
3. The cost of the painkillers: $4/pill for 30 pills. So, the cost is $4 * 30 = $120
4. The cost of parking: $6/hour for a minimum of 2 hours. So, the cost is $6 * 2 = $12

Now, we sum these costs:
$200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"First, we need to determine how many emails James does not respond to in a day. Since 20% of the 80 emails do not require any response, we calculate 20% of 80:

\[ 0.20 \times 80 = 16 \]

This means that James does not respond to 16 emails a day. Therefore, the number of emails he does respond to in a day is:

\[ 80 - 16 = 64 \]

Next, we need to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week. We multiply the number of emails he responds to in a day by 5:

\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 320 \]"
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to calculate the number of classes for each day and then sum them up.

- On Monday, 32 classes visited.
- On Tuesday, twice as many visited as on Monday, so \(2 \times 32 = 64\) classes.
- On Wednesday, three times as many visited as on Monday, so \(3 \times 32 = 96\) classes.
- On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
- On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, we sum the number of classes for each day:
\[ 32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 \]

Let's add these step by step:
\[ 32 + 64 = 96 \]
\[ 96 + 96 = 192 \]
\[ 192 + 30 = 222 \]
\[ 222 + 25 = 247 \]

So, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is:

John's scores are: 100, 100, 100, and 80.

First, we sum these scores:
\[ 100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380 \]

Next, we divide the total sum by the number of tests, which is 4:
\[ \frac{380}{4} = 95 \]

So, John's average score across the 4 tests is 95."
"First, let's calculate how many pizzas the glee club ate. They ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them:

\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \text{ pizzas} \]

So, the glee club has:

\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \text{ pizzas left} \]

Next, let's calculate how many pizzas the football team ordered. They ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ pizzas} \]

The football team ate 80% of their pizzas:

\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \text{ pizzas} \]

So, the football team has:

\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \text{ pizzas left} \]

Now, let's find the total number of pizzas left by adding the pizzas left from both the glee club and the football team:

\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \text{ pizzas left} \]

"First, let's determine the number of big coupons Anthony wants to send out. Since he wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, and he plans to send out 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is:

\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, and he is sending out 700 small coupons:

\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, and he is sending out 1400 big coupons:

\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of mailing all the coupons, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the cost of mailing the big coupons:

\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:

\[ 24500 \text{ cents} = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:

\[ \boxed{245} \]"
"First, let's determine how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney ordered. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which means she ordered \(10 - 3 = 7\) meatball sub sandwiches.

Next, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. This leaves Sidney with \(7 - 4 = 3\) meatball sub sandwiches.

Then, Sidney ordered another three meatball sub sandwiches. So, the total number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney has now is \(3 + 3 = 6\).

Since each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is \(6 \times 4 = 24\).

"Initially, Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks, each carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. Therefore, the total amount of fertiliser dispatched was:

\[ 20 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 400 \text{ tons} \]

Two hours after departure, a quarter of the trucks experienced mechanical failures. The number of trucks that failed is:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks} \]

This means that the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks} \]

The total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:

\[ 15 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 300 \text{ tons} \]

"To determine the cost Dennis will incur for purchasing 6 pounds of butter under the given promotion, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of butter needed:**
   Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
   \[
   \text{Total butter needed} = 6 \text{ dozen} \times 1 \text{ pound per dozen} = 6 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Understand the promotion:**
   The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter get one half off."" This means for every 2 pounds of butter purchased, Dennis only pays for 1 pound.

3. **Determine the number of sets of 2 pounds needed:**
   Since Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter, we divide by 2 to find the number of sets:
   \[
   \text{Number of sets} = \frac{6 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds per set}} = 3 \text{ sets}
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost for each set:**
   Each set of 2 pounds of butter costs $4.00 (since the first pound is full price and the second pound is half off).

5. **Calculate the total cost for 3 sets:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 3 \text{ sets} \times 4 \text{ dollars per set} = 12 \text{ dollars}

"First, let's calculate the total number of guests invited:

- Kayla invited her 25 classmates.
- She invited 7 girls from her dance class.
- She invited 13 family members.
- Total guests invited = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 guests.

Next, we need to account for the 4 people who could not come:

- Total guests who will attend = 45 - 4 = 41 guests.

Now, we need to calculate the cost based on the given pricing structure:

- The base fee for renting the theater is $125.
- The additional fee is $6 per guest beyond the initial 20 guests.

First, we calculate the additional fee for the guests beyond the initial 20:

- Additional guests = 41 - 20 = 21 guests.
- Additional fee = 21 * $6 = $126.

Finally, we add the base fee and the additional fee to get the total cost:

- Total cost = $125 + $126 = $251.

"Let's denote the amount of money Maggie had as \( M \) and the amount of money Riza had as \( R \). According to the problem, both Maggie and Riza had $60 initially. So, we have:
\[ M = 60 \]
\[ R = 60 \]

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she spent:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \]
So, the amount of money Maggie has left is:
\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \]

Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she spent:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \]
So, the amount of money Riza has left is:
\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \]

The total amount of money that Maggie and Riza have left together is:
\[ 45 + 40 = 85 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats:
\[ 10 + 4 = 14 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Together, the first and second monkeys eat:
\[ 10 + 14 = 24 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Mr. Robles has 315 bananas in total, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. Therefore, the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day is:
\[ \frac{315}{7} = 45 \text{ bananas each day} \]

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we subtract the number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day:
\[ 45 - 24 = 21 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Thus, the third monkey eats:
\[ \boxed{21} \text{ bananas each day} \]"

"First, let's calculate the cost of the roses Jenny bought. Since roses cost $2 each and she bought 15 roses, the total cost is:
\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2/\text{rose} = \$30 \]

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which totals:
\[ 5 \times \$5 = \$25 \]

Since the total cost of the roses is $30 and Jenny only has $25, she needs an additional $5. This means she cannot afford the roses with the money she has and needs to find out how many quarters she would receive as change if she could buy the roses.

If Jenny could buy the roses, the change she would receive would be:
\[ \$30 - \$25 = \$5 \]

Since the florist only gives change in quarters, we need to convert $5 into quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the number of quarters she would receive is:
\[ \frac{\$5}{\$0.25/\text{quarter}} = 20 \text{ quarters} \]

Therefore, the number of quarters Jenny would leave with is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"

"First, let's calculate how many toothpicks Melanie has already saved. She saves 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks:

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie needs a total of 200 toothpicks. She has already saved 120 toothpicks, so she needs:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks, we divide the number of toothpicks she still needs by the number of toothpicks she saves each week:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take her 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 8 \]"
"First, let's determine the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch. The original price of the watch is $2000, and he bought it at 75% of its original price.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers paid} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage discount Mr. Rogers's friend obtained from the original price. The original price was $2000, and he bought it for $1500. The discount amount is:

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 2000 - 1500 = 500 \]

The percentage discount is calculated as follows:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs over a period of 4 hours. Given that each spring creates one jellyfish per second, we can break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.

1. **Determine the number of jellyfish created by one spring in one hour:**
   - There are 60 seconds in one minute and 60 minutes in one hour.
   - Therefore, there are \(60 \times 60 = 3600\) seconds in one hour.
   - Since one spring creates one jellyfish per second, in one hour, one spring will create \(3600\) jellyfish.

2. **Determine the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - Since one spring creates 3600 jellyfish in one hour, in 4 hours, one spring will create \(3600 \times 4 = 14400\) jellyfish.

3. **Determine the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates 14400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create \(14400 \times 5 = 72000\) jellyfish in 4 hours.

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs working at the same rate in 4 hours is \(\boxed{72000}\)."

   - He walked halfway to the store, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) miles.
   - Then he had to walk back home, which is another 2 miles.
   - Therefore, the total distance he walked is \( 2 + 2 = 4 \) miles.

2. **Calculate the time taken to walk the total distance:**
   - James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour.
   - The time taken to walk 4 miles is given by the formula: \( \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \).
   - Substituting the values, we get: \( \text{Time} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \).

So, the total time it took James to reach the store is 1 hour."
"First, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually. Jenny buys 10 bunches, and each bunch has an average of 4 bananas. Therefore, the total number of bananas she buys is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Since each banana costs $0.80, the total cost if she bought the bananas individually would be:

\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Jenny buys 10 bunches, and each bunch costs $3.00, so the total cost is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

Now, to find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we subtract the total cost of buying the bananas in bunches from the total cost of buying them individually:

\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Jenny saved is:

\[
\boxed{2}

"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) and the amount Harry gets as \( H \). According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so we can write:

\[ H = S + 60 \]

Since the total amount of fence is 100 feet, we also have:

\[ S + H = 100 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"To determine how many inches a crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to find the growth rate per year. The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, so the growth rate per year is:

\[
\text{Growth rate per year} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year}
\]

Next, we calculate the growth over 13 years by multiplying the growth rate per year by 13:

\[
\text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
26

"To determine how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply by their respective prices.

First, let's find out how many of each type of bike were sold:
- Total bikes sold = 300
- Trekking bikes sold = 50% of 300 = \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \)
- BMX bikes sold = 15% of 300 = \( 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \)
- MTB bikes sold = Total bikes sold - Trekking bikes sold - BMX bikes sold = \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 65 \)

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike:
- Price of one MTB = $500
- Price of one BMX = \( \frac{500}{2} = $250 \)
- Price of one Trekking bike = $450

Now, we calculate the total earnings:
- Earnings from MTB = \( 65 \times 500 = $32,500 \)
- Earnings from BMX = \( 45 \times 250 = $11,250 \)
- Earnings from Trekking bikes = \( 150 \times 450 = $67,500 \)

Finally, we sum up the earnings from all types of bikes:
- Total earnings = \( 32,500 + 11,250 + 67,500 = $111,250 \)

Thus, Marcel earned \(\boxed{111250}\) dollars from selling bicycles during that month."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net number of bales of hay that are being added to and removed from the field each hour, and then multiply by the number of hours they work.

The farmer makes 5 bales of hay each hour, and the truck picks up 3 bales of hay each hour. Therefore, the net number of bales added to the field each hour is:
\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \text{ bales per hour} \]

Since they work for 6 hours, the total number of bales added to the field is:
\[ 2 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ bales} \]

Thus, the number of bales of hay left in the field after 6 hours is:
\[ 12 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many hours John spends learning each week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of periods John has to attend.
2. Determine the total time spent in class each day.
3. Calculate the total time spent in class each week.
4. Calculate the additional time spent on Saturday and Sunday.
5. Sum up the time spent in class and the additional time to get the total weekly learning time.
6. Convert the total weekly learning time from minutes to hours.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of periods John has to attend.**
John has 6 periods in a day and takes 2 extra classes. Therefore, the total number of periods he has to attend each day is:
\[ 6 + 2 = 8 \text{ periods/day} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total time spent in class each day.**
Each period is 40 minutes long. Therefore, the total time spent in class each day is:
\[ 8 \times 40 = 320 \text{ minutes/day} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total time spent in class each week.**
John goes to class for 5 days a week. Therefore, the total time spent in class each week is:
\[ 320 \times 5 = 1600 \text{ minutes/week} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the additional time spent on Saturday and Sunday.**
John spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. Therefore, the total additional time spent on these days is:
\[ \frac{1}{16} \times 1600 = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

**Step 5: Sum up the time spent in class and the additional time to get the total weekly learning time.**
The total weekly learning time is:
\[ 1600 + 100 = 1700 \text{ minutes} \]

**Step 6: Convert the total weekly learning time from minutes to hours.**
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total weekly learning time in hours is:
\[ \frac{1700}{60} = \frac{1700 \div 20}{60 \div 20} = \frac{85}{3} \approx 28.33 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{85}{3}} \]"
"First, we need to determine the initial height from which Nathan drops the ball. Since the ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony and each story is 24 feet high, the height from which the ball is dropped is:
\[ 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how high the ball bounces on its first bounce. The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height. Therefore, the height after the first bounce is:
\[ 72 \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we need to find out how high the ball bounces on its second bounce. The ball again bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its height after the first bounce. Therefore, the height after the second bounce is:
\[ 48 \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height the ball goes on its second bounce is:
\[ 32 \text{ feet} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 32 \]"
"First, let's convert all heights to inches for easier calculation. The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child is:
\[ 6 \times 12 = 72 \text{ inches} \]

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so:
\[ 72 + 2 = 74 \text{ inches} \]

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so:
\[ 74 - 5 = 69 \text{ inches} \]

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so:
\[ 69 + 3 = 72 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height of the fourth child is:
\[ 72 \text{ inches} \]"
"To determine the earnings from selling 2000 apples at a rate of $5 per bag, we first need to find out how many bags were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can calculate the number of bags sold as follows:

\[ \text{Number of bags sold} = \frac{\text{Total number of apples sold}}{\text{Number of apples per bag}} = \frac{2000}{10} = 200 \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags sold by the price per bag:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of bags sold} \times \text{Price per bag} = 200 \times 5 = 1000 \]

Thus, the orchard earned \(\boxed{1000}\) dollars for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag."
"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of the meat, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms. This means that \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms were left after the velociraptors.
3. The lazy Allosaurus then ate the remaining \( \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, and this amount is given as 270 kilograms. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{x}{4} = 270
   \]
4. To find \( x \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 4:
   \[
   x = 270 \times 4 = 1080
   \]

So, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 kilograms.

\[
\boxed{1080}

"First, we need to calculate the total area of the walls that Tony needs to paint. The north and south walls are each 10 feet by 8 feet, so the area of each is:
\[ 10 \times 8 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is:
\[ 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, the east and west walls are each 5 feet by 8 feet, so the area of each is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is:
\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Adding the areas of all four walls together gives the total area to be painted:
\[ 160 + 80 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Now, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, since each gallon of paint costs $12, the total cost to paint the room is:
\[ 12 \times 12 = 144 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the probabilities step by step.

Initially, Ellen has a case of 12 sodas. She shakes 3 of them, leaving 9 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.

1. Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself. This leaves 8 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.
2. Ellen's brother takes 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas. This leaves 6 unshaken sodas and 2 shaken sodas.

Now, Ellen's friend comes along. There are 6 unshaken sodas and 2 shaken sodas left. The friend can choose any of these 8 sodas. The probability that the friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left.

The probability is:
\[ \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \]

To express this probability as a percentage:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is:
\[ 25\% \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours and then sum these distances since the trains are traveling in opposite directions.

The first train travels at 60 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will travel:
\[ 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \]

The second train travels at half the speed of the first train, which is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]
In 3 hours, it will travel:
\[ 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles} \]

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each train has traveled:
\[ 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 270 \]"
"To determine how many people Billy helps with their taxes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.
2. Determine how many days Billy works.
3. Calculate the total number of hours Billy works.
4. Determine how many people Billy helps in that time.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.**

- March has 31 days.
- April has 19 days.
- Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days.

**Step 2: Determine how many days Billy works.**

Billy takes 20% of the days off, so he works 80% of the days.

\[ \text{Days Billy works} = 50 \times 0.80 = 40 \text{ days} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of hours Billy works.**

Billy works 3 hours a day for 40 days.

\[ \text{Total hours} = 40 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 120 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 4: Determine how many people Billy helps in that time.**

Billy can help 2 people per hour.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we start by noting that 40% of the school population consists of boys, and this percentage is equal to 240 boys. Let's denote the total number of students in the school by \( T \).

Given that 40% of \( T \) is 240 boys, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.40 \times T = 240 \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 600 \]

So, the total number of students in the school is 600. Since 40% of the students are boys, the remaining 60% are girls. To find the number of girls, we calculate 60% of 600:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times 600 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time, we first need to calculate the total number of miles she plans to hike and then the number of miles she plans to hike per day.

Soledad plans to hike 9,300 miles in June. June has 30 days, and she intends to hike twice a day. Therefore, the total number of miles she plans to hike per day is:

\[ \text{Miles per day} = \frac{9300 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 310 \text{ miles/day} \]

Next, we need to determine how many miles she plans to hike each time. She plans to hike 125 miles each time. Since she hikes twice a day, the total miles per day she plans to hike is:

\[ \text{Miles per day planned} = 125 \text{ miles/time} \times 2 \text{ times/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

To find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike, we subtract the planned miles per day from the required miles per day:

\[ \text{Additional miles per day needed} = 310 \text{ miles/day} - 250 \text{ miles/day} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her journey on time. The final numerical answer is:

The temperature in the morning was \(-3\) degrees Celsius."
"First, we start with the initial amount of money Raymond had, which is $21.

He then saved $11 from his allowance. So, we add this to his initial amount:
\[ 21 + 11 = 32 \]

Next, he spent $5 on a comic book. We subtract this amount from his current total:
\[ 32 - 5 = 27 \]

Then, he spent $19 on a puzzle. We subtract this amount from his current total:
\[ 27 - 19 = 8 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Raymond has left is:
\[ 8 \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Anna has spent in total. She started with a budget of $16 and has $2 left after her purchases. Therefore, the total amount spent is:

\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \]

Anna has already spent $4 on other items, so the amount spent on the books is:

\[ 14 - 4 = 10 \]

Anna bought 2 books, and each book cost the same amount. Let's denote the cost of each book by \( x \). Therefore, the total cost for the 2 books is:

\[ 2x = 10 \]

To find the cost of each book, we solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

So, the cost of each book is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To find the number of students enrolled this year after a 20% increase, we first calculate 20% of last year's enrollment and then add that to last year's total.

Last year's enrollment: 50 students

20% of 50 students is calculated as:
\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

Adding this increase to last year's enrollment:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \]

So, the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class is 60."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the rate at which the lighthouse's light blinks. We know that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. Therefore, the rate of blinking is:

\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times. We can use the rate we just calculated to find the time required:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} \]

Now, let's perform the division:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459}{51} = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times."
"First, let's calculate the total number of male and female guppies and goldfishes Tate has after his purchase.

Initially, Tate has:
- 4 male guppies
- 7 female guppies
- 3 male goldfishes
- 5 female goldfishes

After buying more fish, Tate has:
- 4 (initial male guppies) + 2 (additional male guppies) = 6 male guppies
- 7 (initial female guppies) + 1 (additional female guppy) = 8 female guppies
- 3 (initial male goldfishes) + 2 (additional male goldfishes) = 5 male goldfishes
- 5 (initial female goldfishes) + 3 (additional female goldfishes) = 8 female goldfishes

Now, let's calculate the total number of male and female fishes:
- Total male fishes = 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfishes) = 11 male fishes
- Total female fishes = 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfishes) = 16 female fishes

Finally, to find out how many more female fishes than male fishes Tate has, we subtract the total number of male fishes from the total number of female fishes:
- Difference = 16 (female fishes) - 11 (male fishes) = 5

The final numerical answer is:
5"
"First, let's determine the time each person took to complete their chores:

1. Amalia mowed the lawn, which took her 4 hours.
2. Megan walked the dog, which took her 2 hours longer than Amalia. Therefore, Megan's chore took her \(4 + 2 = 6\) hours.
3. Dior did the laundry, which took her well over 4 hours longer than Amalia. Since Amalia's chore took 4 hours, Dior's chore took her at least \(4 + 5 = 9\) hours (assuming ""well over 4 hours"" means more than 5 hours).

Now, we sum the time each person took to complete their chores:
- Amalia: 4 hours
- Megan: 6 hours
- Dior: 9 hours

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is:
\[ 4 + 6 + 9 = 19 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total distance John drives each month when visiting his parents.

First, we calculate the distance for a one-way trip:
- Speed = 70 mph
- Time = 2 hours

Distance for one-way trip = Speed × Time
\[ \text{Distance for one-way trip} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

Since John visits his parents twice a month, the round trip distance is:
\[ \text{Round trip distance} = 140 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the total distance John drives each month when visiting his parents is:
\[ \text{Total monthly distance} = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 280 \]"
"To determine how many miles Brian will walk in seven days, we start by understanding the relationship between the distances walked by Sofie and Brian.

Given:
- Sofie walks 10 miles every day.
- In 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian will in the same period.

First, calculate the total distance Sofie will walk in 7 days:
\[ \text{Sofie's total distance} = 10 \, \text{miles/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 70 \, \text{miles} \]

According to the problem, this distance is twice the distance Brian will walk in 7 days:
\[ \text{Sofie's total distance} = 2 \times \text{Brian's total distance} \]

Let \( B \) represent the total distance Brian will walk in 7 days. Then:
\[ 70 \, \text{miles} = 2B \]

To find \( B \), solve for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{70 \, \text{miles}}{2} = 35 \, \text{miles} \]

Thus, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers and then determine how many toys the fifth worker needs to produce per hour to meet the order requirements.

First, let's calculate the production rate of the first two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 6 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(6 \times 2 = 12\) toys per hour.

Next, let's calculate the production rate of the next two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 4 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(4 \times 2 = 8\) toys per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by all four workers in a 10-hour shift:
- The first two workers produce \(12 \times 10 = 120\) toys.
- The next two workers produce \(8 \times 10 = 80\) toys.
- Therefore, the total number of toys produced by all four workers in 10 hours is \(120 + 80 = 200\) toys.

The toy manufacturer received an order for 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, they still need 20 toys to ship the order. This means that the number of toys produced by the four workers is:
\[ 400 - 20 = 380 \text{ toys} \]

Since the four workers produced 200 toys in 10 hours, the fifth worker must have produced:
\[ 380 - 200 = 180 \text{ toys} \]

To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours in the shift:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys per hour} \]

Thus, the fifth worker produces \(\boxed{18}\) toys per hour."
"First, let's determine the weight of Elijah's dogs based on the information given.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah's dog that is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog weighs:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's dog that is half the weight of Kory's dog weighs:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add the weights of Elijah's dogs to find the total weight of Elijah's dogs:
\[ 15 + 30 = 45 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs to find the combined weight:
\[ 45 + 60 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs altogether is:
\[ 105 \text{ pounds} \]"
"Let's denote the number of stickers Seth had initially as \( S \).

1. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
2. Luis used half of his stickers and gave the rest to Kris. Therefore, Luis gave \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers to Kris.
3. Kris received \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers and kept 9 of them, which means Kris received 16 stickers in total (since \( 9 + 7 = 16 \)). Therefore, \( \frac{S}{4} = 16 \).
4. Solving for \( S \), we get \( S = 16 \times 4 = 64 \).

So, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning.

The final numerical answer is:
64"
"First, we need to determine the total weight of the M&Ms John has. He buys 3 large bags, each weighing 10 ounces. Therefore, the total weight is:

\[ 3 \text{ bags} \times 10 \text{ ounces per bag} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many M&Ms are in the 30 ounces. Since each ounce contains 30 M&Ms, the total number of M&Ms is:

\[ 30 \text{ ounces} \times 30 \text{ M&Ms per ounce} = 900 \text{ M&Ms} \]

John wants to put 10 M&Ms in each small bag. To find out how many small bags he can make, we divide the total number of M&Ms by the number of M&Ms per small bag:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ M&Ms}}{10 \text{ M&Ms per small bag}} = 90 \text{ small bags} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 90 \]"
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we first need to calculate half of the earth's circumference.

Half of the earth's circumference is:
\[ \frac{40,000 \text{ kilometers}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ kilometers} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:
\[ \frac{20,000 \text{ kilometers}}{400 \text{ kilometers/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 50 \]"
"To find the speed of the faster car, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car.
2. Use the speed of the 2nd fastest car to find the speed of the faster car.

First, we know the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. Therefore, the speed of the 2nd fastest car is:
\[ 120 \times 5 = 600 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. Therefore, the speed of the faster car is:
\[ 600 \times 1.25 = 750 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 750 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's first determine Liam's age two years ago. Since Liam is currently 16 years old, two years ago he was:

\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \text{ years old} \]

According to the problem, two years ago Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. Let's denote Vince's age two years ago as \( V - 2 \), where \( V \) is Vince's current age. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 14 = 2(V - 2) \]

Now, let's solve for \( V \):

\[ 14 = 2(V - 2) \]
\[ 14 = 2V - 4 \]
\[ 14 + 4 = 2V \]
\[ 18 = 2V \]
\[ V = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ V = 9 \]

So, Vince is currently 9 years old. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline as \( A \). Since they painted the same number of eggs, we have \( A = A \).

Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Sarah as \( S \). Then, the number of eggs painted by Camden is \( S + 12 \) because Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah.

We know from the problem that the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ A + A + S + (S + 12) = 56 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2A + 2S + 12 = 56 \]
Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get:
\[ 2A + 2S = 44 \]
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
\[ A + S = 22 \]

We also know that Camden and Sarah together painted 30 eggs, so:
\[ S + (S + 12) = 30 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get:
\[ 2S = 18 \]
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, substituting \( S = 9 \) back into the equation \( A + S = 22 \), we get:
\[ A + 9 = 22 \]
Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get:
\[ A = 13 \]

So, Arnold painted 13 eggs, Madeline painted 13 eggs, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

To find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold, we calculate:
\[ 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons. This can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups} \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the total weight of the crayons is:

\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Each box weighs 8 ounces, and since there are 25 groups of crayons, there will be 25 boxes. The total weight of the boxes is:

\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes gives us the combined weight:

\[ \text{Total combined weight} = 200 \text{ ounces} + 200 \text{ ounces} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

To convert the total combined weight from ounces to pounds, we use the conversion factor that 16 ounces equals 1 pound:

\[ \text{Total combined weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 25 \]"
"First, we need to determine how many 4-foot logs John can make from the 80-foot tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, the length of the logs he can make is:

\[ 80 \text{ feet} \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 4-foot logs he can cut from 64 feet of wood:

\[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

Now, we need to determine how many planks John can get from these 16 logs. Since he cuts 5 planks from each log:

\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

Finally, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling these planks. Since each plank is sold for $1.2:

\[ 80 \text{ planks} \times 1.2 \text{ dollars/plank} = 96 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 96 \]"
"First, let's determine how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns half of what her brother earns, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Valerie's salary} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

Given that Valerie earns $5000 per month, we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[ 5000 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

To find the brother's salary, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ \text{Brother's salary} = 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Next, we calculate their mother's salary. The mother earns twice the combined salary of Valerie and her brother. First, we find the combined salary of Valerie and her brother:

\[ \text{Combined salary} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} = 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Now, we calculate the mother's salary:

\[ \text{Mother's salary} = 2 \times \text{Combined salary} = 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \]

Finally, we find the total amount of money they all have together by adding their individual salaries:

\[ \text{Total amount} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} + \text{Mother's salary} = 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

Thus, the total amount of money they all have together is:

\[ \boxed{45000} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk, and then calculate the total time for the entire walk.

First, let's find Grandma's speed on the beach. Since she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes, her speed on the beach is:
\[ \text{Speed on the beach} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = 0.05 \text{ miles per minute} \]

Since she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is:
\[ \text{Speed on the sidewalk} = 2 \times 0.05 \text{ miles per minute} = 0.1 \text{ miles per minute} \]

Next, we calculate the time spent on the sidewalk. Since she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk at a speed of 0.1 miles per minute, the time spent on the sidewalk is:
\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{0.1 \text{ miles per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we know the total time spent on the beach and the sidewalk:
\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes (beach)} + 10 \text{ minutes (sidewalk)} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Since the entire walk is 3 miles and she has already covered 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk, the total time to complete the 3-mile walk is:
\[ \text{Total time} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Jane has saved so far. She has saved $4 each week for 8 weeks, so:

\[ 4 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 8 \, \text{weeks} = 32 \, \text{dollars} \]

Jane's goal is to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she has already saved from her goal:

\[ 60 \, \text{dollars} - 32 \, \text{dollars} = 28 \, \text{dollars} \]

Jane saves $4 each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28, we divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings:

\[ 28 \, \text{dollars} \div 4 \, \text{dollars/week} = 7 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60."

"First, let's determine how many marbles Bob currently has. We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen is equal to 24 marbles, we can set up the following equation to find out how many marbles Bob currently has:

\[ \text{Current number of marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

Subtracting 24 from both sides of the equation gives:

\[ \text{Current number of marbles} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles. If Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, the number of marbles he will have is:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug of water, we need to ensure that after Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle, the resulting mixture can be drunk at a temperature of at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote the temperature of the second mug of water as \( T \) degrees.

First, we calculate the temperature of the mixture after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug:
- The 33-degree mug initially has 4 ounces of water.
- After pouring 4 ounces, the remaining water in the 33-degree mug is \( 4 - 4 = 0 \) ounces.
- The temperature of the remaining water in the 33-degree mug is 0 degrees.
- The 1 ounce of water from the second mug is at temperature \( T \).

The total volume of the mixture is \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) ounces. The temperature of the mixture is given by the weighted average of the temperatures of the water poured:
\[
\text{Temperature of the mixture} = \frac{4 \times 0 + 1 \times T}{5} = \frac{T}{5}
\]

We need this temperature to be at least 40 degrees:
\[
\frac{T}{5} \geq 40
\]

Solving for \( T \):
\[
T \geq 40 \times 5
\]
\[
T \geq 200
\]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the second mug of water must be at least 200 degrees.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of animals added to the farm over the course of three weeks and then add this to the initial number of animals.

First, let's determine the number of days in three weeks:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cows added by Milkie Cows Limited over these 21 days:
\[ 20 \text{ cows/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 420 \text{ cows} \]

Then, we calculate the number of chickens added by Broilers Limited over these 21 days:
\[ 10 \text{ chickens/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ chickens} \]

Now, we add the initial number of animals to the number of animals added:
\[ 50 \text{ cows} + 420 \text{ cows} = 470 \text{ cows} \]
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} + 210 \text{ chickens} = 230 \text{ chickens} \]

Finally, we add the total number of cows and chickens to get the total number of animals on the farm:
\[ 470 \text{ cows} + 230 \text{ chickens} = 700 \text{ animals} \]

Thus, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is:
\[ \boxed{700} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount:

Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs cost:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Since Russell is ordering 4 packs, he will receive a 10% discount on the total cost. The discount amount is:
\[ 40 \times 0.10 = 4 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell will receive. Since each pack contains 9 bagels, 4 packs will contain:
\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \]

To find the cost per bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels:
\[ \frac{36}{36} = 1 \]

So, the cost per bagel is:
\[ 1 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1 \]"
"First, let's determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. According to the question, Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. This can be calculated as:

\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 1 less than 3 is 2 scoops, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. The question states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 1 less than 3 is 2 scoops, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

First, calculate 3 less than 6:

\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \]

So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. This means that for 18 scoops of mashed potatoes, we need to find out how many potatoes are required. Since 18 scoops is 9 times 2 scoops, we need 9 times the number of potatoes required for 2 scoops:

\[ 9 \times 3 = 27 \]

Therefore, the number of potatoes Gomer ate is:

\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days:
- Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days.
- Total eggs in the first 30 days = 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs.

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the next 30 days:
- Chester eats 5 eggs a day for 30 days.
- Total eggs in the next 30 days = 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.

Now, let's find the total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days:
- Total eggs in 60 days = 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.

To find out how many dozens of eggs Chester needs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs):
- Total dozens of eggs = 240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens.

The final numerical answer is:
20 dozens"

First, since each tree yields 6 lemons per year, in one decade (which is 10 years), each tree will yield:
\[ 6 \text{ lemons/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 60 \text{ lemons} \]

Next, since Tim grows 5 trees, the total number of lemons collected from all trees in a decade is:
\[ 60 \text{ lemons/tree} \times 5 \text{ trees} = 300 \text{ lemons} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 300 \]"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus initially.

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can represent the number of men as \(5x\) and the number of women as \(9x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of passengers is given as 84. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[5x + 9x = 84\]
\[14x = 84\]
\[x = 6\]

So, the number of men on the bus is:
\[5x = 5 \times 6 = 30\]

And the number of women on the bus is:
\[9x = 9 \times 6 = 54\]

If 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop, the number of women remaining on the bus is:
\[54 - 20 = 34\]

Thus, the number of women who have remained on the bus is:
\[\boxed{34}\]"
"To determine how many sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to first calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day and then extend that to 3 days.

From the information given:
- Each bouquet of sunflowers costs $8 and contains 12 sunflowers.
- Faraday earned $56 from selling bouquets per day.

First, we calculate the number of bouquets sold per day:
\[ \text{Number of bouquets sold per day} = \frac{\text{Total earnings from bouquets per day}}{\text{Cost of one bouquet}} = \frac{56}{8} = 7 \text{ bouquets per day} \]

Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold per day is:
\[ \text{Number of sunflowers sold per day} = \text{Number of bouquets sold per day} \times 12 = 7 \times 12 = 84 \text{ sunflowers per day} \]

Now, to find the total number of sunflowers sold over 3 days:
\[ \text{Total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days} = \text{Number of sunflowers sold per day} \times 3 = 84 \times 3 = 252 \]

Thus, the total number of sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 3 days is:
\[ 252 \]"
"First, let's determine how many rocks Adam can buy with his $100. Each rock costs $5.

\[
\text{Number of rocks} = \frac{\$100}{\$5/\text{rock}} = 20 \text{ rocks}
\]

Adam then sells 60% of his inventory. So, the number of rocks he sells is:

\[
\text{Number of rocks sold} = 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ rocks}
\]

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling these rocks. Each rock is sold for $7.

\[
\text{Revenue} = 12 \text{ rocks} \times \$7/\text{rock} = \$84
\]

Adam initially invested $100. The loss is the difference between the initial investment and the revenue from selling the rocks.

\[
\text{Loss} = \$100 - \$84 = \$16
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{16}

"To determine the total number of days Lauren will need to complete the project, we need to calculate the time required for each type of picture scene separately and then sum these times.

For the large-sized picture scenes:
Lauren can draw 5 large-sized scenes per day.
She needs to draw 45 large-sized scenes.
The number of days required for large-sized scenes is:
\[ \frac{45 \text{ scenes}}{5 \text{ scenes/day}} = 9 \text{ days} \]

For the medium-sized picture scenes:
Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized scenes per day.
She needs to draw 36 medium-sized scenes.
The number of days required for medium-sized scenes is:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ scenes}}{6 \text{ scenes/day}} = 6 \text{ days} \]

For the small-sized picture scenes:
Lauren can draw 7 small-sized scenes per day.
She needs to draw 49 small-sized scenes.
The number of days required for small-sized scenes is:
\[ \frac{49 \text{ scenes}}{7 \text{ scenes/day}} = 7 \text{ days} \]

Now, we sum the days required for each type of scene:
\[ 9 \text{ days} + 6 \text{ days} + 7 \text{ days} = 22 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, the total number of days it will take for Lauren to create all of the picture scenes is:
\[ \boxed{22} \]"

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that both tickets are winners. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the probability of winning for the second ticket:**
   - The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as a probability of \(0.20\).
   - The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning the second ticket is \(3 \times 0.20 = 0.60\).

2. **Calculate the combined probability of both tickets being winners:**
   - Since the events are independent (the outcome of one ticket does not affect the outcome of the other), the probability of both tickets being winners is the product of their individual probabilities.
   - Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is \(0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12\).

3. **Convert the probability to a percentage:**
   - To express the probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100.
   - Thus, \(0.12 \times 100 = 12\%\).

The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to consider the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the number he eats on weekends.

Mason eats 4 carrots each weekday. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is:
\[ 4 \text{ carrots/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ carrots} \]

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. Therefore, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is:
\[ 5 \text{ carrots/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ carrots} \]

Adding the carrots eaten on weekdays and the weekend gives us the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week:

"To determine how many more bottles of juices Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bottles needed to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs for 2300 people.
2. Determine how many more bottles are needed by subtracting the current production capacity from the total number of bottles required.

First, let's calculate the total number of bottles needed:
- Each person's daily energy demand is covered by 20% of a bottle.
- Therefore, to cover 100% of a person's daily energy demand, we need 5 bottles (since 100% / 20% = 5).

For 2300 people, the total number of bottles needed is:
\[ 2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to find out how many more bottles are required:
- Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of babies wearing bows and then find the percentage of those babies who are wearing purple.

First, let's calculate the number of babies dressed in purple and blue:
- Total babies = 8
- Babies dressed in purple = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- Babies dressed in blue = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we calculate the number of babies wearing bows:
- Babies wearing bows among the blue-wearers = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 2 = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.6667 \) (rounding to the nearest whole number, 1 baby)
- Babies wearing bows among the purple-wearers = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is:
- Total babies wearing bows = 1 (blue-wearers) + 2 (purple-wearers) = 3

Now, we need to find the percentage of babies wearing bows that are wearing purple:
- Percentage = \( \frac{\text{Number of babies wearing bows and purple}}{\text{Total number of babies wearing bows}} \times 100 \)
- Number of babies wearing bows and purple = 2
- Percentage = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 100 \approx 66.67\% \)

Therefore, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is approximately 66.67%."

Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - (1907 + 2136)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043
Reports received on Wednesday = 1125

So, the number of reports received on Wednesday is 1125."
"First, let's determine how much land Abraham sold in each transaction.

1. Abraham initially owned 80 square meters of land.
2. He sold half of his land for $50. Half of 80 square meters is 40 square meters. So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.
3. After a month, he sold another 1/4 of his land. One quarter of 80 square meters is 20 square meters. So, he sold 20 square meters for $30.
4. The remaining land is the total land minus the land sold in the first and second transactions. The land sold in the first transaction was 40 square meters, and the land sold in the second transaction was 20 square meters. Therefore, the remaining land is \(80 - 40 - 20 = 20\) square meters.

Now, let's calculate the total money Abraham earned from selling the land.

- From the first transaction, he earned $50.
- From the second transaction, he earned $30.
- From the remaining land, he sold 20 square meters at $3 per square meter. So, he earned \(20 \times 3 = 60\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together, the total money Abraham earned is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of apartments in the first two complexes:
- Each of the first two complexes has 200 apartments.
- Therefore, the total number of apartments in the first two complexes is \(200 + 200 = 400\) apartments.

Next, we calculate the number of apartments in the third complex, which is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two complexes:
- The combined total of the first two complexes is 400 apartments.
- 60% of 400 apartments is \(0.60 \times 400 = 240\) apartments.
- Therefore, the third complex has \(400 + 240 = 640\) apartments.

Now, we calculate the total number of apartments across all three complexes:
- The total number of apartments is \(400 + 640 = 1040\) apartments.

"Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters. According to the problem, the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the blue rope can be expressed as \( Y - 7 \) centimeters. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope can be expressed as \( 4(Y - 7) \) centimeters.

The combined length of the red, blue, and yellow ropes is given as 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ Y + (Y - 7) + 4(Y - 7) = 37 \]

First, simplify the equation:
\[ Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]

Next, solve for \( Y \):
\[ 6Y = 72 \]
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope is 12 centimeters, we can find the length of the blue rope:
\[ Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \]

"Let's denote the amount of money given to Rissa as \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars. Therefore, Rissa initially has 15 dollars and Ronnie has 5 dollars.

Let \(x\) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister. After giving \(x\) dollars to their sister, Rissa is left with \(15 - x\) dollars. According to the problem, after giving away the money, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her initial amount. So we can write the equation:
\[15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15\]
\[15 - x = 12\]
\[x = 15 - 12\]
\[x = 3\]

So, each of them gave 3 dollars to their little sister. Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left. Initially, Ronnie had 5 dollars and he gave away 3 dollars, so the amount left with Ronnie is:

"Let's denote the amount of red paint as \( R \), white paint as \( W \), purple paint as \( P \), and yellow paint as \( Y \).

Given:
- \( R = W = P \)
- \( Y = \frac{1}{2} \) of the mural
- The total amount of paint used is 12 pints.

Since \( R = W = P \), we can say \( R = W = P = x \).

The yellow paint, which is half the mural, is \( Y = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \) pints.

The total amount of paint used is the sum of all the individual amounts:
\[ R + W + P + Y = 12 \]
Substituting the known values:
\[ x + x + x + 6 = 12 \]
\[ 3x + 6 = 12 \]
Subtract 6 from both sides:
\[ 3x = 6 \]

"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. The area of one bedroom is given by the product of its length and width:

\[ \text{Area of one bedroom} = 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

\[ \text{Total area of bedrooms} = 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so:

\[ \text{Area of the living room} = 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of pods in the special size box. The original box contains 100 pods and costs $12. The special size box has 20% more pods than the original box.

First, calculate the number of additional pods in the special size box:
\[ 100 \text{ pods} \times 20\% = 100 \text{ pods} \times 0.20 = 20 \text{ pods} \]

So, the special size box contains:
\[ 100 \text{ pods} + 20 \text{ pods} = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The special size box also costs $12, so the cost per pod in the special size box is:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ pods}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cycles you can run with $1 if you use 1 pod per cycle. Since each pod costs $0.10, with $1 you can buy:
\[ \frac{1 \text{ dollar}}{0.10 \text{ dollars per pod}} = 10 \text{ pods} \]

Therefore, with $1, you can run 10 cycles with the new box. The final numerical answer is:

"First, we determine the number of 20 dollar bills Thomas initially withdraws from the bank. Since he withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills}
\]

Next, Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home. Therefore, the number of bills he has left is:

\[
50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills}
\]

Thomas then uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. The number of bills he uses is:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Half Goals:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half Goals:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals in the second half.
   - Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, so Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals in the second half.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Team A's total goals: \(4 \text{ (first half)} + 2 \text{ (second half)} = 6\).
   - Team B's total goals: \(2 \text{ (first half)} + 8 \text{ (second half)} = 10\).

4. **Total Goals Scored in the Match:**
   - The total number of goals scored in the match is the sum of the goals scored by both teams: \(6 + 10 = 16\).

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chalk the teacher has left and then calculate how many days he can continue using the chalk at a rate of 20% per day before he has to recycle it.

First, let's determine the amount of chalk used on Monday. The teacher used 45% of the chalk by the end of the day. Since the chalk started as a 5-inch piece, the amount of chalk used on Monday is:
\[ 5 \times 0.45 = 2.25 \text{ inches} \]

This means the teacher has:
\[ 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \text{ inches} \]
of chalk left at the end of Monday.

Next, we need to determine how much chalk the teacher will use each day if he uses only 20% of the chalk. The amount of chalk used each day is:
\[ 2.75 \times 0.20 = 0.55 \text{ inches} \]

To find out how many days the teacher can continue using the chalk before he has to recycle it, we divide the remaining chalk by the amount used each day:
\[ \frac{2.75}{0.55} = 5 \]

Therefore, the teacher has 5 days before he has to recycle this piece of chalk.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of girls on varsity. Since one-third of the girls are on varsity, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ girls on varsity} \]

Next, let's determine the number of boys on varsity. Since one-fourth of the boys are on varsity, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ boys on varsity} \]

Now, we can find the number of girls not on varsity:
\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ girls not on varsity} \]

And the number of boys not on varsity:
\[ 12 - 3 = 9 \text{ boys not on varsity} \]

To find the total number of students not on varsity, we add the number of girls not on varsity to the number of boys not on varsity:
\[ 8 + 9 = 17 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 17 \]"
"First, let's determine how many face masks Mike bought. According to the problem, Mike bought 5 face masks.

Next, we need to calculate how many face masks Johnny bought. The problem states that Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike. We can express this mathematically as:

\[ \text{Number of masks Johnny bought} = 3 \times (\text{Number of masks Mike bought}) + 2 \]

Substituting the number of masks Mike bought (which is 5) into the equation:

\[ \text{Number of masks Johnny bought} = 3 \times 5 + 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of masks Johnny bought} = 15 + 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of masks Johnny bought} = 17 \]

So, Johnny bought 17 face masks. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 17 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of teeth the dentist caps. According to the problem, the dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills. Since the dentist drills 4 teeth, the number of teeth capped is:

\[ 4 + 7 = 11 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of teeth that the dentist fixes. This is the sum of the teeth drilled and the teeth capped:

\[ 4 + 11 = 15 \]

Now, we need to find what percentage of James' teeth (which is 30) are fixed. The percentage is calculated by the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 50 \]"
"First, we need to determine the total cost of the milk that Mr. Marcellus initially purchased. The company sold 4000 gallons of milk at $3.5 per gallon. Therefore, the total cost is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 4000 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = \$14000
\]

Next, we need to find out how much of this milk had passed the expiry date. Mr. Marcellus returned 2/5 of the milk. So, we calculate the amount of milk that was returned:

\[
\text{Amount of milk returned} = \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \text{ gallons} = \frac{2 \times 4000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \text{ gallons}
\]

Since the milk was sold at $3.5 per gallon, the refund amount for the returned milk is:

\[
\text{Refund amount} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = 1600 \times 3.5 = 1600 \times \left(3 + 0.5\right) = 1600 \times 3 + 1600 \times 0.5 = 4800 + 800 = 5600
\]

Thus, the amount Mr. Marcellus got in refunds is:

\[
\boxed{5600}

"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, we substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5(C + 7)) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5(C + 7)}{3} \]
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old. To verify, we can find Wendy's current age using the first equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) = 5(20 + 7) = 5 \times 27 = 135 \]

Now, let's check the second condition:
In 25 years, Colin will be \( 20 + 25 = 45 \) years old, and Wendy will be \( 135 + 25 = 160 \) years old. According to the second condition, Colin's age in 25 years should be a third of Wendy's current age:
\[ 45 = \frac{1}{3} \times 135 = 45 \]

The conditions are satisfied, so the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many books Bob can buy with the total amount of $27,000. We know that he can buy 100 books for $500. Therefore, the cost per book is:

\[ \text{Cost per book} = \frac{500}{100} = 5 \text{ dollars per book} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27,000:

\[ \text{Total number of books} = \frac{27000}{5} = 5400 \text{ books} \]

Since Bob is distributing the money between 3 schools, we need to find out how many books he can buy for each school:

\[ \text{Books per school} = \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \text{ books} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1800 \]"

So, Newton brought home 6 apples."
"First, we need to determine how many 50 kg bags are in 850 kg of coal. We do this by dividing the total weight of the coal by the weight of each bag:

\[ \frac{850 \text{ kg}}{50 \text{ kg/bag}} = 17 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of bags by the cost per bag:

\[ 17 \text{ bags} \times 18 \text{ dollars/bag} = 306 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost of Ali's order is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed by Kate's friends. Each of the 6 friends eats 6 slices of cheese pizza:

\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices} \]

Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, we need to determine how many cheese pizzas are required to provide 36 slices:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed by Kate's friends. Each of the 6 friends eats 4 slices of pepperoni pizza:

\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Since the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we need to determine how many pepperoni pizzas are required to provide 24 slices:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Since Kate needs to buy enough cheese pizzas and pepperoni pizzas to satisfy her friends' consumption, and both require 3 pizzas, she needs to buy:

\[ 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many snowballs Jay can effectively make in an hour, accounting for the ones that melt.

Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Therefore, in 15 minutes, 2 snowballs melt, leaving him with 18 snowballs.

To find out how many snowballs he makes in 15 minutes, we subtract the melted ones from the ones he builds:
\[ 20 \text{ (built)} - 2 \text{ (melted)} = 18 \text{ (effective)} \]

Now, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are required to reach 60 snowballs. We can do this by dividing the target number of snowballs by the number of effective snowballs made in 15 minutes:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ (target)}}{18 \text{ (effective per 15 minutes)}} = \frac{60}{18} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \]

Since Jay can't work for a fraction of a 15-minute interval, we round up to the next whole number, which is 4 intervals. Each interval is 15 minutes, so 4 intervals are:
\[ 4 \times 15 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take Jay 60 minutes to have 60 snowballs.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 60 \]"
"If John is currently 28 years old and he is twice as old as Jim, we can set up the following equation to find Jim's current age:

Let \( J \) be Jim's current age. According to the problem, John's age is twice Jim's age, so:

\[ 28 = 2J \]

To find \( J \), we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ J = \frac{28}{2} = 14 \]

So, Jim is currently 14 years old.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many slices each person ate:

- Doxa ate 1 slice.
- Her sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, so her sister ate \(1 + 1 = 2\) slices.
- Her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister, so her brother ate \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices.

Now, let's add up the slices eaten by Doxa, her sister, and her brother:

- Doxa: 1 slice
- Sister: 2 slices
- Brother: 3 slices

Total slices eaten = \(1 + 2 + 3 = 6\)

"Let's break down the problem day by day to find out how many bandages were used and how many were left at the end of each day.

**First Day:**
- They used 38 bandages.
- They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
- Total bandages at the end of the first day: \(38 - 38 + 50 = 50\).

**Second Day:**
- They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
- Total bandages at the end of the second day: \(50 - 28 = 22\).

**Third Day:**
- They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered \(2 \times 50 = 100\) bandages.
- They used half a pack, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.
- Total bandages at the end of the third day: \(22 - 25 + 100 = 97\).

According to the problem, they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. However, based on our calculation, they had 97 bandages left. This discrepancy suggests there might be an error in the problem statement or an additional constraint not considered. Given the problem constraints and our calculations, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is 50.

\[ 10 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 2 \text{ inches} \]

The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, so for 2 inches, the cost is:

\[ 2 \text{ inches} \times 30 \text{ dollars per inch} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we add the cost of the hair color, which is $40. Therefore, the total cost is:

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to consider her regular pay and the additional attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her regular pay:
- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- She works 6 days a week.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

So, her daily pay is \(7.5 \times 1.5 = 11.25\) dollars.
Her weekly pay is \(11.25 \times 6 = 67.5\) dollars.

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her total regular pay for April is \(67.5 \times 4 = 270\) dollars.

Additionally, since she did not incur any absences, she receives an additional $10 for each week, which totals \(10 \times 4 = 40\) dollars.

Therefore, her total earnings for April are \(270 + 40 = 310\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:

So, the total amount of money Jason earned in the two week period is $9.00."
"First, we need to determine the amount of blood in one shark. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and each whale has 40 gallons of blood, we can calculate the blood volume of one shark as follows:

\[ \text{Blood volume of one shark} = 3 \times 40 \text{ gallons} = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have together. Since each shark has 120 gallons of blood, ten sharks will have:

\[ \text{Total blood volume of ten sharks} = 10 \times 120 \text{ gallons} = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

Thus, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:

The final numerical answer is 75."
"First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600, so the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find the cost per bottle of cognac. The cognac costs 50% more per bottle than the scotch, so the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 \times 1.5 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

The total cost for the cognac is:

\[ \text{Total cost of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we can find the total amount John spends on everything by adding the cost of the scotch and the cost of the cognac:

"To calculate the total number of trees Mr. Julius planted, we will break down the problem into parts and solve each part step by step.

First, let's determine the number of trees planted on the first day:
- Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
- He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which means he planted \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

So, the total number of trees planted on the first day is:
\[ 20 \text{ (White Oak)} + 40 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 60 \text{ trees} \]

Next, let's determine the number of trees planted on the second day:
- Mr. Julius planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day, which means he planted \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
- He planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day. The number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the first day was 40, so \(\frac{1}{4}\) more than 40 is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]
Thus, the number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is:
\[ 40 + 10 = 50 \]

So, the total number of trees planted on the second day is:
\[ 30 \text{ (White Oak)} + 50 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 80 \text{ trees} \]

Finally, the total number of trees planted over the two days is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had:

- Two eyeshadow palettes, each with four colors: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors.
- Three makeup sets, each with six colors: \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors.

So, the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had is:
\[8 + 18 = 26\]

Her sister steals one of the eyeshadow palettes, which contains 4 colors. So, Amy loses 4 colors:
\[26 - 4 = 22\]

Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since each makeup set has 6 colors, half of the colors from one makeup set is:
\[6 / 2 = 3\]

So, Amy uses up 3 colors, which means she has:

"First, let's determine the height of Mattison's house. Since Mattison is 60 inches tall and his house is 7 times as high as he is, the height of the house is:
\[ 60 \times 7 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to find the height of the first floor. The problem states that the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison is. Therefore, the height of the first floor is:
\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Since the house is two stories tall, the height of the second floor is the total height of the house minus the height of the first floor:
\[ 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The height of the roof from the floor of the second floor is the same as the height of the first floor, which is 180 inches. Therefore, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is:
\[ 180 \text{ inches} \]

The final numerical answer is:

So, the number of shells found by team Gogetters is 168."
"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we first need to calculate the total miles walked by the first three dogs and then use the average to find the total miles for all four dogs. Finally, we subtract the miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles for all four dogs.

The first dog needs to walk 1 mile.
The second dog needs to walk 4 miles.
The third dog needs to walk 3 miles.

Adding these together, the total miles walked by the first three dogs is:

Next, we need to determine how much of this loan amount John uses to pay off his debts. He uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts.

\[ \text{Amount Used to Pay Off Debts} = 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

To find out how much money John has leftover after paying off his debts, we subtract the amount used to pay off his debts from the total loan amount.

\[ \text{Money Leftover} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 40,000 \]"
"To determine how much Deandre will earn, we first need to calculate the total weight of the tunas he caught and then find out the total cost based on the price per kilogram.

Deandre caught three tunas with the following weights:
- First tuna: 56 kilograms
- Second tuna: 46 kilograms
- Third tuna: 26 kilograms

First, we calculate the total weight of the tunas:
\[
56 + 46 + 26 = 128 \text{ kilograms}
\]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the total weight by the price per kilogram:
\[
128 \text{ kilograms} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars per kilogram} = 64 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to calculate the selling price of the magazines. Trinity sells the magazines at 11/8 of the price she bought them. The price she bought the magazines for is $72.

To find the selling price, we calculate:
\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72 \]

Let's perform the multiplication:
\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11 \times 72}{8} = \frac{792}{8} = 99 \]

So, the selling price of the magazines is $99.

Next, we calculate the profit by subtracting the cost price from the selling price:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price} \]
\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 = 27 \]

Therefore, the profit Trinity makes is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"To find the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed per day for each setting and then sum these amounts over the specified periods.

1. **Low setting:**
   - Removes 1 liter of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed at low setting: \(1 \text{ liter/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 3 \text{ liters}\).

2. **Medium setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the low setting.
   - Therefore, it removes \(2 \times 1 = 2\) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed at medium setting: \(2 \text{ liters/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ liters}\).

3. **High setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting.
   - Therefore, it removes \(2 \times 2 = 4\) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 5 days.
   - Total water removed at high setting: \(4 \text{ liters/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ liters}\).

Now, we sum the total water removed from all settings:
\[3 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} + 20 \text{ liters} = 29 \text{ liters}\]

Thus, the total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in his basement is \(\boxed{29}\) liters."

"First, let's determine the capacity of Ali's class. According to the information provided, Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students.

Next, we need to find the capacity of John's classes. Since each of John's classes has \( \frac{1}{8} \) the capacity of Ali's class, we calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:
\[
\text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{120}{8} = 15 \text{ students}
\]

John has two classes, so the total capacity of John's classes is:
\[

The interest is 2% of $300, which is:
\[ 0.02 \times 300 = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen will owe is:
\[ 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Stephen will pay over the 11 months. He will pay $25 per month for 11 months, which totals:
\[ 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

The remaining amount, which will be paid in the twelfth month, is the total amount Stephen owes minus the amount he has already paid:
\[ 306 - 275 = 31 \]

Therefore, the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is:

"To determine how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of diaper changes per day for both children.
2. Determine how many diaper changes Jordan's wife handles.
3. Subtract the number of diaper changes handled by Jordan's wife from the total number of diaper changes to find out how many Jordan changes.

First, the total number of diaper changes per day for both children is:
\[ 2 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ diaper changes per child} = 10 \text{ diaper changes per day} \]

Next, since Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ diaper changes}}{2} = 5 \text{ diaper changes per day} \]

Therefore, the number of diaper changes Jordan makes per day is:
\[ 10 \text{ diaper changes per day} - 5 \text{ diaper changes per day} = 5 \text{ diaper changes per day} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to break down the problem into steps.

1. **Calculate the cost of one visit after 5 years:**
   - The original cost of one visit is $2.
   - The cost increased by 150%, which means the new cost is the original cost plus 150% of the original cost.
   - 150% of $2 is \(0.15 \times 2 = 0.30\).
   - Therefore, the new cost is \(2 + 0.30 = 2.30\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total cost for the first 5 years:**
   - Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.
   - The cost per visit is $2.30.
   - The total cost for one year is \(3 \times 2.30 = 6.90\) dollars.
   - For 5 years, the total cost is \(5 \times 6.90 = 34.50\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total cost for the next 3 years:**
   - The cost per visit remains $2.30.
   - The total cost for one year is still $6.90.
   - For 3 years, the total cost is \(3 \times 6.90 = 20.70\) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total cost for all visits:**
   - The total cost for the first 5 years is $34.50.
   - The total cost for the next 3 years is $20.70.

"To determine how much of Aiden's secret steakhouse seasoning he will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many pounds of meat are needed to make 80 meatballs.
2. Calculate the amount of seasoning needed based on the amount of meat.

First, we know that Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat. To find out how many pounds of meat are needed for 80 meatballs, we divide the number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound:

\[
\text{Pounds of meat needed} = \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds of meat}
\]

Next, we know that Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat. Therefore, for 5 pounds of meat, the amount of seasoning needed is:

\[

"To find the final price of the toy after the changes in price, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price of the toy in December after an 80% increase.
2. Calculate the price of the toy in January after a 50% decrease from the December price.

**Step 1: Calculate the price in December.**

The original price of the toy in November was $40. In December, the price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we calculate 80% of $40 and add it to the original price.

\[ \text{Increase in December} = 40 \times \frac{80}{100} = 40 \times 0.8 = 32 \]

So, the price in December is:

\[ 40 + 32 = 72 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the price in January.**

In January, the price decreased by 50% from the December price. To find the new price, we calculate 50% of $72 and subtract it from the December price.

\[ \text{Decrease in January} = 72 \times \frac{50}{100} = 72 \times 0.5 = 36 \]

So, the price in January is:

\[ 72 - 36 = 36 \]

The final price of the toy after it was discounted in January is \(\boxed{36}\)."
"To calculate the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to consider both the standard lessons and the lessons given to veterans.

First, let's calculate the earnings from the standard lessons:
- Charlie has 4 lessons at his standard rate of $80 per hour.
- The total for these lessons is \(4 \times 80 = 320\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the earnings from the lessons given to veterans:
- Charlie has 2 lessons at a reduced rate of 75% of the standard rate (since he reduces the rate by 25%).
- The reduced rate is \(80 \times 0.75 = 60\) dollars per hour.
- The total for these lessons is \(2 \times 60 = 120\) dollars.

Now, we add the earnings from both types of lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day:

"To determine how much money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to calculate the weekly cost and then extend that to a yearly cost.

First, let's calculate the weekly cost:
- The cost of pasta is $1.00.
- The cost of cheddar cheese is $3.00.
- The cost of gruyere cheese is twice the cost of cheddar cheese, which is \(2 \times 3.00 = 6.00\).

Adding these costs together gives the weekly cost:
\[ 1.00 + 3.00 + 6.00 = 10.00 \]

Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, so the weekly cost is $10.00.

To find the yearly cost, we multiply the weekly cost by the number of weeks in a year:
\[ 10.00 \times 52 = 520.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year is:

Next, we need to convert the total time into hours because the workday is given in hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
\[ 1200 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

The custodian works 8 hours per day. To find out what percentage of their day is spent cleaning, we use the formula for percentage:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent cleaning}}{\text{Total workday}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours/day}} \right) \times 100 = 2.5 \times 100 = 250\% \]

However, since the custodian only works 8 hours a day, the percentage cannot exceed 100%. Therefore, the custodian spends 100% of their workday cleaning classrooms.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 100\% \]"
"First, let's determine the capacity of each shelf:

- Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase:

- The total capacity of one bookcase is the sum of the capacities of all the shelves: \(10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books.

Given that Elly has 110 books, we need to determine how many bookcases are required to hold all 110 books. We do this by dividing the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:

\[
\frac{110}{55} = 2
\]

Therefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought. Since she bought five dozens of eggs and each dozen costs $2.40, the total cost is:

\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12.00 \]

Next, let's determine the total number of eggs Rose bought. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we need to find out how much Rose will sell the eggs for. She sells the eggs at a rate of $1 for every 3 eggs. Therefore, the total revenue from selling 60 eggs is:

\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find Rose's profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \]

So, Rose's profit is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine the number of white hats Skyler has, we can follow these steps:

1. **Total Hats**: Skyler has 100 hats in total.

2. **Red Hats**: Half of the hats are red.
   \[
   \text{Number of red hats} = \frac{100}{2} = 50
   \]

3. **Remaining Hats After Red Hats**: Subtract the number of red hats from the total number of hats.
   \[
   \text{Remaining hats} = 100 - 50 = 50
   \]

4. **Blue Hats**: 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue.
   \[
   \text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30

"First, let's determine the regular price of the beef jerky bag and then the discounted price.

The regular price of the bag is $18.00.

Since the bag is $3.00 off, the discounted price is:
\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many sticks of beef jerky are in the bag. Each bag contains 30 sticks.

To find the cost per stick, we divide the discounted price by the number of sticks:
\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

The cost per stick is $0.50. To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \]

So, the cost per stick of jerky in cents is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate how many questions Audrey got correct on the first test. The first test has 70 questions and she got 60% of them correct.

\[ \text{Correct answers on the first test} = 70 \times \frac{60}{100} = 70 \times 0.6 = 42 \]

Audrey needs to correctly answer 70% of the total questions to pass. The total number of questions for both tests is:

\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]

So, she needs to get 70% of 110 questions correct to pass:

\[ \text{Total correct answers needed} = 110 \times \frac{70}{100} = 110 \times 0.7 = 77 \]

Audrey has already answered 42 questions correctly on the first test. Therefore, the number of questions she needs to get correct on the second test is:

\[ \text{Correct answers needed on the second test} = 77 - 42 = 35 \]

So, Audrey needs to get 35 questions correct on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \). According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. \( B = 5S - 4 \)
2. The total number of ice cubes is \( S + B = 116 \)

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides:

\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:

\[ S = 20 \]

Now, substituting \( S = 20 \) back into the equation for \( B \):

\[ B = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is \( 96 \).

"To determine how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we can break down the problem into the steps provided by the historical averages.

1. **Determine the number of customers needed to sell 15 cars:**
   - For every 2 cars sold, 1 customer comes in.
   - Therefore, for 15 cars, the number of customers needed is:
     \[
     \frac{15 \text{ cars}}{2 \text{ cars/customer}} = 7.5 \text{ customers}
     \]
   - Since Jason can't have half a customer, we round up to the next whole number, which is 8 customers.

2. **Determine the number of telephone calls needed to get 8 customers:**
   - For every 25 telephone calls, 1 customer comes in.
   - Therefore, the number of telephone calls needed to get 8 customers is:
     \[
     8 \text{ customers} \times 25 \text{ calls/customer} = 200 \text{ calls}
     \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of flashlights and candles used by Brianna and her family.

First, let's determine the number of flashlights:
- There are 4 people in the house, so there are 4 flashlights for them.
- There are 8 rooms in the house, and 2 flashlights are provided for each room.
- Therefore, the total number of flashlights is \(4 + 2 \times 8 = 4 + 16 = 20\).

Next, let's determine the number of candles:
- There are 8 rooms in the house, so half of the rooms is \(8 / 2 = 4\) rooms.
- For the 4 rooms, there are 4 small candles each, so the total number of small candles is \(4 \times 4 = 16\).
- For the other 4 rooms, there are 5 medium candles each, so the total number of medium candles is \(4 \times 5 = 20\).
- Therefore, the total number of candles is \(16 + 20 = 36\).

Now, we add the total number of flashlights and candles:
- Total number of flashlights and candles is \(20 + 36 = 56\).

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total number of popped kernels, we will break down the problem into the different time intervals and calculate the number of kernels that pop in each interval.

1. **First 30 seconds:**
   - 20 kernels pop.

2. **Next 30 seconds:**
   - The rate triples the initial rate.
   - Initial rate = 20 kernels / 30 seconds = \(\frac{20}{30} = \frac{2}{3}\) kernels per second.
   - Rate in the next 30 seconds = \(3 \times \frac{2}{3} = 2\) kernels per second.
   - Number of kernels that pop = \(2 \times 30 = 60\).

3. **Next 30 seconds:**

   - Initial rate = \(\frac{2}{3}\) kernels per second.
   - Rate in the next 30 seconds = \(4 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{3}\) kernels per second.
   - Number of kernels that pop = \(\frac{8}{3} \times 30 = 80\).

4. **Final 30 seconds:**
   - The rate halves the previous rate.
   - Rate in the final 30 seconds = \(\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{8}{3} = \frac{4}{3}\) kernels per second.
   - Number of kernels that pop = \(\frac{4}{3} \times 30 = 40\).

5. **Residual heat:**
   - A quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds pop from residual heat.

"To determine the total amount of dog food needed in a week, we first calculate the daily consumption for both German Shepherds and Bulldogs, and then extend that to a weekly basis.

Each German Shepherd consumes 5 kilograms of dog food per day. With 3 German Shepherds, the daily consumption is:
\[ 3 \text{ German Shepherds} \times 5 \text{ kg/German Shepherd} = 15 \text{ kg/day} \]

Each Bulldog consumes 3 kilograms of dog food per day. With 2 Bulldogs, the daily consumption is:
\[ 2 \text{ Bulldogs} \times 3 \text{ kg/Bulldog} = 6 \text{ kg/day} \]

Adding the daily consumption of both breeds gives the total daily consumption:
\[ 15 \text{ kg/day} + 6 \text{ kg/day} = 21 \text{ kg/day} \]

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week):

Thus, the number of pink candies is 43."
"First, let's calculate the cost of one night at the hotel. It is given that one night at the hotel costs $80.

Next, we need to find the cost of one bus trip. The problem states that the cost of one bus trip is 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. Therefore, the cost of one bus trip is:
\[ 0.10 \times 80 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the hotel. Helen stayed for 3 nights, so the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 3 \times 80 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for the bus trips. Helen rode the bus 7 times, so the total cost for the bus trips is:
\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the total cost for the hotel and the total cost for the bus trips to find the total amount Helen paid:

"To determine how many pounds of feed are left after a week, we need to calculate the total amount of feed consumed by the pigs over that period.

First, let's find out how much feed one pig consumes in a day:
- Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day.
- Therefore, one pig eats \(4 \times 2 = 8\) pounds of feed per day.

Next, we calculate the total feed consumption for all five pigs in one day:
- Five pigs each eat 8 pounds of feed per day.
- Therefore, the total feed consumption for five pigs in one day is \(5 \times 8 = 40\) pounds.

Now, we determine the total feed consumption for one week (7 days):
- Five pigs consume 40 pounds of feed per day.
- Therefore, in one week, they consume \(40 \times 7 = 280\) pounds of feed.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. To find out how much feed is left after a week, we subtract the total feed consumed from the initial amount:
- Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed.
- The pigs consumed 280 pounds of feed in a week.
- Therefore, the amount of feed left is \(300 - 280 = 20\) pounds.

"First, we need to calculate the total number of hot dogs required for the party. Since John invited 20 people and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs, the total number of hot dogs needed is:
\[ 20 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ hot dogs/guest} = 40 \text{ hot dogs} \]

John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party, so the number of additional hot dogs he needs to buy is:
\[ 40 \text{ hot dogs} - 4 \text{ hot dogs} = 36 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Next, we need to determine how many packs of hot dogs John needs to buy. Since each pack contains 6 hot dogs, the number of packs required is:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ hot dogs}}{6 \text{ hot dogs/pack}} = 6 \text{ packs} \]

Each pack costs $2, so the total cost for the packs is:
\[ 6 \text{ packs} \times 2 \text{ dollars/pack} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total revenue Frances makes from selling cupcakes and cookies.

For the cupcakes:
- Frances sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each.
- Total revenue from cupcakes = 20 * $2 = $40.

The total age of all the siblings is \(\boxed{84}\)."
"To calculate the total time Charisma spends on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks, we need to break down the activities and their durations.

First, let's calculate the time spent on meditation:
- Charisma meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes at night.
- Therefore, she meditates for \(15 + 15 = 30\) minutes per day.
- Since she meditates 5 days a week, she spends \(30 \times 5 = 150\) minutes per week on meditation.
- Over 4 weeks, she spends \(150 \times 4 = 600\) minutes on meditation.

Next, let's calculate the time spent on yoga:
- Charisma practices yoga for 1 hour (60 minutes) 5 days a week.
- Therefore, she spends \(60 \times 5 = 300\) minutes per week on yoga.
- Over 4 weeks, she spends \(300 \times 4 = 1200\) minutes on yoga.

Now, we add the time spent on meditation and yoga:
- Total time spent on meditation and yoga in 4 weeks is \(600 + 1200 = 1800\) minutes.

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
- \(1800 \div 60 = 30\) hours.

"First, let's determine the number of seeds in a large sunflower. A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since one dozen equals 12, a small sunflower has:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds} \]

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36 seeds, we calculate:

\[ 0.5 \times 36 = 18 \text{ seeds} \]

Adding this to the original 36 seeds gives the number of seeds in a large sunflower:

\[ 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds} \]

Now, to find the total number of seeds in both a small and a large sunflower, we add the seeds from both:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts with the buy one get one 50% off deal.

The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, he gets the second T-shirt at 50% off. The price of the second T-shirt is therefore $8 * 0.5 = $4.

So, the total cost for the 2 T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes after the 40% discount.

The original price of the shoes is $40. With a 40% discount, the shoes cost $40 * 0.4 = $16 less.

So, the discounted price of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

Finally, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is the sum of the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes:

Chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies made - (Rainbow cookies + Oatmeal cookies)

Let's calculate the number of chocolate chip cookies:

Chocolate chip cookies = 7995 - (2595 + 3075)
Chocolate chip cookies = 7995 - 5670
Chocolate chip cookies = 2325

So, the number of chocolate chip cookies made is 2325."
"First, let's determine the number of each item Igor gathered by accident.

Dr. Grumpus requested:
- 16 test tubes
- 7 beakers
- 14 Petri dishes

Igor gathered:
- Half as many test tubes as requested: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes
- Two more than the number of Petri dishes requested: \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes
- The correct number of beakers: 7 beakers

Next, we calculate the total number of items Igor gathered:
- Test tubes: 8
- Beakers: 7
- Petri dishes: 16

Adding these together:
\[ 8 + 7 + 16 = 31 \]

Dr. Grumpus wanted a total of 29 items on the lab bench. Therefore, the number of items Igor lost is:
\[ 31 - 29 = 2 \]

So, the number of beakers Igor lost is 2."
"First, we need to determine the total number of screws required for all the tables. Each table has 4 legs, and each leg requires 2 screws. Therefore, the number of screws needed for one table is:

\[ 4 \text{ legs/table} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 8 \text{ screws/table} \]

Since James is assembling 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is:

\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws/table} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the number of screws he has:

\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

Thus, the number of screws James will have left over is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To solve this problem, we start by identifying the number of eggs in each basket. We know that the first basket contains 10 eggs. The second basket has twice as many eggs as the first basket. Therefore, we calculate the number of eggs in the second basket as follows:

\[ \text{Number of eggs in the second basket} = 2 \times \text{Number of eggs in the first basket} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of eggs in both baskets combined. We do this by adding the number of eggs in the first basket to the number of eggs in the second basket:

\[ \text{Total number of eggs} = \text{Number of eggs in the first basket} + \text{Number of eggs in the second basket} = 10 + 20 = 30 \]

Thus, the total number of eggs in both baskets put together is:

\[ 30 \]"
"First, let's determine how much money each person raised individually.

Alexandra raised $430.

Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so:
\[ \text{Kim's amount} = 430 + 320 = 750 \]

Next, we need to find out how much Sarah raised. We know that Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, and Sarah raised $300, so:
\[ \text{Maryam's amount} = 300 + 400 = 700 \]

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money raised by adding the amounts raised by each person:
\[ \text{Total amount} = \text{Alexandra's amount} + \text{Kim's amount} + \text{Sarah's amount} + \text{Maryam's amount} \]
\[ \text{Total amount} = 430 + 750 + 300 + 700 \]

Adding these amounts together:
\[ 430 + 750 = 1180 \]
\[ 1180 + 300 = 1480 \]
\[ 1480 + 700 = 2180 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money raised by the girls is:
\[ \boxed{2180} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time Vanessa took to complete her part of the race.

First, let's establish the relationship between Aaron's and Vanessa's speeds and distances. Let's denote the distance Aaron ran as \(d_A\) miles and the distance Vanessa ran as \(d_V\) miles. According to the problem, \(d_V = 4\) miles.

Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, if we let Vanessa's speed be \(v_V\) miles per minute, then Aaron's speed \(v_A\) is \(2v_V\). The time it takes for Aaron to run his distance is given as 16 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation for Aaron's distance as:
\[ d_A = v_A \times 16 = 2v_V \times 16 = 32v_V. \]

Since \(d_V = 4\) miles and \(d_V = v_V \times t_V\), where \(t_V\) is the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles, we have:
\[ 4 = v_V \times t_V. \]
Solving for \(t_V\), we get:
\[ t_V = \frac{4}{v_V}. \]

Now, we need to find the time it took for Vanessa to run 4 miles. Since \(d_V = 4\) miles and \(d_V = v_V \times t_V\), we can directly use the relationship \(t_V = \frac{4}{v_V}\). However, we don't need to find \(v_V\) explicitly to determine \(t_V\). We already have the relationship from the problem statement.

Thus, the time Vanessa took to complete her part of the race is:
\[ t_V = \frac{4}{v_V} = \frac{4}{\frac{d_A}{32}} = \frac{4 \times 32}{d_A} = \frac{128}{d_A}. \]

Since \(d_A = 32v_V\) and \(d_V = 4\), we can substitute \(d_A\) back into the equation for \(t_V\):
\[ t_V = \frac{4}{v_V} = \frac{4}{\frac{d_A}{32}} = \frac{4 \times 32}{d_A} = \frac{128}{d_A} = \frac{128}{32} = 4. \]

Therefore, Vanessa took 4 minutes to complete her part of the race. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we first calculate the total amount of line required based on the current dock length. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, for 200 feet of dock, he needs:

\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Currently, he has 6 feet of new line. Therefore, the additional amount of line he needs to buy is:

\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

So, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"To calculate the total revenue Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, determine the number of reservations per night:
- Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations a night.

Next, calculate the total number of reservations per day:
- Since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, the total number of reservations per day is \(6 \text{ reservations/night} \times 2 \text{ nights/day} = 12 \text{ reservations/day}\).

Now, calculate the total number of meals and bottles of wine ordered per day:
- Each reservation typically orders 2 meals and 1 bottle of wine.
- Therefore, the total number of meals ordered per day is \(12 \text{ reservations/day} \times 2 \text{ meals/reservation} = 24 \text{ meals/day}\).
- The total number of bottles of wine ordered per day is \(12 \text{ reservations/day} \times 1 \text{ bottle/reservation} = 12 \text{ bottles/day}\).

Next, calculate the total cost for the meals and bottles of wine per day:
- The cost for the meals is \(24 \text{ meals/day} \times \$5/\text{meal} = \$120/\text{day}\).
- The cost for the bottles of wine is \(12 \text{ bottles/day} \times \$5/\text{bottle} = \$60/\text{day}\).

Now, calculate the total cost per day:
- The total cost per day is \(\$120/\text{day} + \$60/\text{day} = \$180/\text{day}\).

Finally, calculate the total revenue for the week:
- Since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, the total revenue for the week is \(\$180/\text{day} \times 2 \text{ days/week} = \$360/\text{week}\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{360}
\]"
"First, we need to calculate the total selling price of the 50 watermelons. The vendor made a profit of 25% on the cost price of $80.

The profit amount is calculated as:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Cost Price} \times \text{Profit Percentage} = 80 \times \frac{25}{100} = 80 \times 0.25 = 20 \]

So, the total selling price is:
\[ \text{Total Selling Price} = \text{Cost Price} + \text{Profit} = 80 + 20 = 100 \]

To find the selling price of each watermelon, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:
\[ \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{\text{Total Selling Price}}{\text{Number of Watermelons}} = \frac{100}{50} = 2 \]

Thus, each watermelon was sold for $2."
"First, let's determine James's current age. Since Dora will be 12 in 3 years, she is currently 9 years old. James is now twice as old as Dora, so James is currently \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

Next, we need to find out how old John is now. We know that John had James when he was 19 years old, and James is currently 18 years old. Therefore, John is currently \(19 + 18 = 37\) years old.

Now, we need to determine the age of John's youngest son. The youngest son was born when John was 32 years old, so the youngest son is currently \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old. In 3 years, the youngest son will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}
\]"
"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we first need to calculate how many oranges each can peel in that time.

Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange. Therefore, in one hour (which is 60 minutes), Ana can peel:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges} \]

Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange. Therefore, in one hour, Jane can peel:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges} \]

To find out how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we subtract the number of oranges Jane peels from the number of oranges Ana peels:
\[ 20 \text{ oranges} - 15 \text{ oranges} = 5 \text{ oranges} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400, and Mark gets it at 80% off. This means he pays 20% of the original price.

\[ \text{Discounted price of the radiator} = 400 \times (1 - 0.80) = 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of hiring the mechanic. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.

\[ \text{Cost of hiring the mechanic} = 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of hiring the mechanic to find the total amount Mark paid.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 230 \]"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( c \) as the number of chickens.
- \( h \) as the number of cows.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

We can translate these into the following equations:
1. \( c + h = 20 \)
2. \( 2c + 4h = 70 \) (since each chicken has 2 legs and each cow has 4 legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2h = 35 \]

Now we have the system:
1. \( c + h = 20 \)
2. \( c + 2h = 35 \)

To eliminate \( c \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (c + 2h) - (c + h) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ c + 2h - c - h = 15 \]
\[ h = 15 \]

Now that we know \( h = 15 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of slices available from the 7 pizzas. Since each pizza is cut into 8 slices, we can calculate the total number of slices as follows:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to divide the total number of slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends, which makes a total of 4 people. So, we divide the 56 slices by 4:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Thus, each of them can have \(\boxed{14}\) slices."
