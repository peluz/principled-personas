"First, let's determine how many eggs Janet has left after eating and baking.

Janet starts with 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and bakes 4 eggs. So, the number of eggs left for sale is:

\[ 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 \]

Janet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg. Therefore, the total amount she makes every day is:

\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 18 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of fiber required for both the blue and white fibers and then sum them up.

1. The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.
2. The robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Therefore, the amount of white fiber is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) bolt.

Now, we add the bolts of blue and white fiber together:
\[ 2 \text{ bolts (blue)} + 1 \text{ bolt (white)} = 3 \text{ bolts} \]

So, the total number of bolts required is 3.

\[
\boxed{3}

"First, we need to calculate the new value of the house after the repairs and the increase in value.

The initial value of the house is $80,000. Josh adds $50,000 in repairs, so the total cost before the increase is:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

The value of the house increases by 150%. To find out how much the value increases, we calculate 150% of $130,000:
\[ 130,000 \times 1.5 = 195,000 \]

Adding this increase to the total cost gives us the new value of the house:
\[ 130,000 + 195,000 = 325,000 \]

The profit Josh made is the new value of the house minus the total amount he spent (the purchase price plus the repairs):
\[ 325,000 - 130,000 = 195,000 \]

So, the profit Josh made is:
\[ 195,000 \]"
"To determine the total number of meters James runs in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the total meters James runs in one sprint.
2. Calculate the total meters James runs in one week for one sprint.
3. Multiply the weekly total for one sprint by the number of sprints he runs in a week.

Step 1: James runs 60 meters in one sprint.

Step 2: James runs 3 times a week, so the total meters he runs in one week for one sprint is:
\[ 60 \text{ meters/sprint} \times 3 \text{ sprints/week} = 180 \text{ meters/week} \]

Step 3: James runs 3 sprints each week, so the total meters he runs in a week is:
\[ 180 \text{ meters/week} \times 3 \text{ sprints/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week} \]

Therefore, the total meters James runs in a week is 540 meters."
"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she gives her flock in the morning and afternoon.

Wendi gives her flock 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. Therefore, the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
\[ 15 + 25 = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Since Wendi has a flock of 20 chickens and she feeds each chicken three cups of feed per day, the total amount of feed needed for the entire flock is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed in the final meal, we subtract the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total amount of feed needed for the day:
\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Thus, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:
\[ 20 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"
"To determine the total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure. The first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.

Let's break it down:

- The first glass costs $5.
- The second glass costs $3.
- The third glass costs $5.
- The fourth glass costs $3.
- And so on...

This pattern continues for 16 glasses. We can see that for every two glasses, the cost is $5 + $3 = $8.

Since 16 glasses can be grouped into 8 pairs of glasses, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 \times 8 = 64 \]

So, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 64 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of sheep in each city based on the given relationships and the number of sheep in Seattle.

1. Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. Therefore, Charleston has \(4 \times 20 = 80\) sheep.
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Therefore, Toulouse has \(2 \times 80 = 160\) sheep.

Now, we sum the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle:
\[160 + 80 + 20 = 260\]

The total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is 260.

\[
\boxed{260}

"To determine the total time Carla spends downloading the 200 GB file, we need to break down the process into parts and calculate the time for each part.

1. **First 40% of the download:**
   - 40% of 200 GB is \(0.40 \times 200 = 80\) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \(80 \div 2 = 40\) minutes.

2. **Windows update installation:**
   - This takes 20 minutes.

3. **Restarting the download:**
   - After the update, Carla has to start the download from the beginning, which means she has to download the entire 200 GB again.
   - The time to download 200 GB at 2 GB/minute is \(200 \div 2 = 100\) minutes.

Adding these times together:
- Time for the first 40% download: 40 minutes
- Time for the Windows update: 20 minutes
- Time to restart and download the entire file: 100 minutes

Total time = \(40 + 20 + 100 = 160\) minutes.

The final numerical answer is 160 minutes."
"To determine how far John is from home at the end of 4 hours, we need to break down his journey into segments and calculate the distance for each segment.

1. **First Segment:**
   - Time: 3 hours
   - Speed: 60 mph
   - Distance: \(3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ mph} = 180 \text{ miles}\)

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Time: 2 hours (in traffic)
   - Speed: 0 mph
   - Distance: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 0 \text{ mph} = 0 \text{ miles}\)

3. **Third Segment:**
   - Time: 0.5 hours
   - Speed: 30 mph
   - Distance: \(0.5 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ miles}\)

4. **Fourth Segment:**
   - Time: 3.5 hours (since the total time is 4 hours and the first 2 hours were in traffic)
   - Speed: 80 mph
   - Distance: \(3.5 \text{ hours} \times 80 \text{ mph} = 280 \text{ miles}\)

Now, we sum up the distances from all segments to find the total distance traveled:
\[180 \text{ miles} + 0 \text{ miles} + 15 \text{ miles} + 280 \text{ miles} = 475 \text{ miles}\]

Therefore, at the end of those 4 hours, John is \(\boxed{475}\) miles from home."
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break it down into regular hours and overtime hours.

First, we calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours at her regular rate:
\[ \text{Regular earnings} = 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \]

Next, we calculate her earnings for the 5 overtime hours at her overtime rate. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate:
\[ \text{Overtime rate} = 1.2 \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$12/\text{hour} \]
\[ \text{Overtime earnings} = 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

Now, we add the regular earnings and the overtime earnings to find her total earnings for the week:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \]

So, Eliza's total earnings for the week are:
\[ \boxed{460} \]"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the number of downloads for each month and then sum them up.

1. **First Month:**
   The number of downloads in the first month is given as 60.

2. **Second Month:**
   The number of downloads in the second month is three times the number of downloads in the first month.
   \[
   \text{Downloads in the second month} = 3 \times 60 = 180
   \]

3. **Third Month:**
   The number of downloads in the third month is 30% less than the number of downloads in the second month.
   \[
   \text{Downloads in the third month} = 180 - (0.30 \times 180) = 180 - 54 = 126
   \]

4. **Total Downloads Over Three Months:**
   Sum the downloads from each month.
   \[
   \text{Total downloads} = 60 + 180 + 126 = 366
   \]

The total number of downloads over the three months is \(\boxed{366}\)."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts:
- Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
- Each dozen of donuts costs $68.
- Therefore, the cost for the donuts is \(3 \times 68 = 204\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:
- Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
- Each dozen of mini cupcakes costs $80.
- Therefore, the cost for the mini cupcakes is \(2 \times 80 = 160\) dollars.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes:
- Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
- Each dozen of mini cheesecakes costs $55.
- Therefore, the cost for the mini cheesecakes is \(6 \times 55 = 330\) dollars.

Now, we add up the costs of all the pastries to find the total cost:
- Total cost = cost of donuts + cost of mini cupcakes + cost of mini cheesecakes
- Total cost = 204 + 160 + 330 = 694 dollars.

The final numerical answer is 694."
"To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money from the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point at which this profit becomes positive.

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:
- Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons.
- Each lemon is sold for $1.5.
- Therefore, the annual revenue from lemons is \(7 \times 1.5 = 10.5\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the annual cost of maintaining the tree:
- The cost to water and feed the tree is $3 per year.

Now, we can find the net profit each year by subtracting the annual cost from the annual revenue:
- Net profit per year = Annual revenue - Annual cost
- Net profit per year = \(10.5 - 3 = 7.5\) dollars.

Since the initial cost to plant the tree is $90, we need to determine how many years it will take for the net profit to cover this initial cost.

Let \(n\) be the number of years it takes to start earning money. The total profit after \(n\) years is given by:
- Total profit after \(n\) years = Net profit per year \(\times n\)
- Total profit after \(n\) years = \(7.5n\)

We need this total profit to be at least equal to the initial cost of $90:
- \(7.5n \geq 90\)

Solving for \(n\):
- \(n \geq \frac{90}{7.5}\)
- \(n \geq 12\)

Therefore, it will take at least 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

The final numerical answer is:
12"
"Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had as \( x \).

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \).

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \).

3. She then sold half of what was left at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \). The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \).

We know that after these sales, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

Let's solve this equation step by step.

First, simplify the expression inside the parentheses:

\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \left( \frac{x}{3} - 1 \right) = \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{x}{3} + 1 = \frac{x}{3} - 1 \]

So the equation becomes:

\[ \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5 \]

Add 1 to both sides:

\[ \frac{x}{3} = 6 \]

Multiply both sides by 3:

\[ x = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners. Let's verify this by checking the steps:

1. She sold \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) vacuum cleaners at the green house, leaving her with \( 18 - 6 = 12 \) vacuum cleaners.
2. She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, leaving her with \( 12 - 2 = 10 \) vacuum cleaners.
3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) vacuum cleaners, leaving her with \( 10 - 5 = 5 \) vacuum cleaners.

The calculations confirm that Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners. Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{18}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we have:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after those who enrolled in contemporary dance have been accounted for:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Now, 25% of these remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Finally, the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is the remaining students after those who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance have been accounted for:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of students in hip-hop dance}}{\text{Total number of students}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.60 \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the entire students that enrolled in hip-hop dance is 60%."
"To determine which purchase plan will maximize the profit, we need to calculate the future value of each item based on the expected market growth and then compare the profit from each plan.

For the jewelry:
- Current value: $5,000
- Expected growth: 2.5%
- Future value of jewelry = $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,000 * 1.025 = $5,125

For the electronic gadgets:
- Current value: $8,000
- Expected growth: 1.2%
- Future value of electronic gadgets = $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,000 * 1.012 = $8,096

Now, we calculate the profit for each plan:
- Profit from jewelry = Future value of jewelry - Current value of jewelry = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets = Future value of electronic gadgets - Current value of electronic gadgets = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Comparing the profits:
- Profit from jewelry: $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets: $96

The merchant would maximize profit by choosing to purchase the jewelry, which would result in a profit of $125.

The final numerical answer is:
125"
"To determine the total distance covered by each train over the two days, we need to add the distances traveled in both directions.

1. The first day, the train travels 80 miles west.
2. The second day, the train travels 150 miles north.

The total distance covered by each train is the sum of these two distances:
\[ 80 \text{ miles} + 150 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles} \]

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles."
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to break down her earnings from both teaching and coaching and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her annual earnings from teaching:
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual teaching hours = 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year
Annual teaching earnings = 1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her annual earnings from coaching:
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual coaching hours = 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year
Annual coaching earnings = 750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year

Now, we sum up her annual earnings from both teaching and coaching:
Annual salary = Annual teaching earnings + Annual coaching earnings
Annual salary = $35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

The final numerical answer is $57,500."
"To determine how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs Claire uses per day.
2. Calculate the number of eggs Claire uses per week.
3. Calculate the number of eggs Claire uses in 4 weeks.
4. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.

Step 1: Claire uses 3 eggs per day.

Step 2: There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Step 3: Over 4 weeks, she will use:
\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Step 4: Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, the number of dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks is:
\[ \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozen} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 7 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour over the entire 12-mile trail.

First, let's calculate the total time Marissa wants to spend hiking to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour. The formula for average speed is:

\[
\text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}
\]

Given that the average speed Marissa wants is 4 miles per hour and the total distance is 12 miles, we can set up the equation:

\[
4 = \frac{12}{\text{Total Time}}
\]

Solving for Total Time:

\[
\text{Total Time} = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

Marissa has already spent 1 hour on the first 4 miles and another 1 hour on the next 2 miles. So, the time spent so far is:

\[
1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}
\]

To achieve a total time of 3 hours, the remaining time Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance is:

\[
3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour}
\]

The remaining distance is:

\[
12 \text{ miles} - 4 \text{ miles} - 2 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles}
\]

Now, we need to find the speed required to walk the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour. The speed is given by:

\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

Thus, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour. The final numerical answer is:

\[
6

"First, let's determine the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink. Since two-thirds of the orange drink is water, we calculate:

\[ \text{Water in orange drink} = \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \text{ liters} \]

Next, let's determine the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since three-fifths of the pineapple drink is water, we calculate:

\[ \text{Water in pineapple drink} = \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = \frac{45}{5} = 9 \text{ liters} \]

After spilling one liter of the orange drink, the amount of orange drink left is:

\[ 10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we add the remaining orange drink to the pineapple drink to get the total volume of the mixture:

\[ 9 \text{ liters (orange)} + 15 \text{ liters (pineapple)} = 24 \text{ liters} \]

The total amount of water in the mixture is the sum of the water from the orange drink and the pineapple drink:

\[ \text{Total water} = \frac{20}{3} + 9 = \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3} \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture is:

\[ \frac{47}{3} \text{ liters} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \frac{47}{3} \]

To express this as a decimal, it is approximately 15.67 liters. However, the exact answer in fraction form is preferred, so the final answer is:

\[ \frac{47}{3} \]"
"First, let's determine Raymond's current age. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha and Samantha is currently 31 years old, Raymond is currently \(31 - 6 = 25\) years old.

Raymond had a son at the age of 23. Therefore, Raymond's son was born when Raymond was 23 years old. Since Raymond is currently 25 years old, his son was born \(25 - 23 = 2\) years ago.

- The next 2 customers each bought 2 DVDs, so that's \(2 \times 2 = 4\) DVDs.
- The last 3 customers did not buy any DVDs, so that's \(3 \times 0 = 0\) DVDs.

Adding these together, the total number of DVDs sold is \(3 + 4 + 0 = 7\).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 7."
"To determine how many centimeters shorter the candle will be after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, we need to calculate the total burning time and then use the rate of melting to find the total decrease in the candle's height.

The time from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is 4 hours. Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we can calculate the total decrease in height as follows:

\[ \text{Total decrease in height} = \text{Burning time} \times \text{Rate of melting} \]
\[ \text{Total decrease in height} = 4 \, \text{hours} \times 2 \, \text{cm/hour} \]
\[ \text{Total decrease in height} = 8 \, \text{cm} \]

So, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"To find the original price of the book before the discount, we can set up the equation based on the information given. If the book was bought for $19.50 with a 25% discount, this means Kyle paid 75% of the original price (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \). According to the problem, 75% of \( P \) is $19.50. We can write this as:

\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we need to solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's calculate the value of \( P \).
```python
# Calculation
original_price = 19.50 / 0.75
original_price
```
```output
RuntimeError
```
It seems there was an error in the execution environment. Let's perform the calculation manually:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was \( \$26 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered except for the boxes of pizza.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
The cost of 4 apples is \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Adding these costs together, we get:
\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\] dollars.

Marie paid a total of $50. If we subtract the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples from the total amount paid, we can find out how much she spent on the boxes of pizza:
\[50 - 33 = 17\] dollars.

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, we can determine the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered by dividing the amount spent on pizza by the cost per box:
\[17 \div 8.50 = 2\]

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"To find out how much Mishka spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of each type of clothing item and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the cost of the shorts:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts.
- Each pair of shorts costs $16.50.
- Therefore, the total cost for the shorts is \( 3 \times 16.50 = 49.50 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pants:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
- Each pair of pants costs $22.50.
- Therefore, the total cost for the pants is \( 3 \times 22.50 = 67.50 \) dollars.

Then, let's calculate the cost of the shoes:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
- Each pair of shoes costs $42.
- Therefore, the total cost for the shoes is \( 3 \times 42 = 126 \) dollars.

Finally, we sum up the costs of all the items:
- Total cost = Cost of shorts + Cost of pants + Cost of shoes
- Total cost = $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243

So, Mishka spent a total of 243 dollars on all the clothing items.

The final numerical answer is:

1. Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.
2. Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need to buy.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.**

Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night. There are 60 days in the period, so she will consume:
\[ 60 \text{ servings} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need to buy.**

Each carton contains 15 servings. To find out how many cartons she needs, we divide the total servings by the servings per carton:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.**

Each carton costs $4.00. Therefore, the total cost for 4 cartons is:
\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To determine how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to calculate the distance from his first stop to his second stop.

Henry's total trip distance is 60 miles. His first stop was after 20 miles. Therefore, the distance from the start to his first stop is 20 miles.

His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip is 60 miles, the distance from the start to his second stop is:
\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \text{ miles} \]

To find the distance traveled between his first and second stops, we subtract the distance of his first stop from the distance of his second stop:
\[ 45 - 20 = 25 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the number of miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops is:
\[ 25 \]"
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

The cost of the first pair of high heels is $33. The cost of the second pair of high heels is twice the cost of the first pair, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ B = 99 + 5 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = 104 \]

So, the cost of the boots is \( 104 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 104 \]"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen based on the given ratio and total age.

Given:
- The ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11.
- The total age of Darrell and Allen is 162.

Let's denote Darrell's age as \(7x\) and Allen's age as \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The sum of their ages is:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]
\[18x = 162\]
\[x = \frac{162}{18}\]
\[x = 9\]

Now, we can find their current ages:
- Darrell's age: \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\)
- Allen's age: \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\)

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is:
\[109\]"
"To find the average guess, we first need to determine each friend's guess and then calculate the average of these guesses.

1. The first friend's guess is 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60. So, the second friend's guess is 60 jelly beans.
3. The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, and adding this to 80 gives us 100. So, the third friend's guess is 100 jelly beans.

Now, we calculate the average of these guesses:
- The first guess is 80.
- The second guess is 60.
- The third guess is 100.

The sum of these guesses is \(80 + 60 + 100 = 240\).

The average guess is the sum of the guesses divided by the number of guesses, which is \(240 / 3 = 80\).

Therefore, the average guess is 80 jelly beans."
"To determine how many hours a week John spends taking care of the dogs, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. First, calculate the total hours John spends on one dog per day:
   \[
   0.5 \text{ hours/dog/day}
   \]

2. Next, calculate the total hours John spends on all 10 dogs per day:
   \[
   0.5 \text{ hours/dog/day} \times 10 \text{ dogs} = 5 \text{ hours/day}
   \]

3. Finally, calculate the total hours John spends on all the dogs in one week (7 days):
   \[
   5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week}
   \]

So, the total number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs in a week is:

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these pieces of information as equations:
\[ G + S = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins \( S \) is 40, we can find the number of gold coins \( G \) using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 70 \]"
"First, let's determine how many jewels Aaron has. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Since Raymond has 40 jewels, we can calculate half of Raymond's jewels as follows:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Now, we add 5 to this number to find out how many jewels Aaron has:

\[
20 + 5 = 25
\]

So, Aaron has 25 jewels. Next, we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. The problem states that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Therefore, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:

\[
25 - 2 = 23
\]

Thus, Siobhan has 23 jewels. The final numerical answer is:

\[
23
\]"
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points he scores in the second 20 minutes, we calculate 25% of 4 points and add it to the original 4 points.

25% of 4 points is \( 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \) point.

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) points.

Adding the points from both periods, the total points Mike scored is \( 4 + 5 = 9 \) points.

The final numerical answer is 9."
"First, we need to determine the cost of one yogurt. Since 4 yogurts cost $5.00, the cost of one yogurt is:

\[

\]

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so the cost of 2 yogurts per day is:

\[
2 \times 1.25 = 2.50 \text{ dollars}
\]

Over 30 days, the total cost for Terry to buy 2 yogurts each day is:

\[

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John makes from selling his lego sets. He has 13 lego sets and sells each for $15.

\[ \text{Total money from lego sets} = 13 \times 15 = 195 \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money John spends on the video games. He buys 8 video games for $20 each.

\[ \text{Total money spent on video games} = 8 \times 20 = 160 \]

Now, we can determine how much money John has left after buying the video games. We know he has $5 left after these purchases.

\[ \text{Money left} = 195 - 160 = 35 \]

Since the problem states that John has $5 left, we can verify that the calculation is consistent with the given information.

Finally, since John did not sell any lego sets after buying the video games, he still has all 13 lego sets.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 13 \]"
"To find out how fast John runs, we need to determine the total distance he runs in a week and the total time he spends running in a week.

First, let's calculate the total distance John runs in a week:
- He runs 60 miles in total.
- He runs 3 days a week.

Next, let's calculate the total time John spends running in a week:
- He runs 3 hours on the first day.
- He runs half as much as the first day on the other two days, which means he runs 3/2 = 1.5 hours each on the second and third days.

Now, let's add up the total time spent running:
- First day: 3 hours
- Second day: 1.5 hours
- Third day: 1.5 hours

Total time spent running = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours

Now, we can calculate John's average speed. Speed is calculated as the total distance divided by the total time:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how far Dana can travel in six hours given her running, walking, and skipping speeds, and the time she spends on each activity.

First, let's find Dana's walking speed. We know that her skipping speed is half her running speed, and she skips at 3 miles per hour. Therefore, her running speed is twice her skipping speed:
\[ \text{Running speed} = 2 \times 3 \text{ miles per hour} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine the time she spends running and walking. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Since the total time is six hours, the time spent running is:
\[ \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]
And the time spent walking is:
\[ \text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the distance she covers while running and walking. The distance covered while running is:
\[ \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time running} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]
The distance covered while walking is:
\[ \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time walking} \]
Since her walking speed is the same as her skipping speed (3 miles per hour), the distance covered while walking is:
\[ \text{Distance walking} = 3 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

The total distance Dana can travel in six hours is the sum of the distances covered while running and walking:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance walking} = 12 \text{ miles} + 12 \text{ miles} = 24 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{24} \]"

"First, let's determine how far Polly can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone. We know that without the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet. When holding the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther. Therefore, the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone is:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's breath can reach up to 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance Polly can throw the javelin:

\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

"First, let's determine the number of calories in one serving of the bag of chips. Given that a 300g bag has 5 servings and contains 250 calories per serving, we can calculate the total calories in the bag as follows:

\[ \text{Total calories in the bag} = 5 \text{ servings} \times 250 \text{ calories/serving} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories are left for the day. Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories:

\[ \text{Calories left for the day} = 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to determine how many servings of chips you can eat with the remaining 200 calories. Since each serving contains 250 calories:

\[ \text{Servings you can eat} = \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories/serving}} = \frac{200}{250} = \frac{4}{5} = 0.8 \text{ servings} \]

Since each serving is 500g (because 300g is 5 servings), the amount of chips you can eat is:

\[ \text{Grams you can eat} = 0.8 \text{ servings} \times 500 \text{ grams/serving} = 400 \text{ grams} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the cost of making the candles. Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax and wicks for every 10 candles. For 20 candles, he will need 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks. The cost for 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks is:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pound} = \$20.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles. Each candle is sold for $2.00:

\[ 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00 \text{ per candle} = \$40.00 \]

Now, we can find the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00 \]

So, Charlie's net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of articles written on each day.
2. Calculate the total number of hours spent writing articles over the three days.

**Step 1: Determine the number of articles written on each day.**

- **Monday:** Meredith wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday:** She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. So, the number of articles on Tuesday is:
  \[
  5 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 5 \right) = 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ articles}
  \]
- **Wednesday:** She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, the number of articles on Wednesday is:
  \[
  2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ articles}
  \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of hours spent writing articles over the three days.**

- Each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write about.
- Total articles written over the three days:
  \[

The total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days is \(\boxed{104}\)."
"To determine how many Post-it notes were in the package that Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of Post-it notes used at work.
2. Determine the initial number of Post-it notes before the purchase.
3. Calculate the number of Post-it notes purchased.
4. Add the number of Post-it notes purchased to the initial number to find the total number in the package.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Candice placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee. Therefore, she used 220 Post-it notes at work.

2. Initially, Candice had 80 Post-it notes in her purse. After using 220 Post-it notes at work, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining. We can calculate the number of Post-it notes she had before purchasing the new package by adding the 220 used and the 23 remaining to the initial 80:

\[ \text{Initial number of Post-it notes} + \text{Post-it notes used} + \text{Post-it notes remaining} = \text{Total number of Post-it notes before purchase} \]

\[ 80 + 220 + 23 = 323 \]

So, Candice had 323 Post-it notes before purchasing the new package.

3. To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package she purchased, we subtract the initial number of Post-it notes from the total number of Post-it notes before purchase:

\[ \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package} = \text{Total number of Post-it notes before purchase} - \text{Initial number of Post-it notes} \]

\[ \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package} = 323 - 80 = 243 \]

Therefore, the number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is 243.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 243 \]"
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Given that each blue tie costs $40 and he spent a total of $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of each red tie. Since red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, the cost of each red tie is:

\[ \text{Cost per red tie} = \text{Cost per blue tie} + 0.5 \times \text{Cost per blue tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60 \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

Finally, the total amount John spent on ties is the sum of the cost of the blue ties and the cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total spent on ties} = \text{Total spent on blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 800 \]"

So, the total length of the wire in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 6-inch pieces can be cut from the 48-inch wire. We do this by dividing the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"First, we need to determine the total number of units in the building. Since there are 15 floors and each floor contains 8 units, the total number of units is:

\[ 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units/floor} = 120 \text{ units} \]

Next, we need to find out how many units are occupied. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is:

\[ 120 \text{ units} \times \frac{3}{4} = 90 \text{ units} \]

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

\[ 120 \text{ units} - 90 \text{ units} = 30 \text{ units} \]

So, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is:

\[ 30 \]"
"First, we need to determine how many dozens of eggs Lloyd gets from his farm per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs produced per day by 12:

\[ \text{Dozens of eggs per day} = \frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 21 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we calculate how much Lloyd makes per day by selling the eggs at $2 per dozen:

\[ \text{Daily earnings} = 21 \text{ dozen} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much Lloyd makes in a week, we multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in a week (7 days):

\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 42 \text{ dollars/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 294 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 294 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Tom to travel back from his destination. However, we first need to know the distance he traveled to get to his destination. Since the problem does not specify the distance, let's assume the distance from 1 to 4 PM is the same as the distance back.

Let's denote the distance from 1 to 4 PM as \( D \) miles. Given that Tom's ship travels at 10 miles per hour, the time taken to travel from 1 to 4 PM is \( \frac{D}{10} \) hours.

On his return trip, he travels back at a rate of 6 miles per hour. The time taken to travel back is \( \frac{D}{6} \) hours.

Since the distance \( D \) is the same for both trips, we can calculate the time taken to return as follows:

\[
\text{Time to return} = \frac{D}{6} \text{ hours}
\]

Without the specific distance \( D \), we can't provide a numerical answer. However, if we assume the distance \( D \) is known, the formula above will give us the time in hours.

If we assume the distance \( D \) is known and provided, we can substitute it into the formula to get the numerical answer. For the sake of this problem, let's assume the distance \( D \) is 20 miles (this is an arbitrary assumption for the sake of calculation).

\[
\text{Time to return} = \frac{20}{6} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \text{ hours}
\]

So, the time it takes him to get back is approximately 3.33 hours."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, and he removes 30 comic books.

\[ \text{Total weight of comic books} = 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. So, the remaining weight that needs to be removed is:

\[ \text{Remaining weight to be removed} = 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[ \text{Number of toys to be removed} = \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 15 \]"
"To determine which day the mechanic earned more revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for each day.

**Thursday:**
- Revenue from truck tires: \(6 \text{ tires} \times \$60 \text{ per tire} = \$360\)
- Revenue from car tires: \(4 \text{ tires} \times \$40 \text{ per tire} = \$160\)
- Total revenue on Thursday: \(\$360 + \$160 = \$520\)

**Friday:**
- Revenue from car tires: \(12 \text{ tires} \times \$40 \text{ per tire} = \$480\)
- Revenue from truck tires: \(0 \text{ tires} \times \$60 \text{ per tire} = \$0\)
- Total revenue on Friday: \(\$480 + \$0 = \$480\)

"To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the maximum allowable weight of the boxes.
2. Determine how many boxes can be loaded given the weight limit.

First, we subtract the weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit to find the maximum weight the boxes can have:

\[ \text{Maximum weight for boxes} = \text{Bridge's weight limit} - \text{Weight of driver and empty truck} \]
\[ \text{Maximum weight for boxes} = 5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out how many boxes can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding this weight limit. Each box weighs 15 pounds, so we divide the maximum weight for boxes by the weight of one box:

\[ \text{Maximum number of boxes} = \left\lfloor \frac{\text{Maximum weight for boxes}}{\text{Weight of one box}} \right\rfloor \]
\[ \text{Maximum number of boxes} = \left\lfloor \frac{1245}{15} \right\rfloor \]
\[ \text{Maximum number of boxes} = \left\lfloor 83 \right\rfloor = 83 \]

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes which can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83.

"First, let's break down the information given:

- Total number of oranges = 25
- Number of bad oranges = 1
- Number of unripe oranges = 20% of 25 = 0.20 * 25 = 5
- Number of sour oranges = 2

To find the number of good oranges, we need to subtract the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges from the total number of oranges.

Number of good oranges = Total number of oranges - (Number of bad oranges + Number of unripe oranges + Number of sour oranges)

Let's calculate this:

Number of good oranges = 25 - (1 + 5 + 2) = 25 - 8 = 17

So, the number of good oranges is 17.

"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of working, we need to break down the calculation into two parts: the first 20 years and the next 10 years.

1. **First 20 years:**
   - Marcy earns a fixed annual pension of $50,000.
   - For 20 years, the total pension amount is \(20 \times 50,000 = 1,000,000\) dollars.

2. **Next 10 years:**
   - Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.
   - The value of the pension at the start of the 21st year is $50,000.
   - For the next 10 years, she earns \(50,000 \times 0.05 = 2,500\) dollars per year.

3. **Total pension after 30 years:**
   - The total pension amount after 30 years is the sum of the pension from the first 20 years and the pension from the next 10 years.
   - Total pension = $1,000,000 (from the first 20 years) + $2,500 \times 10 (from the next 10 years) = $1,000,000 + $25,000 = $1,025,000.

4. **Annual pension after 30 years:**
   - After 30 years, she will receive 5% of the total pension amount.
   - Annual pension = \(1,025,000 \times 0.05 = 51,250\) dollars.

Therefore, her annual pension after 30 years will be **$51,250**."
"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payment into two halves of the year and then sum them up.

1. **First Half of the Year:**
   - The streaming service charges $140 per month.
   - There are 6 months in the first half of the year.
   - Total cost for the first half = $140/month * 6 months = $840.

2. **Second Half of the Year:**
   - The service charges 10% less than the initial amount.
   - The reduced monthly charge = $140 - (10% of $140) = $140 - $14 = $126.
   - There are 6 months in the second half of the year.
   - Total cost for the second half = $126/month * 6 months = $756.

3. **Total Cost for the Year:**
   - Total cost = Cost for the first half + Cost for the second half = $840 + $756 = $1596.

Therefore, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $1596."
"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to calculate how much gas she has left in her tank after her 100-mile trip. Since she needed 4 gallons to refill her 12-gallon tank, she currently has:

\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how many miles she can drive with the 8 gallons of gas she currently has. We know that she drove 100 miles with 4 gallons, so the miles per gallon (mpg) for her car is:

\[ \text{mpg} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

With 8 gallons of gas, she can drive:

"First, we need to determine how much water each of the two girls received. Since each girl got \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the 24 liters of water, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters}
\]

So, each girl received 4 liters of water. Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they received together is:

\[
4 \text{ liters} + 4 \text{ liters} = 8 \text{ liters}
\]

Next, we need to account for the 6 liters of water that the boy received. Adding the water received by the girls and the boy gives us the total amount of water distributed:

"To determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the salary increase after the first year.
2. Calculate the salary increase after the second year.
3. Calculate the salary increase after the third year.
4. Add the total increase to the initial salary.

The initial salary is $600. The company increases the salary by 10% of the initial salary every year for those who have stayed for five years.

**Step 1: Calculate the salary after the first year.**
The increase after the first year is 10% of $600.
\[ \text{Increase after 1 year} = 0.10 \times 600 = 60 \]
\[ \text{Salary after 1 year} = 600 + 60 = 660 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the salary after the second year.**
The increase after the second year is 10% of $660.
\[ \text{Increase after 2 years} = 0.10 \times 660 = 66 \]
\[ \text{Salary after 2 years} = 660 + 66 = 726 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the salary after the third year.**
The increase after the third year is 10% of $726.
\[ \text{Increase after 3 years} = 0.10 \times 726 = 72.6 \]

"First, let's determine the number of pets each person has based on the information provided.

Cindy has 4 pets.

Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has:
\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pets} \]

Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has:
\[ 3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ pets} \]

Now, to find the total number of pets that Jan, Marcia, and Cindy have together, we add the number of pets each has:
\[ 4 + 6 + 18 = 28 \]

So, the total number of pets the three have is:
\[ 28 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's define the ages of the kids using variables:

- Let \( J \) be Jackson's age.
- Then Amy's age is \( J + 5 \) (since Amy is 5 years older than Jackson).
- Corey's age is \( J + 5 + 2 = J + 7 \) (since Amy is 2 years younger than Corey).
- James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey's age is \( 10 + 1 = 11 \).

Since Corey's age is \( J + 7 \) and we know Corey's age is 11, we can set up the equation:
\[ J + 7 = 11 \]

Now, solve for \( J \):
\[ J = 11 - 7 \]
\[ J = 4 \]

So, Jackson is 4 years old.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how long it took Lee to run the 400-meter hurdles before the change. According to the information, Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald would run it. Since Lee runs it in 38 seconds, Gerald would run it in 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

Now, Gerald improved his speed by 10% due to his new diet. To find out how fast Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles, we need to calculate 10% of his original time and subtract it from his original time.

10% of 40 seconds is \( 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \) seconds.

So, Gerald's new time is \( 40 - 4 = 36 \) seconds.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of dogs:**
   The number of dogs is given as 60.

2. **Determine the number of cats:**
   Since there are two cats for every dog, the number of cats can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Number of cats} = 2 \times \text{Number of dogs} = 2 \times 60 = 120
   \]

3. **Calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:**
   \[
   \text{Combined number of dogs and cats} = \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of cats} = 60 + 120 = 180
   \]

4. **Determine the number of rabbits:**
   The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. Therefore:
   \[
   \text{Number of rabbits} = \text{Combined number of dogs and cats} - 12 = 180 - 12 = 168
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of pets:**
   \[
   \text{Total number of pets} = \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of cats} + \text{Number of rabbits} = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348
   \]

The total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348."
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in Grade 5.

Given that 2/5 of the 200 Grade 5 students are boys, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:
\[ \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

Since the total number of students is 200, the number of girls can be calculated by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. According to the problem, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout:
\[ \text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find the number of girls who are not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[ \text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40 \]

Therefore, the number of girls who are not in the girl scout is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"

"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the volume of tomatoes before cooking.
2. Calculate the number of tomatoes based on the volume before cooking.

First, we know that the final volume of the sauce is 32 ounces, and this volume is half the volume of the tomatoes before cooking. Therefore, the volume of the tomatoes before cooking was:
\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we know that each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes. To find out how many 16-ounce cans were used, we divide the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of one can:
\[ \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/can}} = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes used is:
\[ 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes/can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Thus, the number of tomatoes Freda used is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Friend**: The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. **Second Friend**: The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. This means the second friend pressed the doorbell \(20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25\) times.
3. **Fourth Friend**: The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. **Third Friend**: The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. This means the third friend pressed the doorbell \(60 + 10 = 70\) times.

Now, let's sum up all the doorbell presses:

- First friend: 20 times
- Second friend: 25 times
- Third friend: 70 times
- Fourth friend: 60 times

Total doorbell presses = \(20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175\)

"First, let's calculate the total number of pages Solo needs to read:

- Science: 4 pages
- Social Studies: 20 pages
- History: 7 pages
- Geography: 8 pages

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday. Therefore, the remaining pages he needs to read are:

Remaining pages = Total pages - Pages read on Monday
Remaining pages = 39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read, on average, in one day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days left:

Pages per day = Remaining pages / Number of days left
Pages per day = 24 / 4 = 6 pages

So, Solo needs to read, on average, 6 pages per day. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to break down his water consumption by weekdays and weekends.

First, let's calculate the number of glasses of water John drinks on a weekday:
- John drinks 1 glass of water with breakfast.
- John drinks 1 glass of water with lunch.
- John drinks 1 glass of water with dinner.
- John drinks 1 glass of water before bed.

So, on a weekday, John drinks \(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4\) glasses of water.

Since there are 5 weekdays in a week, the total number of glasses of water John drinks on weekdays is:
\[ 4 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ glasses} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of glasses of water John drinks on a weekend day:
- John drinks 1 glass of water with dinner.

So, on a weekend day, John drinks \(1\) glass of water.

Since there are 2 weekend days in a week, the total number of glasses of water John drinks on weekends is:
\[ 1 \text{ glass/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 2 \text{ glasses} \]

Now, we add the total glasses of water consumed on weekdays and weekends to find the total for the week:

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to determine the inner dimensions of one box and then calculate its volume. After that, we can multiply the volume of one box by 3 to get the total inner volume of all 3 boxes.

The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, the inner dimensions of each box are:
- Length: 5 inches - 2 * 1 inch = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - 2 * 1 inch = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - 1 inch = 3 inches

Now, we calculate the volume of one inner box:
\[ \text{Volume of one box} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} = 3 \times 4 \times 3 = 36 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume is:

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, let's break down the hours he spent watching TV each day:

- Monday and Tuesday: 1 hour each day, so \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours.
- Thursday: 1 hour for a 1-hour episode and 0.5 hours (30 minutes) for a 30-minute show, so \(1 + 0.5 = 1.5\) hours.
- Friday: 2 hours for two 1-hour episodes, so \(2\) hours.

Now, let's sum up the hours watched from Monday to Friday:
\[2 \text{ (Monday and Tuesday)} + 1.5 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Friday)} = 5.5 \text{ hours}.\]

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. Therefore, the hours he watched on Wednesday is:
\[7 - 5.5 = 1.5 \text{ hours}.\]

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is:
\[1.5 \div 0.5 = 3.\]

So, the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday is 3.

"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry meant to bake as \( x \). According to the problem, he actually baked twice as many as he meant to, plus 15 more cookies. So, the number of cookies he actually baked is \( 2x + 15 \).

After baking, he drops 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \). We are given that he now has 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2x = 100 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 50 \]

So, Henry meant to bake 50 cookies. Since he actually baked twice as many as he meant to, plus 15 more, he baked \( 2 \times 50 + 15 = 115 \) cookies. However, the question asks for the number of cookies he baked last year, which is the number he meant to bake, \( x \).

Thus, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas without any cashback:

\[ \text{Cost per gallon} = \$3.00 \]
\[ \text{Number of gallons} = 10 \]
\[ \text{Total cost without cashback} = 3.00 \times 10 = \$30.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cashback received for 10 gallons:

\[ \text{Cashback per gallon} = \$0.20 \]
\[ \text{Total cashback} = 0.20 \times 10 = \$2.00 \]

Now, let's subtract the total cashback from the total cost to find the final amount after cashback:

\[ \text{Final amount} = \$30.00 - \$2.00 = \$28.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$28.00 \]"

"First, let's determine the speed at which Julia rows the boat. It takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Therefore, her speed is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes her to row the entire 64 seconds distance to the shore:

\[ \text{Time to row 64 seconds} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds/20 feet}} = \frac{64}{16} \times 20 = 4 \times 20 = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. To find out how much water the boat took on during the 80 feet row, we can set up a proportion:

\[ \text{Water taken on} = \left( \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 80 \text{ feet} = \frac{2 \times 80}{10} = \frac{160}{10} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how much time Rosie has left after running for 3 hours. Since she has a total of 7 hours available, the remaining time is:

\[ \text{Remaining Time} = 7 \, \text{hours} - 3 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{hours} \]

Now, we calculate the distance Rosie covers when she runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours.

\[ \text{Distance}_2 = 5 \, \text{mph} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, we add the distances from both parts of her run to find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours.

\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} = 50 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many letters were already stamped when Jennie began her work.

1. Jennie has a pile of 60 letters needing stamps.
2. She puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps. Therefore, the number of letters she stamps is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
   \]
3. After stamping, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. This means that the number of letters that were already stamped when Jennie began plus the 20 letters she stamped equals 30. Let's denote the number of letters that were already stamped when Jennie began as \( x \). Therefore, we have:
   \[
   x + 20 = 30
   \]
4. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 30 - 20 = 10
   \]

So, the number of letters that were already stamped when Jennie began is 10.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the hospital's profit from these visits, we need to calculate the revenue and the cost, and then find the difference between them.

First, let's calculate the total revenue from the patients:
- Each patient is seen for 24 minutes, which is 24/60 = 0.4 hours.
- The hospital charges $200 per hour to the patients.
- Therefore, the revenue per patient is $200 * 0.4 = $80.
- With 500 patients per day, the total revenue is $80 * 500 = $40,000.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the doctors' services:
- Each doctor is seen for 24 minutes, which is 0.4 hours.
- The doctors charge $150 per hour.
- Therefore, the cost per patient is $150 * 0.4 = $60.
- With 500 patients per day, the total cost is $60 * 500 = $30,000.

Finally, the profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
- Profit = $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

The hospital's profit from these visits is $10,000."

1. Determine how many miles Walt walked on Tuesday.
2. Calculate the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday.
3. Subtract the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday from the total miles walked from Monday to Wednesday to find the miles walked on Wednesday.

First, we know that Walt walked 4 miles on Monday. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he did on Monday. Therefore, the miles walked on Tuesday are:
\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday:
\[ 4 \text{ miles (Monday)} + 24 \text{ miles (Tuesday)} = 28 \text{ miles} \]

We know that the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. Therefore, the miles walked on Wednesday can be found by subtracting the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday from the total miles walked from Monday to Wednesday:
\[ 41 \text{ miles (Monday through Wednesday)} - 28 \text{ miles (Monday through Tuesday)} = 13 \text{ miles} \]

"Let's denote the number of queens as \( Q \), the number of baby bees as \( B \), and the number of worker bees as \( W \).

According to the problem:
1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so \( W = 2B \).
2. There are twice as many baby bees as queens, so \( B = 2Q \).

We also know the total number of bees is 700:
\[ W + B + Q = 700 \]

Substituting \( W = 2B \) and \( B = 2Q \) into the total bees equation:
\[ 2B + B + Q = 700 \]
\[ 3B + Q = 700 \]

Since \( B = 2Q \), we can substitute \( B \) with \( 2Q \) in the equation:
\[ 3(2Q) + Q = 700 \]
\[ 6Q + Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now, we can find \( B \) and \( W \):

"First, let's calculate the total cost of nonfood items before tax:

- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

Total cost of nonfood items = $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $15

Next, we calculate the tax on the nonfood items. The tax rate is 10%, so the tax amount is:

Tax amount = 10% of $15 = 0.10 * $15 = $1.50

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of nonfood items to get the final cost:

Final cost of nonfood items = $15 + $1.50 = $16.50

The cost of food items (milk, eggs, light bulbs, cups, and roach traps) is $15, and there is no tax on food items. Therefore, the total cost including tax is:

"To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of harvests John can have in a year.
2. Determine the total number of pineapples harvested based on the number of harvests.

First, since John harvests his pineapples every 3 months, we need to find out how many 3-month periods there are in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so:

\[ \text{Number of harvests in a year} = \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests} \]

Next, we know that John has 100 pineapples per hectare and he has 10 hectares of pineapple field. Therefore, the total number of pineapples per harvest is:

\[ \text{Total pineapples per harvest} = 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} \times 10 \text{ hectares} = 1000 \text{ pineapples} \]

Since John can harvest 4 times in a year, the total number of pineapples he can harvest in a year is:

"To determine how many bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours, let's break down the information given:

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of 30 bees return to the hive, which is 15 bees.
3. In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as those that left in the first 6 hours return, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.

Now, we need to calculate the number of bees that are in the hive at the end of the first 6 hours, before the last 6 hours. Initially, there are 0 bees in the hive. After 30 bees leave, there are 0 bees in the hive. Then, 15 bees return, so there are 15 bees in the hive. Finally, 60 bees return, so there are 15 + 60 = 75 bees in the hive at the start of the last 6 hours.

In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before returns to the hive. Since 30 bees left in the first 6 hours, all 30 bees that left will return in the last 6 hours.

Therefore, the number of bees that Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours is 30.

"Let's denote the initial number of french fries in the pack as \( x \).

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
4. After the pigeons, the number of fries left is \( x - 14 - 7 - 9 = x - 20 \).
5. The raccoon then ate two thirds of the remaining fries, so it ate \( \frac{2}{3}(x - 20) \) fries.
6. After the raccoon, the number of fries left is \( (x - 20) - \frac{2}{3}(x - 20) = \frac{1}{3}(x - 20) \).
7. Ants carried off a final french fry, leaving 5 fries behind. So, \( \frac{1}{3}(x - 20) - 1 = 5 \).

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[
\frac{1}{3}(x - 20) - 1 = 5

Adding the hours from both sets of days gives the total number of hours he spends on classes each week:
\[ 9 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours/week} \]

Since there are 16 weeks in the semester, the total number of hours he spends attending classes in one semester is:
\[ 17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 272 \]"
"First, let's convert all the lengths to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll use inches for this problem.

- Each roll is 4 inches long, and Bill bakes 300 rolls. So, the total length of the rolls is:
  \[
  300 \text{ rolls} \times 4 \text{ inches/roll} = 1200 \text{ inches}
  \]

- Each croissant is 6 inches long, and Bill bakes 120 croissants. So, the total length of the croissants is:
  \[
  120 \text{ croissants} \times 6 \text{ inches/croissant} = 720 \text{ inches}
  \]

- Each baguette is 2 feet long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is:
  \[
  2 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 24 \text{ inches}
  \]
  Bill bakes 60 baguettes, so the total length of the baguettes is:
  \[
  60 \text{ baguettes} \times 24 \text{ inches/baguette} = 1440 \text{ inches}
  \]

Now, we add up the total lengths of all the baked goods in inches:
\[
1200 \text{ inches} + 720 \text{ inches} + 1440 \text{ inches} = 3360 \text{ inches}
\]

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[
3360 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 280 \text{ feet}
\]

So, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is 280 feet."
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order to last for 2 months, we first need to calculate the total number of bananas required by all the apes in one month and then multiply that by 2.

- Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
- Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
- Baboons need 100 bananas per month.

So, the total number of bananas needed per month is:
\[ 200 \text{ (monkeys)} + 400 \text{ (gorillas)} + 100 \text{ (baboons)} = 700 \text{ bananas per month} \]

For 2 months, the total number of bananas needed is:
\[ 700 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 1400 \text{ bananas} \]

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order \(\boxed{1400}\) bananas to last for 2 months."
"To determine how far Blake and Kelly each run, we need to calculate the total distance each of them covers.

First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs:
- Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field.
- Each round trip is 200 yards (100 yards out and 100 yards back).
- Therefore, the total distance Blake runs is \(15 \times 200 = 3000\) yards.

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs:
- Kelly runs back and forth once to the 40-yard line and back, which is a total of 80 yards.
- She does this 34 times.
- Therefore, the total distance Kelly runs is \(34 \times 80 = 2720\) yards.

Now, we compare the distances:
- Blake runs 3000 yards.
- Kelly runs 2720 yards.

The difference in the distance they run is:
\[3000 - 2720 = 280\] yards.

The winner runs 280 yards farther than the loser. Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{280}
\]"
"To calculate the total amount Raphael spent, we need to multiply the quantity of each item by its respective cost and then sum these amounts.

For the pens:
4 pens * $1.5 per pen = $6

For the notebooks:
2 notebooks * $4 per notebook = $8

For the rim of bond paper:
1 rim of bond paper * $20 per rim = $20

Now, we add these amounts together:
$6 (pens) + $8 (notebooks) + $20 (bond paper) = $34

Therefore, the total amount Raphael spent is $34."
"Initially, Finn sees 11 tadpoles swimming in the pond. Then, 6 tadpoles come out of hiding, so the number of tadpoles Finn can see increases to 11 + 6. After that, 2 tadpoles hide under a rock, so the number of tadpoles Finn can see decreases by 2. Therefore, the calculation is:

11 + 6 - 2 = 15

The final numerical answer is 15."
"To find the water depth on Wednesday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the depth of the water on Tuesday.
2. Calculate the depth of the water on Wednesday based on the depth on Tuesday.

First, we know the depth of the water on Monday is 17 feet. On Tuesday, the depth increased by 7 feet. Therefore, the depth on Tuesday is:
\[ 17 + 7 = 24 \text{ feet} \]

Next, on Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. So, we calculate two thirds of 24 feet:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is:
\[ 16 \text{ feet} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 16 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of each type of fish caught by Locsin:

- Starfish: Anakin caught 10 starfish, so Locsin caught \(10 - 5 = 5\) starfish.
- Sea horses: Anakin caught 6 sea horses, so Locsin caught \(6 - 3 = 3\) sea horses.
- Clownfish: Anakin caught 3 clownfish, so Locsin caught \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin:

- Total starfish: \(10 + 5 = 15\)
- Total sea horses: \(6 + 3 = 9\)
- Total clownfish: \(3 + 5 = 8\)

Adding these together gives the total number of fish caught:

\[15 + 9 + 8 = 32\]

So, the final numerical answer is 32."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the price increase step by step over the 36 months. The price increases by 20% every two months. Let's break it down:

1. **Initial Price**: $20
2. **Price after 2 months**: The price increases by 20% of $20.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 20 \times \frac{20}{100} = 4
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 20 + 4 = 24
   \]
3. **Price after 4 months**: The price increases by 20% of $24.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 24 \times \frac{20}{100} = 4.8
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 24 + 4.8 = 28.8
   \]
4. **Price after 6 months**: The price increases by 20% of $28.8.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 28.8 \times \frac{20}{100} = 5.76
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 28.8 + 5.76 = 34.56
   \]
5. **Price after 8 months**: The price increases by 20% of $34.56.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 34.56 \times \frac{20}{100} = 6.912
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 34.56 + 6.912 = 41.472
   \]
6. **Price after 10 months**: The price increases by 20% of $41.472.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 41.472 \times \frac{20}{100} = 8.2944
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 41.472 + 8.2944 = 49.7664
   \]
7. **Price after 12 months**: The price increases by 20% of $49.7664.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 49.7664 \times \frac{20}{100} = 9.95328
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 49.7664 + 9.95328 = 59.71968
   \]

We can see that the price increases by 20% every two months. Since 36 months is equivalent to 18 two-month periods, we can generalize the price after 36 months as follows:

The price after \( n \) two-month periods is given by:
\[
P_n = 20 \times (1 + 0.20)^n
\]
For \( n = 18 \):
\[
P_{18} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}
\]

Now, we calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \):
\[
(1.20)^{18} \approx 10.488
\]
Thus,
\[
P_{18} = 20 \times 10.488 = 209.76
\]

Therefore, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is approximately:
\[
\boxed{209.76}
\]"
"First, let's determine the cost of one red car. According to the information given, one red car costs $4.

Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and an action figure costs $5, the cost of 3 action figures is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]
Therefore, the doll costs $15.

Now, we know the cost of one red car is $4, and the doll costs $15. We need to find the total cost of all the toys:
- Red cars: 5 cars at $4 each = \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \)
- Action figures: 3 figures at $5 each = \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \)
- Doll: $15

Adding these together gives the total cost of all the toys:
\[ 20 + 15 + 15 = 50 \]

So, the total value of all the toys is $50."
"First, we need to determine the missed income if Jackie does her taxes herself. She loses $35/hour for 3 fewer hours of freelance work. Therefore, the missed income is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Missed Income} = 3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105 \]

Next, we need to find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant instead of doing her taxes herself. The accountant charges $90, which is the amount she would lose by doing her own taxes. Therefore, the additional money she will have if she hires the accountant is:

\[ \text{Additional Money} = \$90 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$90 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the computer accessories Elvira bought:

- Screen: €157
- Keyboard and mouse: €74
- Scanner: €102
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Total cost of accessories = €157 + €74 + €102 + €74 + €102 = €509

Elvira's total budget is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost of the accessories from her budget:

Money left for clothing = €1500 - €509 = €991

So, the final numerical answer is €991."
"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit to make 15 Spanish flans, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs needed to make 15 flans.
   - Each flan requires 3 eggs.
   - Therefore, for 15 flans, the total number of eggs needed is \( 15 \times 3 = 45 \) eggs.

2. Determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit to collect 45 eggs.
   - Each babysitting session provides 9 eggs.
   - To find the number of babysitting sessions required, divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs provided per babysitting session: \( \frac{45}{9} = 5 \).

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit 5 times to collect enough eggs to make 15 Spanish flans.

The final numerical answer is:
5"
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So, \((S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28\).

First, we can simplify the second equation:
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now we substitute the first equation \( S = 2B \) into the simplified second equation:
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's current age \( B = 8 \), we can find Seth's current age using \( S = 2B \):
\[ S = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is currently 16 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 16 \]"
"To find out how much money Jimmy has, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the amount of money Ethel has as \( E \) and the amount of money Jimmy has as \( J \).

According to the problem, Ethel has $8, so \( E = 8 \).

The problem also states that Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has. This can be written as:
\[ J = 2E + 2 \]

Now, substituting the value of \( E \) into the equation:
\[ J = 2(8) + 2 \]
\[ J = 16 + 2 \]
\[ J = 18 \]

So, Jimmy has $18.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 18 \]"
"To calculate the total number of miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to consider his daily walking distance and the fact that he walks 10 miles on weekends.

- From Monday to Friday, he walks 20 miles each day. So, for 5 days, he walks \(20 \times 5 = 100\) miles.
- On Saturday and Sunday, he walks 10 miles each day. So, for 2 days, he walks \(10 \times 2 = 20\) miles.

Adding these together, the total number of miles he walks in a week is \(100 + 20 = 120\) miles.

The final numerical answer is 120."
"First, let's determine the cost of each item:
- The cost of the hat is $25.
- The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat, so it is \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.
- The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket. The average is calculated as \(\frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50\) dollars.

Now, to find the total cost of each uniform, we add the cost of the hat, the jacket, and the pants:
\[ 25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \]

So, the total cost of each uniform is $150.

\[
\boxed{150}

"To find the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to calculate the legs from each group of creatures separately and then sum them up.

For the spiders:
\[ 80 \text{ spiders} \times 8 \text{ legs per spider} = 640 \text{ legs} \]

For the insects:
\[ 90 \text{ insects} \times 6 \text{ legs per insect} = 540 \text{ legs} \]

For the rare mutant invertebrates:
\[ 3 \text{ invertebrates} \times 10 \text{ legs per invertebrate} = 30 \text{ legs} \]

Now, we add the legs from all the groups together:
\[ 640 \text{ legs} + 540 \text{ legs} + 30 \text{ legs} = 1210 \text{ legs} \]

So, the total number of legs Jake sees is:
\[ 1210 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

1. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, we can calculate the total age of the four birds:

\[
\text{Total age} = \text{Sally Two} + \text{Granny Red} + \text{Sally Four} + \text{Sally Thirtytwo} = 19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 51
\]

The total age of the four birds is 51."
"First, let's calculate the amount Jessica needs to pay each month if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum.

For the student loans:
Minimum payment = $300
50% more than minimum = $300 * 0.50 = $150
Total payment = $300 + $150 = $450

For the credit card:
Minimum payment = $200
50% more than minimum = $200 * 0.50 = $100
Total payment = $200 + $100 = $300

For the mortgage:
Minimum payment = $500
50% more than minimum = $500 * 0.50 = $250
Total payment = $500 + $250 = $750

Now, let's add up the monthly payments:
Total monthly payment = $450 + $300 + $750 = $1500

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the total monthly payment by 12:
Total annual payment = $1500 * 12 = $18000

The final numerical answer is $18000."
"To determine how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel and cut each potato and then multiply by the total number of potatoes.

First, let's calculate the time to peel and cut one potato:
- Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
- Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

Convert the time to peel one potato to seconds for easier calculation:
- 1.5 minutes = 1.5 * 60 seconds = 90 seconds

Now, add the time to peel and cut one potato:
- Total time for one potato = 90 seconds (peeling) + 5 seconds (cutting) = 95 seconds

Next, calculate the total time for 60 potatoes:
- Total time = 95 seconds/potato * 60 potatoes = 5700 seconds

Finally, convert the total time from seconds to minutes:
- 5700 seconds = 5700 / 60 minutes = 95 minutes

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

The final numerical answer is 95 minutes."
"First, let's determine the total revenue from selling lemonade. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, so the revenue per gallon is:
\[ 20 \text{ glasses/gallon} \times \$0.50/\text{glass} = \$10/\text{gallon} \]

Given that their profit is $25, we can use the profit formula to find the total cost. The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. Let's denote the total cost as \( C \). The total revenue is the number of gallons sold times the revenue per gallon. Since the profit is $25, we can write:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} \]
\[ \$25 = (\text{Number of gallons} \times \$10) - C \]

We need to find the total cost \( C \). To do this, we first need to determine the number of gallons sold. Let's denote the number of gallons sold as \( G \). Then the total revenue is:
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = G \times \$10 \]

Since the profit is $25, we can substitute the total revenue and solve for \( C \):
\[ \$25 = G \times \$10 - C \]
\[ C = G \times \$10 - \$25 \]

Next, we need to find the total cost \( C \). The total cost \( C \) is the sum of the cost of lemons and the cost of sugar. The cost of lemons is $3 per gallon and the cost of sugar is $2 per gallon. Therefore, the total cost per gallon is:
\[ \text{Total Cost per gallon} = \$3 + \$2 = \$5 \]

Since the total cost \( C \) is the total cost per gallon times the number of gallons sold, we have:
\[ C = G \times \$5 \]

Now we can set the two expressions for \( C \) equal to each other:
\[ G \times \$5 = G \times \$10 - \$25 \]

Solving for \( G \):
\[ G \times \$5 = G \times \$10 - \$25 \]
\[ G \times \$5 - G \times \$10 = -\$25 \]
\[ -G \times \$5 = -\$25 \]
\[ G \times \$5 = \$25 \]
\[ G = \frac{\$25}{\$5} \]
\[ G = 5 \]

Now that we know they sold 5 gallons, we can find the total cost \( C \):
\[ C = 5 \times \$5 = \$25 \]

The total cost \( C \) is the sum of the cost of lemons and the cost of sugar. Let \( L \) be the cost of lemons and \( S \) be the cost of sugar. We know:
\[ L + S = \$25 \]

The cost of lemons is $3 per gallon and the cost of sugar is $2 per gallon. Therefore:
\[ L = 5 \times \$3 = \$15 \]
\[ S = 5 \times \$2 = \$10 \]

So, the amount spent on lemons is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we first need to determine the number of Chinese participants. Given that there are 240 Asians in total and 80 of them are Japanese, the number of Chinese participants is:

\[ 240 - 80 = 160 \]

We know that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. Therefore, the number of girls on the Chinese team can be found by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants:

\[ 160 - 60 = 100 \]

So, the number of girls on the Chinese team is 100. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 100 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Zaid spends on rent, car fuel, and the remaining amount after these expenses.

Zaid's monthly salary is $6000.

1. Rent: \( \frac{1}{4} \) of his salary
\[ \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \]

2. Car fuel: \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his salary
\[ \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \]

3. Total spent on rent and car fuel
\[ \text{Total spent} = 1500 + 2000 = 3500 \]

4. Remaining amount after rent and car fuel
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 6000 - 3500 = 2500 \]

5. Donation to charity: half of the remaining amount
\[ \text{Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \]

6. Remaining amount after donation
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \]

7. Expenses for his daughter and wife
\[ \text{Total expenses} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

8. Remaining amount after expenses for daughter and wife
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 1250 - 900 = 350 \]

So, the final amount of money Zaid will still have after all these expenses and donations is $350."
"First, let's determine the number of crabs each person has:

- Bo has 40 crabs.
- Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has \(40 - 4 = 36\) crabs.
- Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has \(36 + 10 = 46\) crabs.

Now, let's calculate the total number of crabs the three have together:

\[ \text{Total crabs} = \text{Bo's crabs} + \text{Monic's crabs} + \text{Rani's crabs} \]
\[ \text{Total crabs} = 40 + 36 + 46 \]
\[ \text{Total crabs} = 122 \]

The final numerical answer is 122."
"To calculate Lloyd's total earnings for the first two weeks, we need to multiply the number of hours he tutored each week by his hourly rate and then add the totals together.

For the first week:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$10 \text{ per hour} = \$50 \]

For the second week:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times \$10 \text{ per hour} = \$80 \]

Adding the earnings from both weeks:
\[ \$50 + \$80 = \$130 \]

So, Lloyd earned a total of \$130 for the first two weeks."
"To determine the number of votes the loser received, we first need to calculate the number of votes the winner received. The winner got \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total votes, and the total number of votes cast was 80.

First, we calculate the number of votes the winner received:
\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80
\]

Perform the multiplication:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 3 \times 20 = 60
\]

So, the winner received 60 votes. Since the total number of votes cast was 80, the number of votes the loser received is:
\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20
\]

Thus, the number of votes the loser got is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of white carnations Sandra ordered as \( w \).

From the information given:
1. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, so the number of red roses is \( 4w \).
2. Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which are five times the number of white carnations, so \( 5w = 200 \).

First, we solve for \( w \):
\[ 5w = 200 \]
\[ w = \frac{200}{5} \]
\[ w = 40 \]

Now that we know \( w = 40 \), we can find the number of red roses:
\[ \text{Number of red roses} = 4w = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Mark's age two years ago:**
   - Jan's current age is 30.
   - Two years ago, Jan's age was \(30 - 2 = 28\).
   - Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time.
   - Half of Jan's age two years ago was \(\frac{28}{2} = 14\).
   - Therefore, Mark's age two years ago was \(14 + 5 = 19\).

2. **Determine Mark's current age:**
   - Since Mark was 19 two years ago, his current age is \(19 + 2 = 21\).

3. **Determine Jean's current age:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark.
   - Therefore, Jean's current age is \(21 + 2 = 23\).

The final numerical answer is 23."
"First, let's calculate the total time for the faster team to complete the race. Since each member of the faster team runs their leg in 55 seconds, the total time for the race is:

\[ 55 \text{ seconds/runner} \times 4 \text{ runners} = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time for the slower team to complete the race. The first runner takes 60 seconds, the second runner takes 57 seconds (3 seconds faster than the first), the third runner takes 54 seconds (3 seconds faster than the second), and the fourth runner takes 51 seconds (3 seconds faster than the third). The total time for the race is:

\[ 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, to find out how many seconds the faster team will win by, we subtract the total time of the faster team from the total time of the slower team:

\[ 222 \text{ seconds} - 220 \text{ seconds} = 2 \text{ seconds} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then compare them.

First, let's determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers on a six-sided die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Next, let's determine the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:
\[ P(\text{even on first roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also:
\[ P(\text{even on second roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of both events happening (rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll) is:
\[ P(\text{even on first roll and even on second roll}) = P(\text{even on first roll}) \times P(\text{even on second roll}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25 \]

Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by calculating the difference in probabilities and then converting that difference to a percentage.

The difference in probabilities is:
\[ 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 \]

To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.25 \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"If Jenna's mother picked 20 apples, and Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother, then Jenna picked:

\[ \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ apples} \]

Together, they picked:

\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ apples} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 30 \]"
"Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as \( r \).

From the information given:
- There are 3 cages of rats, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is \( 3r \times 6 = 18r \).
- There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \).
- There are 20 pieces of straw distributed among the rabbits.

The total number of pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents is the sum of the pieces of straw given to the rats, the hamsters, and the rabbits. According to the problem, this total is 160 pieces of straw. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 18r + 50 + 20 = 160 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 18r + 70 = 160 \]
\[ 18r = 160 - 70 \]
\[ 18r = 90 \]
\[ r = \frac{90}{18} \]
\[ r = 5 \]

So, the number of rats in each cage is \( 5 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"To calculate the amount Mandy should give Benedict after 3 months, we need to consider the initial amount and the monthly interest.

The initial amount Mandy owes is $100. The monthly interest rate is 2%, which can be expressed as a decimal: 0.02.

The interest for the first month is:
\[ 100 \times 0.02 = 2 \]

So, after the first month, the total amount Mandy owes is:
\[ 100 + 2 = 102 \]

For the second month, the interest is again 2% of $102:
\[ 102 \times 0.02 = 2.04 \]

So, after the second month, the total amount Mandy owes is:
\[ 102 + 2.04 = 104.04 \]

For the third month, the interest is again 2% of $104.04:
\[ 104.04 \times 0.02 = 2.0808 \]

So, after the third month, the total amount Mandy owes is:
\[ 104.04 + 2.0808 = 106.1208 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent (since currency is typically expressed to two decimal places), Mandy should give Benedict $106.12.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 106.12 \]"
"Let's denote the number of bags of wheat as \( n \).

The cost per bag includes the purchase price and the transportation cost, which is \( 20 + 2 = 22 \) dollars per bag.

The total cost for \( n \) bags is \( 22n \) dollars.

The selling price per bag is $30, so the total revenue from selling \( n \) bags is \( 30n \) dollars.

The trader made a total profit of $400, which means the total revenue minus the total cost equals $400. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 30n - 22n = 400 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 8n = 400 \]

To find \( n \), we divide both sides by 8:

\[ n = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 50 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food:

- The cost of the tickets is $20.25.
- The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, so it is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

Next, we add the cost of the food to the cost of the tickets to find the total cost of the tickets and food:

- Total cost of tickets and food = $20.25 + $15.75 = $36.00.

Now, we add the cost of the rides to the total cost of the tickets and food:

- The cost of the rides is $33 for each ride, and they went on 2 rides, so the total cost for the rides is $33 * 2 = $66.00.
- Total cost including rides = $36.00 + $66.00 = $102.00.

Since they agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:

- Each person's share = $102.00 / 3 = $34.00.

So, the final numerical answer is $34.00."

"To determine how many pounds of insects the flock of ten ducks needs per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of insects needed per day for one duck.
2. Multiply the daily amount needed for one duck by the number of ducks in the flock.

First, we know that the total amount of insects needed per week for one duck is 3.5 pounds. There are 7 days in a week, so the amount of insects needed per day for one duck is:
\[ \frac{3.5 \text{ pounds}}{7 \text{ days}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per day} \]

Next, since there are ten ducks in the flock, the total amount of insects needed per day for the flock is:
\[ 0.5 \text{ pounds per day per duck} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 5 \text{ pounds per day} \]

Therefore, the total amount of insects needed per day for the flock of ten ducks is:
\[ 5 \text{ pounds per day} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the net increase in trees each year.
2. Determine the number of trees after 10 years without considering the trees that die.
3. Calculate the number of trees that die after 10 years.
4. Subtract the number of dead trees from the total number of trees after 10 years.

**Step 1: Net increase in trees each year**
Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year.
Net increase = 10 - 2 = 8 trees per year.

**Step 2: Number of trees after 10 years without considering the trees that die**
Tom starts with 50 trees. Over 10 years, the number of trees increases by 8 trees each year.
Total increase in trees over 10 years = 8 trees/year * 10 years = 80 trees.
Total number of trees after 10 years = 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

**Step 3: Number of trees that die after 10 years**
30% of the trees die after 10 years.
Number of trees that die = 30% of 130 = 0.30 * 130 = 39 trees.

**Step 4: Number of trees left after 10 years**
Number of trees left = Total number of trees after 10 years - Number of trees that die.
Number of trees left = 130 - 39 = 91 trees.

The final numerical answer is:
91"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Placement on Friday:**
   - Sue's front yard starts with 18 pink plastic flamingos.

2. **Action on Saturday:**
   - The neighbors take back one third of the flamingos.
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
   - The neighbors take back 6 pink flamingos and paint them white.
   - The number of flamingos left on Sue's front yard is \( 18 - 6 = 12 \).
   - The neighbors then put the 6 white flamingos back out.

3. **Placement on Sunday:**
   - The neighbors add another 18 pink plastic flamingos.
   - The total number of flamingos on Sue's front yard is now \( 12 \text{ (remaining pink)} + 18 \text{ (new pink)} = 30 \).

4. **Counting the Flamingos:**
   - Pink flamingos: 18 (initial) + 18 (added on Sunday) = 30.
   - White flamingos: 6 (taken back and painted).

5. **Difference Calculation:**
   - The number of pink flamingos minus the number of white flamingos is \( 30 - 6 = 24 \).

Therefore, at noon on Sunday, there are 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.

"First, let's determine the cost of a pencil and an eraser combined. A pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30, so the combined cost is:

\[ 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50 \]

Since a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined, a pen costs $1.50.

Now, to find out how much 8 pens will cost, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8:

\[ 1.50 \times 8 = 12.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we first need to calculate the total amount of carrots that will be distributed to the 40 restaurants.

Each restaurant receives 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. Therefore, the total amount of carrots distributed is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds/restaurant} \times 40 \text{ restaurants} = 80 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of carrots available is 200 pounds. To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we subtract the total amount distributed from the total amount available:
\[ 200 \text{ pounds} - 80 \text{ pounds} = 120 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used is:

"To find the number of children in the city of Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

Total population = 23786
Number of men = 8417
Number of women = 9092

Number of children = Total population - (Number of men + Number of women)

Let's calculate the number of children:
Number of children = 23786 - (8417 + 9092)

First, add the number of men and women:
8417 + 9092 = 17509

Now, subtract this sum from the total population:
23786 - 17509 = 6277

Therefore, the number of children in Soda is 6277."
"To find out how many Pokemon cards Elaine has now, we need to calculate the number of cards she collected each month and then sum them up.

1. **First Month:**
   Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards. After a month, she collected three times that number.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ cards}
   \]
   So, after the first month, she has:
   \[
   20 + 60 = 80 \text{ cards}
   \]

2. **Second Month:**
   In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40 \text{ cards}
   \]
   So, after the second month, she has:
   \[
   80 + 40 = 120 \text{ cards}
   \]

3. **Third Month:**
   In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months.
   \[
   2 \times (60 + 40) = 2 \times 100 = 200 \text{ cards}

"First, let's determine how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher each week. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers and a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits:

\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher A} \]
\[ 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher B} \]

Next, we know that Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, the amount Mark earns from Publisher A each week is:

\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays:

\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10 \text{ cents/sentence} \]

Therefore, the amount Mark earns from Publisher B each week is:

\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

To find out how much Mark makes in a week in total, we add the earnings from both publishers:

\[ 2500 \text{ cents} + 5000 \text{ cents} = 7500 \text{ cents} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

Thus, the total number of liters of water Baldur gets every day is 55 liters."
"To calculate how much money John made that year after winning the award, we need to consider both the one-time monetary reward and the annual raise in his salary.

First, let's calculate the annual raise in his salary:
- John's current weekly salary is $2000.
- The raise is 5% of his weekly salary.
- Therefore, the annual raise is \(2000 \times 0.05 = 100\) dollars per week.
- Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the annual raise is \(100 \times 52 = 5200\) dollars.

Next, we add the one-time monetary reward to his annual salary:
- The one-time monetary reward is $5000.
- So, the total annual salary after the raise is \(2000 \times 52 + 5000 = 104000 + 5000 = 109000\) dollars.

   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 5 days.
   - Each sandwich uses 2 slices of cheese.
   - Total slices of cheese used for sandwiches = \(5 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 10 \text{ slices}\).

2. **Omelets for breakfast:**
   - Carl ate omelets 3 days in the week.
   - Each omelet uses 1 more slice of cheese than a sandwich, so each omelet uses \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices of cheese.
   - Total slices of cheese used for omelets = \(3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices}\).

3. **Macaroni and cheese dish:**

"To determine the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then sum them up.

First, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams. Since there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we need to find the weight of each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ grams} \]

With 80 candied apples, the total weight of the candied apples is:
\[ 80 \times 20 = 1600 \text{ grams} \]

So, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is \(\boxed{76}\)."
"First, let's break down the information given in the question:

- Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
- Each plate costs $6000.
- We need to find the total cost of buying each cup.

Let's start by calculating the total cost of half a dozen plates:
- Half a dozen plates mean 6 plates.
- Each plate costs $6000.
- Therefore, the total cost for 6 plates is \(6 \times 6000 = 36000\).

According to the question, the cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than this total cost:
- The cost of twenty dozen cups is \(36000 - 1200 = 34800\).

Now, we need to find the cost of one cup. Since twenty dozen cups mean \(20 \times 12 = 240\) cups, we can find the cost of one cup by dividing the total cost of twenty dozen cups by 240:
- The cost of one cup is \(\frac{34800}{240}\).

Let's calculate this value:
\[
\frac{34800}{240} = 145
\]

Therefore, the total cost of buying each cup is \(\boxed{145}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, let's determine how much money Sara earns from babysitting and mowing the lawn:
- Sara earns $5 each time she babysits, and she babysits 4 times, so she earns \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars from babysitting.
- Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, and we need to find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to afford the $70.

Let's denote the number of times Sara needs to mow the lawn as \(x\). The total amount of money Sara will have after mowing the lawn is the sum of the money she already has and the money she earns from mowing the lawn:
\[10 + 4x\]

We need this total to be at least $70 to afford the jacket and shoes:
\[10 + 4x \geq 70\]

Subtract 10 from both sides to isolate the term with \(x\):
\[4x \geq 60\]

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \(x\):
\[x \geq 15\]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn at least 15 times to afford the jacket and shoes. The final numerical answer is:
\[15\]"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \). According to the problem, the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs every day. Additionally, it is given that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which can be expressed as:

\[ w = r + 2 \]

The total number of eggs collected each day can be expressed as:

\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Now, substitute \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation:

\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 8r = 32 \]

Divide both sides by 8:

\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens. To verify, we can calculate the number of white chickens and the total eggs collected:

\[ w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \]
\[ 3r + 5w = 3(4) + 5(6) = 12 + 30 = 42 \]

The calculations confirm that the solution is correct. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

1. Determine the number of customers on the second day.
2. Calculate the total number of customers over the three days.
3. Find the number of customers on the third day by subtracting the total number of customers on the first and second days from the total number of customers over the three days.

First, we know that on the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than on the first day. Therefore, the number of customers on the second day is:
\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \]

Next, we know the total number of customers over the three days is 500. To find the number of customers on the third day, we subtract the number of customers on the first and second days from the total number of customers over the three days:
\[ 500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250 \]

So, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is:
\[ 250 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons.

From the problem, we know that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Since the pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
Simplifying this equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ B = 2S + 16 \]

Now, we know that the current amount of water in the big pool is four times the current amount of water in the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have two equations:
1. \( B = 2S + 16 \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

We can set these two equations equal to each other:
\[ 2S + 16 = 4S \]
Solving for \( S \):
\[ 16 = 2S \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool currently has 8 gallons of water. Let's verify this by finding the current amount of water in the big pool:
\[ B = 4S = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( 32 - 16 = 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( 8 - 16 = -8 \) gallons, which is not possible, so we need to recheck the consistency. The correct interpretation is that the big pool had \( 32 \) gallons and the small pool had \( 8 \) gallons, and the current amounts are consistent with the problem's conditions.

Thus, the amount of water in the small pool now is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to make her purchase, we first need to calculate the total cost of the pair of shoes and the matching belt.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

So, the total cost of the purchase is $352.00. Lori earns $8.00 per hour at her part-time job. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44.00 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 44 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She promised to return the original $2000 plus an additional 10% of that amount.

The additional amount is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she promised to return is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Janeth is paying $165 per month for 12 months. The total amount she will pay over 12 months is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she promised to return to find her remaining balance:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance by the end of 12 months will be:
\[ 220 \]"
"There are 4 roses in the vase. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, there are 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias. The total number of flowers in the vase is the sum of the roses and dahlias, which is 4 + 11 = 15.

The final numerical answer is 15."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack, and then find their average age in three years.

1. **Determine Harriet's current age:**
   Harriet is currently 21 years old.

2. **Determine Zack's current age:**
   Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, we can calculate Zack's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. **Determine Adrian's current age:**
   Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age:
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years old}
   \]

4. **Calculate their ages in three years:**
   - Harriet's age in three years: \(21 + 3 = 24\)
   - Zack's age in three years: \(42 + 3 = 45\)
   - Adrian's age in three years: \(63 + 3 = 66\)

5. **Calculate the average age of the three in three years:**
   \[
   \text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Harriet's age in three years} + \text{Zack's age in three years} + \text{Adrian's age in three years}}{3} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna, and then subtract the points scored by Naomi and Yuri from the total points.

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. So, Yuri's score is \(\frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44\) points.
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna's score is \(68 + 17 = 85\) points.

Now, we can calculate the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[68 + 44 + 85 = 197\]

The total points scored by all four students is 251. Therefore, the points scored by Jojo are:
\[251 - 197 = 54\]

So, Jojo scored \(\boxed{54}\) points."
"To determine the total time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles and the time spent on sudoku puzzles separately, and then sum these times.

First, we calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
- It takes Carmen 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles over the weekend.

\[
\text{Time spent on crossword puzzles} = 10 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 3 \text{ puzzles} = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the time spent on sudoku puzzles:
- It takes Carmen 5 minutes to finish one sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 sudoku puzzles over the weekend.

\[
\text{Time spent on sudoku puzzles} = 5 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 8 \text{ puzzles} = 40 \text{ minutes}

"Initially, the tank has 120 liters of water. Celine used 90 liters to water her garden, so the amount of water left in the tank is:

\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters} \]

Celine then collected rainwater that is twice the amount left in the tank. Since there were 30 liters left, the amount of rainwater collected is:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters} \]

Adding the collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank gives:

\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final amount of water in the tank is:

\[ 90 \text{ liters} \]"
"First, we need to determine the number of petunias Andy plants. Since he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, and he plants 90 geraniums, we can calculate the number of petunias as follows:

Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
Number of petunias = 90 - 40
Number of petunias = 50

Next, we calculate the total number of flowers by adding the number of geraniums and the number of petunias:

Total number of flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
Total number of flowers = 90 + 50
Total number of flowers = 140

So, the total number of flowers Andy plants is 140."
"To find the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years, we need to calculate the amount spent in the second year and then add it to the amount spent in the first year.

The amount spent on advertising in the first year is $15000.

The amount spent on advertising in the second year is a third of the first year's amount, which is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15000 = 5000\).

Adding the amounts from both years gives us the total amount spent:
\[ 15000 + 5000 = 20000 \]

So, the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20000."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Travel by Bus:**
   - Andrew takes 6 days to travel by bus from New Jersey to Rochester.

2. **Travel by Car:**
   - It takes half as many days to travel by car from New Jersey to Rochester.
   - Therefore, the travel time by car is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) days.

3. **Return Trip:**
   - Andrew plans to return from Rochester to New Jersey by car.
   - The travel time for the return trip by car is also 3 days.

4. **Total Travel Time:**
   - The total travel time for the round trip (New Jersey to Rochester by bus and back by car) is the sum of the travel times for each leg of the trip.
   - Total travel time = 6 days (bus) + 3 days (car) + 3 days (car) = 12 days.

"First, let's calculate the total number of cards James has after the changes:

- Initial fire type cards: 30
- Initial grass type cards: 20
- Initial water type cards: 40

After losing 8 water type cards:
- Water type cards left: 40 - 8 = 32

After buying 14 new grass type cards:
- Grass type cards now: 20 + 14 = 34

Now, the total number of cards James has is:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 34
- Water type: 32

The total number of cards is:
30 + 34 + 32 = 96

The number of water type cards left is 32. To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 = 0.3333 \times 100 = 33.33\% \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33%.

"First, let's calculate the cost of the base burrito and all the additional items Chad added:

- Base burrito: $6.50
- Extra meat: $2.00
- Extra cheese: $1.00
- Avocado: $1.00
- 2 sauces at $0.25 each: $0.25 * 2 = $0.50

Now, let's add these costs together:

$6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $11.00

Next, we add the extra $3.00 for the upgrade:

$11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00

Chad has a gift card worth $5.00, which he uses at checkout. So, we subtract the value of the gift card from the total:

$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

Therefore, Chad still owes $9.00."
"First, let's determine how many pieces Kalinda and her mom can place together per minute.

Kalinda places 4 pieces per minute.
Her mom places half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

Together, they can place \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces per minute.

The puzzle has 360 pieces. To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can place together per minute:

\[ \text{Time in minutes} = \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \text{Time in hours} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

"First, let's determine how many watermelons were ready for harvest after the first two months. Since 30% of the 120 watermelons were ready, we calculate:

\[ 120 \times 0.30 = 36 \]

So, Ashlyn took home 36 watermelons. This means the number of watermelons remaining after she took home the first batch is:

\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest two weeks later. Since 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready, we calculate:

\[ 84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 63 \]

This means 63 watermelons were ready for harvest two weeks later. Therefore, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:

\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

"First, let's calculate the cost of the cars before tax and registration fees. Each car costs $20,000, and Mark buys 12 cars.

\[ \text{Total cost of cars} = 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000 \]

Next, we calculate the tax on the cars. The tax rate is 10%.

\[ \text{Tax on cars} = 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000 \]

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of the cars to get the total cost before registration fees.

\[ \text{Total cost before registration} = 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000 \]

Then, we calculate the registration fees. Each car has a registration fee of $1,000, and Mark has 12 cars.

\[ \text{Total registration fees} = 12 \times 1,000 = 12,000 \]

Finally, we add the total registration fees to the total cost before registration fees to get the final amount Mark pays.

\[ \text{Total amount paid} = 264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how much Steve's girlfriend eats. Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, and Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, his girlfriend eats:

\[ \text{Steve's girlfriend's consumption} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ tomatoes per day} \]

Next, we calculate the total consumption per week. Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, so in a week (7 days), he eats:

\[ \text{Steve's weekly consumption} = 6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ tomatoes} \]

His girlfriend eats 3 tomatoes per day, so in a week, she eats:

\[ \text{Girlfriend's weekly consumption} = 3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Therefore, the total weekly consumption by both of them is:

\[ \text{Total weekly consumption} = 42 + 21 = 63 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Given that a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, the number of vines needed to produce 63 tomatoes per week is:

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the process Ram uses to make new pens from the empty ones. Ram can make one full pen by mixing the ink from five empty pens. This means that for every five empty pens, he gets one new full pen.

Ram initially buys 25 pens. Since he can make one new pen from five empty pens, we can determine how many new pens he can make from the 25 empty pens he has:

\[ \text{Number of new pens} = \frac{25}{5} = 5 \]

After making these 5 new pens, Ram will have used up 25 empty pens, and he will have 5 new full pens. Now, he has 5 new full pens, and he can continue the process with these 5 new pens. He can make one more pen from these 5 new pens:

\[ \text{Number of additional new pens} = \frac{5}{5} = 1 \]

After making this additional pen, he will have 1 new pen, and he will have used up the 5 empty pens he had. Now, he has 1 new pen, and he can continue the process with this 1 new pen. He can make one more pen from this 1 new pen:

\[ \text{Number of additional new pens} = \frac{1}{5} = 0 \text{ (since he only has 1 pen, he can't make another full pen)} \]

So, after the last step, he will have 1 new pen. Adding up all the pens he has:

- Initial 25 pens
- 5 new pens made from the first batch of 25 pens
- 1 new pen made from the last batch of 5 pens

Total pens = 25 (initial) + 5 (first batch) + 1 (last batch) = 31

Therefore, the total number of pens Ram gets is:

"First, let's determine the ages of Mary and Joan based on the information given:

1. Jessa's age is 20 years.
2. Joan is five years older than Jessa, so Joan's age is \(20 + 5 = 25\) years.
3. Mary is two years younger than Joan, so Mary's age is \(25 - 2 = 23\) years.

Now, we can find the sum of the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa:

\[ \text{Sum of ages} = \text{Jessa's age} + \text{Joan's age} + \text{Mary's age} = 20 + 25 + 23 \]

Let's calculate the sum:

\[ 20 + 25 + 23 = 68 \]

"First, let's calculate the number of students who went out through exit A. Since 30% of the students went out through exit A, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Students through exit A} = 1000 \times \frac{30}{100} = 300 \]

After students went through exit A, the remaining number of students is:

\[ \text{Remaining students} = 1000 - 300 = 700 \]

Next, we calculate the number of students who went out through exit B. According to the problem, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining students went out through exit B:

\[ \text{Students through exit B} = 700 \times \frac{3}{5} = 420 \]

The number of students who went out through exit C is the rest of the students after those who went through exits A and B. Therefore, we subtract the number of students who went through exits A and B from the total number of students:

\[ \text{Students through exit C} = 1000 - 300 - 420 = 280 \]

So, the number of students who went out through exit C is:

\[ \boxed{280} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's start by determining how many candies Robert has. We know that John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find out how many candies Robert has:

\[ \text{John's candies} = 2 \times \text{Robert's candies} \]
\[ 54 = 2 \times \text{Robert's candies} \]
\[ \text{Robert's candies} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Now that we know Robert has 27 candies, we can find out how many candies James has. We know that James has 6 more candies than Robert:

\[ \text{James's candies} = \text{Robert's candies} + 6 \]
\[ \text{James's candies} = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Next, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's candies} - \text{James's candies} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

So, John has 21 more candies than James. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many pen pals Mike has left after stopping being pen pals with 2 of them. Initially, he had 5 pen pals, so after stopping being pen pals with 2, he has:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals left} \]

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each pen pal sends:

\[ 2 \text{ letters/week} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 10 \text{ pages/week} \]

Since there are 3 pen pals, the total number of pages sent by all pen pals in a week is:

\[ 3 \text{ pen pals} \times 10 \text{ pages/pen pal/week} = 30 \text{ pages/week} \]

Mike responds in kind, so he also writes 30 pages a week. Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. Therefore, the time he spends writing 30 pages is:

\[ 30 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin initially had 24 fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin had \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Now Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin as \(x\). After receiving \(x\) fries from Ginger, Griffin had \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, so Colby took \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. After Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries left.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27

- Both aquariums have the same number of fish.

First, calculate the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums:
\[ \text{Difference in snails} = 32 - 4 = 28 \]

According to the problem, this difference is twice the number of fish in both aquariums:
\[ 28 = 2 \times (2F) \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]

Now, solve for \( F \):
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} = 7 \]

Therefore, the number of fish in each aquarium is \( 7 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 7 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist spends on her makeup over the 5 weeks.

She requires 6 hours of makeup each day and needs it done 4 times a week. So, the makeup required per week is:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ hours/week} \]

Over 5 weeks, the total hours required are:
\[ 24 \text{ hours/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ hours} \]

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 120 \text{ hours} \times \$250/\text{hour} = \$30,000 \]

After the movie is done, she gives Jean a 10% discount. The discount amount is:
\[ 10\% \times \$30,000 = 0.10 \times \$30,000 = \$3,000 \]

Therefore, the final amount Jean pays after the discount is:
\[ \$30,000 - \$3,000 = \$27,000 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$27,000 \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total amount Isabelle spent on the party supplies. We do this by adding up all the individual expenses:

\[
12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22 = 96
\]

Isabelle spent a total of $96 on the party supplies. Since she split the cost evenly with her two parents, the total cost is divided among three people. To find out how much each person paid, we divide the total cost by 3:

\[ 4 \text{ bags} \times 50 \text{ pounds per bag} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total cost. A pound of onions costs $1.50, so for 200 pounds, the cost is:

\[ 200 \text{ pounds} \times 1.50 \text{ dollars per pound} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the chef spent \(\boxed{300}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine how many cookies Sue's sister ate each day.

On Monday, her sister ate 5 cookies.

On Tuesday, her sister ate 13 cookies.

Next, we calculate how many cookies Sue ate each day based on the information given.

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Therefore, Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies on Monday.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Therefore, Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies on Tuesday.

Now, we calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate over the two days.

Sue's total cookies:
- Monday: 20 cookies
- Tuesday: 26 cookies
- Total: \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies

Her sister's total cookies:
- Monday: 5 cookies
- Tuesday: 13 cookies
- Total: \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies

Each cookie has 200 calories. Therefore, we calculate the total calories consumed by each.

Sue's total calories:
- \(46 \text{ cookies} \times 200 \text{ calories/cookie} = 9200 \text{ calories}\)

Her sister's total calories:
- \(18 \text{ cookies} \times 200 \text{ calories/cookie} = 3600 \text{ calories}\)

Finally, we find the difference in calories consumed between Sue and her sister.

Difference in calories:
- \(9200 \text{ calories} - 3600 \text{ calories} = 5600 \text{ calories}\)

The final numerical answer is:
5600"
"First, let's determine the total number of students in the school. Since each class has 20 students and there are 3 classes, the total number of students is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

Given that the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the number of boys and girls in the school is:
\[ \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ boys and } 30 \text{ girls} \]

For the first class, there are 15 girls. Since each class has 20 students, the number of boys in the first class is:
\[ 20 - 15 = 5 \text{ boys} \]

For the second class, there are 12 girls. Similarly, the number of boys in the second class is:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ boys} \]

Now, we need to find the number of boys in the third class. The total number of boys in the school is 30. The number of boys in the first and second classes is 5 and 8, respectively. Therefore, the number of boys in the third class is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Previous Night's Kill:**
   - Wolves: 10
   - Cougars: 15

2. **Today's Kill:**
   - Let the number of cougars killed today be \( c \).
   - According to the problem, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, so the number of wolves killed today is \( 3c \).
   - Also, Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, so the number of cougars killed today is \( 15 - 3 = 12 \).

3. **Calculating Today's Wolves:**
   - Since today's number of cougars is 12, the number of wolves killed today is \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \).

4. **Total Animals Killed:**
   - Wolves killed in total: \( 10 \text{ (previous night)} + 36 \text{ (today)} = 46 \)
   - Cougars killed in total: \( 15 \text{ (previous night)} + 12 \text{ (today)} = 27 \)

5. **Final Total:**

"First, let's determine how many times Anne went down the water slide. Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Anne's rides} = \text{Mitchel's rides} - (\text{Mitchel's rides} \times 0.30) \]
\[ \text{Anne's rides} = 30 - (30 \times 0.30) \]
\[ \text{Anne's rides} = 30 - 9 \]
\[ \text{Anne's rides} = 21 \]

Next, we need to find out how many times Robert went down the water slide. Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne:

\[ \text{Robert's rides} = \text{Anne's rides} \times 4 \]
\[ \text{Robert's rides} = 21 \times 4 \]
\[ \text{Robert's rides} = 84 \]

So, Robert went down the water slide 84 times. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the total number of cows after Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows. Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, which totals:

\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows/stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Mr. Sylas then buys 40 more cows, so the total number of cows becomes:

\[ 200 \text{ cows} + 40 \text{ cows} = 240 \text{ cows} \]

Next, Mr. Sylas divides these 40 new cows equally among the 20 stalls. Each stall will get:

\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows/stall} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. Since each stall has 2 cows, 8 stalls will have:

   100 \text{ pennies} \times 0.01 \text{ dollars/penny} = 1 \text{ dollar}
   \]

2. **Nickels**: Each nickel is worth $0.05. Brady has 40 nickels.
   \[
   40 \text{ nickels} \times 0.05 \text{ dollars/nickel} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Dimes**: Each dime is worth $0.10. Brady has 20 dimes.

"First, we need to determine the total length of the redwood tree in feet, which is given as 200 feet.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the entire redwood tree before any damage. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can find the total weight by dividing the total length of the tree by the length of each section and then multiplying by the weight of each section.

\[
\text{Total weight of the tree} = \left(\frac{\text{Total length of the tree}}{\text{Length of each section}}\right) \times \text{Weight of each section}
\]

\[
\text{Total weight of the tree} = \left(\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}}\right) \times 400 \text{ pounds/section}
\]

\[
\text{Total weight of the tree} = 20 \times 400 = 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to account for the fact that termites ate 30% of the tree's wood. This means that 70% of the tree remains. We calculate the remaining weight as follows:

\[
\text{Remaining weight} = \text{Total weight of the tree} \times (1 - \text{Percentage eaten})
\]

\[
\text{Remaining weight} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \times (1 - 0.30)
\]

\[
\text{Remaining weight} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70

"Let's denote the number of apples Jamal has as \( J_a \) and the number of bananas Jamal has as \( J_b \).

From the information given:
1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, so if Andrea has 52 apples, then Jamal has \( 52 - 8 = 44 \) apples.
2. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so \( J_b = J_a + 4 \).
3. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so if Jamal has \( J_b \) bananas, then Andrea has \( \frac{J_b}{2} \) bananas. Since Andrea has 52 apples, we can use this to find the number of bananas Jamal has.

First, we know Jamal has 44 apples, so:
\[ J_b = 44 + 4 = 48 \]
This means Jamal has 48 bananas.

Now, we can find out how many bananas Andrea has:
\[ \text{Andrea's bananas} = \frac{J_b}{2} = \frac{48}{2} = 24 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits:
- Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas, so Andrea has \( 52 + 24 = 76 \) fruits.
- Jamal has 44 apples and 48 bananas, so Jamal has \( 44 + 48 = 92 \) fruits.

The total number of fruits is:
\[ 76 + 92 = 168 \]

"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we first need to calculate how many pennies are in two thirds of the total pennies.

Given that there are 9,300 pennies in the cup, we calculate two thirds of 9,300 as follows:

\[
\text{Number of pennies in the stack} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9300
\]

Let's perform the multiplication:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9300 = \frac{2 \times 9300}{3} = \frac{18600}{3} = 6200
\]

So, there are 6,200 pennies in the stack.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, the total dollar amount in the stack is:

"First, let's calculate the total price of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

The selling price of the house is $350,000.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price:
\[ \text{Brokerage fee} = 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500 \]

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price:
\[ \text{Transfer fee} = 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000 \]

Now, let's add the brokerage fee and the transfer fee to the selling price to get the total price of the house:
\[ \text{Total price} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500 \]

Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. To find out how much more the total price of the house is than her budget, we subtract her budget from the total price:
\[ \text{Difference} = 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500 \]

So, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 9500 \]"
"First, let's calculate the transfer fees. The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Transfer Fees} = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000 \]

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee. The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000 \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount paid for the transfer fees and the brokerage fee.

Mr. Tan also paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount of the house. To find the net proceeds, we subtract the total fees and the loan amount from the selling price.

\[ \text{Net Proceeds} = 400,000 - 32,000 - 250,000 = 118,000 \]

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is $118,000."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes for the oil to heat up to 400 degrees. We know it takes 20 minutes to heat the oil to 300 degrees, and it then takes 40% longer to heat it to 400 degrees.

40% of 20 minutes is:
\[ 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the additional time needed to heat the oil to 400 degrees is 8 minutes. Therefore, the total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that it takes 5 minutes less time to cook the chicken than it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees. So, the cooking time is:
\[ 28 - 5 = 23 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees and the time it took to cook the chicken:
\[ 28 + 23 = 51 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"To determine the total number of windows in John's houses, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum the results.

1. **Windows in Bedrooms:**
   - Each house has 3 bedrooms.
   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.
   - Therefore, the number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is \(3 \text{ bedrooms} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows}\).
   - Since John has 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms of both houses is \(6 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 12 \text{ windows}\).

2. **Additional Windows:**
   - Each house has an additional 4 windows not connected to bedrooms.
   - Therefore, the total number of additional windows in one house is 4.
   - For both houses, the total number of additional windows is \(4 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 8 \text{ windows}\).

3. **Total Windows:**
   - Adding the windows from the bedrooms and the additional windows gives us the total number of windows.

"First, let's determine the number of stitches for each part of the sweater:

- The collar takes a tenth of the stitches for the body of the sweater. Since the body takes 900 stitches, the collar takes \( \frac{900}{10} = 90 \) stitches.
- The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar. Since the collar takes 90 stitches, the rosette takes \( 90 \times 2 = 180 \) stitches.

Now, let's calculate the total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette:
- Collar: 90 stitches
- Rosette: 180 stitches
- Total for collar and rosette: \( 90 + 180 = 270 \) stitches

The total number of stitches for the whole sweater is 1800. Therefore, the number of stitches used for the body and the sleeves is:
- Body: 900 stitches
- Total for body and sleeves: \( 1800 - 270 = 1530 \) stitches

Since there are two sleeves, we need to find out how many stitches each sleeve takes. Let's denote the number of stitches for each sleeve as \( x \). Therefore, the total number of stitches for the two sleeves is \( 2x \). We can set up the following equation:
\[ 900 + 2x = 1530 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 2x = 1530 - 900 \]
\[ 2x = 630 \]
\[ x = \frac{630}{2} \]
\[ x = 315 \]

So, each sleeve takes 315 stitches. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{315} \]"

Next, we find out how many cards remained after removing the cards with the letter A:

\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 80 - 32 = 48 \]

Then, we calculate how many of these remaining cards had the letter B on them. Since \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the remaining cards had the letter B, we have:

\[ \text{Cards with letter B} = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]

Now, we find out how many cards remained after removing the cards with the letter B:

\[ \text{Remaining cards after B} = 48 - 24 = 24 \]

Next, we calculate how many of these remaining cards had the letter C on them. Since \( \frac{5}{8} \) of the remaining cards had the letter C, we have:

\[ \text{Cards with letter C} = \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \]

Finally, we find out how many cards remained after removing the cards with the letter C:

\[ \text{Remaining cards after C} = 24 - 15 = 9 \]

These remaining cards had the letter D on them. Therefore, the number of cards that had the letter D on them is:

\[ \text{Cards with letter D} = 9 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 9 \]"
"To determine the total time Matthew will take to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we need to calculate the time for each type of hole separately and then sum them up.

First, calculate the time for the small holes:
- Time to dig one small hole = 3 minutes
- Number of small holes = 30
- Total time for small holes = 3 minutes/hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes

Next, calculate the time for the large holes:
- Time to dig one large hole = 10 minutes
- Number of large holes = 15
- Total time for large holes = 10 minutes/hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes

Now, sum the total time for both types of holes:
- Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

Finally, convert the total time from minutes to hours:
- Total time in hours = 240 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours

The final numerical answer is 4 hours."
"To determine the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we can start by defining their current ages as \( M \) and \( C \) respectively. According to the problem, the sum of their current ages is 20, which can be written as:

\[ M + C = 20 \]

In 10 years, Mico's age will be \( M + 10 \) and Marco's age will be \( C + 10 \). The sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

\[ (M + 10) + (C + 10) \]

Simplifying the expression, we get:

\[ M + C + 10 + 10 = M + C + 20 \]

Since we know from the problem statement that \( M + C = 20 \), we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[ 20 + 20 = 40 \]

Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

\[ 40 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 40 \]"
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, which translates to \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. This can be written as \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

First, we substitute the expression for \( R \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Next, we expand and simplify the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old. To verify, we can find Ruby's current age:
\[ R = 6S = 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

In 9 years, Sam will be \( 6 + 9 = 15 \) years old, and Ruby will be \( 36 + 9 = 45 \) years old. Checking the condition that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
\[ 45 = 3 \times 15 \]
This is true, confirming our solution.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, we calculate the cost of the popsicles. Peter bought 20 popsicles at $0.25 each, so the total cost for the popsicles is:
\[ 20 \times 0.25 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the ice cream bars. Peter bought 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each, so the total cost for the ice cream bars is:
\[ 4 \times 0.50 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the total amount Peter paid, we add the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars:
\[ 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Peter paid is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of spots a mamba has. Since a cobra has 70 spots and a mamba has half as many spots as a cobra, a mamba has:

\[ \text{Spots per mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and all the mambas. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, so the total number of spots for the cobras is:

\[ \text{Total spots for cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots, so the total number of spots for the mambas is:

\[ \text{Total spots for mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Now, we find the combined total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas:

\[ \text{Total spots combined} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of this combined total:

\[ \text{Half the total spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 2450 \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of people who will be eating the pizza.

- There are 12 team members.
- There are 3 coaches.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so \(12 \text{ team members} \times 2 \text{ guests/team member} = 24 \text{ guests}\).

Adding these together, the total number of people is:
\[ 12 \text{ team members} + 3 \text{ coaches} + 24 \text{ guests} = 39 \text{ people} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Each pizza serves 3 people, so we divide the total number of people by the number of people each pizza can serve:
\[ \frac{39 \text{ people}}{3 \text{ people/pizza}} = 13 \text{ pizzas} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Each pizza costs $15, so:
\[ 13 \text{ pizzas} \times 15 \text{ dollars/pizza} = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Maddy will spend \(\boxed{195}\) dollars."
"To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to calculate the total length used by the topaz gemstones and then find out how much space is left for the sterling silver beads.

1. **Calculate the total length used by the topaz gemstones:**
   - Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long.
   - Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace.
   - Therefore, the total length used by the topaz gemstones is:
     \[
     8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches}
     \]

2. **Calculate the remaining length for the sterling silver beads:**
   - The total length of the necklace is 25 inches.
   - The length used by the topaz gemstones is 8 inches.
   - Therefore, the remaining length for the sterling silver beads is:
     \[
     25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of sterling silver beads:**
   - Each sterling silver bead is 0.25 inches long.
   - The remaining length for the sterling silver beads is 17 inches.
   - Therefore, the number of sterling silver beads is:
     \[
     \frac{17 \text{ inches}}{0.25 \text{ inches/bead}} = 68 \text{ beads}
     \]

Thus, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace. The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot altogether, we need to calculate the number of stories each wrote in both weeks and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of stories each wrote in the second week:
- Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week and doubled that in the second week, so she wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories in the second week.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week and doubled that in the second week, so he wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories in the second week.
- Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week and doubled that in the second week, so she wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories in the second week.

Next, we sum up the total number of stories written by each of them over the two weeks:
- Alani wrote \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories in total.
- Braylen wrote \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories in total.
- Margot wrote \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories in total.

Finally, we add up the total number of stories written by all three:
\[60 + 120 + 180 = 360\]

So, the total number of stories they wrote altogether is \(\boxed{360}\)."
"First, we need to determine the current age of Ann's brother. Since Ann is 9 years old and her brother is twice her age, we can calculate her brother's age as follows:

\[ \text{Brother's current age} = 2 \times \text{Ann's age} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we need to find out how old her brother will be in 3 years. We do this by adding 3 years to his current age:

\[ \text{Brother's age in 3 years} = \text{Brother's current age} + 3 = 18 + 3 = 21 \]

So, Ann's brother will be 21 years old in 3 years. The final numerical answer is:

"Kelly has 5 quarters, and since each quarter is worth 25 cents, the total value of the quarters is:
\[ 5 \times 25 = 125 \text{ cents} \]

She also has 2 dimes, and since each dime is worth 10 cents, the total value of the dimes is:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ cents} \]

The total amount of money Kelly has is the sum of the value of the quarters and the dimes:
\[ 125 + 20 = 145 \text{ cents} \]

If she buys a can of pop for 55 cents, the amount of money she will have left is:
\[ 145 - 55 = 90 \text{ cents} \]

"To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we first need to calculate the total number of stars accounted for by the rows of 8 and 6 stars, and then subtract this from the total number of stars to find the number of 5-star rows.

The total number of stars on the flag is 76. There are three rows of 8 stars and two rows of 6 stars. Let's calculate the number of stars in these rows:

- Three rows of 8 stars: \(3 \times 8 = 24\)
- Two rows of 6 stars: \(2 \times 6 = 12\)

Adding these together gives the total number of stars in the rows of 8 and 6 stars:

\[24 + 12 = 36\]

Now, we subtract the number of stars in the rows of 8 and 6 stars from the total number of stars to find the number of stars in the rows of 5 stars:

\[76 - 36 = 40\]

Since each row of 5 stars contains 5 stars, we divide the number of 5-star rows by 5:

\[40 \div 5 = 8\]

Therefore, the number of rows of 5 stars is 8.

The final numerical answer is:
8"
"First, we need to calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight of 80 flagstones is:

\[ 80 \times 75 = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how many trucks are required to transport 6000 pounds, given that each truck can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds. We do this by dividing the total weight by the capacity of one truck:

\[ \frac{6000}{2000} = 3 \]

Since the result is a whole number, we do not need to round up. Therefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, we can calculate the speed of the slow lane car as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of slow lane car} = \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it took the car in the fast lane to travel 480 miles. We can use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the fast lane:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{fast lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at a constant speed of 30 miles/hour and it needs to cover the same distance of 480 miles, we can calculate the time it took for the slow lane car to cover the distance:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{slow lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

\[ 16 \text{ hours} \]"
"First, let's determine how many medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, we can calculate the number of medals Izzy has as follows:

\[ \text{Medals Izzy has} = \text{Medals Ali has} - 5 = 22 - 5 = 17 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:

\[ \text{Total medals Ali and Izzy have} = \text{Medals Ali has} + \text{Medals Izzy has} = 22 + 17 = 39 \]

According to the problem, the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out. This means that the total number of medals given out is 10 times the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have:

\[ \text{Total medals given out} = 10 \times \text{Total medals Ali and Izzy have} = 10 \times 39 = 390 \]

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is:

\[ \boxed{390} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available:

- Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars.
- There are 8 packets.

So, the total number of chocolate bars is:
\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars/packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Next, let's determine how many chocolate bars the adults will get:

- There are 4 adults.
- Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars.

So, the total number of chocolate bars for the adults is:
\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars/adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, we can find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children:

\[ 40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

There are 8 children, and we need to distribute the remaining 16 chocolate bars equally among them:

\[ \frac{16 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars/child} \]

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the total time Susan works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total time in minutes is:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Susan takes a 30-minute break, so the actual time she spends working is:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} - 30 \text{ minutes} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how much money Susan earns in 150 minutes. She earns $5 every 10 minutes. To find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes, we divide 150 by 10:

\[ 150 \text{ minutes} \div 10 \text{ minutes/interval} = 15 \text{ intervals} \]

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, the total amount of money she earns is:

\[ 15 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ dollars/interval} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 75 \]"
"First, let's determine the initial points for each player:

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Next, we check if any of the players get an extra point in the fourth round. According to the rules, a player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points.

- Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so Mike gets an extra point.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so Jim does not get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so Tony gets an extra point.

Now, we add the extra points to their initial points:

- Mike's new total is \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
- Jim's new total remains \(18\) points.
- Tony's new total is \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

Finally, we calculate the total points for all three players:

\[22 + 18 + 43 = 83\]

So, the total number of points all three players have after the extra points had been distributed is 83."

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day by the household.
2. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week by the household.
3. Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

First, let's calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day by the household. Since each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal and there are 5 members, and they eat rice at lunch and dinner, the total consumption per day is:
\[ 5 \text{ people} \times 0.2 \text{ kg/meal/person} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 2 \text{ kg/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week:
\[ 2 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ kg/week} \]

Now, we determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last:

"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we first need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week.

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he did not sell any bread on those days. Over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday), he sold 20 crates. From Tuesday to Thursday, he sold 15 crates on Tuesday, 12 crates on Wednesday, and 18 crates on Thursday. Let's add these up:

\[
15 + 12 + 18 = 45
\]

Now, we add the crates sold over the weekend to the crates sold from Tuesday to Thursday:

\[
45 + 20 = 65
\]

Sam's target for the week was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off by, we subtract the number of crates he sold from his target:

"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the folding process and how the pages are printed.

1. **Folding the Paper**: When a piece of paper is folded vertically, it creates two layers. This means that each piece of paper can be used to print two pages.
2. **Printing Layout**: In the given layout, page 1 is printed on the left back, page 2 on the left front, page 32 on the right back, and page 31 on the right front. This means that each piece of paper is used to print two pages, one on each side of the fold.

Since the tabloid is 32 pages long, we can calculate the number of pieces of paper needed as follows:
- Each piece of paper prints 2 pages.
- For 32 pages, we need \( \frac{32}{2} = 16 \) pieces of paper.

Therefore, the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid is 16.

"To determine the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of books sold in the current year:**
   - There are currently 50 unsold books.
   - The total number of books is 250.
   - Therefore, the number of books sold in the current year is:
     \[
     250 - 50 = 200 \text{ books}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of books sold in the first year:**
   - Elise sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year.
   - The number of books sold in the current year is 200.
   - Therefore, the number of books sold in the first year is:
     \[
     2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ books}
     \]

3. **Verify the total number of books sold over the three years:**
   - The total number of books sold in the first year is 400.
   - The number of books sold in the current year is 200.
   - The number of books sold in the second year is 45.
   - The total number of books sold over the three years is:
     \[
     400 + 200 + 45 = 645 \text{ books}
     \]
   - However, the total number of books is 250, so there seems to be a discrepancy. Given the problem constraints, we should assume the total number of books sold is 250, and the unsold books are 50, which means the total sold is indeed 200.

4. **Calculate the total amount of money earned in the second year:**
   - Each book sells for $20.
   - The number of books sold in the second year is 45.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money earned in the second year is:

- Watson works 10 hours a day.
- He earns $10 per hour.

\[ \text{Daily earnings} = 10 \, \text{hours/day} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$100/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate his weekly earnings:
- Watson works 5 days a week.
- He earns $100 per day.

\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 5 \, \text{days/week} \times \$100/\text{day} = \$500/\text{week} \]

Since Watson received a $300 bonus each week if the company performed well, his total weekly earnings when the company performed well are:

\[ \text{Total weekly earnings} = \$500 + \$300 = \$800/\text{week} \]

Now, let's determine the number of weeks in April:
- April has 30 days.

Since Watson works 5 days a week, we can calculate the number of weeks in April:

\[ \text{Number of weeks in April} = \frac{30 \, \text{days}}{5 \, \text{days/week}} = 6 \, \text{weeks} \]

Finally, we calculate Watson's total earnings for the month of April:

\[ \text{Total earnings for April} = 6 \, \text{weeks} \times \$800/\text{week} = \$4800 \]

So, the total amount of money Watson made in April if the company performed very well for the whole month is:

\[ \$4800 \]"
"To determine how many people John lost to in the arm wrestling matches, we first need to calculate how many people he beat and then subtract that number from the total number of people he competed against.

John beats 80% of the 20 people he arm wrestles. To find out how many people he beats, we calculate 80% of 20:

\[ 0.80 \times 20 = 16 \]

This means John beats 16 people. Since he competed against 20 people in total, the number of people he loses to is:

\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, the number of people John lost to is 4."
"First, let's determine how many loaves of bread are sold in the morning. Since two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning, we calculate:

\[
\text{Morning sales} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
\]

Next, we find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales:

\[
\text{Loaves left after morning} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
\]

In the afternoon and evening, half of the remaining loaves are sold equally. Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening combined is:

\[
\text{Afternoon and evening sales combined} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
\]

Since the loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[
\text{Afternoon sales} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ loaves}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{5}
\]"
"First, we need to determine how much weight Joey loses in one week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so the weight loss per week is:

\[ \text{Weight loss per week for Joey} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in 1 week, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds. Therefore, to lose the same amount of weight (2 pounds) that Joey loses in 1 week, Sandy will take:

\[ \text{Number of weeks for Sandy} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the savings on the ice cream. The original price of one tub of ice cream is $13, and it is now sold at $11. The discount per tub of ice cream is:

\[ 13 - 11 = 2 \]

So, the savings on one tub of ice cream is $2. Therefore, the savings on two tubs of ice cream would be:

\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \]

Next, let's calculate the savings on the milk. The discount on one packet of milk is $0.5. Therefore, the savings on four packets of milk would be:

\[ 0.5 \times 4 = 2 \]

Now, we add the savings from the ice cream and the milk to find the total savings:

\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \]

So, the total amount saved if you buy 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine the number of new limbs Helena's serum will cause a person to grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate how many times the person grows an extra arm and an extra leg within this period.

First, let's calculate the number of extra arms:
- The person grows an extra arm every 3 days.
- In 15 days, the number of times an extra arm is grown is \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \).

Next, let's calculate the number of extra legs:
- The person grows an extra leg every 5 days.
- In 15 days, the number of times an extra leg is grown is \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \).

Since the growth of arms and legs are independent events, we add the number of extra arms and extra legs to find the total number of new limbs:
- Total new limbs = Number of extra arms + Number of extra legs
- Total new limbs = 5 + 3 = 8

Therefore, after fifteen days, Helena’s serum will cause a person to grow 8 new limbs."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
\[ 6 \text{ suits} \times \$100 \text{ per suit} = \$600 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
\[ 3 \text{ suitcases} \times \$50 \text{ per suitcase} = \$150 \]

Now, let's determine the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit:
\[ 5 \times \$100 + \$700 = \$500 + \$700 = \$1200 \]

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[ \$600 \text{ (suits)} + \$150 \text{ (suitcases)} + \$1200 \text{ (flight ticket)} = \$2050 \]

The total amount Theo has for the trip is $6000. He wants to save $2000, so the amount he can spend on the trip is:
\[ \$6000 - \$2000 = \$4000 \]

To find out how much he can spend on gifts, we subtract the total costs from the amount he can spend:
\[ \$4000 - \$2050 = \$1950 \]

Therefore, the amount Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa is:
\[ \$1950 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 1950 \]"
"First, let's determine the daily egg consumption for the family.

- Three people eat 3 eggs each day: \(3 \times 3 = 9\) eggs.
- The remaining two people eat 2 eggs each day: \(2 \times 2 = 4\) eggs.
- Therefore, the total daily egg consumption is \(9 + 4 = 13\) eggs.

Next, we calculate the weekly egg consumption by multiplying the daily consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week):

\[13 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 91 \text{ eggs/week}\]

So, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week."
"To find Trent's age, we need to first determine Jane's age and then use that to find Trent's age.

Given:
- Quinn is 30 years old.
- Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn.
- Trent is 5 years older than Jane.

First, calculate Jane's age:
\[ \text{Jane's age} = \text{Quinn's age} - 3 = 30 - 3 = 27 \]

Next, calculate Trent's age:
\[ \text{Trent's age} = \text{Jane's age} + 5 = 27 + 5 = 32 \]

So, Trent is 32 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 32 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera's current age is 46 years.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old six years ago.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since six years have passed, Noah's current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Let the current population of Chile be \(P\).
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was \(P / 2\).

4. **Use the given information about the population six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times the age of Noah.
   - Six years ago, Noah was 20 years old.
   - Therefore, the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

5. **Calculate the current population of Chile:**
   - Since the population six years ago was \(P / 2 = 60000\), the current population \(P\) is \(60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

The population of Chile now is \(\boxed{120000}\)."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so it is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve for \( D \), we first combine the terms on the left side of the equation:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 3D + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{6D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{7D}{2} \]

So the equation becomes:
\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

To isolate \( D \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Then we divide both sides by 7:
\[ D = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 30 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha initially invited:

- Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people.
- Martha invited 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people.

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we account for the people who couldn't come due to illness. This number is 8 people.

Then, we account for the people who couldn't come due to previous commitments. This number is \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the 8 people who couldn't come due to illness, which is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \) people.

The total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Therefore, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is \(24 - 10 = 14\).

The final numerical answer is:
14"
"First, let's determine the total number of marbles Solomon has after adding the marbles he bought from Johanna to the store.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and the store already had 50 marbles. So, the total number of marbles in the store after adding the bought marbles is:
\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \]

Next, we need to calculate the number of marbles Solomon received from his father. His father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as Solomon bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles, the number of marbles his father gave him is:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \]

Now, we add the marbles given by his father to the marbles already in the store:
\[ 70 + 8 = 78 \]

Each marble weighs 2 kg, so the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:
\[ 78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kg} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 156 \]"
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is in the shape of a rectangular prism, and the volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 5 feet

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 5 \]

Now, let's calculate the volume:

\[ V = 24 \times 5 = 120 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is given as $0.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = \text{Volume} \times \text{Cost per cubic foot} \]

Substituting the volume and the cost per cubic foot:

\[ C = 120 \times 0.1 \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost:

\[ C = 12 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The number of girls is 3 times the number of boys.
2. The number of nongendered children is 1/10 of the number of boys.
3. The classroom has 30 boys.

First, calculate the number of girls:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 3 \times \text{Number of boys} = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

Next, calculate the number of nongendered children:
\[ \text{Number of nongendered children} = \frac{1}{10} \times \text{Number of boys} = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3 \]

Now, add up all the children in the classroom:
\[ \text{Total number of children} = \text{Number of boys} + \text{Number of girls} + \text{Number of nongendered children} \]
\[ \text{Total number of children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 \]

So, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles.

The ratio 1:3 means for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires. Therefore, if there are 45 electric wires, we can find the number of electric poles by dividing the number of wires by 3.

Let's calculate the number of electric poles:
\[
\text{Number of electric poles} = \frac{\text{Number of electric wires}}{3} = \frac{45}{3} = 15
\]

So, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

\[
\boxed{15}

"First, let's determine the total number of people at the party at the beginning. There were 25 men and 15 women, so the total number of people was:

\[ 25 + 15 = 40 \]

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. This means that 1/4 of 40 people left:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

So, 10 people left the party. If 22 men stayed at the party, we can determine the number of men who left by subtracting the number of men who stayed from the total number of men:

\[ 25 - 22 = 3 \]

Since 10 people in total left the party and 3 of them were men, the remaining 7 people must have been women. Therefore, the number of women who left is:

\[ 15 - 7 = 8 \]

So, the number of women left at the party is:

\[ 15 - 8 = 7 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 7 \]"
"First, we need to determine the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book and the book costs $4, we can calculate the cost of the magazine as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of magazine} = \frac{\text{Cost of book}}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of the pen. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so we can calculate the cost of the pen as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of pen} = \text{Cost of magazine} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 \]

Therefore, the cost of the pen is $1.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1 \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of pencils Jam has. We know that Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. So, the number of pencils in the boxes is:

\[ 26 - 2 = 24 \]

This means Jam has 24 pencils in boxes and 2 loose pencils, making a total of 26 pencils. Now, we need to find out how many boxes are needed to store all of Jam's pencils. Since each box presumably holds the same number of pencils, and we don't know the exact number of pencils per box, we can assume that the 24 pencils in boxes are stored in 24/number_of_pencils_per_box boxes. However, since the problem does not specify the number of pencils per box, we can infer that the 24 pencils in boxes are stored in 24/12 = 2 boxes (assuming each box holds 12 pencils, which is a common assumption for such problems if not specified otherwise).

So, Jam has 2 boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which totals to 2 boxes. Adding Meg's 46 pencils, the total number of pencils is:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

To find out how many boxes are needed to store all 72 pencils, we need to assume that each box holds the same number of pencils. If we assume each box holds 12 pencils (as a common assumption), then the number of boxes needed is:

\[ \frac{72}{12} = 6 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 6 boxes to store all their pencils. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the cooling effect and the additional liquid added to the coffee.

First, let's determine how many ice cubes are used to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we can calculate the number of ice cubes as follows:
\[ \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \]

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
\[ 5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters weaker per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker} \]

Next, we need to account for the 15 milliliters of cream added. Adding cream does not change the strength of the coffee in terms of milliliters, but it does add to the volume of the drink. However, the question asks how many milliliters weaker the iced coffee is, not how much weaker in volume.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ 60 \text{ milliliters weaker} \]

In a separate line, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 60 \]"
"To determine the number of old records the 5 people brought in, we can use the given exchange rate of 2 old records for 1 new record. If 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can set up the following equation based on the exchange rate:

\[ \text{Number of new records} = \text{Number of old records brought in} \times \frac{1 \text{ new record}}{2 \text{ old records}} \]

Given that 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can substitute these values into the equation:

\[ 7 = \text{Number of old records brought in} \times \frac{1}{2} \]

To find the number of old records brought in, we can solve for the number of old records by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ \text{Number of old records brought in} = 7 \times 2 \]

\[ \text{Number of old records brought in} = 14 \]

So, the 5 people brought in 14 old records. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 14 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of junior and senior programmers.

Given that the total number of employees is 100 and the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:
\[ \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers is:
\[ \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Next, we know that each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total amount paid to junior programmers per month is:
\[ \text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

The senior programmers are paid $400 more than the junior programmers, so each senior programmer is paid:
\[ \text{Payment to each senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400 \]

Therefore, the total amount paid to senior programmers per month is:
\[ \text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

Finally, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers:
\[ \text{Total payment} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 224000 \]"
"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the number of people on the bus became \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on, so the number of people on the bus became \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).

We are given that at the third stop, there were 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( 14 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 14 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school: \(24 - 2 = 22\) lollipops left.
3. He passes 14 lollipops to his friends: \(22 - 14 = 8\) lollipops left.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which means he buys \(2 \times 14 = 28\) lollipops: \(8 + 28 = 36\) lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night: \(36 - 3 = 33\) lollipops.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning: \(33 - 2 = 31\) lollipops.

So, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is 31.

"To determine how long it will take to fully charge the cell phone from 60% to 100%, we first need to calculate the percentage of charging required. Since the phone is currently at 60% and needs to reach 100%, it needs to charge by 40 percentage points.

Given that the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the total time required to charge by 40 percentage points as follows:

\[ \text{Time required} = 40 \text{ percentage points} \times 3 \text{ minutes/percentage point} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Since the question asks for the time in hours, we convert 120 minutes to hours:

\[ 120 \text{ minutes} = \frac{120}{60} \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \text{ hours} \]"
"Erin initially has 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her another 10 lollipops, so she now has:

\[ 17 - 3 = 14 \text{ lollipops} \]

The final numerical answer is 14."
"First, let's calculate the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip where they spent $80. For every $20 spent, they get $1 off their next purchase. So, for $80 spent, they would earn:

\[ \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ rewards} \]

Each reward is worth $1 off their next purchase. Therefore, they earned 4 rewards, which means they can get $4 off their next purchase.

Next, let's calculate the rewards they earned from their current shopping trip where they spent $43. Using the same reward system:

\[ \frac{43}{20} = 2.15 \]

Since they can only earn whole rewards, they would earn 2 rewards. This means they can get $2 off their next purchase.

However, they used their rewards and applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. So, the $2 rewards were reduced by $4 (since the coupon took twice the amount of rewards off the price):

\[ 2 - 4 = -2 \]

Since the negative value indicates an additional discount, they effectively get an additional $2 off their purchase. Therefore, the total discount they received is:

\[ 2 + 2 = 4 \]

Now, subtract the total discount from the amount spent:

\[ 43 - 4 = 39 \]

So, the customer paid $39 on this shopping trip.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 39 \]"
"First, let's calculate the net pay for Job A.

Job A:
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours per year: 2000
- Total annual income before tax: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- State tax rate: 20%
- State tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net pay for Job A: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Next, let's calculate the net pay for Job B.

Job B:
- Annual income before tax: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax rate on net income: 10%
- Tax on net income: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay for Job B: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, let's find the difference in net pay between the two jobs.

Difference in net pay: $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate compared to the other job."

- Total cost for Furniture United: $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

For Cozy Homes:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 installments of $250 each
- Total installments: 9 * $250 = $2,250
- Total cost for Cozy Homes: $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

- DJ has 8 guns.
- Nick has 10 guns.
- RJ has 1 gun.
- Richard has 5 guns.

Adding these together:

\[ 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24 \]

So, they have a total of 24 paintball guns.

Next, we need to divide this total number of guns equally among the four people (Nick, Richard, Jason, and RJ).

"To determine the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we need to calculate the sugar required for the suckers and the fudge separately and then sum them up.

For the suckers:
- Each batch requires 30 ounces of sugar.
- For 8 batches, the total sugar required is \( 30 \times 8 = 240 \) ounces.

For the fudge:
- Each batch requires 70 ounces of sugar.
- For 1 batch, the total sugar required is \( 70 \times 1 = 70 \) ounces.

Now, we add the sugar required for the suckers and the fudge:
- Total sugar required = sugar for suckers + sugar for fudge
- Total sugar required = 240 ounces + 70 ounces = 310 ounces.

"First, let's calculate the initial value of Maria's shares. She buys 8 shares at $8 each, so the initial value is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8/\text{share} = \$64 \]

In the first year, the stock price increases by 50%. The new price per share after the increase is:

\[ \$8 \times (1 + 0.50) = \$8 \times 1.50 = \$12 \]

So, the value of Maria's shares at the end of the first year is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12/\text{share} = \$96 \]

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. The new price per share after the decrease is:

\[ \$12 \times (1 - 0.25) = \$12 \times 0.75 = \$9 \]

So, the value of Maria's shares at the end of the second year is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$9/\text{share} = \$72 \]

Therefore, the final value of all of Maria's shares is:

\[ \$72 \]"
"First, let's determine how many hot dogs Thomas ate. Since Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, we can calculate the number of hot dogs Thomas ate as follows:

\[ \text{Thomas's hot dogs} = 3 \times \text{Luke's hot dogs} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Next, we need to find out how many hot dogs John ate. John ate half the amount that Thomas ate, so:

\[ \text{John's hot dogs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Thomas's hot dogs} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \]

Now, to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's hot dogs} - \text{Luke's hot dogs} = 3 - 2 = 1 \]

So, John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 1 \]"
"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The number of students in the smallest group would then be \( x - 10 \).

Given that the total number of students is 200, we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of students in all three groups:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two equal groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60."
"Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \) and the number of chickens as \( H \). According to the problem, the total number of animals is 60, and there are twice as many chickens as cows. This gives us the following equations:

\[ H + C = 60 \]
\[ H = 2C \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( C \):

\[ 2C + C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:

\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of legs. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:

\[ \text{Total legs} = (2 \times H) + (4 \times C) = (2 \times 40) + (4 \times 20) = 80 + 80 = 160 \]

So, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is 160."
"Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week for 4 weeks. So, the number of balls he adds over the 4 weeks is:

\[ 1 \text{ ball/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 4 \text{ balls} \]

Adding these to the initial 3 balls:

\[ 3 \text{ initial balls} + 4 \text{ added balls} = 7 \text{ balls} \]

However, when he starts juggling on stage, he drops 3 balls. Therefore, the number of balls he has left to juggle is:

\[ 7 \text{ balls} - 3 \text{ dropped balls} = 4 \text{ balls} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the weights of the other animals based on the given information and then calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal.

1. **Pink Frog Weight:**
   - Given: 50 pounds.

2. **Blue Beetle Weight:**
   - Since a pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.

3. **Green Toad Weight:**
   - Since a pink frog weighs the same as a green toad, the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.

4. **Yellow Snake Weight:**
   - A pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake.
   - Therefore, the yellow snake weighs \(50 + 10 = 60\) pounds.

5. **Red Bird Weight:**
   - A pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than a red bird.
   - Therefore, the red bird weighs \(50 - 20 = 30\) pounds.

Now, we have the weights of all the animals:
- Pink Frog: 50 pounds
- Blue Beetle: 50 pounds
- Green Toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow Snake: 60 pounds
- Red Bird: 30 pounds

Next, we calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal:
- Total weight of the animals: \(50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 240\) pounds.
- Weight of the container: 20 pounds.

Finally, the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the additional distance Tyson should run each day.
2. Determine the total distance Tyson runs each day after taking the coach's advice.
3. Calculate the total distance Tyson runs in a month.
4. Since June has 30 days, we will multiply the daily distance by 30.

First, let's calculate the additional distance Tyson should run each day. The coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters than he currently runs. Since Tyson currently runs 5000 meters, the additional distance is:
\[ \text{Additional distance} = 5000 \times \frac{1}{5} = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

So, the total distance Tyson should run each day is:
\[ \text{Total daily distance} = 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters} \]

Next, we calculate the total distance Tyson runs in a month. Since June has 30 days, the total distance is:
\[ \text{Total distance in June} = 6000 \times 30 = 180000 \text{ meters} \]

Therefore, the total distance Tyson covered in June is:
\[ \boxed{180000} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of each juice box:

- Juice Box A costs $4.
- Juice Box B costs $5 more than Juice Box A, so Juice Box B costs $4 + $5 = $9.
- Juice Box C costs $7 more than Juice Box A, so Juice Box C costs $4 + $7 = $11.

Now, to find out how much more Juice Box C costs than Juice Box B, we subtract the cost of Juice Box B from the cost of Juice Box C:

$11 - $9 = $2.

So, Juice Box C is $2 more expensive than Juice Box B. The final numerical answer is 2."
"To calculate the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have, we need to consider the number of legs contributed by each type of table.

For the 40 tables with 4 legs each:
\[ 40 \text{ tables} \times 4 \text{ legs/table} = 160 \text{ legs} \]

For the 50 tables with 3 legs each:
\[ 50 \text{ tables} \times 3 \text{ legs/table} = 150 \text{ legs} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of legs:
\[ 160 \text{ legs} + 150 \text{ legs} = 310 \text{ legs} \]

So, the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is 310."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Jenny buys in a week:
\[ 1 \text{ bag/week} \times 36 \text{ cookies/bag} = 36 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Next, let's determine how many cookies Jenny puts in her son's lunch box over the week:
\[ 4 \text{ cookies/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 20 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Now, let's calculate how many cookies her husband eats over the week:
\[ 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 7 \text{ cookies/week} \]

To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to subtract the number of cookies she puts in her son's lunch box and the number her husband eats from the total number of cookies she buys:
\[ 36 \text{ cookies/week} - 20 \text{ cookies/week} - 7 \text{ cookies/week} = 9 \text{ cookies/week} \]

So, Jenny eats 9 cookies a week."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the shirts without any discount. Davos bought 2 shirts, each costing $30.

\[ \text{Total cost without discount} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Next, we need to calculate the discount amount. The discount is 40%, so we calculate 40% of $60.

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 60 \times \frac{40}{100} = 60 \times 0.40 = 24 \]

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the total cost without discount to find out how much Davos paid.

\[ \text{Total cost with discount} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 36 \]"
"First, let's calculate the daily earnings from tractor sales:
- They sold 10 tractors a day.
- Each tractor was sold for $100.

So, the daily earnings from tractor sales were:
\[ 10 \text{ tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate the daily earnings from silo sales:
- They sell 5 silos a day.
- Each silo is sold for $220.

So, the daily earnings from silo sales are:
\[ 5 \text{ silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day} \]

Now, we need to find the percentage increase in daily earnings from tractors to silos:
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New daily earnings} - \text{Old daily earnings}}{\text{Old daily earnings}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\$1100 - \$1000}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{\$100}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage more they are making per day now is:
\[ 10\% \]"

"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming.

John spends 6 hours boating. He spends half that time swimming, which is:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time spent on boating and swimming is:
\[ 6 + 3 = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total time he spent watching the shows. He watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is:
\[ 9 + 6 = 15 \text{ hours} \]

This 15 hours represents 30% of the total time he spent on his vacation. Let \( T \) be the total time spent on the vacation. We can set up the equation:
\[ 0.30T = 15 \]

Solving for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John spent 40% of his total time sightseeing. Therefore, the time spent sightseeing is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost for the mini-golf and go-karts rides.

- The cost for one round of mini-golf is $5.
- The cost for two rides on the go-karts is $10 * 2 = $20.

So, the total cost for these activities is $5 + $20 = $25.

Morgan's budget for the party is $90. After spending $25 on mini-golf and go-karts, she has $90 - $25 = $65 left for arcade tokens and snacks.

Each friend gets $5 worth of arcade tokens, and Morgan herself also gets $5 worth of arcade tokens. So, the cost for Morgan and her friends' arcade tokens is $5 * (number of friends + 1).

Let's denote the number of friends as \( f \). The equation for the remaining budget is:
\[ 65 = 5(f + 1) \]

Now, we solve for \( f \):

"First, let's calculate how much Marisa spends on lollipops each day. She buys 4 lollipops every day, and each lollipop costs 25 cents. Therefore, the cost of the lollipops each day is:

\[ 4 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 100 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, 100 cents is equivalent to 1 dollar. So, Marisa spends $1 on lollipops each day.

Next, let's determine how much money Marisa has in her pocket every day after buying the lollipops. She gets $5 as pocket money every day, so the change she saves each day is:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars} - 1 \text{ dollar} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much money Marisa saves in her piggy bank over 5 days. Since she saves $4 each day, over 5 days she saves:

Since he spent half of his change on gumballs, the total amount of money he had initially was twice the amount he spent on gumballs:

\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Billy started with $10, so the amount of money he spent on candy is:

\[ 10 - 4 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of the candy is $1.5 per pound. To find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we divide the total amount spent on candy by the cost per pound:

"First, let's calculate the total distance of one complete trip from the first city to the third city and back to the first city.

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city back to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the second and third city trip, which is \(100 - 50 = 50\) miles.

So, the total distance for one complete round trip is:
\[75 + 100 + 50 = 225 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[225 \times 3 = 675 \text{ miles}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance traveled in one day by the service interval:
\[18000 \div 675 = 26.6667\]

Since the train cannot go a fraction of a day between services, we round up to the next whole number. Therefore, the train goes between services every 27 days.

The final numerical answer is:

   - A Rottweiler bed requires 8 pounds of stuffing.
   - A chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing.
   - The collie bed requires the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler and a chihuahua bed.
   - The average of 8 pounds and 2 pounds is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Average} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
     \]
   - Therefore, a collie bed requires 5 pounds of stuffing.

2. **Calculate the total stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds:**
   - Mark needs to make 4 chihuahua beds.
   - Each chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing.
   - The total stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds is:

Therefore, the total number of pounds of stuffing Mark needs to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds is 23 pounds."
"First, let's calculate the time John spent driving to his friend's house. The distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, and he drives at a speed of 70 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time taken to drive to his friend's house is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} = \frac{200 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{200}{70} \text{ hours} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 2.857 \text{ hours} \]

Next, John took a detour that added 10 miles to his trip, making the total distance to his friend's house 210 miles. The time taken for this detour is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{210}{70} \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the time John spent driving back home. The distance home is 240 miles, and he drives at a speed of 80 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{back home}} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = \frac{240}{80} \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, the total time for the trip is the sum of the time taken to drive to his friend's house, the time taken for the detour, and the time taken to drive back home:

\[ \text{Total Time} = \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} + \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} + \text{Time}_{\text{back home}} \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{20}{7} + 3 + 3 \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{20}{7} + 6 \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{20}{7} + \frac{42}{7} \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{62}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 8.857 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time for the trip is:

The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is \( 4C - 5 \). Substituting \( C = 3 \) into this equation, we get:
\[ 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]

The number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is \( 3 \) times the number of shoplifters, which is \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \).

Now, we know the total number of customers kicked out is 50. The total number of customers and shoplifters and those for physical violence can be calculated as follows:
\[ C + (4C - 5) + 3(4C - 5) = 50 \]
\[ 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 \]

The number of customers kicked out for other reasons is the total number of people kicked out minus the number of customers, shoplifters, and those for physical violence:
\[ 50 - 31 = 19 \]

So, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is \( 19 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we need to first find out how many points Erin had after scoring 14 points.

Given:
- Sara scored 8 points.
- Erin now has three times more points than Sara.

First, calculate how many points Erin has now:
\[ \text{Erin's current points} = 3 \times \text{Sara's points} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Erin scored 14 points to reach her current total of 24 points. Therefore, the number of points Erin had before scoring the 14 points is:
\[ \text{Erin's points before} = \text{Erin's current points} - \text{points scored} = 24 - 14 = 10 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break down the expenses into different components and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of picture frames:**
   - Each picture frame costs $20.
   - Each frame needs to be etched at an additional 20% cost.
   - The total cost per frame is $20 + ($20 * 20%) = $20 + $4 = $24.
   - There are 44 seniors, so the total cost for the picture frames is $24 * 44 = $1056.

2. **Cost of pins:**
   - 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each.
   - The total cost for the pins is $5 * 2 = $10.

3. **Cost of cords for officers:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so there are 44 / 4 = 11 officers.
   - Each officer will receive a cord that costs $12.
   - The total cost for the cords is $12 * 11 = $132.

Now, we sum up all the costs:
- Cost of picture frames: $1056
- Cost of pins: $10
- Cost of cords: $132

Total cost = $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of pieces of equipment and then calculate the cost of the functioning pieces.

1. Let's denote the total number of pieces of equipment as \( N \).
2. According to the problem, 40% of the total number of pieces were faulty. Therefore, the number of faulty pieces is \( 0.4N \).
3. Consequently, the number of functioning pieces is \( N - 0.4N = 0.6N \).
4. The total cost of the equipment is $400,000. Since the faulty pieces are returned, the company only pays for the functioning pieces.
5. The cost of the functioning pieces is \( 0.6N \times \frac{400000}{N} = 0.6 \times 400000 = 240000 \).

"First, we need to determine how many pupils like blue. Since half of the class likes blue, we calculate:

\[
\text{Pupils who like blue} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Next, we find out how many pupils are left after accounting for those who like blue:

\[
\text{Remaining pupils} = 40 - 20 = 20
\]

One-fourth of these remaining pupils like green:

\[
\text{Pupils who like green} = \frac{20}{4} = 5
\]

The rest of the pupils like yellow. To find out how many pupils like yellow, we subtract the number of pupils who like green from the remaining pupils:

"First, we need to determine how many apples Lucy sold on Monday. Given that she sold all the apples she picked on Monday and received $56 from selling them at $4 per piece, we can calculate the number of apples sold on Monday as follows:

\[
\text{Number of apples sold on Monday} = \frac{\$56}{\$4/\text{apple}} = 14 \text{ apples}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many apples Lucy picked on Tuesday and Wednesday. According to the problem, on Tuesday, she picked 12 apples. On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday:

\[
\text{Number of apples picked on Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ apples}
\]

Now, we can calculate the total number of apples picked over the three days by summing the apples picked on each day:

\[
\text{Total number of apples} = \text{Apples picked on Monday} + \text{Apples picked on Tuesday} + \text{Apples picked on Wednesday}
\]

Since the number of apples picked on Monday is 14, and the apples picked on Tuesday and Wednesday are 12 and 24 respectively, we have:

\[
\text{Total number of apples} = 14 + 12 + 24 = 50
\]

Thus, the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days is:

"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including the interest, and then divide that by five.

The formula to calculate the total amount to be paid, including interest, is:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} \times (1 + \text{Interest Rate})^{\text{Time}} \]

Here, the principal (P) is $3,650, the interest rate (r) is 10% or 0.10, and the time (t) is 5 months. Since the interest rate is given as an annual rate, we need to adjust it for the time period. However, since the interest is compounded monthly, we can use the formula directly with the given values.

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 \times (1 + 0.10)^5 \]

First, calculate \( (1 + 0.10)^5 \):
\[ (1 + 0.10)^5 = 1.10^5 \approx 1.61051 \]

Now, multiply this by the principal:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 \times 1.61051 \approx 5874.4115 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the total amount Karan has to pay is approximately $5874.41.

Next, we need to divide this total amount by the number of months (5) to find the monthly payment:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{5874.4115}{5} \approx 1174.8823 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is approximately $1174.88.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we calculate the distance Cho hiked. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Cho, the speed is 14 kilometers per hour and the time is 8 hours. So, the distance Cho hiked is:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{h} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, we calculate the distance Chloe hiked. The speed for Chloe is 9 kilometers per hour and the time is 5 hours. So, the distance Chloe hiked is:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{h} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked, we subtract the distance Chloe hiked from the distance Cho hiked:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she can make 3 pitchers, the total number of cups is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups/pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to determine the revenue from selling all 36 cups of lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue is:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1/\text{cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to find out how much it costs her to make the lemonade. She spent $18 to buy the supplies, so the cost is:

\[ \$18 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Millie sells all of the lemonade, and she sells an average of 4 cups per hour. Therefore, the profit per hour is:

"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can set up an equation based on the information given. If 12.8 hectares represent the remaining 2/5 of his land (since he sold 3/5 of it), we can find the total amount of land he had initially by determining the value of 1/5 of his land and then multiplying it by 5.

Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had at first as \( L \).

Given that \( \frac{2}{5}L = 12.8 \) hectares, we can solve for \( L \) as follows:

\[ L = \frac{12.8 \times 5}{2} \]

\[ L = \frac{64}{2} \]

\[ L = 32 \]

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 50\% \times 52 = 0.50 \times 52 = 26 \]

Since the choir is evenly split between boys and girls, the number of boys is also 26.

Next, we need to find out how many female members will perform. Since all female members are performing, the number of female members is equal to the number of girls, which is 26.

However, on the day of the performance, half the people performing can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, only half of the female members will actually perform:

\[ \text{Female members who can perform} = \frac{26}{2} = 13 \]

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. So, the total number of people who sang in the performance is the sum of the female members who can perform and the 3 teachers:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many popsicles Betty and Sam each have based on the given ratio and total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. The total parts of the ratio are 5 + 6 = 11 parts.

Given that the total number of popsicles is 165, we can find out how many popsicles each part of the ratio represents by dividing the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts in the ratio:
\[ \text{Value of each part} = \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can find out how many popsicles Betty and Sam have:
- Betty's popsicles: \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \)
- Sam's popsicles: \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \)

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

"First, let's convert all the time spent into the same unit. We'll use minutes for this calculation.

Carol spends 4 hours writing a song. Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, 4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

She spends half that much time recording it, which is 240 / 2 = 120 minutes.

She spends 90 minutes editing it.

Now, let's calculate the total work time in minutes:
Total work time = Time spent writing + Time spent recording + Time spent editing
Total work time = 240 minutes + 120 minutes + 90 minutes
Total work time = 450 minutes

The time spent editing is 90 minutes. To find the percentage of her total work time spent editing, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total work time}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{90}{450} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{5} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of her total work time that Carol spent editing is 20%."

1. **Calculate the total number of spaces in the shelving system:**
   - The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns.
   - Each row has 6 spaces.
   - Therefore, the total number of spaces is \(6 \times 6 = 36\).

2. **Determine the number of books Wendy wants to place:**
   - Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books already in the system.
   - Let \(x\) be the number of books currently in the system.
   - Wendy wants to place \(2x + 20\) books.

3. **Calculate the number of additional books Wendy needs to place:**
   - Since the total number of spaces is 36, and she wants to place \(2x + 20\) books, we need to find \(x\) such that the total number of books equals 36.
   - Therefore, \(2x + 20 = 36\).

4. **Solve for \(x\):**
   \[
   2x + 20 = 36

"First, let's determine the number of millipedes. Nancy saw 1/3 as many millipedes as spiders. Since she saw 90 spiders, the number of millipedes is:

\[ \text{Number of millipedes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30 \]

Next, we need to find the number of stink bugs. The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12. Since there are 30 millipedes, the number of stink bugs is:

\[ \text{Number of stink bugs} = 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48 \]

Now, we can find the total number of bugs by adding the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs together:

\[ \text{Total number of bugs} = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168 \]

So, the total number of bugs Nancy counted is:

\[ 168 \]"
"If Erica is 30 years old, and Beth is 5 years older than Erica, then Beth is 30 + 5 = 35 years old. Since Alice is 7 years older than Beth, Alice is 35 + 7 = 42 years old. The difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 42 - 30 = 12 years.

The final numerical answer is 12."

"To determine how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for a quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for:
- 3 cups of flour
- 1 cup of milk

For a quadruple batch, the amounts are:
- Flour: \( 3 \text{ cups} \times 4 = 12 \text{ cups} \)
- Milk: \( 1 \text{ cup} \times 4 = 4 \text{ cups} \)

Next, we need to determine how many bags of flour and bottles of milk are required.

Flour is sold in 2-cup bags:
- \( \frac{12 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups per bag}} = 6 \text{ bags} \)

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles:
- \( \frac{4 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups per bottle}} = 2 \text{ bottles} \)

Finally, we calculate the difference between the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk:
- \( 6 \text{ bags} - 2 \text{ bottles} = 4 \)

Therefore, Mark has to buy 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the energy savings, we first need to calculate the energy consumption of the air conditioner under the original and reduced usage conditions.

1. **Original Usage:**
   - Power consumption: 900 watts
   - Usage time: 8 hours per day
   - Daily energy consumption: \( 900 \, \text{watts} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watt-hours} \)
   - Converting watt-hours to kilowatt-hours: \( 7200 \, \text{watt-hours} \div 1000 = 7.2 \, \text{kilowatt-hours} \)
   - Daily energy consumption in kilowatt-hours: 7.2 kWh

2. **Reduced Usage:**
   - Reduced usage time: 8 hours - 5 hours = 3 hours per day
   - Daily energy consumption: \( 900 \, \text{watts} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watt-hours} \)
   - Converting watt-hours to kilowatt-hours: \( 2700 \, \text{watt-hours} \div 1000 = 2.7 \, \text{kilowatt-hours} \)
   - Daily energy consumption in kilowatt-hours: 2.7 kWh

3. **Energy Savings per Day:**
   - Savings per day: 7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh = 4.5 kWh

4. **Energy Savings in 30 Days:**
   - Savings in 30 days: \( 4.5 \, \text{kilowatt-hours/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kilowatt-hours} \)

Therefore, the total kilowatt-hours of electric energy saved in 30 days is 135 kWh."
"First, let's calculate the total number of stripes on all the zebras Jane counted.

- Two zebras with 17 stripes each: \(2 \times 17 = 34\) stripes
- One zebra with 36 stripes: \(36\) stripes
- One zebra with half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes: \(36 / 2 = 18\) stripes

Now, let's add up all the stripes:
\[34 + 36 + 18 = 88\]

Jane has a total of 88 stripes from the zebras. To find the average number of stripes per zebra, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras:
\[88 \div 4 = 22\]

So, the average number of stripes per zebra is 22.

"First, let's determine the initial number of corns Allan has. According to the problem, there is twice as much corn as cannolis. Given that Allan initially has 40 cannolis, we can calculate the initial number of corns as follows:

\[ \text{Initial number of corns} = 2 \times \text{Initial number of cannolis} = 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

Next, Allan bought 60 more cannolis at the store. So, the new number of cannolis is:

\[ \text{New number of cannolis} = \text{Initial number of cannolis} + 60 = 40 + 60 = 100 \]

Now, Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he had after buying the additional cannolis. Since he now has 100 cannolis, the number of corns he has is:

\[ \text{Number of corns} = \text{New number of cannolis} - 40 = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Finally, to find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house, we add the new number of corns and the new number of cannolis:

\[ \text{Combined total} = \text{New number of corns} + \text{New number of cannolis} = 60 + 100 = 160 \]

So, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:

"To determine how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we can break down the information given:

1. Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day.
2. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. This means he completed 5,000 steps.
3. He also did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.
4. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take.

First, we calculate the total number of steps Elliott had taken before his jog:
\[ 5,000 \text{ (steps to and from school)} + 1,000 \text{ (steps with friend)} = 6,000 \text{ steps} \]

Since his goal was to walk 10,000 steps, the number of steps he had left to take before his jog is:
\[ 10,000 - 6,000 = 4,000 \text{ steps} \]

After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take. Therefore, the number of steps he took during his jog is:
\[ 4,000 - 2,000 = 2,000 \text{ steps} \]

So, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is:
\[ \boxed{2000} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total number of words in the book. The book is 45 pages long and averages 200 words per page. Therefore, the total number of words in the book is:

\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it will take Toby to read the entire book. Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute. Therefore, the time it takes to read the book is:

\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby plans to leave the airport in 60 minutes. He needs to get to the airport in 10 minutes. Therefore, the total time Toby needs to be ready to leave the airport is:

\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Since it takes Toby 30 minutes to read the book, he will be ready to leave the airport in:

\[ 30 \text{ minutes} \]

To find out how many minutes early Toby will be, we subtract the time he needs to be ready from the time he will be ready:

\[ 50 \text{ minutes} - 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Toby will be \(\boxed{20}\) minutes early."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by employees in May:**
   - Number of employees in May: 40
   - Hours worked per employee per week: 40
   - Weeks in May: 4 (assuming May has 4 weeks)
   - Total hours worked by employees in May = 40 employees * 40 hours/employee * 4 weeks = 6400 hours

2. **Calculate the total amount of money paid to employees in May:**
   - Hourly wage per employee: $15
   - Total amount paid in May = 6400 hours * $15/hour = $96,000

3. **Calculate the number of employees whose contracts expired in June:**
   - Number of employees whose contracts expired = 1/4 of 40 = 10 employees

4. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by employees in June:**
   - Number of employees remaining in June = 40 - 10 = 30 employees
   - Hours worked per employee per week: 40
   - Weeks in June: 4 (assuming June has 4 weeks)
   - Total hours worked by employees in June = 30 employees * 40 hours/employee * 4 weeks = 4800 hours

5. **Calculate the total amount of money paid to employees in June:**
   - Hourly wage per employee: $15
   - Total amount paid in June = 4800 hours * $15/hour = $72,000

6. **Calculate the total amount of money paid to employees in the two months:**
   - Total amount paid in May + Total amount paid in June = $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $168,000."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is sold in a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. Sally bought 2 pounds of taffy.

For the first pound, the cost is $3.
For the second pound, the cost is $3 - $1.50 = $1.50 (since it's half off).

So, the total cost for the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells. The seashells cost $1.50.

Then, let's calculate the cost of the magnets. Each magnet costs $0.25, and Sally bought 4 magnets.

So, the total cost for the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items Sally bought:
Total cost = Cost of taffy + Cost of seashells + Cost of magnets
Total cost = $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00.

Sally's parents gave her $10 to spend. To find out how much money Sally has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from the $10 she was given.

Money left = $10 - $7.00 = $3.00.

So, the final numerical answer is $3.00."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the two packs of fireworks. The first pack costs $400, and the second pack costs twice as much, which is $800. Adding these together gives:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost of the two packs of fireworks. A 20% discount means Tim pays 80% of the original cost. So, we calculate 80% of $1200:

\[ 1200 \times 0.80 = 960 \]

Now, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted cost of the fireworks:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is:

\[ \boxed{1110} \]"
"Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies a night. Over 30 days, she will eat:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. We know that 5% of the candles are dangerous and have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. Additionally, 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode. Therefore, 1% of the candles are dangerous and do not have the defect.

First, let's find out how many candles are dangerous:
\[ \text{Number of dangerous candles} = 5\% \text{ of } 50000 = 0.05 \times 50000 = 2500 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these dangerous candles also have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. Since 5% of the candles are dangerous and have the defect, we calculate:
\[ \text{Number of dangerous candles with the defect} = 5\% \text{ of } 2500 = 0.05 \times 2500 = 125 \]

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is:
\[ \text{Number of dangerous candles with the defect} = 125 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 125 \]"
"First, we need to determine the discount price for each blouse. The regular price of each blouse is $20, and there is a 30% discount.

To find the discount amount, we calculate 30% of $20:
\[ \text{Discount amount} = 20 \times \frac{30}{100} = 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]

Next, we subtract the discount amount from the regular price to find the sale price of each blouse:
\[ \text{Sale price} = 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so we need to find the total cost for 4 blouses at the sale price:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 4 \times 14 = 56 \]

Thus, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:

"Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees as \( A_{\text{tall}} \), from the shortest trees as \( A_{\text{short}} \), and from the average trees as \( A_{\text{avg}} \).

From the problem, we know:
- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, so \( A_{\text{tall}} = 30 \).
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, so \( A_{\text{short}} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \).
- Joanne gathers \( A_{\text{avg}} \) apples from the average trees.

Her sister gathers:
- Twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
- Three times as many apples from the shortest trees, so \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
- No apples from the average trees, so \( 0 \) apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne and her sister is 500. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total apples gathered as:
\[ A_{\text{tall}} + A_{\text{short}} + A_{\text{avg}} + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 30 + 15 + A_{\text{avg}} + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Simplifying the left side:
\[ 150 + A_{\text{avg}} = 500 \]

Solving for \( A_{\text{avg}} \):
\[ A_{\text{avg}} = 500 - 150 \]
\[ A_{\text{avg}} = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{350} \]"
"Let's denote the number of camels as \( C \) and the number of dromedaries as \( D \).

From the problem, we have two equations:
1. The total number of heads: \( C + D = 180 \)
2. The total number of humps: \( 2C + D = 304 \)

We can solve these equations step by step. First, we'll subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( D \):

\[ (2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180 \]
\[ 2C + D - C - D = 124 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

Now that we have the number of camels, we can substitute \( C = 124 \) back into the first equation to find \( D \):

\[ 124 + D = 180 \]
\[ D = 180 - 124 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 56 \]"
"To determine the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we need to break down the distances traveled each day and then sum them up.

1. **First 4 days:**
   - Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the first 4 days: \( 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \).

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - Tom traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days.
   - Distance traveled in the next 2 days: \( 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \).

3. **The fifth day:**
   - Tom did not travel at all.
   - Distance traveled on the fifth day: \( 0 \text{ km} \).

"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to work backwards from the information given about Peter's locker.

1. We know that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
2. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. Therefore, we can find the size of Zack's locker by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4:
   \[
   \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]
3. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. Therefore, we can find the size of Timothy's locker by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2:

"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:

\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of both pairs of jeans:

\[ 28 + 22 = 50 \]

Cole saved a total of $6. According to the problem, he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. Let's denote the total savings as \( S \). Since he saved $6 in total, we have:

\[ S = 6 \]

The savings from the jogger jeans is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]

The savings from the tattered jeans is:

\[ 6 - 2 = 4 \]

Now, we need to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. We already know the original cost of the tattered jeans is $28 and the original cost of the jogger jeans is $22. The difference in cost is:

\[ 28 - 22 = 6 \]

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 more than the tattered jeans. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the total number of bird feeders Lillian has. She builds 3 and buys 3, so she has a total of 3 + 3 = 6 bird feeders.

Next, we need to calculate the number of birds that each type of feeder attracts. The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each, and the bird feeders Lillian made attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, which means they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

Now, we can calculate the total number of birds that can be expected to visit the garden each day. Since there are 3 store-bought feeders and 3 bird feeders Lillian made, the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders is 3 * 20 = 60 birds, and the total number of birds attracted by the bird feeders Lillian made is 3 * 30 = 90 birds.

Adding these together, the total number of birds expected to visit the garden each day is 60 + 90 = 150 birds.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the cost of the soup. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. Since the bagel costs $4, we can calculate the cost of the soup as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of soup} = \text{Cost of bagel} + 0.25 \times \text{Cost of bagel} \]
\[ \text{Cost of soup} = 4 + 0.25 \times 4 \]
\[ \text{Cost of soup} = 4 + 1 \]
\[ \text{Cost of soup} = 5 \]

Next, we know the cake costs half the price of the bagel. Since the bagel costs $4, the cake costs:

\[ \text{Cost of cake} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cost of bagel} \]
\[ \text{Cost of cake} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 \]
\[ \text{Cost of cake} = 2 \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the dinner by adding the cost of the soup, the bagel, and the cake:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of soup} + \text{Cost of bagel} + \text{Cost of cake} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 5 + 4 + 2 \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 11 \]

So, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for the dinner she ordered."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of cards Kenny started with. Let's break down the information given:

1. Kenny sells his cards for $1.5 each.
2. He keeps 1/3 of his cards and uses the remaining 2/3 to buy the ticket.
3. The ticket costs $100.
4. He has $50 in spending cash after buying the ticket.

First, let's calculate how much money Kenny earned from selling the cards:
\[ \text{Money from selling cards} = \text{Cost of the ticket} + \text{Spending cash} = 100 + 50 = 150 \]

Next, we need to find out how many cards he sold to earn $150:
\[ \text{Number of cards sold} = \frac{\text{Money from selling cards}}{\text{Price per card}} = \frac{150}{1.5} = 100 \]

Since he sold 100 cards, and these are 2/3 of his total collection, we can find the total number of cards he started with:
\[ \text{Total number of cards} = \frac{\text{Number of cards sold}}{\frac{2}{3}} = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} = 150 \]

So, Kenny started with 150 cards. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 150 \]"
"First, let's determine how many hotdogs the caterer initially prepared. Since half of the 40 guests would have two hotdogs each, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of guests who would have two hotdogs} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

This means that 20 guests would have two hotdogs each, so the caterer prepared:

\[
20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ hotdogs}
\]

However, since 40 guests showed up and everyone wanted a second hotdog, the caterer needs to provide an additional hotdog for each of the 20 guests who already had one. This means the caterer needs to prepare:

\[
40 \text{ hotdogs} + 20 \text{ hotdogs} = 60 \text{ hotdogs}
\]

Since the caterer only prepared 40 hotdogs, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:

\[
40 - 20 = 20
\]

So, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:

\[
\boxed{20}

"First, let's determine the number of letters in Indras' sister's name. We know that Indras' name has 6 letters. Half of the letters in Indras' name is:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name, so:

\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Now, to find the total number of letters in both names, we add the number of letters in Indras' name to the number of letters in her sister's name:

\[ 6 + 7 = 13 \]

So, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is:

\[ 13 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- The pot and pans set costs $120.00.
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so the total for the utensils is $5.00 * 5 = $25.00.

Adding these together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[ 120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00 \]

Next, we need to calculate the discount amount. The discount is 20%, so we calculate 20% of $165.00:
\[ 0.20 \times 165.00 = 33.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Charlotte has to pay:
\[ 165.00 - 33.00 = 132.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 132.00 \]"

"First, we need to determine how many gallons of gas are in one container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we can calculate the amount per container as follows:

\[ \text{Gallons per container} = \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5 \text{ containers}} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Josey needed \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a container. Therefore, the amount of gas Josey needed in gallons is:

\[ \text{Gallons needed} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ container} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so:

\[ \text{Pints needed} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints per gallon} = \frac{3 \times 8}{4} \text{ pints} = \frac{24}{4} \text{ pints} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount of money George spent:**
   George spent $5, and he had 1% of his money left after the purchase. This means he spent 99% of his money.
   \[
   0.99 \times 5 = 4.95 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   So, George spent $4.95.

2. **Calculate the cost of the chips George bought:**
   George bought 3 bags of chips. Each bag of chips costs 40 cents, which is $0.40.
   \[
   3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   So, the chips cost $1.20.

3. **Determine the amount of money spent on candy bars:**
   Subtract the cost of the chips from the total amount spent.
   \[
   4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   So, George spent $3.75 on candy bars.

4. **Calculate the number of candy bars George bought:**
   Each candy bar costs 75 cents, which is $0.75.

"Rory and her mom each have a piece, which means they have 2 pieces in total. The cake weighs 20 ounces, and Rory cuts it into 8 pieces. Therefore, the weight of each piece is 20 ounces / 8 pieces = 2.5 ounces per piece. Since Rory and her mom have 2 pieces, the weight of the pieces they have is 2 pieces * 2.5 ounces per piece = 5 ounces. The remaining cake weighs 20 ounces - 5 ounces = 15 ounces.

The final numerical answer is 15 ounces."
"First, we need to find the total number of oranges that Sitti and Juris have together. Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges, so the total number of oranges is:

"First, let's determine the amount of onions Antoine uses. The recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, and he doubles that amount:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00 \text{ per pound} = \$8.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box is $2.00:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00 \text{ per box} = \$4.00 \]

Adding the cost of the onions and the beef stock gives us the total cost:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

"First, let's determine the time it takes for Wayne to drive to the theater. According to the problem, it takes Wayne 4 minutes to drive to the theater.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes for Bernadette to drive to the theater. The problem states that the drive from Bernadette’s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne’s hotel. Therefore, the time it takes for Bernadette to drive to the theater is:
\[ 4 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne will take 4 minutes to drive to the theater, Bernadette should leave 5 minutes before the time Wayne leaves. Therefore, Bernadette should leave:
\[ 4 \text{ minutes} - 5 \text{ minutes} = -1 \text{ minute} \]

Since Bernadette cannot leave negative time before Wayne, we interpret this as Bernadette should leave 1 minute after Wayne leaves to ensure she arrives 5 minutes before Wayne. Thus, Bernadette should leave 1 minute after Wayne leaves to arrive 5 minutes before him.

To find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to calculate the difference in their departure times. Since Wayne leaves at 0 minutes and Bernadette leaves 1 minute after Wayne, Bernadette should leave:
\[ 0 \text{ minutes} + 1 \text{ minute} = 1 \text{ minute} \]

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 1 minute earlier than Wayne to arrive 5 minutes before him.

"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to determine the width of the room. We know the area of the room and the length, so we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

Given:
- Area = 360 square feet
- Length = 3 yards

First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard = 3 feet, the length in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Now we can find the width using the area formula:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{Width} \]

Solving for the width:

\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can calculate the perimeter of the rectangle using the formula:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

So, the perimeter of the room is 98 feet."
"First, let's calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

So, the total number of beads Elizabeth bought is:
\[ 1 \text{ pack of red} + 2 \text{ packs of clear} = 1 \times 20 + 2 \times 20 = 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ beads} \]

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

So, the total number of beads Margareth bought is:
\[ 3 \text{ packs of blue} + 4 \text{ packs of red} = 3 \times 20 + 4 \times 20 = 60 + 80 = 140 \text{ beads} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:

"First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven. Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour. Therefore, the total temperature increase from the oven is:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, let's calculate the temperature decrease due to the window. Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Therefore, the total temperature decrease from the window is:

\[ \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 3 \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 6 \text{ degrees} \]

Now, we can find the final temperature by adding the temperature increase from the oven to the initial temperature and then subtracting the temperature decrease from the window:

"First, let's convert all times to minutes for easier calculation:
- Jon's total time: \(40 + 100 + 50 = 190\) minutes.
- James' swim time: \(40 \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36\) minutes.
- James' bike time: \(100 + 5 = 105\) minutes.
- James' run time: unknown, let's call it \(R\) minutes.

James' total time is the sum of his swim, bike, and run times:
\[36 + 105 + R = 141 + R\]

We know that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James' total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[141 + R = 190 + 10\]
\[141 + R = 200\]
\[R = 200 - 141\]
\[R = 59\]

So, James took 59 minutes to do the run. The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine how many miles the horse runs. The horse runs at a speed of 32 miles per hour for 30 minutes, which is half an hour. Therefore, the distance the horse runs is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 32 \, \text{MPH} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 16 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of hay the horse eats. Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, the total amount of hay eaten is:

\[ \text{Total Hay} = 16 \, \text{miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \, \text{bail/mile} = 8 \, \text{bails} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the hay. Since each bail of hay costs $3, the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 8 \, \text{bails} \times 3 \, \text{dollars/bail} = 24 \, \text{dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which means he has a total of:

\[ \text{Total Money} = 6 \times 5 = 30 \, \text{dollars} \]

The change Michael has after buying the hay is:

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 21 - 15 - P = 2 \]
\[ 6 - P = 2 \]
\[ P = 6 - 2 \]
\[ P = 4 \]

The regular price of the popcorn is $4.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the original cost per balloon.
2. Calculate the new cost per balloon after the price increase.
3. Compute the total cost for 170 balloons at the new price.

First, let's find the original cost per balloon. The total cost for 20 balloons was $900. Therefore, the cost per balloon was:
\[ \text{Original cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Two days later, the cost per balloon increased by $20. So, the new cost per balloon is:

"To find the average speed of the car during the entire trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance for each segment of the trip:
- For the first segment, the car travels at 60 mph for 2 hours. The distance is \(60 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles}\).
- For the second segment, the car travels at 30 mph for 1 hour. The distance is \(30 \text{ mph} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 30 \text{ miles}\).

The total distance traveled is \(120 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 150 \text{ miles}\).

The total time taken for the trip is \(2 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} = 3 \text{ hours}\).

The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time:
\[
\text{Average speed} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ mph}
\]

So, the car's average speed during the trip is \(50 \text{ mph}\)."
"First, let's determine how many sapphires Jenna has left after the trade. Jenna starts with 8 sapphires and trades 3 of them, so she has:

\[ 8 - 3 = 5 \text{ sapphires} \]

Next, we calculate the value of the sapphires Jenna has left. Since each sapphire is worth $800, the value of the 5 sapphires is:

\[ 5 \times 800 = 4000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to determine how many rubies Jenna has after the trade. She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies, so she has 2 rubies. Since each ruby is worth $1200, the value of the 2 rubies is:

\[ 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the value of the sapphires and the rubies to find the total value of all her jewels:

"First, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the raised bed) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

For one raised bed, the volume is:

\[ V = 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:

\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 \, \text{cubic feet} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet per bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{dollars per bag} = 1920 \, \text{dollars} \]

Thus, the total cost for the potting soil is:

"First, let's determine the number of green cards. We know that there are 15 red cards and that the number of green cards is 60% more than the number of red cards.

The number of green cards can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Number of green cards} = \text{Number of red cards} + 0.60 \times \text{Number of red cards} \]
\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + 0.60 \times 15 \]
\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + 9 \]
\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 24 \]

Next, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards:
\[ \text{Number of yellow cards} = \text{Number of red cards} + \text{Number of green cards} \]
\[ \text{Number of yellow cards} = 15 + 24 \]
\[ \text{Number of yellow cards} = 39 \]

Now, we can find the total number of cards by adding the number of red, green, and yellow cards:

"First, let's determine how many fairies Katelyn's friend saw. Katelyn saw 50 fairies, and her friend saw half as many. Therefore, her friend saw:

\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ fairies} \]

Next, we add these 25 fairies to the original 50 fairies that Katelyn saw. This gives us the total number of fairies before any flew away:

\[ 50 + 25 = 75 \text{ fairies} \]

Then, 30 fairies flew away. To find out how many fairies remain, we subtract the 30 fairies that flew away from the total of 75 fairies:

\[ 75 - 30 = 45 \text{ fairies} \]

So, the final number of fairies remaining is:

"First, we need to find the total number of puppies. Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, so the total number of puppies is:
\[ 8 + 12 = 20 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. Jennifer's dog has 3 spotted puppies and Brandon's dog has 4 spotted puppies, so the total number of spotted puppies is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we use the formula for percentage:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of Spotted Puppies}}{\text{Total Number of Puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 \]

Calculating the fraction:
\[ \frac{7}{20} = 0.35 \]

Then, converting to a percentage:
\[ 0.35 \times 100 = 35\% \]

So, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is:
\[ 35\% \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 35 \]"
"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of the feed.

1. **Sugar Cubes:**
   - 2 boxes, each 1 pound.
   - Total weight = 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

2. **Carrots:**
   - 4 bags, each 12 pounds.
   - Total weight = 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

3. **Hay:**
   - 42 bales, each 75 pounds.
   - Total weight = 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

4. **Oats:**
   - 20 sacks, each 65 pounds.
   - Total weight = 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

Now, we sum the weights of all the feed items to find the total weight:
\[ 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 \text{ pounds} \]

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find the number of trips needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since partial trips are not possible):
\[ \frac{4500}{2250} = 2 \]

Since 2250 pounds is exactly half of 4500 pounds, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"To determine how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate her weekly earnings and then multiply by four.

First, let's calculate her weekly earnings from aluminum cans:
- Each aluminum can is worth 2 cents.

"To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion. First, we need to find out how many kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both.

The number of kids allergic to dairy is 9.
The number of kids allergic to peanuts is 6.
The number of kids allergic to both is 3.

Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion, the number of kids allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Allergic to dairy or peanuts} = \text{Allergic to dairy} + \text{Allergic to peanuts} - \text{Allergic to both} \]
\[ \text{Allergic to dairy or peanuts} = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both. Since there are 32 kids in total, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:
\[ \text{Not allergic to anything} = \text{Total kids} - \text{Allergic to dairy or peanuts} \]
\[ \text{Not allergic to anything} = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

\[ 2 \times 4.00 = 8.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we apply the buy one get one free offer. This means for every pack of razors Heather buys, she gets another pack for free. So, for 2 packs, she only pays for 1 pack:
\[ 1 \times 4.00 = 4.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we apply the $2.00 coupon to the discounted price:
\[ 4.00 - 2.00 = 2.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Heather is buying 2 packs of razors, which contain 8 razors (2 packs * 4 razors per pack), the cost per razor is:
\[ \frac{2.00}{8} = 0.25 \text{ dollars} \]

To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.25 \times 100 = 25 \text{ cents} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 25 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total height of the human pyramid by summing the heights of all the cheerleaders involved. We know that 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall, and the 10th cheerleader is 60 inches tall.

First, let's calculate the total height of the 9 cheerleaders who are 64 inches tall:
\[ 9 \times 64 = 576 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we add the height of the 10th cheerleader who is 60 inches tall:
\[ 576 + 60 = 636 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to convert the total height from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot:
\[ \frac{636}{12} = 53 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height of the human pyramid is:
\[ 53 \text{ feet} \]

In a separate line, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 53 \]"
"Charisma gets up and walks for 5 minutes every hour she works. Since she works for 8 hours each day, the number of minutes she walks each day is:

\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ minutes/hour} = 40 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Over 5 days, the total number of minutes she walks is:

\[ 40 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 200 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Brett's age in four years:**
   - Brett is currently 14 years old.
   - In four years, Brett will be \( 14 + 4 = 18 \) years old.

2. **Set up the equation for Angela's age in four years:**
   - According to the problem, in four years Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now.
   - Brett is currently 14 years old, so three times his current age is \( 3 \times 14 = 42 \).
   - Therefore, in four years, Angela will be 42 years old.

3. **Determine Angela's current age:**
   - If Angela will be 42 years old in four years, her current age is \( 42 - 4 = 38 \).

So, Angela is currently 38 years old.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of his morning and afternoon rides separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the cost of the morning rides:
- Paul drives in the morning twice a day.
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- He drives for 14 days.

The total number of morning rides in 14 days is:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ morning rides} \]

The total cost for the morning rides is:
\[ 28 \text{ rides} \times 6 \text{ dollars/ride} = 168 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the afternoon rides:
- Paul drives in the afternoon twice a day.
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- He drives for 14 days.

The total number of afternoon rides in 14 days is:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ afternoon rides} \]

The total cost for the afternoon rides is:
\[ 28 \text{ rides} \times 2 \text{ dollars/ride} = 56 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we sum the costs of the morning and afternoon rides to find the total amount spent:
\[ 168 \text{ dollars} + 56 \text{ dollars} = 224 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is:

"First, let's determine how many oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box, so:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, let's add the total number of oranges brought by both Brianne and Ashley:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Since one Greek orange pie needs three oranges, the number of pies they can make is:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ oranges}}{3 \text{ oranges/pie}} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 40 \]"
"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let's denote the number of guests by \( n \).

**Cost at the first venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Cost of food per guest: $5
- Total cost at the first venue: \( 200 + 5n \)

**Cost at the second venue:**
- Cost per guest: $25
- Cost of food per guest: $5 (already included in the price)
- Total cost at the second venue: \( 25n \)

We need to find the value of \( n \) for which the costs at both venues are equal. Therefore, we set the two cost equations equal to each other:

\[ 200 + 5n = 25n \]

Next, we solve for \( n \):

1. Subtract \( 5n \) from both sides of the equation:
   \[ 200 = 25n - 5n \]
   \[ 200 = 20n \]

2. Divide both sides by 20:
   \[ n = \frac{200}{20} \]
   \[ n = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \( 10 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \( D \). According to the problem, Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects. Additionally, David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects. The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ D = 9 \]

So, David found 9 insects. Since Lily found 7 more than David, Lily found:

\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Therefore, the number of insects Lily found is 16.

\[
\boxed{16}

"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to calculate the total amount of yarn used by both of them and then convert that into yards.

Mariah used \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a skein of yarn, and her grandma used \(\frac{1}{2}\) of a skein of yarn. Together, they used:

\[
\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4}
\]

of a skein of yarn.

Since there are 364 yards in a skein of yarn, the total number of yards they used is:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 364 = \frac{3 \times 364}{4} = \frac{1092}{4} = 273
\]

So, the total number of yards of yarn they used altogether is 273 yards."
"First, let's calculate the number of gifts Cherrie buys for her 5 friends. 

For the 2 friends who want 5 gifts each:

For the 3 friends who want 2 gifts each:
\[ 3 \text{ friends} \times 2 \text{ gifts per friend} = 6 \text{ gifts} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of gifts for her friends:
\[ 10 \text{ gifts} + 6 \text{ gifts} = 16 \text{ gifts} \]

Cherrie also decides to buy 10 more random gifts as a surprise. 

Adding these to the gifts for her friends:
\[ 16 \text{ gifts} + 10 \text{ gifts} = 26 \text{ gifts} \]

So, the total number of gifts Cherrie buys is:

"First, let's determine the width of the rug. Since the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair and the chair is 3 feet wide, the width of the rug is:

\[ \text{Width of the rug} = \text{Width of the chair} + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the length of the couch. The problem states that the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Since the width of the rug is 8 feet, twice the width of the rug is:

\[ 2 \times \text{Width of the rug} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the length of the couch is:

\[ \text{Length of the couch} = 2 \times \text{Width of the rug} + 2 = 16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet} \]

So, the length of the couch is 18 feet."

The total cost of the gum can be expressed as:
\[ 2S + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his sled dogs, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
2. Determine the number of pairs of legs (since each pair of snowshoes is for one pair of legs).
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of pairs of legs.

First, we know that each dog has 4 legs and there are 6 dogs:
\[ 4 \text{ legs/dog} \times 6 \text{ dogs} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Since each pair of snowshoes covers one pair of legs, we need to find out how many pairs of legs there are:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs/pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs of legs} \]

Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, so the total cost for 12 pairs of snowshoes is:
\[ 12 \text{ pairs} \times 12 \text{ dollars/pair} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of Janet's current bus trips. She takes two bus trips each day and does this five days a week. Therefore, the total number of bus trips she takes in a week is:

\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 10 \text{ trips/week} \]

Since each bus trip costs her $2.20, the total cost for her current bus trips in a week is:

\[ 10 \text{ trips/week} \times \$2.20/\text{trip} = \$22.00 \text{ per week} \]

Next, we compare this to the cost of buying a weekly bus pass, which is $20. The savings from buying the bus pass instead of paying for each trip individually is:

\[ \$22.00 - \$20.00 = \$2.00 \]

So, Janet would save $2.00 by buying the weekly bus pass."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Farm's Cows and Sheep:**
   - The farm has 30 cows.
   - The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has \(2 \times 30 = 60\) cows.

2. **Zoo's Cows and Sheep:**
   - The zoo has 20 sheep.
   - The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has \(\frac{20}{2} = 10\) sheep.

3. **Total Animals:**
   - The farm has 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.
   - The zoo has 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.
   - Combined, the farm and zoo have 40 + 80 = 120 animals.

"To determine how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we start by understanding the relationship between the quantities bought by Sophia and Rose. According to the problem, Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.

Given:
- Rose bought 12 onions.
- Rose bought 4 potatoes.

Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as \( S_o \) and the number of potatoes Sophia bought as \( S_p \).

From the problem, we know:
\[ 4 \times (S_o + S_p) = 12 + 4 \]

First, we calculate the total number of onions and potatoes Rose bought:
\[ 12 + 4 = 16 \]

Now, we set up the equation:
\[ 4 \times (S_o + S_p) = 16 \]

To find \( S_o + S_p \), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ S_o + S_p = \frac{16}{4} = 4 \]

Therefore, Sophia bought a total of 4 onions and potatoes. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we first need to calculate the total number of calories he needs to burn to lose 30 pounds. Given that he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose one pound, the total calories he needs to burn to lose 30 pounds is:

\[ 3500 \text{ calories/pound} \times 30 \text{ pounds} = 105000 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to determine the number of days from December 31st to July 19th. Counting the days:

- December has 31 days, so from December 31st to December 19th is 19 days.
- January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 19th is 19 days.
- February has 28 days in a non-leap year, so from February 1st to February 19th is 19 days.
- March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 19th is 19 days.
- April has 30 days, so from April 1st to April 19th is 19 days.
- May has 31 days, so from May 1st to May 19th is 19 days.
- June has 30 days, so from June 1st to June 19th is 19 days.
- July 1st to July 19th is 19 days.

Adding these up, the total number of days from December 31st to July 19th is:

\[ 19 + 19 + 19 + 19 + 19 + 19 + 19 + 19 = 152 \text{ days} \]

Now, to find the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve, we divide the total calories he needs to burn by the number of days:

\[ \frac{105000 \text{ calories}}{152 \text{ days}} \approx 690.13 \text{ calories/day} \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, Andy needs to have a daily calorie deficit of approximately 690 calories to reach his goal. Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, the house cost three times as much as the lot, so we can write:

\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]

Combining like terms, we have:

\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

To find \( L \), we divide both sides by 4:

\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000 \]

Now that we know the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):

\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000 \]

So, the cost of the house is $90,000.

**Before adding the new device:**
- Daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour
- Cost per kilowatt per hour: $1.50
- Daily cost: \( 12 \times 1.50 = 18 \) dollars

**After adding the new device:**
- Daily consumption: 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour
- Cost per kilowatt per hour: $1.50
- Daily cost: \( 14 \times 1.50 = 21 \) dollars

Next, let's calculate the weekly cost for both scenarios.

**Weekly cost before adding the new device:**
- Weekly cost: \( 18 \times 7 = 126 \) dollars

**Weekly cost after adding the new device:**
- Weekly cost: \( 21 \times 7 = 147 \) dollars

Finally, let's find the difference between the weekly electric bills before and after adding the new device.

**Difference:**
- Difference: \( 147 - 126 = 21 \) dollars

The difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is \(\boxed{21}\) dollars."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which the people can paint and then scale it up for 5 people.

1. First, let's find out how much one person can paint in one day. Since one person can paint half a house in 5 days, one person can paint:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \text{ house} \div 5 \text{ days} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ house per day}
   \]

2. Now, if one person can paint \(\frac{1}{10}\) of a house in one day, then 5 people can paint:
   \[
   5 \times \frac{1}{10} \text{ house per day} = \frac{5}{10} \text{ house per day} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ house per day}
   \]

3. This means that 5 people can paint half a house in one day. Therefore, to paint a whole house, it would take:
   \[
   \frac{1 \text{ house}}{\frac{1}{2} \text{ house per day}} = 2 \text{ days}
   \]

4. Since there are 24 hours in a day, the number of hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house is:
   \[
   2 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours per day} = 48 \text{ hours}
   \]

The final numerical answer is 48 hours."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ophelia has 20 sofas.
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. Therefore, Ophelia has \(20 + 2 = 22\) chairs.
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. So, Jenna has \(3 \times 22 = 66\) chairs.
4. Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, Ophelia also has 22 sofas (as calculated earlier).
5. Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so Jenna has \(66 - 2 = 64\) sofas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have together:

- Ophelia's total: \(20\) sofas + \(22\) chairs = \(42\)
- Jenna's total: \(64\) sofas + \(66\) chairs = \(130\)

Adding their totals together:

\[42 + 130 = 172\]

The total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have is \(\boxed{172}\)."
"To determine how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had not purchased the headphone set, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of the headphone set.
2. Determine the amount of money Tom would have had if he did not buy the headphone set.
3. Calculate how many CDs he could have bought with that amount of money.

First, we know that Tom paid $48 in total and that the CD cost $4. Therefore, the cost of the headphone set is:
\[ 48 - 4 = 44 \]

If Tom had not bought the headphone set, he would have had:
\[ 48 - 44 = 4 \]

With $4, we can determine how many CDs he could have bought. Since each CD costs $4, he could buy:
\[ \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

So, Tom would have been able to buy 1 more CD if he had not bought the headphone set. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1 \]"
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we need to account for the hours he worked out each week, including the exceptions.

First, let's calculate the total hours for the weeks where he worked out 4 hours each week:
\[ 4 \text{ hours/week} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 24 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we add the hours from the two weeks where he worked out 5 hours each week:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

Then, we add the hours from the week where he worked out 6 hours:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/week} \times 1 \text{ week} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we sum all these hours together:
\[ 24 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:
\[ 40 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

**First Stop:**
- 8 people get off the bus.
- The number of people who get on the bus is 5 times the number who got off, which is \(5 \times 8 = 40\).

So, after the first stop:
- People on the bus: \(48 - 8 + 40 = 70\).

**Second Stop:**
- 21 people get off the bus.
- The number of people who get on the bus is 3 times fewer than those who got off, which means they get on \(21 \div 3 = 7\) people.

So, after the second stop:
- People on the bus: \(70 - 21 + 7 = 56\).

The final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is 56."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, Jame's current age is \( 27 - 5 = 22 \) years.

2. **Determine the cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 22 + 8 = 30 \) years old.
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \).
   - Therefore, Jame's cousin will be \( 60 - 5 = 55 \) years old in 8 years.

3. **Determine the cousin's current age:**
   - If Jame's cousin will be 55 in 8 years, then the cousin's current age is \( 55 - 8 = 47 \) years.

4. **Calculate the age difference between Jame and his cousin:**
   - Jame is currently 22 years old.
   - Jame's cousin is currently 47 years old.
   - The age difference is \( 47 - 22 = 25 \) years.

"Let's break down the information given:

- The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400.
- The computer costs $1,100.
- The printer costs $400 less than the computer, so the printer costs $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the computer and the printer:
- Cost of the computer: $1,100
- Cost of the printer: $700
- Total cost of the computer and the printer: $1,100 + $700 = $1,800

Since the total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400, we can find the total cost of the 2 monitors by subtracting the total cost of the computer and the printer from the total cost:
- Total cost of the computer and the printer: $1,800
- Total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer: $2,400
- Total cost of the 2 monitors: $2,400 - $1,800 = $600

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the total cost of the 2 monitors by 2:
- Total cost of the 2 monitors: $600
- Cost of one monitor: $600 / 2 = $300

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is $300.

The final numerical answer is:
300"
"To find out how many seashells each girl brought, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of boys and girls.
2. Calculate the total number of seashells brought by the boys.
3. Use the information about the seashells brought by the girls to find out how many each girl brought.

First, since there are 20 kids in total and they are divided into two equal groups of girls and boys, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

Next, each boy brought back 60 seashells. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is:
\[ 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

The problem states that each girl brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. So, each girl brought:
\[ 60 + 4 \times 60 = 60 + 240 = 300 \]

Thus, each girl brought 300 seashells. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"If George has 3 candies left after eating 5, it means George originally had 3 + 5 = 8 candies.

"First, let's determine Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, we can calculate Alyana's age as follows:

\[ \text{Alyana's age} = \text{Chenny's age} - 4 = 10 - 4 = 6 \]

Next, we need to find Anne's age. Since Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, we can calculate Anne's age as follows:

\[ \text{Anne's age} = \text{Alyana's age} + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8 \]

Therefore, Anne is 8 years old. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 8 \]"
"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and then sum them up.

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so its thickness is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so its thickness is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm.

Now, we sum the thicknesses of all four books:
\[31 + 50 + 45 + 62\]

Let's calculate the sum:
\[31 + 50 = 81\]
\[81 + 45 = 126\]
\[126 + 62 = 188\]

Therefore, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps.

1. **Determine the total savings for the month:**
   Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125.

2. **Assume the number of days in April:**
   April has 30 days.

3. **Define variables:**
   Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves in the first half of the month.
   Therefore, he saves \( 2x \) in the second half of the month.

4. **Set up the equation:**
   The total savings for the month is the sum of the savings in the first and second halves:
   \[
   x + 2x = 1125
   \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   3x = 1125
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{1125}{3}
   \]
   \[
   x = 375
   \]

6. **Determine the savings for the second half of the month:**
   Since \( x = 375 \), the savings in the second half of the month is:
   \[
   2x = 2 \times 375 = 750

"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars. The total amount of money is $100, so we can write the equation:

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets $20. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's amount as:

\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets $80. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Rewriting**: Elise writes the entire alphabet twice.
   - The alphabet has 26 letters.
   - Therefore, writing it twice means \(26 \times 2 = 52\) letters.

2. **Second Rewriting**: Elise writes half of the alphabet once.
   - Half of the alphabet is \(26 / 2 = 13\) letters.
   - Therefore, writing half of the alphabet once means \(13\) letters.

3. **Third Rewriting**: Elise rewrites everything she has already written.
   - This includes the two full alphabets and the half alphabet.
   - The total number of letters already written is \(52 + 13 = 65\).
   - Rewriting everything means writing \(65\) letters again.

Now, we sum up all the letters written:
- First rewriting: \(52\) letters.
- Second rewriting: \(13\) letters.
- Third rewriting: \(65\) letters.

Adding these together:
\[ 52 + 13 + 65 = 130 \]

Therefore, the total number of letters Elise has written is \(\boxed{130}\)."

"First, let's determine the daily recommended cups of coffee for Octavia. Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, if we denote the daily recommended cups of coffee as \( R \), then Octavia drinks \( \frac{R}{2} \) cups of coffee.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks. Therefore, Juan drinks \( 10 \times \frac{R}{2} = 5R \) cups of coffee.

According to Juan's doctor, Juan's coffee intake should be reduced to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. This means Juan needs to reduce his coffee intake from \( 5R \) cups to 4 cups.

To find out by how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we calculate the difference between his current intake and the recommended intake:
\[ 5R - 4 \]

Since \( R \) is the daily recommended cups of coffee, the reduction Juan needs to make is:
\[ 5R - 4 \]

However, without the specific value of \( R \), we can't provide a numerical answer. If we assume \( R = 4 \) (a common daily recommended amount), then:
\[ 5 \times 4 - 4 = 20 - 4 = 16 \]

Therefore, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 16 \]"
"To find the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then add them together.

For the hamsters:
3 cages * 10 hamsters per cage = 30 hamsters

For the guinea pigs:
3 cages * 5 guinea pigs per cage = 15 guinea pigs

Now, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs together:
30 hamsters + 15 guinea pigs = 45 rodents

The final numerical answer is 45."
"First, let's determine the weights of Susan and Bob.

Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark. Since Mark weighs 150 pounds, Susan's weight is:
\[ 150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds} \]

Bob weighs twice as much as Susan. Since Susan weighs 130 pounds, Bob's weight is:
\[ 2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we can find the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob. The average weight is calculated by summing their weights and dividing by the number of people (which is 3 in this case):
\[ \text{Average weight} = \frac{150 + 130 + 260}{3} = \frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 180 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the angle the sun makes with the ground after moving for 10 hours and the angle the pyramid makes with the ground.

Initially, the sun is at the tip of the pyramid, which is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground. The sun moves upward at a rate of 5 degrees per hour. Over 10 hours, the sun will move upward by:

\[ 5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the angle of the sun from the ground after 10 hours will be the sum of the initial angle and the angle it has moved upward:

\[ 32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 82 \]"
"To determine how much James spends on candles, we first need to find out how many candles he needs in total.

1. Determine the ages of the sons:
   - The older son is 12 years old.
   - The younger son is 4 years younger, so the younger son is \(12 - 4 = 8\) years old.

2. Calculate the total number of candles needed:
   - James needs one candle for each son, so he needs \(12 + 8 = 20\) candles.

3. Determine how many packs of candles are needed:
   - Each pack contains 5 candles.
   - To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack: \(20 \div 5 = 4\) packs.

4. Calculate the total cost:
   - Each pack costs $3.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 4 packs is \(4 \times 3 = 12\).

James spends $12 on candles."
"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the pages read in the first week and add it to the pages read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week. She read for 15 minutes each night for 7 nights, so the total reading time in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pages she can read in 105 minutes. Since she can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, we first find out how many 1.5-minute intervals are in 105 minutes:
\[ \frac{105 \text{ minutes}}{1.5 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 70 \text{ intervals} \]

Since she reads 2 pages in each 1.5-minute interval, the total number of pages read in the first week is:
\[ 70 \text{ intervals} \times 2 \text{ pages/interval} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

Now, we know that in the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many sandwiches Cody ate. Cody ate a third of the 12 sandwiches:

\[
\text{Sandwiches eaten by Cody} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
\]

Next, we calculate how many sandwiches Trevor ate. Trevor ate a quarter of the 12 sandwiches:

\[
\text{Sandwiches eaten by Trevor} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3
\]

Now, we add the sandwiches eaten by Cody and Trevor to find the total number of sandwiches they ate together:

\[
\text{Total sandwiches eaten} = 4 + 3 = 7
\]

Finally, we subtract the total number of sandwiches eaten from the original number of sandwiches to find out how many are left:

\[
\text{Sandwiches left} = 12 - 7 = 5
\]

The final numerical answer is:

\[
5

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equation based on the information given.

Let \( S \) be Shiloh's current age, and let \( N \) be his nephew's current age.

From the problem, we know:
1. Shiloh is currently 44 years old, so \( S = 44 \).
2. In 7 years, Shiloh will be \( 44 + 7 = 51 \) years old.
3. In 7 years, his nephew will be \( N + 7 \) years old.
4. At that time, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   51 = 3 \times (N + 7)
   \]

Now, let's solve for \( N \):
\[
51 = 3 \times (N + 7)
\]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[
17 = N + 7
\]
Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[
N = 10
\]

So, his nephew is currently 10 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Tooth:**
   - The tooth fairy left $5.00.

2. **Next Three Teeth:**
   - For each of these teeth, the tooth fairy gave $1.00.
   - Therefore, for three teeth, the total amount is \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.

3. **Last Two Teeth:**
   - For the first of the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of the previous three teeth, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 1 = 0.5 \) dollars.
   - For the second of the last two teeth, the tooth fairy again gave half the amount of the previous three teeth, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 1 = 0.5 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, for the last two teeth, the total amount is \(0.5 + 0.5 = 1\) dollar.

Now, let's sum up all the amounts:
- First tooth: $5.00
- Next three teeth: $3.00
- Last two teeth: $1.00

Total amount = \(5.00 + 3.00 + 1.00 = 9.00\)

The tooth fairy left Sharon a total of \(\boxed{9.00}\) dollars."
"To find out how many goals all three teenagers scored, we need to determine the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna based on the information given about Richie.

First, we know that Richie scored 80 goals. According to the problem, Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. Therefore, we can calculate the number of goals Mark scored as follows:
\[ \text{Goals scored by Mark} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 20 = 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Next, we know that Richie also scored 45 more goals than Anna. Therefore, we can calculate the number of goals Anna scored as follows:
\[ \text{Goals scored by Anna} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 45 = 80 - 45 = 35 \]

Now, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers by adding the goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna:
\[ \text{Total goals} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} + \text{Goals scored by Mark} + \text{Goals scored by Anna} = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 \]

Thus, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is:
\[ \boxed{175} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Mitchell made selling lemonade.

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 each, so the total amount Mitchell made is:
\[ 21 \text{ lemonades} \times \$4 \text{ per lemonade} = \$84 \]

Liam claimed to have made $63. To find out how many more dollars Mitchell made than Liam, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings:
\[ \$84 - \$63 = \$21 \]

So, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam that weekend.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$21 \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Peter spends on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. Since he spends an equal amount each day and there are 4 days (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday) during which he buys wooden action figures, we can calculate the total amount spent on wooden action figures as follows:

\[ \text{Total spent on wooden action figures} = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Peter started with $70, so after buying the wooden action figures, he has:

\[ \text{Remaining money} = 70 - 20 = 50 \]

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Sunday), he will buy plastic action figures. There are 3 days (Thursday, Friday, and Saturday) during which he buys plastic action figures. The cost of each plastic action figure is $2, so the total amount spent on plastic action figures is:

\[ \text{Total spent on plastic action figures} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

After buying the plastic action figures, the remaining money Peter has is:

\[ \text{Remaining money after plastic action figures} = 50 - 6 = 44 \]

Now, we need to determine how many plastic action figures he can buy with the remaining $44. Since each plastic action figure costs $2, the number of plastic action figures he can buy is:

\[ \text{Number of plastic action figures} = \frac{44}{2} = 22 \]

From Sunday through Wednesday, he bought wooden action figures. Since each wooden action figure costs $5, the number of wooden action figures he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of wooden action figures} = \frac{20}{5} = 4 \]

Therefore, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is:

\[ \text{Total number of action figures} = 4 + 22 = 26 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 26 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the spaying procedure:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage error in Maggie's oven and then apply that same percentage to the 520 degrees she needs for her recipe.

First, let's calculate the percentage error when the oven is set to 450 degrees and the actual temperature is 468 degrees.

The error is:
\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage error is:
\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

Now, we need to apply this 4% error to the 520 degrees required for her recipe.

The increase in temperature due to the error is:
\[ 520 \times \frac{4}{100} = 520 \times 0.04 = 20 \]

"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch both movies, we need to add the duration of the first movie to the duration of the second movie.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Converting this to minutes:
1 hour = 60 minutes
So, 1 hour and 30 minutes = 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting this to minutes:
2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes
So, 2 hours and 5 minutes = 120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes.

90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is 215 minutes."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we first need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and then subtract that from Herb's price.

Herb's house price = $76,000

30% of Herb's house price = 0.30 * $76,000 = $22,800

Juan's house price = Herb's house price - 30% of Herb's house price
Juan's house price = $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

Now, we add the prices of both houses to find the combined value:

Combined value = Herb's house price + Juan's house price
Combined value = $76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200

The value of the two houses combined is $129,200."
"First, let's determine the number of cups and dishes Judy initially bought.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups.

She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.

At the event, her friend brought 40 cups. Since Judy initially bought 12 cups, her friend brought \(40 - 12 = 28\) more cups than Judy bought.

Her friend also brought 20 more dishes than Judy's initial purchase of 24 dishes. Therefore, her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend.

Judy's total cups: \(12\) (initial) + \(28\) (friend) = \(40\) cups.
Judy's total dishes: \(24\) (initial) + \(44\) (friend) = \(68\) dishes.

The total number of utensils (cups and dishes) brought by the two is:
\[40 \text{ cups} + 68 \text{ dishes} = 108 \text{ utensils}\]

"First, let's determine the cost of one box of contacts after the discount. The original price of one box is $100.00, and there is a 10% discount.

The discount amount is:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the discounted price of one box is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost for the 2 boxes is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Next, we need to determine how many pairs of contacts Pete will get with 2 boxes. Since each box contains 90 single use contacts, 2 boxes will contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ contacts} \]

Since each pair of contacts consists of 2 contacts, the number of pairs Pete will get is:
\[ \frac{180}{2} = 90 \text{ pairs} \]

Finally, to find the cost per pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the number of pairs:
\[ \frac{180.00}{90} = 2.00 \]

So, the cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ 2.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total hours Jill worked.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so:
\[ \text{Total hours Jill worked} = 2 + 1 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total hours John worked. John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday and three times as long as Jill on Sunday.

On Saturday, John worked:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

On Sunday, John worked:
\[ 3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total hours John worked is:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the earnings for both Jill and John. They both earn $10 per hour.

Jill's earnings:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

John's earnings:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 70 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings:
\[ 70 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

So, John earned $40 more than Jill. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total calories burned by Hannah during her workout.

For the aerobics:
- She spends 2 hours doing aerobics.
- Aerobics burn 500 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from aerobics = 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.

For the running:
- She spends 1 hour running.
- Running burns 600 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from running = 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.

Now, let's add the calories burned from both activities to get the total calories burned:
- Total calories burned = calories burned from aerobics + calories burned from running
- Total calories burned = 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories.

Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. To find out how many ml of water she needs to drink for 1600 calories, we can set up a proportion:
- For 200 calories, she drinks 100 ml.
- For 1600 calories, she drinks \( x \) ml.

The proportion can be written as:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{100 \text{ ml}} = \frac{1600 \text{ calories}}{x \text{ ml}} \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{1600 \text{ calories} \times 100 \text{ ml}}{200 \text{ calories}} \]
\[ x = \frac{160000 \text{ ml}}{200} \]
\[ x = 800 \text{ ml} \]

So, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the note, the number of red jelly beans is 1% less than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \). Similarly, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of the red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \), we find:
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
- The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \).
- The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \).

The difference between the number of green and red jelly beans is:
\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 30 \]"
"First, let's determine the increase in Jared's typing speed. He starts at 47 WPM and increases to 52 WPM after some lessons. The increase in speed is:

\[ 52 - 47 = 5 \text{ WPM} \]

Next, if he continues to increase his typing speed by 5 words per minute, his new speed will be:

\[ 52 + 5 = 57 \text{ WPM} \]

Now, we need to find the average of the three measurements: 47 WPM, 52 WPM, and 57 WPM. The average is calculated by summing these values and dividing by the number of measurements:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{47 + 52 + 57}{3} \]

Let's calculate the sum:

\[ 47 + 52 + 57 = 156 \]

Now, divide the sum by 3:

The difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options is 2.5 pounds."
"To determine the total number of seats Alex needs, we need to calculate the number of attendees based on the invitations and the additional guests.

1. **Initial Invitations:**
   - Alex invites 100 people.
   - Each of these 100 people invites 2 friends.
   - Total additional guests from initial invitations = \(100 \times 2 = 200\).

2. **Additional Invitations:**
   - Alex calls 10 friends.
   - 8 of these 10 friends bring their spouses.
   - Total additional guests from these 10 friends = \(8\) (since spouses are considered as additional guests).

Now, we sum up all the attendees:
- Initial attendees: 100
- Additional guests from initial invitations: 200
- Additional guests from calling friends: 8

Total number of seats needed = \(100 + 200 + 8 = 308\).

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost for the boots on Amazon.com:
- The cost of the boots on Amazon.com is $16.
- The shipping cost on Amazon.com is $4.
- Therefore, the total cost on Amazon.com is $16 + $4 = $20.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the boots on eBay:
- The cost of the boots on eBay is $13.
- The shipping cost on eBay is twice the shipping cost on Amazon.com. Since the shipping cost on Amazon.com is $4, the shipping cost on eBay is 2 * $4 = $8.
- Therefore, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

Now, let's find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon.com:
- The total cost on eBay is $21.
- The total cost on Amazon.com is $20.
- The difference in cost is $21 - $20 = $1.

"To determine how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms every day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Calculate the total protein intake per week.

First, we know that 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein. Therefore, the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Protein per 200 grams} = \left(\frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams of mushrooms}}\right) \times 200 \text{ grams of mushrooms} = 6 \text{ grams of protein} \]

Next, we calculate the total protein intake per week. Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, the protein intake per day is 6 grams. Therefore, the protein intake per week is:
\[ \text{Protein per week} = 6 \text{ grams/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 42 \]"
"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Expanding and simplifying the equation:
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
\[ J - 2J = -10 \]
\[ -J = -10 \]
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work for George.

1. The base price for each implant is $2000.
2. George needs 2 implants, so the cost for the implants is:
   \[
   2 \times 2000 = 4000 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. So, the additional cost for the porcelain crown is $500.
4. The total cost for the dental work is:
   \[
   4000 + 500 = 4500 \text{ dollars}
   \]
5. George has already put down a deposit of $600. Therefore, the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
   \[
   4500 - 600 = 3900 \text{ dollars}
   \]
6. George makes $15 per hour at work. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
   \[
   \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \text{ hours}

"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees, and the other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees. The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees and \( 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees. The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The measure of the largest angle in the triangle is \(\boxed{90}\) degrees."
"First, let's determine how many gumballs Colby can buy based on the value of his coins.

- Quarters: 8 quarters * $0.25 = $2.00
- Dimes: 6 dimes * $0.10 = $0.60
- Nickels: 14 nickels * $0.05 = $0.70
- Pennies: 15 pennies * $0.01 = $0.15

Total value of Colby's coins: $2.00 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45

Since each gumball costs a nickel, which is $0.05, we can calculate the number of gumballs he can buy by dividing the total value of his coins by the cost of one gumball:

Number of gumballs = $3.45 / $0.05 = 69

So, Colby can buy 69 gumballs."
"To determine the total number of legs in the pet store, we need to consider the number of legs each type of pet has and then multiply by the number of each type of pet.

- Dogs have 4 legs each.
- Cats have 4 legs each.
- Birds have 2 legs each.

Given:
- There are 5 dogs.
- There are 2 cats.
- There are 10 birds.

Now, we calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the plane. The speed is calculated by dividing the distance by the time taken.

Given:
- Distance traveled = 1200 miles
- Time taken = 3 hours

Speed of the plane = \(\frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour}\).

Next, we need to find out how many additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same speed.

Additional distance to be traveled = 2000 miles

Time required to travel 2000 miles at 400 miles per hour = \(\frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}\).

So, the additional hours required to travel the additional 2000 miles is 5 hours.

"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we can calculate the hourly rate for Ruiz as follows:

\[ \text{Ruiz's hourly rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. According to the problem, Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we can calculate the amount Marissa makes in one hour as follows:

\[ \text{Marissa's hourly rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 60 \text{ pounds per hour} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of chocolates Ruiz and Marissa make together in 12 hours. First, we calculate the total amount Ruiz makes in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Ruiz's total in 12 hours} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Marissa makes in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Marissa's total in 12 hours} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

"First, let's determine the total number of rotations the tires go through in a month. We know that for every 2 miles driven, the tires rotate 725 times. Jeremy drives 400 miles a month.

The number of rotations per mile is:
\[ \frac{725 \text{ rotations}}{2 \text{ miles}} = 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} \]

So, for 400 miles, the total number of rotations is:
\[ 400 \text{ miles} \times 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} = 145,000 \text{ rotations per month} \]

Next, we need to find out how many months it will take for the tires to reach 10,440,000 rotations. We do this by dividing the total number of rotations the tires can undergo by the number of rotations per month:
\[ \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{145,000 \text{ rotations per month}} = 72 \text{ months} \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, we convert 72 months into years:

"To determine the cost of each pump in cents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of washes Jackie can get from one bottle of shampoo.
2. Determine the cost per wash.
3. Convert the cost per wash into cents.

First, we know that the directions say 2 pumps give 120 washes. Therefore, the number of washes per pump is:
\[ \text{Washes per pump} = \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washes per pump} \]

The total cost of the bottle of shampoo is $24.00. To find the cost per wash, we divide the total cost by the total number of washes:
\[ \text{Cost per wash} = \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ washes}} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per wash} \]

Since we need the cost per wash in cents, we convert dollars to cents (1 dollar = 100 cents):
\[ 0.20 \text{ dollars} = 0.20 \times 100 \text{ cents} = 20 \text{ cents per wash} \]

Therefore, the cost of each pump is:

So, the discounted price of the shirt is:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

The shorts originally cost $35, and there is also a 30% off sale.

The discount on the shorts is:
\[ 35 \times 0.30 = 10.50 \]

So, the discounted price of the shorts is:
\[ 35 - 10.50 = 24.50 \]

Now, we add the discounted prices of the shirt and the shorts to find the total cost of the outfit:
\[ 17.50 + 24.50 = 42.00 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. After buying the outfit, the amount of money he will have left is:

"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the funding into two parts: the initial funding and the additional funding for the extended research period.

1. **Initial Funding:**
   - John receives $100,000 for the first 5 months.
   - Therefore, the initial funding is $100,000.

2. **Extended Research Period:**
   - The total research period is 10 times the initial 5 months.
   - Therefore, the extended research period is \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \) months.
   - The first 5 months of the extended period have the same funding as the initial 5 months, which is $100,000.
   - The remaining \( 50 - 5 = 45 \) months have 50% more funding per month than the initial $100,000 per 5 months.

3. **Funding per Month for Extended Period:**
   - Initial funding per month for the first 5 months: \( \frac{100,000}{5} = 20,000 \) dollars per month.
   - Extended funding per month: \( 20,000 \times 1.5 = 30,000 \) dollars per month.

4. **Total Funding for Extended Period:**
   - Funding for the first 5 months: \( 5 \times 20,000 = 100,000 \) dollars.
   - Funding for the remaining 45 months: \( 45 \times 30,000 = 1,350,000 \) dollars.
   - Total funding for the extended period: \( 100,000 + 1,350,000 = 1,450,000 \) dollars.

5. **Total Cost of Research:**
   - Total cost = Initial funding + Funding for the extended period
   - Total cost = \( 100,000 + 1,450,000 = 1,550,000 \) dollars.

"First, let's calculate the total number of street lights at one intersection. Since each pole has 4 street lights and there are 6 poles at each intersection, the number of street lights at one intersection is:

\[ 4 \text{ lights/pole} \times 6 \text{ poles} = 24 \text{ lights} \]

Next, we need to find the total number of street lights for all 4 intersections. Since each intersection has 24 street lights, the total number of street lights for 4 intersections is:

\[ 24 \text{ lights/intersection} \times 4 \text{ intersections} = 96 \text{ lights} \]

We are given that 20 of these street lights are not working. Therefore, the total number of functioning street lights is:

\[ 96 \text{ lights} - 20 \text{ non-functioning lights} = 76 \text{ functioning lights} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to add the number of times each DVD has already been played to their respective maximum play counts.

The first DVD can be played 1000 times and has been played 356 times, so it can still be played:
\[ 1000 - 356 = 644 \text{ times} \]

The second DVD can also be played 1000 times and has been played 135 times, so it can still be played:
\[ 1000 - 135 = 865 \text{ times} \]

Adding the remaining play counts of both DVDs together gives:
\[ 644 + 865 = 1509 \]

Therefore, the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is:
\[ 1509 \]"

The cost per hour is $125.
\[ \text{Total cost} = 24 \text{ hours} \times 125 \text{ dollars/hour} = 3000 \text{ dollars} \]

The total cost of John's physical therapy is $3000."
"First, let's determine how many pieces of gum Jim chews during the school day. Since he chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school and a school day lasts 8 hours, we can calculate the number of pieces he chews during school as follows:

\[ \text{Pieces chewed during school} = \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours/piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we account for the pieces he chews on the way home from school and after dinner:

\[ \text{Pieces chewed on the way home} = 1 \]
\[ \text{Pieces chewed after dinner} = 1 \]

Adding these together with the pieces chewed during school, we get:

\[ \text{Total pieces chewed} = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 \text{ pieces} \]

Jim starts with a 20-pack of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, the number of pieces remaining is:

\[ \text{Remaining pieces} = 20 - 6 = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

Jim then gives half of the remaining pieces to his sister right before bed:

\[ \text{Pieces given to sister} = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, the number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day is:

\[ \text{Pieces left} = 14 - 7 = 7 \text{ pieces} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 7 \]"

\[ 8 \text{ basketballs} \times \$14 \text{ per basketball} = \$112 \]

Now, to find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we subtract the amount spent by the baseball coach from the amount spent by the basketball coach:

\[ \$112 - \$27 = \$85 \]

So, the basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \$85 \]"
"To find out how many flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of flowers in the garden.
2. Determine the number of flowers that have bloomed based on the given fraction.

First, let's calculate the total number of flowers in the garden:
\[ \text{Total number of flowers} = \text{Number of rows} \times \text{Number of flowers per row} \]
\[ \text{Total number of flowers} = 10 \times 20 = 200 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these flowers have bloomed. We know that \( \frac{4}{5} \) of the flowers have bloomed:
\[ \text{Number of flowers that have bloomed} = \frac{4}{5} \times \text{Total number of flowers} \]
\[ \text{Number of flowers that have bloomed} = \frac{4}{5} \times 200 = 160 \]

So, the number of flowers in Arianna's garden that have bloomed is:

"To determine Ashley's internet connection speed in megabits per hour (Mb/h), we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the internet speed from kilobits per second (kb/s) to megabits per second (Mb/s).
2. Convert the speed from megabits per second to megabits per hour.

First, we know that:
\[ 1 \text{ Mb} = 1000 \text{ kb} \]

Ashley's internet speed is 20 kb/s. To convert this to Mb/s, we divide by 1000:
\[ 20 \text{ kb/s} = \frac{20}{1000} \text{ Mb/s} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \]

Next, we need to convert this speed from Mb/s to Mb/h. There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so we multiply the speed in Mb/s by 3600:
\[ 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \times 3600 \text{ s/h} = 72 \text{ Mb/h} \]

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed in Mb per hour is:
\[ 72 \text{ Mb/h} \]"
"To calculate the total number of cars towed by the tow truck over the week, we can break down the problem into two parts: the first three days and the last four days.

For the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day. Therefore, the total number of cars pulled in the first three days is:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

For the remaining four days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day than it did on the first three days. Since it pulled 10 cars each day on the first three days, it pulled:
\[ 10 \text{ cars} - 4 \text{ cars} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]
Therefore, the total number of cars pulled in the last four days is:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Adding the number of cars pulled over the first three days and the last four days gives us the total number of cars towed that week:
\[ 30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars} \]

So, the total number of cars towed that week is:
\[ \boxed{54} \]"
"First, we need to convert Adam's current height from inches to feet to compare it with the required height. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, Adam's height in feet is:

\[ 40 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{40}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The minimum height required to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. Therefore, Adam needs to grow:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Adam grows 2 inches per year, which is equivalent to \(\frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6}\) feet per year. To find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet, we divide \(\frac{2}{3}\) by \(\frac{1}{6}\):

\[ \frac{2}{3} \div \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Therefore, Adam will be tall enough to ride the roller coaster in 4 years. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 cars James sold:
\[ \text{Total cost of cars} = 10 \times \$25,000 = \$250,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount the company paid to acquire these cars:
\[ \text{Cost to acquire the cars} = 30\% \times \$250,000 = 0.30 \times \$250,000 = \$75,000 \]

Now, we find the total profit from selling the cars:
\[ \text{Total profit} = \text{Total cost of cars} - \text{Cost to acquire the cars} = \$250,000 - \$75,000 = \$175,000 \]

James gets a 10% commission on the profits:
\[ \text{James's commission} = 10\% \times \$175,000 = 0.10 \times \$175,000 = \$17,500 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$17,500 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of riders who can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives:**
   - We know that 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright.
   - Therefore, the number of riders who can stay upright is \( 100 \times 0.25 = 25 \).

2. **Determine the number of these riders who are women:**
   - We know that 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women.
   - Therefore, the number of women who can stay upright is \( 25 \times 0.60 = 15 \).

3. **Determine the number of these riders who are men:**
   - Since the total number of riders who can stay upright is 25, and 15 of them are women, the number of men who can stay upright is \( 25 - 15 = 10 \).

So, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is **10**."
"First, let's determine the price of the gold jewel. Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000 and the price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

\[
\text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600
\]

Next, we need to find the price of the silver jewel. The problem states that the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of the gold jewel. Therefore, we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

\[
\text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
\]

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by summing the prices of the diamond jewel, the gold jewel, and the silver jewel:

\[
\text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800
\]

Thus, the total price for all three jewels is:

\[
\boxed{4800}

"First, let's determine the number of truck stamps Max bought. Since he bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, and he bought 16 snowflake stamps, the number of truck stamps is:

\[ 16 + 3 = 19 \]

Next, we need to find out how many rose stamps Max bought. He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. Since he bought 19 truck stamps, the number of rose stamps is:

\[ 19 - 9 = 10 \]

Now, we can find the total number of stamps Max bought by adding the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps together:

\[ 16 + 19 + 10 = 45 \]

So, the total number of stamps Max bought is:

\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between him and Bob, given their respective speeds.

First, let's find the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap. Since Bob is driving at 55 mph and Tom is driving at 70 mph, Tom is closing the gap at a rate of:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is reducing the 75-mile gap by 15 miles every hour. To find out how long it will take for Tom to close the entire 75-mile gap, we divide the distance by the relative speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the maximum cost per class and then find out how many classes he can attend without exceeding this cost.

First, let's denote the total cost of the 10 classes as \( C \). The total cost is given as $60. If the cost per class exceeds $10, his parents will not sign him up again. Therefore, we need to find the maximum number of classes \( n \) such that the cost per class is not more than $10.

The cost per class if he attends \( n \) classes is:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{n} \]

We need this cost to be less than or equal to $10:
\[ \frac{60}{n} \leq 10 \]

To find \( n \), we solve the inequality:
\[ 60 \leq 10n \]
\[ n \geq 6 \]

This means Manny can miss up to \( 10 - 6 = 4 \) classes and still be within the $10 per class limit.

Thus, the number of classes Manny can miss before his parents don't sign him up again is:
\[ 10 - 6 = 4 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \]"
"To determine the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we first need to find out how many customers each of them processes in a day.

Given that Jewel processes 50 customers per day, and Julie processes twice as many customers as Jewel, we can calculate the number of customers Julie processes per day as follows:
\[ \text{Customers processed by Julie per day} = 2 \times \text{Customers processed by Jewel per day} = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of customers processed by each of them in a week (7 days):
\[ \text{Total customers processed by Jewel in a week} = 50 \times 7 = 350 \]
\[ \text{Total customers processed by Julie in a week} = 100 \times 7 = 700 \]

Finally, we add the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel in a week to find the total weekly production:
\[ \text{Total weekly production} = \text{Total customers processed by Jewel in a week} + \text{Total customers processed by Julie in a week} = 350 + 700 = 1050 \]

The total weekly production for the two is:
\[ \boxed{1050} \]"
"First, let's determine how many miles Reggie ran. Since Paisley ran 4 miles and Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, we calculate:

\[ \text{Reggie's distance} = 5 \times \text{Paisley's distance} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. So, to find out how many miles Lynn ran, we subtract 3 miles from Reggie's distance:

\[ \text{Lynn's distance} = \text{Reggie's distance} - 3 = 20 - 3 = 17 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of one apple and one orange first, and then use those values to find the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges.

1. Calculate the cost of one apple:
   - Four apples cost $5.20.
   - Therefore, the cost of one apple is \( \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \) dollars.

2. Calculate the cost of one orange:
   - Three oranges cost $3.30.
   - Therefore, the cost of one orange is \( \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \) dollars.

3. Calculate the cost of 5 apples:
   - Since one apple costs $1.30, 5 apples will cost \( 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \) dollars.

4. Calculate the cost of 5 oranges:
   - Since one orange costs $1.10, 5 oranges will cost \( 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \) dollars.

5. Calculate the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:
   - The total cost is \( 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \) dollars.

Therefore, Clyde will pay \(\boxed{12.00}\) dollars for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the hole:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 3 \]

Now, let's calculate the volume:

\[ V = 72 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to determine the total time it will take Bob to dig this volume of earth. We know that it takes him 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) in seconds is:

\[ T = \text{volume} \times \text{time per cubic foot} \]

Substituting the volume and the time per cubic foot:

\[ T = 72 \times 3 \]

Now, let's calculate the total time:

\[ T = 216 \text{ seconds} \]

To convert the time into minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):

\[ \text{Time in minutes} = \frac{216}{60} = 3.6 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take Bob 216 seconds (or 3.6 minutes) to dig the hole. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 216 \]"
"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to add the base price to the costs of the additional features.

1. **Base Price**: $30,000
2. **King Cab Upgrade**: $7,500
3. **Leather Seats**: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so \( \frac{7,500}{3} = 2,500 \)
4. **Running Boards**: $500 less than the leather seats, so \( 2,500 - 500 = 2,000 \)
5. **Upgraded Exterior Light Package**: $1,500

Now, we sum these amounts:

\[
30,000 + 7,500 + 2,500 + 2,000 + 1,500 = 43,500
\]

The total cost of Bill's new truck is **$43,500**."
"To calculate Tim's annual salary after the promotion, we need to consider both the raise and the bonus.

First, let's calculate the raise:
- Tim's monthly salary is $20000.
- The raise is 5% of $20000.
- The raise amount is \( 20000 \times 0.05 = 1000 \).

So, his new monthly salary after the raise is:
- \( 20000 + 1000 = 21000 \).

Next, let's calculate the bonus:
- The bonus is half a month's salary.
- The bonus amount is \( 20000 \times 0.5 = 10000 \).

So, his total monthly salary after the raise and bonus is:
- \( 21000 + 10000 = 31000 \).

Finally, to find out how much he will make in a year, we multiply his monthly salary by 12:
- \( 31000 \times 12 = 372000 \).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the suits:
- James buys 10 suits.
- Each suit costs $750.
- Total cost for suits = 10 * $750 = $7500.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the dress pants:
- The cost of each dress pant is 1/5 of the cost of a suit.
- Cost of each dress pant = $750 / 5 = $150.
- James buys 10 dress pants.
- Total cost for dress pants = 10 * $150 = $1500.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the dress shirts:
- James buys 3 dress shirts per suit.
- Since he buys 10 suits, he buys 10 * 3 = 30 dress shirts.
- Each dress shirt costs $60.
- Total cost for dress shirts = 30 * $60 = $1800.

Finally, let's add up the total cost:
- Total cost = Cost of suits + Cost of dress pants + Cost of dress shirts.
- Total cost = $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800.

The final numerical answer is $10800."

"First, let's determine the number of likes Fishio received three weeks after posting the photo. We know that after 1 week, she received 2000 likes. Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times the initial number of likes. Therefore, the number of likes three weeks after posting is:

\[ 70 \times 2000 = 140000 \]

Next, we need to find out how many likes she received recently. According to the problem, she received 20000 more likes recently. So, we add these 20000 likes to the 140000 likes she had three weeks after posting:

\[ 140000 + 20000 = 160000 \]

Thus, the total number of likes on the photo is:

\[ \boxed{160000} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost Clara paid for the pomegranates on Tuesday.

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the total cost before the voucher discount is:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

She got a $2 voucher, so the final price Clara paid is:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost Sheila paid for the pomegranates on Wednesday.

The price per pomegranate on Wednesday was $30, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount is:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final price Sheila paid is:
\[ 600 - 60 = 540 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we find the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila:
\[ 540 - 398 = 142 \text{ dollars} \]

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:
\[ \boxed{142} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the sales from green hats in the first month:**
   - The sales from red hats in the first month were $400.
   - The sales from green hats in the first month were twice the sales from red hats.
   - Therefore, the sales from green hats in the first month = $400 * 2 = $800.

2. **Calculate the total sales for the first month:**
   - Total sales in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
   - Total sales in the first month = $400 + $800 = $1200.

3. **Determine the sales from green hats in the second month:**
   - The sales from green hats in the second month were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month.
   - Therefore, the sales from green hats in the second month = $1200 * 3/4 = $900.

4. **Calculate the total sales for the second month:**
   - Total sales in the second month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
   - Since the sales from red hats in the second month are not given, we assume they are the same as in the first month, which is $400.
   - Therefore, the total sales in the second month = $400 + $900 = $1300.

5. **Calculate the total sales for the two months:**
   - Total sales for the two months = Total sales in the first month + Total sales in the second month
   - Total sales for the two months = $1200 + $1300 = $2500.

The final numerical answer is $2500."
"To determine how much James paid for the horse-drawn carriage, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total time hired:**
   - James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM.
   - Total time hired = 9 PM - 5 PM = 4 hours.

2. **Account for the free hour:**
   - James gets 1 hour free.
   - Effective paid hours = Total time hired - Free hour = 4 hours - 1 hour = 3 hours.

3. **Calculate the cost for each paid hour:**
   - The first paid hour costs $15.
   - Each subsequent hour costs twice the previous hour's cost.
   - Cost for the first hour = $15.
   - Cost for the second hour = 2 * $15 = $30.
   - Cost for the third hour = 2 * $30 = $60.

4. **Sum the costs of the paid hours:**
   - Total cost = Cost of the first hour + Cost of the second hour + Cost of the third hour
   - Total cost = $15 + $30 + $60 = $105.

Therefore, the total amount James paid is $105."
"To determine how many dollars were withheld from Sally’s wage, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Sally has in her bank account at the end of the week.
2. Subtract the amount of money she should have in her bank account if she had received her full wage.
3. The result will be the amount of money withheld from her wage.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Sally's bank account at the end of the week is $420.
2. If Sally had received her full weekly wage of $300, her bank account would have been $200 (initial amount) + $300 (wage) = $520.
3. However, her bank account only has $420. Therefore, the amount withheld is $520 - $420 = $100.

So, the amount of money withheld from Sally’s wage is $100.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many deviled egg halves Lori needs in total. Since each of her 16 guests will eat 3 deviled egg halves, the total number of deviled egg halves needed is:

\[ 16 \text{ guests} \times 3 \text{ deviled egg halves/guest} = 48 \text{ deviled egg halves} \]

Next, we need to find out how many whole eggs are required. Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, the number of whole eggs needed is:

\[ \frac{48 \text{ deviled egg halves}}{2 \text{ deviled egg halves/whole egg}} = 24 \text{ whole eggs} \]

Now, we need to convert the number of whole eggs into dozens. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, the number of dozens of eggs needed is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ whole eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozen} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \]"

"To determine how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading, we need to calculate the total number of days it will take him to read the entire 200-page book at a rate of 10 pages per day.

The total number of days required can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by the number of pages Mike plans to read per day:

\[
\text{Total days required} = \frac{\text{Total pages}}{\text{Pages per day}} = \frac{200 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ pages/day}} = 20 \text{ days}
\]

Since the assignment is to be completed within 30 days, we can find out how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading by subtracting the total days required from the deadline:

\[
\text{Days before deadline} = \text{Deadline} - \text{Total days required} = 30 \text{ days} - 20 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ days}
\]

So, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline."
"To calculate the total cost for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane, the monthly rental cost for the hanger, and the monthly cost for fuel.

1. **Initial Cost of the Plane**: $150,000
2. **Monthly Rental Cost for the Hanger**: $5,000
3. **Monthly Cost for Fuel**: Twice the rental cost for the hanger, which is \(2 \times 5000 = 10,000\)

Next, we calculate the total cost for the first year:

- **Total Rental Cost for the Hanger in a Year**: \(5000 \times 12 = 60,000\)
- **Total Cost for Fuel in a Year**: \(10,000 \times 12 = 120,000\)

Now, we sum up all the costs:

- **Initial Cost of the Plane**: $150,000
- **Total Rental Cost for the Hanger in a Year**: $60,000
- **Total Cost for Fuel in a Year**: $120,000

Adding these together:

"First, let's determine the cooking times for each item based on the information provided:

1. It took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice.
2. It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so the cooking time for pork is \(30 + 20 = 50\) minutes.
3. The cooking time for beans is half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is \(30 + 50 = 80\) minutes. Therefore, the cooking time for beans is \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) minutes.

Now, we sum up the cooking times for all the items:
- Rice: 30 minutes
- Pork: 50 minutes
- Beans: 40 minutes

Adding these times together:
\[30 + 50 + 40 = 120\]

So, the total time it took to cook all the food is 120 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts:
- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for this mixture is \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts:
- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for this mixture is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's denote:
- \( s \) as the number of sheep,
- \( g \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we know:
1. Each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, and the total number of legs is 70.
2. Each sheep and each goose has one head, and the total number of heads is 20.

This gives us the following equations:
\[ 4s + 2g = 70 \]
\[ s + g = 20 \]

We can solve this system of equations step by step. First, we can simplify the first equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2s + g = 35 \]

Now we have the simplified system:
\[ 2s + g = 35 \]
\[ s + g = 20 \]

Next, we can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate \( g \):
\[ (2s + g) - (s + g) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2s + g - s - g = 15 \]
\[ s = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep is \( s = 15 \).

To verify, we can substitute \( s = 15 \) back into the second equation:
\[ 15 + g = 20 \]
\[ g = 5 \]

Now we can check the number of legs:
\[ 4s + 2g = 4(15) + 2(5) = 60 + 10 = 70 \]

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the more expensive coffee brand. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more. To find the cost of the more expensive brand per pound, we calculate:

\[ \text{Cost of more expensive coffee} = \$5 + (0.20 \times \$5) = \$5 + \$1 = \$6 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the coffee for a week. Since Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day and he needs coffee for 7 days, the total cost of the coffee is:

\[ \text{Total cost of coffee} = 7 \times \$6 = \$42 \]

Roger also buys a donut for $2. Therefore, the total cost of everything is the sum of the cost of the coffee and the cost of the donut:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$42 + \$2 = \$44 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{44} \]"
"To determine the cost of the apple pie, we first need to calculate the total amount Gus spent on the items he bought, excluding the apple pie.

- A bottle of soda for $1.00

Adding these amounts together:
\[4 + 8 + 1 = 13\] dollars

Gus spent a total of $20.00. To find out how much the apple pie cost, we subtract the total amount spent on the other items from the total amount spent:
\[20 - 13 = 7\] dollars

Therefore, the apple pie cost \(\boxed{7}\) dollars."

"To determine the number of good days left in the month, we need to first calculate the total number of good days and then subtract the number of good days that have already occurred.

Christina had twelve good days in total over the thirty days. The distribution of these good days is as follows:
- The first eight days were good.
- The next eight days were bad.
- The last eight days were neutral.

So, the number of good days that have already occurred is:
\[ 8 \text{ (first eight days)} + 0 \text{ (next eight days)} + 0 \text{ (last eight days)} = 8 \text{ good days} \]

Since there are twelve good days in total, the number of good days left in the month is:

"First, let's determine how many toys James needs initially. He currently has 4 toys for 4 dogs, so he needs 4 more toys for the 8 new dogs that have arrived. This means he needs 4 toys for the 8 new dogs.

\[ \text{Toys needed for 8 new dogs} = 4 \]

After buying the toys, there are twice as many more dogs than when he left. This means there are now 16 dogs in total (8 new dogs + the original 4 dogs).

\[ \text{Total dogs now} = 8 + 4 = 12 \]

So, James needs toys for 12 dogs. Since each dog needs one toy, he needs 12 more toys.

\[ \text{Toys needed for 12 dogs} = 12 \]

When James came back yet again, 3 dogs were gone, so he no longer needed those toys. This means he no longer needs the 12 toys for the 12 dogs, but he still needs the 4 toys for the 8 new dogs.

\[ \text{Final total toys needed} = 4 \]

Therefore, the total number of toys James needs is:

"Let's denote the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has as \( C \).

According to the problem:
- Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so if Max has \( M \) cookies, then Katarina has \( M - 5 \).
- Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so \( M = C + 12 \).
- Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so if Max has \( M \) cookies, then Summer has \( M + 23 \).
- Katarina has 68 cookies, so \( M - 5 = 68 \).

From the equation \( M - 5 = 68 \), we can solve for \( M \):
\[ M = 68 + 5 = 73 \]

Now, we know Max has 73 cookies. Using the relationship \( M = C + 12 \), we can solve for \( C \):
\[ 73 = C + 12 \]
\[ C = 73 - 12 = 61 \]

So, the Cookie Monster has 61 cookies. Now we can find out how many cookies Summer has:
\[ M + 23 = 73 + 23 = 96 \]

Now we have the number of cookies each person has:
- Katarina: 68 cookies

The total number of cookies they have is:
\[ \boxed{298} \]"
"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) centimeters.

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means she adds \( 0.5x \) to the original length. Additionally, she adds 20 cm to the bottom of the dress with a lace trim. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm.

So, the equation representing the final length of the dress is:
\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Now, divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} \]
\[ x = 80 \]

Therefore, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 80 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time Chris spent mowing half of his lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half in ""rabbit"" mode.

First, let's convert the times to a consistent unit. Since the question asks for the time in minutes, we'll use minutes for both modes:
- ""Turtle"" mode: 60 minutes
- ""Rabbit"" mode: 40 minutes

Chris mows half of his lawn in each mode. Therefore, the time spent mowing half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Similarly, the time spent mowing half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode is:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

To find the total time spent mowing the entire lawn, we add the time spent in both modes:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time it takes for John and Jack to get to the fire station, which is the sum of the time it takes to get to the corner and the time it takes to get to the fire station from there.

Time to get to the corner = 6 minutes
Time to get to the fire station from the corner = 13 minutes

Total time to get to the fire station = 6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes

They have 30 minutes in total to get to school. To find out how much longer they have to get to school without being late, we subtract the time it takes to get to the fire station from the total time they have.

Time remaining = Total time - Time to get to the fire station
Time remaining = 30 minutes - 19 minutes = 11 minutes

So, they have 11 minutes longer to get to school without being late."

"First, let's determine how many cookies Celinda bakes. Since Celinda bakes twice as many cookies as Greta, and Greta bakes 30 cookies, Celinda bakes:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of cookies baked by both Greta and Celinda:

\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ cookies} \]

They eat 10 cookies while they are cooling, so the number of cookies left in the box is:

\[ 90 - 10 = 80 \text{ cookies} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 80 \]"
"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( Tr \). According to the problem, one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so we can write the first equation as:

\[ T = Tr + 7 \]

We also know that the combined ages of the twins and the triplets are 44, so we can write the second equation as:

\[ T + T + Tr + Tr + Tr = 44 \]

Simplifying the second equation, we get:

\[ 2T + 3Tr = 44 \]

Now we substitute the first equation \( T = Tr + 7 \) into the second equation:

\[ 2(Tr + 7) + 3Tr = 44 \]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[ 2Tr + 14 + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr = 30 \]
\[ Tr = 6 \]

Now that we know the age of one of the triplets (\( Tr = 6 \)), we can find the age of one of the twins using the first equation:

\[ T = Tr + 7 \]
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, the age of one of the twins is \( 13 \).

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 13 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time John needs to complete his homework. He has:

- 20 minutes of math homework
- 40 minutes of reading homework
- 20 minutes of history homework

Adding these together:

\[ 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, 3 hours is equal to:

\[ 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the time John needs to complete his homework from the total time he has before dinner:

\[ 180 - 80 = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

So, John has 100 minutes to nap. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 100 \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of one candy. We know that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20, and each lollipop costs $0.40. Therefore, the cost of five lollipops is:

\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

This means the cost of the four candies is:

\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

So, the cost of one candy is:

\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Now, we need to find out the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:

\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

And the cost of 10 candies is:

\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:

\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 7.00 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of coins Rong and Neil have saved over a period of ten years.

First, let's calculate the number of coins Rong has saved in ten years:
- Rong saves 20 coins per month.
- There are 12 months in a year, so in ten years, there are \(10 \times 12 = 120\) months.
- Therefore, the total number of coins Rong has saved in ten years is \(20 \times 120 = 2400\) coins.

Next, let's calculate the number of coins Neil has saved in ten years:
- Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong per month. This means Neil saves \(20 + \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 20 + 8 = 28\) coins per month.
- In ten years, Neil saves \(28 \times 120 = 3360\) coins.

Finally, to find the total number of coins they have together after ten years, we add the coins saved by Rong and Neil:
- Total coins = Coins saved by Rong + Coins saved by Neil = \(2400 + 3360 = 5760\).

The final numerical answer is:
5760"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Since each vaccine costs $20 and John needs 2 vaccines, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \]

Next, let's denote the cost of the heartworm check as \( H \). According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as \( T \). Therefore, we have:
\[ H = 0.6T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + H \]

Since \( H = 0.6T \), we can substitute \( H \) in the total bill equation:
\[ T = 40 + 0.6T \]

To find \( T \), we need to solve the equation:
\[ T - 0.6T = 40 \]
\[ 0.4T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.4} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To determine the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum these costs.

First, let's find the cost of one banana. Given that one apple costs $0.5 and one banana costs twice as much as an apple:
\[ \text{Cost of one banana} = 2 \times 0.5 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of one orange. Oranges cost three times as much as a banana:
\[ \text{Cost of one orange} = 3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost for the fruits in one crate:
- The crate contains 5 bananas, so the total cost for bananas is:
\[ 5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]
- The crate contains 12 apples, so the total cost for apples is:
\[ 12 \times 0.5 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]
- The crate contains 7 oranges, so the total cost for oranges is:
\[ 7 \times 3 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we sum the costs of all the fruits to find the total price of the crate:
\[ 5 + 6 + 21 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the price for such a crate of fruit is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"To find the total number of square feet of Brittany's comforter, we first need to determine the number of each colored square and then calculate the total area.

4. **White Squares:**
   - Given: 12 fewer white squares than green squares.
   - Calculation: \(24 - 12 = 12\) white squares.

Now, we sum up all the squares:
- Total squares = Red squares + Blue squares + Green squares + White squares
- Total squares = \(14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68\) squares.

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, each square covers 1 square foot. Therefore, the total area of the comforter is:
- Total area = Total squares = 68 square feet.

"First, let's calculate the points collected by each student:

1. Adam has collected 50 points.
2. Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. So, Betty's points are \(50 + (0.30 \times 50) = 50 + 15 = 65\) points.
3. Tom has 30 points less than Betty. So, Tom's points are \(65 - 30 = 35\) points.
4. Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. So, Marta's points are \(3 \times 35 = 105\) points.

Now, let's sum up the points collected by all the students:
\[50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255\]

The minimum threshold for the class to go on the trip is 400 points. Therefore, the points the class is missing are:

Therefore, the number of great grand-babies at the family reunion is 27."
"First, let's calculate how much Greta puts into her retirement account. She puts 50% of her $2400.00 paycheck into her retirement account:

\[ 2400 \times 0.50 = 1200 \]

So, she has $1200 left after funding her retirement account.

Next, we calculate how much she uses for her monthly car payment. She uses 20% of her $2400.00 paycheck for her car payment:

\[ 2400 \times 0.20 = 480 \]

So, she has $2400 - $1200 (retirement) - $480 (car payment) left to spend:

\[ 2400 - 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Greta has left to spend is $720."

"First, let's determine the capacity of Gordy's truck. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, we can calculate Gordy's truck capacity as follows:

\[ \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = 4000 + 800 = 4800 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know the combined capacity of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks is 11,600 pounds. Let's denote Gary's truck capacity by \( G \). Therefore, we can write the equation for the total capacity as:

\[ 4000 + 4800 + G = 11600 \]

Now, we solve for \( G \):

\[ 8800 + G = 11600 \]
\[ G = 11600 - 8800 \]
\[ G = 2800 \]

So, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry. We know that each female ate 3 dumplings and there were 6 females. Therefore, the total number of dumplings eaten by the females is:

\[ 6 \text{ females} \times 3 \text{ dumplings/female} = 18 \text{ dumplings} \]

Next, we need to find out how many dumplings each male ate. According to the problem, each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female. Since each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate:

\[ 3 \text{ dumplings} + 1 \text{ dumpling} = 4 \text{ dumplings} \]

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is:

\[ 8 \text{ males} \times 4 \text{ dumplings/male} = 32 \text{ dumplings} \]

To find the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry, we add the dumplings eaten by the females and the dumplings eaten by the males:

"To find the percent of the river's total water that is used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the percentage of water used by the city for industrial purposes.
2. Subtract this percentage from 100% to find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes.

First, we know that Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. Out of this 40%, 80% is used for industrial purposes. Therefore, the percentage of water used by the city for industrial purposes is:
\[ 40\% \times 80\% = 40\% \times 0.80 = 32\% \]

Next, to find the percentage of water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the industrial usage percentage from the total usage percentage:
\[ 40\% - 32\% = 8\% \]

So, the percent of the river's total water that is used by the city for non-industrial purposes is:

"First, let's determine the production rate for each type of ice cream.

For chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for chocolate ice cream is \( \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

For vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for vanilla ice cream is \( \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Now, we calculate the total production for 48 hours.

For chocolate ice cream in 48 hours:

"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of baked good:

- Croissants: 5 croissants * $3.00 each = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls * $2.50 each = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches * $4.00 each = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 blueberry muffins * $1.00 each = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost before the discount:

Total cost before discount = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Marcus gets a 10% discount on his purchase. To find the discount amount:

Discount amount = 10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final bill:

Final bill = Total cost before discount - Discount amount = $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

So, Marcus' total bill is $45.00."
"First, let's determine the cost of the deal. For every 2 scoops bought, Erin gets 1 scoop free. Since each scoop costs $1.50, the cost for 2 scoops is:

\[ 2 \times 1.50 = 3.00 \]

This means for every $3.00 spent, Erin gets 3 scoops of ice cream (2 bought + 1 free).

Erin has $6.00, so we need to find out how many sets of $3.00 she can spend:

\[ 6.00 \div 3.00 = 2 \]

This means Erin can spend $3.00 twice, which gives her:

"First, let's calculate how much candy Ginger eats in two weeks. Since there are 14 days in two weeks and Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy each day, we can calculate the total amount of candy Ginger eats as follows:

\[ \text{Ginger's candy eaten} = 4 \, \text{pieces/day} \times 14 \, \text{days} = 56 \, \text{pieces} \]

Since Ginger started with 100 pieces of candy, after two weeks, Ginger will have:

\[ \text{Ginger's remaining candy} = 100 \, \text{pieces} - 56 \, \text{pieces} = 44 \, \text{pieces} \]

Next, let's calculate how much candy Amy eats in two weeks. Since Amy eats 3 pieces of candy each day, we can calculate the total amount of candy Amy eats as follows:

\[ \text{Amy's candy eaten} = 3 \, \text{pieces/day} \times 14 \, \text{days} = 42 \, \text{pieces} \]

Since Amy started with 100 pieces of candy, after two weeks, Amy will have:

\[ \text{Amy's remaining candy} = 100 \, \text{pieces} - 42 \, \text{pieces} = 58 \, \text{pieces} \]

Now, to find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger after two weeks, we subtract the amount of candy Ginger has from the amount of candy Amy has:

\[ \text{Difference} = 58 \, \text{pieces} - 44 \, \text{pieces} = 14 \, \text{pieces} \]

So, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy after two weeks. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost James incurred for picking the blueberries. The cost to go picking is $20, and the cost per pound is $1.5. He picked 30 pounds, so the cost for the blueberries is:

\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.5 \text{ per pound} = \$45 \]

Adding the initial cost to go picking, the total cost for James is:

\[ \$20 + \$45 = \$65 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the same amount of blueberries at the store. The store price is $2.5 per pound, and he picked 30 pounds, so the cost at the store is:

\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.5 \text{ per pound} = \$75 \]

To find out how much James saved compared to buying at the store, we subtract the cost James paid for picking the blueberries from the cost of buying them at the store:

\[ \$75 - \$65 = \$10 \]

So, James saved $10 compared to buying at the store. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, let's determine the original price of each computer. The company planned to buy each computer for $700, but the price increased by 10%. To find the new price, we calculate 10% of $700 and add it to the original price.

\[ \text{Increase in price} = 700 \times \frac{10}{100} = 700 \times 0.10 = 70 \]

So, the new price of each computer is:

\[ \text{New price} = 700 + 70 = 770 \]

Now, the company wanted to buy 500 computers at the new price of $770 each. To find the total amount of money they paid, we multiply the new price by the number of computers:

\[ \text{Total amount paid} = 770 \times 500 \]

Let's calculate this:

\[ \text{Total amount paid} = 385000 \]

So, the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices is $385,000."
"First, let's calculate the total calories from the eggs. John uses 6 eggs, and each egg is 75 calories. So, the total calories from the eggs are:
\[ 6 \text{ eggs} \times 75 \text{ calories/egg} = 450 \text{ calories} \]

Next, let's calculate the total calories from the cheese. John uses 2 oz of cheese, and each ounce of cheese is 120 calories. So, the total calories from the cheese are:
\[ 2 \text{ oz} \times 120 \text{ calories/oz} = 240 \text{ calories} \]

Then, let's calculate the total calories from the ham. John uses 2 oz of ham, and each ounce of ham is 40 calories. So, the total calories from the ham are:
\[ 2 \text{ oz} \times 40 \text{ calories/oz} = 80 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we add up all the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham to get the total calories in the omelet:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of taps Helga makes with both her feet over the 5-minute period, considering the different tap rates when her arms are raised and when they are at her sides.

First, let's calculate the number of taps when her arms are at her sides:
- Right foot taps at 300 taps per minute.
- Left foot taps at 250 taps per minute.
- Total taps per minute when arms are at her sides: \(300 + 250 = 550\) taps per minute.
- Total taps in 5 minutes when arms are at her sides: \(550 \times 5 = 2750\) taps.

Next, let's calculate the number of taps when her arms are raised:
- Each foot taps at 200 taps per minute.
- Total taps per minute when arms are raised: \(200 + 200 = 400\) taps per minute.
- Total taps in 3 minutes when arms are raised: \(400 \times 3 = 1200\) taps.

Now, we add the taps from both scenarios to get the total number of taps:
- Total taps when arms are at her sides: 2750 taps.
- Total taps when arms are raised: 1200 taps.

"First, let's calculate the total cost if Ron fixes the pothole himself.

The cost of fixing the pothole is $450.
The cost of the asphalt is 3 buckets at $25 each, which totals to \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.

So, the total cost for Ron to fix the pothole is \(450 + 75 = 525\) dollars.

The city council will fine Ron $120 if he fixes it himself.

Therefore, the net cost for Ron to fix the pothole is \(525 - 120 = 405\) dollars.

If the pothole is not fixed, the damage to his car will be $450.

The amount of money Ron saves by fixing the pothole is the difference between the damage to his car and the net cost of fixing it, which is \(450 - 405 = 45\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is 45."

"First, let's determine the total number of slices of pizza ordered. Since there are 5 people (Bryce and his four friends) and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate how many slices Bryce and two of his friends ate. They ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizzas:
\[ 2 \times 12 \times \frac{2}{3} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Then, we calculate how many slices the remaining two friends ate. They ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizzas:
\[ 2 \times 12 \times \frac{3}{4} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Now, we find the total number of slices eaten by all five friends:
\[ 16 + 18 = 34 \]

Finally, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices ordered to find out how many slices are left:
\[ 60 - 34 = 26 \]

So, the number of slices of pizza left is:

"First, let's convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, Topher's shoe length of 8-feet and 4-inches is:

\[ 8 \times 12 + 4 = 96 + 4 = 100 \text{ inches} \]

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( x \) inches. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches. The final numerical answer is:

"To find the percentage of blue spools of thread, we first need to determine the total number of spools of thread and the number of blue spools.

Candy has:
- 15 light blue spools
- 45 dark blue spools
- 40 light green spools
- 50 dark green spools

The total number of spools is:
\[ 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150 \]

The total number of blue spools (light blue and dark blue) is:
\[ 15 + 45 = 60 \]

To find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 \]

Therefore, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000."
"To determine how many packs of gum Parker will need for 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will chew in 30 days.
2. Determine how many packs of gum are required based on the total number of pieces.

First, we calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will chew in 30 days:
\[ \text{Total pieces of gum} = \text{Pieces per day} \times \text{Number of days} \]
\[ \text{Total pieces of gum} = 4 \times 30 = 120 \]

Next, we determine how many packs of gum are needed. Since each pack contains 15 pieces of gum:
\[ \text{Number of packs} = \frac{\text{Total pieces of gum}}{\text{Pieces per pack}} \]
\[ \text{Number of packs} = \frac{120}{15} = 8 \]

Therefore, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

"First, let's calculate the number of votes candidate B received. Candidate A received 20% of the votes, and candidate B received 50% more than candidate A's votes.

Candidate A's votes = 20% of 100 = 0.20 * 100 = 20 votes

Candidate B's votes = Candidate A's votes + 50% of Candidate A's votes
Candidate B's votes = 20 + 0.50 * 20 = 20 + 10 = 30 votes

Now, we can calculate the number of votes candidate C received. The total number of votes is 100, and we know the votes for candidates A and B.

Votes for candidate C = Total votes - (Votes for candidate A + Votes for candidate B)
Votes for candidate C = 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 votes

- The total cost for the second amusement park is \(28 + 20 = 48\) dollars.

The savings by choosing the second amusement park over the first is the difference between the total costs of the two parks:
\[76 - 48 = 28\]

So, Jake's family will be able to save \(\boxed{28}\) dollars if they choose the second amusement park over the first."
"To determine how much money the tomato vendor saves a week, we need to calculate the difference in cost per day and then multiply that by the number of days in a week.

1. Calculate the daily savings:
   - Original cost per tomato: $0.50
   - New cost per tomato: $0.40
   - Daily savings per tomato: $0.50 - $0.40 = $0.10
   - Daily savings for 500 tomatoes: $0.10 * 500 = $50

2. Calculate the weekly savings:
   - Weekly savings: $50 * 7 = $350

"First, let's determine how many marbles Carl has. Since Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, and Sean has 56 marbles, we can calculate Carl's marbles as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's marbles} = 4 \times \text{Sean's marbles} = 4 \times 56 = 224 \]

Next, let's find out how many marbles Cal has. Since Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, we can calculate Cal's marbles as follows:

\[ \text{Sean's marbles} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cal's marbles} \]

Given that Sean has 56 marbles, we can solve for Cal's marbles:

\[ 56 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cal's marbles} \]

\[ \text{Cal's marbles} = 56 \times 2 = 112 \]

Now, we can find the combined number of marbles that Carl and Cal have:

\[ \text{Combined marbles} = \text{Carl's marbles} + \text{Cal's marbles} = 224 + 112 = 336 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many more groups are needed, we first need to find out how many students would be in each group if the activity is divided into 12 groups.

Given:
- Total number of students = 54
- Total number of groups required = 12

To find the number of students per group when divided into 12 groups:
\[ \text{Number of students per group} = \frac{54}{12} = 4.5 \]

Since the number of students per group must be a whole number, it's clear that 12 groups of 4.5 students each is not possible with 54 students. Therefore, the problem as stated is not feasible with the given numbers.

However, if we interpret the question as asking how many more groups are needed to form 6 groups (as initially stated), we can calculate that as follows:

Given:
- Total number of students = 54
- Initial number of groups = 6

To find the number of students per group when divided into 6 groups:
\[ \text{Number of students per group} = \frac{54}{6} = 9 \]

Since 6 groups of 9 students each is feasible, no additional groups are needed to form 6 groups.

Therefore, the number of additional groups needed to form 6 groups is:
\[ 0 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 0 \]"
"To calculate the total number of chairs Candy can rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during a single weekday and a single weekend day:
- During weekdays, 60 chairs are rented each day.
- During weekends, 100 chairs are rented each day.

Next, we need to determine the number of weekdays and weekend days in a 4-week month:
- There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a single week.
- Therefore, in a 4-week month, there are \(5 \times 4 = 20\) weekdays and \(2 \times 4 = 8\) weekend days.

Now, we can calculate the total number of chairs rented during a 4-week month:
- Chairs rented during weekdays: \(60 \times 20 = 1200\)
- Chairs rented during weekends: \(100 \times 8 = 800\)
- Total chairs rented in one 4-week month: \(1200 + 800 = 2000\)

Finally, we need to find out the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months:
- Total chairs rented in two 4-week months: \(2000 \times 2 = 4000\)

So, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is 4000."

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ plates} \]

Next, we need to account for the number of glasses and plates that were broken and returned. Jeff received 10 broken glasses and 6 broken plates.

The number of glasses Jeff has now is:
\[ 96 - 10 = 86 \text{ glasses} \]

The number of plates Jeff has now is:
\[ 48 - 6 = 42 \text{ plates} \]

To find the total number of glasses and plates Jeff has now, we add the remaining glasses and plates together:
\[ 86 + 42 = 128 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 128 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps and calculate the number of buttons Lorraine ends up with.

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - Number of small stickers traded: \( 0.9 \times 30 = 27 \) small stickers.
   - Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she trades 27 small stickers for 27 large buttons.

3. **Remaining Small Stickers:**
   - Remaining small stickers: \( 30 - 27 = 3 \) small stickers.

4. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - Number of large stickers traded: \( 0.5 \times 40 = 20 \) large stickers.
   - Since each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons, she trades 20 large stickers for 20 large buttons.

5. **Remaining Large Stickers:**
   - Remaining large stickers: \( 40 - 20 = 20 \) large stickers.

6. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons.
   - Since each large button is worth three small buttons, she trades 20 large stickers for \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) small buttons.

7. **Total Number of Buttons:**
   - Large buttons from trading large stickers: 20
   - Small buttons from trading large stickers: 60
   - Total buttons: \( 20 + 60 = 80 \)

Thus, the final number of buttons Lorraine has by the end is 80."
"To determine the total number of matches Joey played in one week, we need to add up the matches he played on each day of the week mentioned.

- On Monday, Joey played 2 matches.
- On Friday, Joey played 1 match.
- On Saturday, Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday. Since he played 2 matches on Monday, on Saturday he played \(2 \times 2 = 4\) matches.

Now, we sum the matches played each day:

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x \). The total number of votes cast is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is \( x + 2x = 3x \).

We know the total number of people on the council is 33, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x \):
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Thus, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 22 \).

\[
\boxed{22}

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Extra-Small (XS) shirts**: 11 students need size extra-small.
2. **Small (S) shirts**: Twice as many students need size small as extra small. Therefore, the number of students needing size small is \(2 \times 11 = 22\).
3. **Medium (M) shirts**: Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size medium is \(22 - 4 = 18\).
4. **Large (L) shirts**: Half as many students need size large as size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size large is \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\).
5. **Extra-Large (XL) shirts**: Six more students need size extra-large than large. Therefore, the number of students needing size extra-large is \(9 + 6 = 15\).

Now, we sum up all the students to find the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order:

\[ 11 \text{ (XS)} + 22 \text{ (S)} + 18 \text{ (M)} + 9 \text{ (L)} + 15 \text{ (XL)} = 75 \]

So, the total number of shirts Krissa ordered is 75."
"To calculate the amount you will pay after a 5% discount on a $140 item, you first need to find out how much the discount is in dollars and then subtract it from the original price.

The discount amount is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Original Price} \times \frac{\text{Discount Percentage}}{100} \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 140 \times \frac{5}{100} \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 140 \times 0.05 \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 7 \]

Now, subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the final price:
\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount Amount} \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 140 - 7 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 133 \]

"To find the total number of puppies Jana has, we can start by determining the number of Pomeranian puppies. We know that one third of the Pomeranian puppies are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. Therefore, the total number of Pomeranian puppies can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Number of Pomeranian puppies} = 6 \times 3 = 18 \]

Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can find the total number of puppies by setting up the following equation:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Total number of puppies} = 18 \]

Let's denote the total number of puppies by \( T \). Then we have:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times T = 18 \]

To solve for \( T \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by \( \frac{3}{2} \):

\[ T = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 27 \]

So, Jana has 27 puppies in total. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The first house needs \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the second house, so the first house needs \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases.
- The third house needs double the first house, so the third house needs \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) cases.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{5}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{5} \):
\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{5} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. Since the third house needs double the first house, and the first house needs half the second house, the first house needs:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50 \text{ cases} \]

Therefore, the third house needs:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ cases} \]

The number of cases of shingles the third house will need is \(\boxed{100}\)."

"To calculate Tanya's earnings for the two days, we need to break down her earnings for each day and then sum them up.

**Monday:**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She also earns an additional $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Monday:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} \times 5 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 20 \times 5 \times 15 = \$1500 \]

Next, calculate the additional earnings for Monday:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} > 3 \text{ classes} \]
\[ 4 \text{ classes} - 3 \text{ classes} = 1 \text{ extra class} \]
\[ 1 \text{ extra class} \times \$5 = \$5 \]

So, the total earnings for Monday are:
\[ \$1500 + \$5 = \$1505 \]

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She does not earn the additional $5 per day since she does not teach more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Wednesday:
\[ 2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 2 \times 2 \times 15 = \$60 \]

Since she does not teach more than 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5 per day.

So, the total earnings for Wednesday are:

"To determine how long Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time he spends driving and then add the time he spends at the museum.

First, let's calculate the time spent driving. The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and Jack drives at a speed of 75 mph. The time spent driving one way is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time spent driving to the museum is:

\[ \text{Time to museum} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Since the trip back is the same distance and speed, the time spent driving back is also 2 hours. Therefore, the total driving time is:

\[ \text{Total driving time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Jack spends 6 hours at the museum. So, the total time Jack is gone from home is the sum of the driving time and the time spent at the museum:

\[ \text{Total time gone} = 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

"First, let's break down the information given:

- Mike has 600 movies in total.
- A third of the movies are in various series, which means \( \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \) movies are in series.
- The remaining movies are \( 600 - 200 = 400 \) movies.
- 40% of the remaining 400 movies are older movies, which means \( 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \) movies are older.
- The rest of the remaining movies are not in series or older, which is \( 400 - 160 = 240 \) movies.

Now, let's calculate the cost of replacing the movies:

- The cost for the series movies is $6 each, so the total cost for the series movies is \( 200 \times 6 = 1200 \) dollars.
- The cost for the older movies is $5 each, so the total cost for the older movies is \( 160 \times 5 = 800 \) dollars.
- The cost for the remaining movies is $10 each, so the total cost for the remaining movies is \( 240 \times 10 = 2400 \) dollars.

Adding these costs together gives the total cost of replacing the movies:

\[ 1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 4400."
"To calculate the total amount Winston spent on fruit, we need to multiply the number of pounds of each type of fruit by their respective prices and then sum the totals.

For peaches:
6 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $12.00

For plums:
8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = $8.00

For apricots:
6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Now, we add the totals for each type of fruit:
$12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

So, Winston spent $38.00 on fruit."
"First, let's calculate the distance the Llesis family drove. They drove for 6 hours at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.

\[ \text{Distance driven} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 50 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to determine the hiking speed. The problem states that the hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half the driving speed.

\[ \text{Hiking speed} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 \, \text{miles/hour} - 5 \, \text{miles/hour} = 25 \, \text{miles/hour} - 5 \, \text{miles/hour} = 20 \, \text{miles/hour} \]

Given that they hiked for 1.5 hours, we can now calculate the distance they hiked.

\[ \text{Distance hiked} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 20 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, to find the total distance to their vacation spot, we add the distance driven and the distance hiked.

\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance driven} + \text{Distance hiked} = 300 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 330 \, \text{miles} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 330 \]"
"Let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumps on as \( E_e \) and the number of berries she collects as \( B_e \). Ava jumps on \( E_a = E_e + 8 \) enemies and collects \( B_a = B_e + 3 \) berries. The time left on the timer for Emma is \( T_e \) seconds, and for Ava it is \( T_a = T_e + 4 \) seconds.

The score for Emma is:
\[ S_e = 10E_e + 5B_e + 30T_e \]

The score for Ava is:
\[ S_a = 10(E_e + 8) + 5(B_e + 3) + 30(T_e + 4) \]
\[ S_a = 10E_e + 80 + 5B_e + 15 + 30T_e + 120 \]
\[ S_a = 10E_e + 5B_e + 30T_e + 215 \]

The difference in their scores is:
\[ \Delta S = S_a - S_e \]
\[ \Delta S = (10E_e + 5B_e + 30T_e + 215) - (10E_e + 5B_e + 30T_e) \]
\[ \Delta S = 215 \]

So, the difference between their two scores is 215 points."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of each of the other two pizzas. We know the total cost of the four pizzas is 64 dollars, and two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars each. Let's denote the cost of each of the other two pizzas as \( x \).

First, we calculate the total cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each:
\[ 30 + 30 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we subtract this amount from the total cost to find the combined cost of the other two pizzas:
\[ 64 - 60 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the remaining cost by 2 to find the cost of each:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, each of the other two pizzas cost 2 dollars. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of rides on usual days:**
   - Chase and Rider ride their bikes thrice a day.
   - They do this for 5 days.
   - Therefore, the number of rides on usual days is \(3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides}\).

2. **Determine the number of rides on special days:**
   - On two other days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days.
   - Twice the usual rides per day is \(3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ rides/day}\).
   - They do this for 2 days.
   - Therefore, the number of rides on special days is \(6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides}\).

3. **Calculate the total number of rides in a week:**
   - The total number of rides is the sum of the rides on usual days and the rides on special days.
   - Total rides = \(15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides}\).

"Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as \( w \) and the number of orange fish he bought as \( o \). We know that the total number of fish he bought from the pet store is \( o + w = 17 \).

After adding these fish to his pond, the total number of orange fish became \( 3 + o \) and the total number of white fish became \( 4 + w \). According to the problem, after adding the new fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish. This gives us the equation:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( o + w = 17 \)
2. \( 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \)

Let's solve the second equation first:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]
\[ 3 + o = 8 + 2w \]
\[ o - 2w = 5 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( o + w = 17 \)
2. \( o - 2w = 5 \)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use elimination. First, we'll eliminate \( o \) by subtracting the second equation from the first:
\[ (o + w) - (o - 2w) = 17 - 5 \]
\[ o + w - o + 2w = 12 \]
\[ 3w = 12 \]
\[ w = 4 \]

Now that we have \( w = 4 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( o \):
\[ o + 4 = 17 \]
\[ o = 13 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish and 13 orange fish. The number of white fish Bob bought at the store is \( \boxed{4} \)."
"First, let's calculate the total distance Andy travels in a week. Since he goes to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days. The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, so the round trip distance is \(5 \times 2 = 10\) miles per day. Therefore, the total distance he travels in a week is \(10 \times 5 = 50\) miles.

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of gas Andy consumes in a week. Given that his car's fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon, the number of gallons consumed for 50 miles is \(50 \div 10 = 5\) gallons.

Finally, we calculate the cost of the gas consumed in a week. If the price of gas is $3 per gallon, then the cost for 5 gallons is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is 15."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie received from her aunt.

Carrie received ten twenties, which means she received:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Carrie also received 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount from the quarters is:
\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Carrie received is:
\[ 200 + 35 = 235 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much money Carrie spent. She spent all the quarters, which is $35, and 3/5 of the twenties. The amount spent on the twenties is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = \frac{3 \times 200}{5} = \frac{600}{5} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Carrie spent for lunch is:
\[ 35 + 120 = 155 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many OLED TVs were sold, we first need to determine the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold, and then subtract these from the total sales.

Given:
- Total sales = 40 TVs
- One-fourth of the sales are smart TVs.
- One-eighth of the sales are analog TVs.

First, calculate the number of smart TVs sold:
\[ \text{Number of smart TVs} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

Next, calculate the number of analog TVs sold:
\[ \text{Number of analog TVs} = \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5 \]

Now, subtract the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total sales to find the number of OLED TVs sold:
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (\text{Number of smart TVs} + \text{Number of analog TVs}) \]
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (10 + 5) \]
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - 15 \]
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 25 \]

So, the number of OLED TVs sold is 25."
"To determine how much money John is missing, we first need to calculate the total cost of the trip and then subtract the amount of money he already has.

The total cost of the trip is $300. The school has decided to cover half of this cost, so the school will cover:

"First, we need to determine the temperature difference that needs to be prevented. The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. During the night, the temperature is 33 degrees colder than during the day, so the night temperature is:

\[ 45 - 33 = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

Since the pipes will freeze if the temperature drops below 32 degrees, we need to calculate how much the temperature needs to be raised to 32 degrees or above. The difference between the night temperature and the freezing point is:

\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs are needed to raise the temperature by 20 degrees, we divide the required temperature increase by the temperature increase per log:

"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of employees after three months.
2. Calculate the total salary paid to all employees each month.
3. Multiply the total salary per month by the number of months (three months).

**Step 1: Determine the number of employees after three months.**

The company hires 20 new employees every month. After three months, the number of new employees hired is:
\[ 20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees} \]

The initial number of employees is 200. Therefore, the total number of employees after three months is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the hourly wages for both Billy and Sally, and then determine the total earnings for 20 hours for each. Finally, we will find the difference in their earnings.

First, let's determine Billy's hourly wage at each stage:
- Initial hourly wage: $10 per hour.
- After 2 months, the raise is $0.50 per hour, so the new hourly wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.
- On his first anniversary, the raise is $1.00 per hour, so the new hourly wage is $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate Billy's total earnings for 20 hours:
- For the first 2 months (24 hours), he earns $10 per hour.
- For the remaining 4 hours, he earns $11.50 per hour.
- Total earnings for Billy = (24 hours * $10/hour) + (4 hours * $11.50/hour) = $240 + $46 = $286.

Next, let's determine Sally's hourly wage:
- Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's initial salary, so her starting hourly wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate Sally's total earnings for 20 hours:
- Sally earns $10.50 per hour for 20 hours.
- Total earnings for Sally = 20 hours * $10.50/hour = $210.

Finally, let's find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally:
- Difference in earnings = Billy's total earnings - Sally's total earnings = $286 - $210 = $76.

"First, let's calculate the number of students and teachers in the school.

The school has 40 classes, with an average of 25 students per class:
\[ \text{Total number of students} = 40 \text{ classes} \times 25 \text{ students/class} = 1000 \text{ students} \]

The school also has 40 classes, with an average of 3 teachers per class:
\[ \text{Total number of teachers} = 40 \text{ classes} \times 3 \text{ teachers/class} = 120 \text{ teachers} \]

Each child plants 1 tree, and each teacher plants 2 trees. Therefore, the total number of trees planted by the students is:
\[ \text{Total trees planted by students} = 1000 \text{ students} \times 1 \text{ tree/student} = 1000 \text{ trees} \]

The total number of trees planted by the teachers is:
\[ \text{Total trees planted by teachers} = 120 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ trees/teacher} = 240 \text{ trees} \]

Adding the trees planted by students and teachers together gives the total number of trees planted:

"First, let's calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:

- Puppies: 3
- Koalas: 5
- Zebras: 2
- Frogs: 4

Total stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Let's denote the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy as \( x \).

After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30%. Therefore, the equation representing this situation is:

\[ \frac{x}{14 + x} = 0.30 \]

To solve for \( x \), we can rearrange the equation:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total hours Kris has already played.

For the first 2 weeks (14 days), Kris plays for half an hour every day:
\[ 14 \text{ days} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/day} = 7 \text{ hours} \]

For the next week (7 days), Kris plays for 2 hours every day:
\[ 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/day} = 14 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's add the hours from both periods to find the total hours played so far:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} + 14 \text{ hours} = 21 \text{ hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. To find out how many more hours she needs to play, we subtract the hours she has already played from the total required hours:

"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled by the first car:
- The first car travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance traveled by the first car is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled by the second car:
- The second car travels at an average speed of 70 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance traveled by the second car is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed}_2 \times \text{Time} = 70 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}

\[ 600 + 300 = 900 \]

Next, we need to calculate the premium. The premium is 30% of the total cost before the premium. To find 30% of $900, we multiply $900 by 0.30:

\[ 900 \times 0.30 = 270 \]

Now, we add the premium to the total cost before the premium to find the final amount James paid:

\[ 900 + 270 = 1170 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1170 \]"
"First, let's calculate the pass rates for each grade:

- For third graders: \( \frac{340}{500} = 0.68 \) or 68%
- For fourth graders: \( \frac{40}{100} = 0.40 \) or 40%
- For fifth graders: The pass rate is twice that of fourth graders, so \( 2 \times 0.40 = 0.80 \) or 80%

Next, we calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students:

- Third graders: 340
- Fourth graders: 40
- Fifth graders: 400

Total number of students = 340 + 40 + 400 = 780

Total number of students who passed = 340 + 40 + 400 = 780

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students:

\[ \text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{780}{780} = 1 \]

So, the school's overall pass rate is 100%.

\[ 72 \text{ chips/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we need to find out how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make every square inch, the number of square inches he can make is:

\[ \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips/square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. To find out how many inches long he can make his mosaic, we use the fact that the area of the mosaic is the product of its length and height. Let's denote the length of the mosaic by \( L \) inches. The area of the mosaic is given by:

\[ \text{Area} = L \times \text{height} = L \times 3 \text{ inches} \]

Since the area of the mosaic is 12 square inches, we can set up the equation:

\[ L \times 3 = 12 \]

Solving for \( L \):

\[ L = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

Each of the 4 students drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea consumed by these students is:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Each of the 16 students drank 2 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea consumed by these students is:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of tea consumed:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

We know that there are 10 quarts of tea left. Therefore, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we convert the total quarts to gallons:
\[ \frac{48}{4} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"Dale initially had 100 candies and sold 150, which means he is short by 50 candies (150 - 100 = 50). After ordering 100 more candies, the total number of candies he has is 100 (initial) + 100 (new order) = 200 candies. To find out how many candies he still needs to sell, we subtract the total number of candies he has from the number of candies he needs to sell, which is 200 (total he has) - 150 (already sold) = 50 candies.

Therefore, Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students on campus at the end of each month and then determine the total number of additional students who joined by the end of May.

Starting with 10 students at the beginning of the year, the number of students doubles every month.

- At the end of January: \(10 \times 2 = 20\) students
- At the end of February: \(20 \times 2 = 40\) students
- At the end of March: \(40 \times 2 = 80\) students
- At the end of April: \(80 \times 2 = 160\) students
- At the end of May: \(160 \times 2 = 320\) students

Now, we calculate the total number of additional students who joined by the end of May:

- Additional students in January: \(20 - 10 = 10\)
- Additional students in February: \(40 - 20 = 20\)
- Additional students in March: \(80 - 40 = 40\)
- Additional students in April: \(160 - 80 = 80\)
- Additional students in May: \(320 - 160 = 160\)

Summing these additional students:
\[10 + 20 + 40 + 80 + 160 = 310\]

Therefore, the number of additional students who would have joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year, is 310."
"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we first need to determine the total number of branches he climbed during the week.

Given that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs and he made $105 during the week, we can calculate the total number of branches he climbed by dividing the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\text{Total money made}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} \]

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = 420 \]

Since this is the total number of branches climbed over the entire week (7 days), we can find the average number of branches climbed per day by dividing the total branches by the number of days in the week:

\[ \text{Average branches climbed per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches climbed}}{\text{Number of days in a week}} = \frac{420}{7} \]

\[ \text{Average branches climbed per day} = 60 \]

So, the average number of branches Felix climbed per day is 60."
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose initially picks:

- For the first 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals.
- For the next 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals.
- For the next 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals.
- For the last 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals.

Adding these together gives the total number of petals before any are dropped:
\[15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\] petals.

Next, Rose drops 1 of each type of flower:
- She drops 1 of the 5-petal flowers, which is 1 petal.
- She drops 1 of the 6-petal flowers, which is 6 petals.
- She drops 1 of the 4-petal flowers, which is 4 petals.
- She drops 1 of the 7-petal flowers, which is 7 petals.

The total number of petals dropped is:
\[1 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 18\] petals.

Subtracting the dropped petals from the initial total gives the number of petals remaining in the vase:
\[101 - 18 = 83\] petals.

So, the total number of petals in the vase is:
\[
\boxed{83}

"First, let's determine the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean to make S'mores. John makes 9 S'mores and DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so together they make:

\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \text{ S'mores} \]

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they use 18 marshmallows in total. They started with 35 marshmallows and dropped 3 on the ground, so the number of marshmallows left is:

\[ 35 - 18 - 3 = 14 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Now, we need to determine how many S'mores they can make with the remaining 14 marshmallows. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they can make:

\[ 14 \text{ S'mores} \]

Since John and DeSean are sharing the remaining marshmallows equally, each of them can have:

\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ S'mores} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 7 \]"
"First, let's determine the play times for each person:

- Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter.
- One friend can play for half as long as Jack, which is \(20 \div 2 = 10\) minutes.
- Another friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which is \(20 \times 1.5 = 30\) minutes.
- The third friend is significantly worse and can play for half as long as Jack, which is \(20 \div 2 = 10\) minutes.

Now, let's add up the total play time for all four friends:
- Jack: 20 minutes
- Friend 1: 10 minutes
- Friend 2: 30 minutes
- Friend 3: 10 minutes

Total play time = 20 + 10 + 30 + 10 = 70 minutes.

Since they play for 4 hours, we need to convert 4 hours into minutes:
4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

Now, we need to determine how many quarters are used. Since each quarter allows for 20 minutes of play, we divide the total play time by 20:
240 minutes / 20 minutes per quarter = 12 quarters.

Therefore, the total amount of money used is:
12 quarters.

The final numerical answer is:
12"
"Let's denote the amount of each ingredient Tanya uses as follows:
- Let \( S \) be the amount of salt.
- Let \( O \) be the amount of oil.
- Let \( F \) be the amount of fragrance.
- Let \( C \) be the amount of citrus zest.
- Let \( G \) be the amount of sugar.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S = G \) (same amount of salt as sugar)
2. \( F = C \) (same amount of fragrance as citrus zest)
3. \( O = 2S \) (twice as much oil as salt)
4. \( S = C \) (twice as much salt as zest)

Since \( S = C \) and \( F = C \), we can say \( S = F = C \).

The total amount of ingredients in the jar is 10 ounces. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total amount of ingredients as:
\[ S + O + F + C + G = 10 \]

Substituting the relationships into the equation:
\[ S + 2S + S + S + S = 10 \]
\[ 6S = 10 \]
\[ S = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \]

Since \( O = 2S \):
\[ O = 2 \times \frac{5}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \]

Therefore, the number of ounces of oil Tanya uses is:
\[ \frac{10}{3} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \frac{10}{3} \]"

"First, let's determine how many cars Joe initially has. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. The number of cars he sells is:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

After selling 8 cars, Joe has:

\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \text{ cars} \]

Then, Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

After giving away 16 cars, Joe has:

\[ 32 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, the final number of cars Joe remains with is:

\[ 16 \]"
"First, we need to determine how much money the students raised. The total amount raised by the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of this amount comes from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much each student raised. There are 20 students, and the total amount raised by the students is $125,000. So, the amount each student raised is:

"To calculate the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days in minutes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the time Sandy walked on the first day.
2. Determine the time Sandy walked on the second day.
3. Convert the time from hours to minutes for both days.
4. Sum the total time in minutes.

First, Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day.

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she did on the first day. Therefore, the time she walked on the second day is:
\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour.

For the first day:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes} \]

For the second day:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we sum the total time in minutes for both days:
\[ 480 \text{ minutes} + 240 \text{ minutes} = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is:

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now we can find out how many cards Becca has:

"First, let's calculate the shipping cost. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound plus $0.08 per mile.

The cost for the weight of the book is:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.35/\text{pound} = \$1.40 \]

The cost for the distance is:
\[ 20 \text{ miles} \times \$0.08/\text{mile} = \$1.60 \]

So, the total shipping cost is:
\[ \$1.40 + \$1.60 = \$3.00 \]

Next, we calculate the refundable amount from Amazon. Since Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, the refundable amount is:
\[ 32 \text{ dollars} \times 0.75 = \$24.00 \]

Now, we calculate the total cost Milly will incur:
\[ \text{Cost of the book} + \text{Shipping cost} = 32 \text{ dollars} + 3 \text{ dollars} = \$35.00 \]

Finally, the amount of money Milly will lose is the total cost minus the refundable amount:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total distance traveled by the kangaroos:**
   - Let the distance across the highway be \( D \).
   - If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel this distance, then the total distance \( D \) can be calculated as:
     \[
     D = 3 \text{ kangaroos} \times 18 \text{ hours} = 54 \text{ kangaroo-hours}
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - The speed of the kangaroos is \( \frac{D}{18} \) kangaroo-hours per hour.

3. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of each turtle is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{D}{18} = \frac{D}{36} \) turtle-hours per hour.

4. **Calculate the time it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \):**
   - The total speed of 4 turtles is \( 4 \times \frac{D}{36} = \frac{4D}{36} = \frac{D}{9} \) turtle-hours per hour.
   - The time \( T \) it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \) is:
     \[
     T = \frac{D}{\frac{D}{9}} = 9 \text{ hours}

"First, let's calculate the total number of slices Adam gets from the large apples. Since each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces and Adam slices 3 large apples, the total number of slices from the large apples is:
\[ 3 \text{ apples} \times 5 \text{ slices/apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of slices Adam gets from the small apples. Since each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces and Adam slices 5 small apples, the total number of slices from the small apples is:
\[ 5 \text{ apples} \times 3 \text{ slices/apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's find the total number of slices Adam has after slicing all the apples:
\[ 15 \text{ slices (from large apples)} + 15 \text{ slices (from small apples)} = 30 \text{ slices} \]

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:
\[ 30 \text{ slices} - 15 \text{ slices} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 15 \]"
"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to have to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to calculate the current daily milk production and then find out how much additional milk is needed.

The current daily milk production from 3 cows is:
\[ 5 \text{ liters/cow/day} \times 3 \text{ cows} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The additional milk needed is:
\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed to produce the additional 10 liters of milk is:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow/day}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs to have 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the remaining length of each glue stick and then sum these lengths.

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Craig has initially. Craig has 2 twenty dollar bills, so:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the squirt guns. Craig buys 6 squirt guns at $2 each, so:

\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, let's calculate the total cost of the packs of water balloons. Craig buys 3 packs of water balloons at $3 each, so:

\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's find the total cost of the squirt guns and water balloons combined:

\[ 12 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find out how much money Craig has left, we subtract the total cost of the squirt guns and water balloons from the initial amount of money he had:

\[ 40 - 21 = 19 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of socks Jack has. According to the problem, Jack collected twice as many dishes as he had socks. If Jack collected 60 dishes, then he had:

\[ \text{Number of socks Jack has} = \frac{\text{Number of dishes Jack has}}{2} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

Next, we need to find out how many socks Peter has. The problem states that Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. Therefore:

\[ \text{Number of socks Peter has} = 2 \times \text{Number of socks Jack has} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together. Jack has 60 dishes and 30 socks, and Peter has 60 socks and 0 dishes (since the problem does not mention any dishes Peter has). Therefore, the total number of socks and dishes is:

\[ \text{Total number of socks} = 30 + 60 = 90 \]
\[ \text{Total number of dishes} = 60 + 0 = 60 \]
\[ \text{Total number of socks and dishes} = 90 + 60 = 150 \]

So, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is:

\[ \boxed{150} \]"
"To determine how many students are good at math, we need to consider the information given:

- There are 20 students in total.
- 5 students are good at math only.
- 8 students perform well in English only.
- The rest are good at both math and English.

First, we calculate the number of students who are good at both math and English. Since the total number of students is 20, and we know the number of students who are good at math only and those who perform well in English only, we can find the number of students who are good at both by subtracting the sum of students who are good at math only and those who perform well in English only from the total number of students.

Let's denote:
- \( M \) as the number of students good at math.
- \( E \) as the number of students good at English.
- \( B \) as the number of students good at both math and English.

From the problem, we know:
- \( M = 5 \) (students good at math only)
- \( E = 8 \) (students good at English only)
- The rest are good at both math and English.

The number of students good at both math and English is:
\[ B = 20 - (5 + 8) = 20 - 13 = 7 \]

Now, to find the total number of students good at math, we add the students who are good at math only to the students who are good at both math and English:
\[ M = 5 + 7 = 12 \]

Thus, the total number of students good at math is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time required for one group to perform, including the time for getting on and off stage, and the intermission.

The time for one group is:
- 2 minutes to get on stage
- 6 minutes to perform
- 2 minutes to exit the stage

So, the total time for one group is:
\[ 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to account for the intermission. The intermission is 10 minutes long. Therefore, the total time for one group including the intermission is:
\[ 10 + 10 = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

The concert is 2 hours long, which is equivalent to:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

To find out how many groups can perform in the concert, we divide the total concert time by the time required for one group:
\[ \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:
\[ 6 \]"
"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years with simple interest, we can use the formula for simple interest:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Given:
- Principal (\(P\)) = $300
- Rate (\(R\)) = \(\frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225\%\)
- Time (\(T\)) = 3 years

First, we calculate the simple interest:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 225\% \times 3 \]

Since the rate is given as a percentage, we convert it to a decimal by dividing by 100:

\[ 225\% = 2.25 \]

So,

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 2.25 \times 3 = 2025 \]

The total amount after 3 years is the sum of the principal and the simple interest:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Simple Interest} = 300 + 2025 = 2325 \]

Therefore, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:

\[ \boxed{2325} \]"

"First, let's determine the number of goats sold from each farm.

From Farm X, Mr. Smith sold 10 goats.

From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats as from Farm X, which means he sold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) goats.

Now, let's calculate the number of goats remaining in each farm.

In Farm X, initially there were 55 goats, and 10 were sold, so the number of goats left is \(55 - 10 = 45\).

In Farm Y, initially there were 45 goats, and 20 were sold, so the number of goats left is \(45 - 20 = 25\).

To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the remaining goats from Farm X and Farm Y:

\(45 + 25 = 70\).

So, the final numerical answer is 70."
"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
2. Divide the total amount spent on shoes by the total number of pairs bought.

James buys 2 pairs of shoes each month. There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of pairs of shoes he buys in a year is:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair of shoes, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs bought:
\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

So, the average amount James pays for each pair of shoes is:

So, the total amount you will have to pay is:
\[ 123 \]"
"To find out how many hours it would take to clean one-half of the rooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of rooms that need to be cleaned.
2. Calculate the total time required to clean those rooms in minutes.
3. Convert the total time from minutes to hours.

Step 1: Calculate the number of rooms that need to be cleaned.
One-half of 90 rooms is \( \frac{90}{2} = 45 \) rooms.

Step 2: Calculate the total time required to clean those rooms in minutes.
It takes 20 minutes to clean each room, so for 45 rooms, the total time is \( 45 \times 20 = 900 \) minutes.

Step 3: Convert the total time from minutes to hours.
There are 60 minutes in an hour, so \( 900 \) minutes is \( \frac{900}{60} = 15 \) hours.

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms.

The final numerical answer is 15."
"To determine the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built each year and then sum them up.

1. In the first year, the town builds 12 homes.
2. In the second year, they build three times the number of homes built in the first year. Therefore, they build \(3 \times 12 = 36\) homes.
3. In the third year, they double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total number of homes built in the first two years is \(12 + 36 = 48\). Therefore, in the third year, they build \(2 \times 48 = 96\) homes.

Now, we sum the homes built over the three years:
\[12 + 36 + 96 = 144\]

The total number of homes built over the next three years is \(\boxed{144}\)."
"Let's denote the ages as follows:

- Then my brother's age is \( S + 3 \).
- My sister's age is \( S - 2 \).
- My mom's age is \( 3(S + 3) - 1 = 3S + 8 \).

The sum of our ages is given as 87. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ S + (S + 3) + (S - 2) + (3S + 8) = 87 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ S + S + 3 + S - 2 + 3S + 8 = 87 \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 87 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 6S = 78 \]

Divide both sides by 6:

"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first calculate the total number of glue sticks required. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks needed is:

\[ 27 \times 2 = 54 \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of glue sticks are required to get at least 54 glue sticks. Since glue sticks come in packs of 8, we divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:

\[ \frac{54}{8} = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks. To ensure he has enough, we calculate the total number of glue sticks in 7 packs:

\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 \]

Since 56 is more than the 54 glue sticks needed, Mr. Jackson will have 2 extra glue sticks left over. Thus, the number of packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Amount of Water**: The initial amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

2. **After the First Day**: The amount of water doubles. Therefore, the amount of water after the first day is:
   \[
   4000 \text{ gallons} \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **After the Second Day**: The amount of water doubles again. Therefore, the amount of water after the second day is:
   \[
   8000 \text{ gallons} \times 2 = 16000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

4. **After the Third Day**: The volume of water increases by 6000 gallons. Therefore, the amount of water after the third day is:

Thus, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point after the third day is 22000 gallons."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of new infections each day and add them to the total number of infected people.

- **Day 0**: Initially, there are 10 infected people.
- **Day 1**: Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others, so \(10 \times 6 = 60\) new infections occur. Therefore, the total number of infected people after Day 1 is \(10 + 60 = 70\).
- **Day 2**: Now there are 70 infected people, and each of them infects 6 others, so \(70 \times 6 = 420\) new infections occur. Therefore, the total number of infected people after Day 2 is \(70 + 420 = 490\).
- **Day 3**: Now there are 490 infected people, and each of them infects 6 others, so \(490 \times 6 = 2940\) new infections occur. Therefore, the total number of infected people after Day 3 is \(490 + 2940 = 3430\).

So, the total number of people infected after three days is \(\boxed{3430}\)."

"Let's denote the number of books Anne has as \( A \). According to the problem, Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has \( A + 25 \) books. Additionally, Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Fawn has \( A + 12 \) books.

The total number of books that Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have together is 85. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (A + 25) + A + (A + 12) = 85 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ A + 25 + A + A + 12 = 85 \]
\[ 3A + 37 = 85 \]

Next, we solve for \( A \):

\[ 3A = 85 - 37 \]
\[ 3A = 48 \]
\[ A = \frac{48}{3} \]
\[ A = 16 \]

So, Anne has 16 books. Since Fawn has 12 more books than Anne, we calculate the number of books Fawn has as follows:

\[ \text{Madeline's share} = 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the total cost is $400, Keenan's share is:
\[ \text{Keenan's share} = 400 - 240 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much Keenan spends per week. There are approximately 4 weeks in a month, so we divide Keenan's monthly cost by 4:
\[ \text{Keenan's weekly cost} = \frac{160}{4} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 40 \]"
"First, let's calculate how many pieces Tobias ate on the first day. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 pieces:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ pieces}
\]

After the first day, the number of pieces remaining is:

\[
60 - 24 = 36 \text{ pieces}
\]

On the second day, Tobias ate 10 pieces, so the number of pieces remaining after the second day is:

\[
36 - 10 = 26 \text{ pieces}
\]

On the third day, Tobias ate \( \frac{7}{13} \) of the remaining 26 pieces:

\[
\frac{7}{13} \times 26 = 14 \text{ pieces}
\]

So, the total number of pieces Tobias has eaten so far is the sum of the pieces he ate on the first, second, and third days:

\[
24 + 10 + 14 = 48 \text{ pieces}
\]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the cost of one bottle of soda and one bottle of water.

For the soda:
- Seven bottles cost $21.00
- Therefore, the cost of one bottle of soda is $21.00 / 7 = $3.00

For the water:
- Four bottles cost $8.00
- Therefore, the cost of one bottle of water is $8.00 / 4 = $2.00

Now, let's calculate the cost for David's purchase:
- Three bottles of soda will cost 3 * $3.00 = $9.00
- Two bottles of water will cost 2 * $2.00 = $4.00

Adding these together, the total cost for David's purchase is $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00.

The final numerical answer is $13.00."

"To determine how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Use the total revenue to find the cost of the chickens.

First, let's find out how many chickens Isaias plans to sell. He plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his 300 chickens:
\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \text{ chickens}
\]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling these 180 chickens at $50 per chicken:
\[
180 \times 50 = 9000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. Therefore, the total cost of the chickens is the total revenue minus the desired profit:
\[
9000 - 2000 = 7000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the amount of money Isaias bought the chickens for is:

"First, let's determine how many glasses of lemonade Micah sold. We know that Julie, Micah, and Mitchell together sold 32 glasses of lemonade, and Julie sold 14 glasses. Therefore, the number of glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell together is:

\[ 32 - 14 = 18 \]

Since the boys (Micah and Mitchell) sold an equal number of glasses, we can divide the 18 glasses equally between them:

\[ \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

So, Micah sold 9 glasses of lemonade. Now, we need to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah:

\[ 14 - 9 = 5 \]

Therefore, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 5 \]"

The final numerical answer is $575."
"First, we need to calculate the total cost for Sarah's friend to buy the 20 meters of rope at $2 per meter.

\[
\text{Total cost} = 20 \text{ meters} \times \$2/\text{meter} = \$40
\]

Next, we need to determine how much money Sarah will have after selling the rope. Since she sells the rope for $2 per meter, the total amount of money she will have is:

\[
\text{Total money} = 20 \text{ meters} \times \$2/\text{meter} = \$40
\]

Now, we need to find out how much money Sarah will have left after buying the new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and she needs to buy 20 meters of it:

\[
\text{Cost of new rope} = 20 \text{ meters} \times \$1.5/\text{meter} = \$30

"To solve this problem, let's denote Melanie's current age as \( x \).

According to the problem, in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 10 = 18 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 18 - 10 \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

We need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. Let's denote the number of years from now as \( y \). At that time, her age will be \( 8 + y \), and we want this to be three times her current age:
\[ 8 + y = 3 \times 8 \]
\[ 8 + y = 24 \]

Solving for \( y \):
\[ y = 24 - 8 \]
\[ y = 16 \]

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 16 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of each item Kelly is purchasing:

1. **Bacon:**
   - Kelly has 5 packs of bacon.
   - The total cost for the bacon is $10.
   - Therefore, the cost per pack of bacon is \( \frac{10}{5} = $2 \).

2. **Chicken:**
   - Kelly has 6 packets of chicken.
   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - Since a pack of bacon costs $2, a packet of chicken costs \( 2 \times 2 = $4 \).
   - Therefore, the total cost for the chicken is \( 6 \times 4 = $24 \).

3. **Strawberries:**
   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries.
   - Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the strawberries is \( 3 \times 4 = $12 \).

4. **Apples:**
   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples.
   - Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   - Since a pack of strawberries costs $4, a pack of apples costs \( \frac{4}{2} = $2 \).
   - Therefore, the total cost for the apples is \( 7 \times 2 = $14 \).

Now, let's sum up the total cost of all the items:
- Total cost of bacon: $10
- Total cost of chicken: $24
- Total cost of strawberries: $12
- Total cost of apples: $14

The total cost of all items is \( 10 + 24 + 12 + 14 = $60 \).

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget:
- Money left = $65 - $60 = $5.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the usual runtime of Elaina's concerts as \( x \) minutes. According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, so the final concert is \( 2x \) minutes long. Additionally, at the end of the final concert, she performs a 15-minute encore. Therefore, the total runtime of the final concert, including the encore, is \( 2x + 15 \) minutes.

We are given that the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. So, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual runtime of Elaina's concerts is 25 minutes. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of petals for the orchids. Joelle has 5 orchids, and each orchid has 5 petals. So, the total number of petals for the orchids is:

\[ 5 \text{ orchids} \times 5 \text{ petals/orchid} = 25 \text{ petals} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals for the African daisies. Joelle has 4 African daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals. So, the total number of petals for the daisies is:

\[ 4 \text{ daisies} \times 10 \text{ petals/daisy} = 40 \text{ petals} \]

Now, to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we subtract the total number of petals of the orchids from the total number of petals of the daisies:

\[ 40 \text{ petals} - 25 \text{ petals} = 15 \text{ petals} \]

So, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, we find out how many plants are remaining after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants, so we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. We can find the number of flowering plants by subtracting the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:

\[ \text{Number of flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25 \]

To find what percent of the total plants are flowering plants, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Tasha made from mowing lawns and then subtract that amount from her total earnings to find out how much she made from lemonade sales.

First, let's determine how many times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn. Since Joe paid her $6 and she mowed his lawn once, we can assume that she mowed Joe's lawn once.

Next, we calculate how many times she mowed Kamala's lawn. According to the problem, she mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as she did Joe's. Since she mowed Joe's lawn once, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times.

Then, we calculate how many times she mowed Alba's lawn. The problem states that she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's. Since she mowed Joe's lawn once, she mowed Alba's lawn 5 times.

Now, we can calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns. She earned $6 from Joe's lawn, $6 from Kamala's lawn, and $6 from Alba's lawn. Therefore, her total earnings from mowing lawns are:
\[ 6 + 6 + 6 = 18 \]

Tasha's total earnings for the month were $80. To find out how much she made from lemonade sales, we subtract her earnings from mowing lawns from her total earnings:

\[ \text{Christian's weight} = 71 \, \text{kg} + 8 \, \text{kg} \]
\[ \text{Christian's weight} = 79 \, \text{kg} \]

Finally, we determine Harry's weight, which is 5 kg less than Christian's weight:

\[ \text{Harry's weight} = \text{Christian's weight} - 5 \]
\[ \text{Harry's weight} = 79 \, \text{kg} - 5 \, \text{kg} \]
\[ \text{Harry's weight} = 74 \, \text{kg} \]

So, the weight of Harry is 74 kg."

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to first understand the capacity of the pot in terms of adult and child bowls.

The pot can fill:
- 4 adult's bowls
- 8 child's bowls

Since Calvin is an adult, he will have one bowl of soup. His wife is also an adult, so she will have one bowl of soup. This accounts for 2 adult bowls. The remaining bowls will be for the two children.

The pot can fill 8 child's bowls, and we have already used 2 adult bowls (1 for Calvin and 1 for his wife). Therefore, the remaining bowls are:
\[ 8 - 2 = 6 \text{ child's bowls} \]

Since there are two children, we need to determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup. We divide the remaining bowls by the number of children:
\[ \frac{6 \text{ child's bowls}}{2 \text{ children}} = 3 \text{ times} \]

Thus, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch 3 times.

"To determine how much material Jo would need to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we can first calculate the material required for each type of mask and then sum them up.

For small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \) yards.
- For 20 small masks, the material needed is \( 20 \times 0.5 = 10 \) yards.

For large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25}{3} = 0.75 \) yards.
- For 8 large masks, the material needed is \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \) yards.

Adding the material needed for both types of masks:
- Total material needed = material for small masks + material for large masks
- Total material needed = 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards.

"To determine how much free time Harold has left in his day, we need to calculate the total time he spends on his activities and then subtract that from the total hours in a day.

1. Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. He works for 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.
3. He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, let's add up the time spent on these activities:
\[ 10 \text{ (sleep)} + 8 \text{ (work)} + 1 \text{ (walk dog)} = 19 \text{ hours} \]

A day has 24 hours, so the free time Harold has left is:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"First, let's determine how many blue shoe boxes Tim uses. Tim starts with 7 blue shoe boxes and uses 3 of them. So, the number of blue shoe boxes left is:

\[ 7 - 3 = 4 \]

Next, let's find out how many red shoe boxes Tim uses. Tim starts with 9 red shoe boxes and uses \(\frac{1}{3}\) of them. So, the number of red shoe boxes used is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3 \]

Therefore, the number of red shoe boxes left is:

\[ 9 - 3 = 6 \]

Now, we can find the total number of blue and red shoe boxes left by adding the remaining blue and red shoe boxes together:

\[ 4 + 6 = 10 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 10 \]"
"First, we need to determine how many books Joseph originally had. Since Joseph had twice the number of books that Sarah had, and Sarah had 9 books, we calculate:

\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

So, Joseph originally had 18 books. However, he lost 2 books. To find out how many books Joseph currently has, we subtract the 2 lost books from the original 18 books:

\[ 18 - 2 = 16 \]

Therefore, the final number of books Joseph currently has is 16."
"First, we need to calculate how many marbles Dean gives to Jamie. Dean gives 1/5 of his 30 marbles to Jamie:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 30 = 6 \]

So, Dean gives 6 marbles to Jamie. After giving 6 marbles to Jamie, Dean has:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

marbles left. Then, Dean gives 10 marbles to Donald. After giving 10 marbles to Donald, Dean has:

\[ 24 - 10 = 14 \]

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information provided.

Let \( D \) be Duncan's age eight years ago and \( A \) be Adam's age four years ago.

From the problem, we know:
1. Duncan's current age is 60.
2. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( 60 - 8 = 52 \).
3. Eight years ago, Duncan's age (\( D \)) was two times Adam's age four years ago (\( A \)).
4. Therefore, we can write the equation: \( D = 2A \).

Substituting the value of \( D \) from the first piece of information:
\[ 52 = 2A \]

Solving for \( A \):
\[ A = \frac{52}{2} = 26 \]

So, four years ago, Adam was 26 years old. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his age four years ago:
\[ 26 + 8 = 34 \]

Therefore, Adam will be 34 years old in 8 years.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 34 \]"
"First, let's determine the size of Farmer Smith's farm. Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

Twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm is:
\[ 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ acres} \]

Adding 100 acres to this amount gives the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \text{ acres} \]

Now, to find the total number of acres for both farms, we add the size of Farmer Brown's farm to the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 200 + 500 = 700 \text{ acres} \]

So, the total number of acres for both farms together is:
\[ 700 \]"
"First, let's determine how many packages Colby completes per hour. According to the problem, he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. So, we calculate:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

This means Colby completes 40 packages per hour. 

Next, we need to find out how many packages he completes in an eight-hour workday. Since he completes 40 packages per hour, in an eight-hour workday he completes:

\[ 40 \times 8 = 320 \]

Colby gets paid $0.20 for each package he completes. Therefore, his total earnings for the day are:

\[ 320 \times 0.20 = 64 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the time John spends on an extreme sudoku puzzle. A normal sudoku puzzle takes him 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long:

\[ 45 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many half-hour intervals are in 180 minutes. Since there are 30 minutes in a half-hour:

\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/half-hour}} = 6 \text{ half-hours} \]

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half-hour, he will drink one bottle of water for each half-hour interval. Therefore, he will drink:

\[ 6 \text{ bottles of water} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"Let's denote the number of red balloons as \( R \) and the number of yellow balloons as \( Y \). According to the problem, \( R = 20 \).

Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon, so the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is \( 2R \). Given that \( R = 20 \), the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \).

The total number of pieces of bologna thrown at all balloons is 58. Therefore, the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons is \( 58 - 40 = 18 \).

Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, the number of yellow balloons \( Y \) can be found by dividing the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons by 3. So, \( Y = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).

Thus, the number of yellow balloons is \( 6 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to calculate the total distance Jon drives in a month. Since he drives 100 miles a day for a 30-day month, the total distance is:

\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how many tune-ups he needs. Since his car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total distance by 1000:

\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

So, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time. The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total number of hours Bruce works over the three days, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Tuesday**: Bruce works for 5 hours.
2. **Wednesday**: Bruce works twice the time he works on Tuesday. Therefore, he works \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.
3. **Thursday**: Bruce works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday. Therefore, he works \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.

Now, we sum the hours worked over the three days:
\[ 5 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 10 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 8 \text{ (Thursday)} = 23 \text{ hours} \]

The total number of hours Bruce works in all these three days is \(\boxed{23}\)."
"To determine how much Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount spent and then divide it by 2.

First, let's calculate the cost of the cake:
\[ \text{Cost of the cake} = \$11 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the balloons. They bought 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons. The balloons cost $0.5 for 2 balloons:
\[ \text{Cost per 2 balloons} = \$0.5 \]
\[ \text{Number of sets of 2 balloons} = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]
\[ \text{Cost of the balloons} = 6 \times \$0.5 = \$3 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the ice cream. They bought 2 tubs of ice cream, each costing $7:
\[ \text{Cost of 2 tubs of ice cream} = 2 \times \$7 = \$14 \]

Now, let's find the total amount spent:
\[ \text{Total amount spent} = \text{Cost of the cake} + \text{Cost of the balloons} + \text{Cost of the ice cream} \]
\[ \text{Total amount spent} = \$11 + \$3 + \$14 = \$28 \]

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances, the total amount given by their mother is twice the total amount spent:
\[ \text{Total amount given by their mother} = 2 \times \$28 = \$56 \]

Finally, we divide the total amount given by their mother by 2 to find out how much each one received:
\[ \text{Amount each received} = \frac{\$56}{2} = \$28 \]

Thus, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them:
\[ \boxed{28} \]"

- Soccer: There are 16 boys and 22 girls, which totals to \(16 + 22 = 38\) students playing soccer.

Now, let's add up the total number of students playing all the sports:

- Tennis: 6 students
- Volleyball: 12 students
- Soccer: 38 students

Total number of students = \(6 + 12 + 38 = 56\)

The final numerical answer is 56."
"First, let's calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class. Since there are 30 students and each student sold an average of 10 lollipops, the total number of lollipops sold is:

\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops. Each lollypop was sold for $0.8, so the total revenue is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollypop} = \$240 \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops. Each lollypop was bought for $0.5, so the total cost is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollypop} = \$150 \]

Finally, the profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ \$240 - \$150 = \$90 \]

So, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops."
"First, let's determine the number of each type of pet Larry has:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats. Therefore, the number of dogs is \(3 \times 3 = 9\).
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. Therefore, the number of rabbits is \(9 - 2 = 7\).
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits. Therefore, the number of fish is \(3 \times 7 = 21\).
5. He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has. Therefore, the number of gerbils is \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\).

Now, let's sum up all the pets:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total cups of tea**: Lana has 27 cups of tea.
2. **Rows of tea cups**: She divides these cups into 3 rows, so each row has \( \frac{27}{3} = 9 \) cups.
3. **Tea types in each row**: In each row, she brews an equal amount of chamomile and mint tea. Therefore, each row has \( \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \) cups of chamomile tea and \( \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \) cups of mint tea.
4. **Cups of cinnamon tea**: She uses the remaining cups to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea. Since she has 27 cups in total and 15 of these are cinnamon tea, the remaining \( 27 - 15 = 12 \) cups are for chamomile and mint tea.

Since each row has 9 cups and each row has 4.5 cups of chamomile tea and 4.5 cups of mint tea, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is 4.5.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which the sloth picks berries and then use that rate to find out how many berries he can pick up in the given time.

First, let's break down the information:
- The sloth takes 4 hours to make a trip down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up.
- The sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

Since the sloth takes 4 hours to pick up berries, we can calculate the number of berries he picks up in 4 hours. Let's denote the number of berries he picks up in 4 hours as \( B \).

Given that he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we can set up the following proportion:
\[ \frac{B}{4 \text{ hours}} = \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{8 \text{ hours}} \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{8 \text{ hours}} \times 4 \text{ hours} \]
\[ B = 3 \text{ berries/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} \]
\[ B = 12 \text{ berries} \]

So, the sloth picks up 12 berries in 4 hours. To find out how many berries he picks up per trip, we divide the total number of berries by the number of trips:
\[ \text{Number of trips} = \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{12 \text{ berries/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips} \]

Since he makes 2 trips in 8 hours, the number of berries he picks up per trip is:
\[ \text{Berries per trip} = \frac{12 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 6 \text{ berries/trip} \]

Therefore, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, we need to determine the amount of water in the tank. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons of water, the tank will have:

\[ \text{Tank capacity} = \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much water will be left in the tank after 6 days, given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. The total amount of water removed from the tank over 6 days is:

\[ \text{Total water removed} = 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[ \text{Remaining water} = 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2000 \]"
"To determine how many more movies Colby can see, we need to calculate his remaining budget after accounting for the items he has already purchased.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items he has already bought:
- 2 tubs of popcorn: \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars
- 4 boxes of candy: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars
- 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday: \(5 \times 10 = 50\) dollars
- 8 movies on other days: \(8 \times 7 = 56\) dollars

Adding these up gives the total cost of the items he has already bought:
\[16 + 8 + 50 + 56 = 120\] dollars

Colby starts with $150, so his remaining budget is:
\[150 - 120 = 30\] dollars

Now, we need to determine how many more movies he can see with the remaining $30. Since each movie ticket costs $7, we divide the remaining budget by the cost of one movie ticket:
\[30 \div 7 = 4.2857\]

Since Colby can only see whole movies, he can see 4 more movies.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to calculate the calories for the mini versions of the pastries.

For the mini cinnamon rolls:
- A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
- A mini cinnamon roll has \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll.
- Therefore, a mini cinnamon roll has \( \frac{600}{3} = 200 \) calories.
- Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls.
- So, the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls are \( 200 \times 200 = 40000 \) calories.

For the mini blueberry muffins:
- A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
- A mini blueberry muffin has \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin.
- Therefore, a mini blueberry muffin has \( \frac{450}{3} = 150 \) calories.
- Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins.
- So, the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins are \( 300 \times 150 = 45000 \) calories.

Adding the calories from both types of pastries:
- Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls: 40000 calories.
- Total calories from mini blueberry muffins: 45000 calories.
- Therefore, the total calories from all the pastries are \( 40000 + 45000 = 85000 \) calories.

The final numerical answer is 85000."
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the five days and then divide that total by the number of days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, so she removed \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs each day.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days:
\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

First, add the Junebugs removed on Monday and Tuesday:
\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]

Next, add the Junebugs removed on Wednesday:
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]

Then, add the Junebugs removed on Thursday:
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]

Finally, add the Junebugs removed on Friday:
\[
243 + 57 = 300
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days is 300.

To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days (5):
\[
\frac{300}{5} = 60
\]

Thus, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"First, we calculate the distance traveled by the bus. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For the bus:
\[ \text{Speed} = 60 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, the distance traveled by the bus is:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \times 5 = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance traveled by the car:
\[ \text{Speed} = 30 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

So, the distance traveled by the car is:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 30 \times 8 = 240 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 300 - 240 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the bus went 60 miles farther than the car. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 60 \]"
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to calculate the total number of toys Sophie already had before buying the bouncy balls and then subtract that number from the total number of toys she has now.

The number of building blocks is 31.
The number of stuffed animals is 8.
The number of stacking rings is 9.

Adding these together gives us the total number of toys Sophie had before buying the bouncy balls:
\[ 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 \]

Sophie now has a total of 62 toys. To find out how many bouncy balls she bought, we subtract the number of toys she had before from the total number of toys she has now:
\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

Therefore, the number of bouncy balls that came in the tube is 14."
"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old:
   \[
   P + Pa + J = 100
   \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   Pa = J + 10
   \]

3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = Pa + J
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now, we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, we can find Paul's age:
\[
Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]

And Peter's age:
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

So, Peter's age is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"Initially, Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons, which totals to \(4 \times 2 = 8\) water balloons. Maria also received 2 water balloons, so the total number of water balloons at this point is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Then, her mom gave each person 3 more water balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional water balloons is \(5 \times 3 = 15\).

Adding these to the previous total, the girls had \(10 + 15 = 25\) water balloons in total.

The final numerical answer is 25."
"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes of stuff available for the yard sale.

1. The charity group has 10 people who each donate 5 boxes of stuff. So, the total number of boxes donated is:
   \[
   10 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ boxes/person} = 50 \text{ boxes}
   \]

2. They also have 10 boxes of stuff already. So, the total number of boxes available is:
   \[
   50 \text{ boxes donated} + 10 \text{ boxes already owned} = 60 \text{ boxes}
   \]

Next, we need to determine how many tables are needed to fit all the boxes. They can fit 2 boxes per table.

3. The number of tables needed to fit 60 boxes is:
   \[
   \frac{60 \text{ boxes}}{2 \text{ boxes/table}} = 30 \text{ tables}

"First, we need to calculate the total distance each person spits the seeds.

For Zoey:
- Number of seeds = 40
- Distance per seed = 10 feet
- Total distance = 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet

For Sydney:
- Number of seeds = 35
- Distance per seed = 12 feet
- Total distance = 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet

Next, we find the total distance both spitted:
- Total distance = Zoey's total distance + Sydney's total distance
- Total distance = 400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance by the number of people (2):
- Average total distance = Total distance / Number of people
- Average total distance = 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the daily, monthly, and total earnings for each machine.

First, let's calculate the daily production and earnings for the Widgeteer 3000:
- The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour.
- It runs 24 hours a day.
- Therefore, the daily production is \(60 \times 24 = 1440\) widgets.
- Each widget sells for $6.
- Therefore, the daily earnings from the Widgeteer 3000 are \(1440 \times 6 = 8640\) dollars.
- For a month with 30 days, the total earnings are \(8640 \times 30 = 259200\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the daily production and earnings for the WidgetMaster 9000:
- The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour.
- It also runs 24 hours a day.
- Therefore, the daily production is \(45 \times 24 = 1080\) widgets.
- Each widget sells for $6.
- Therefore, the daily earnings from the WidgetMaster 9000 are \(1080 \times 6 = 6480\) dollars.
- For a month with 30 days, the total earnings are \(6480 \times 30 = 194400\) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in earnings between the Widgeteer 3000 and the WidgetMaster 9000:
- The difference in earnings is \(259200 - 194400 = 64800\) dollars.

Therefore, Fern will make \(\boxed{64800}\) dollars more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000."

First, let's calculate the cost if Cameron chooses the 24-hour option:
- The initial 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos.
- The additional 12 hours (24-hour stay) cost 1600 pesos.
- Therefore, the total cost for the 24-hour option is 1000 + 1600 = 2600 pesos.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Cameron chooses the option of adding 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark:
- The initial 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos.
- Cameron stays from 5 pm to 10 am the next morning, which is 17 hours in total.
- The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos.
- The additional 5 hours cost 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.
- Therefore, the total cost for the 17-hour option is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Now, we find the difference between the two options to determine how much Cameron would save:
- The savings would be the cost of the 24-hour option minus the cost of the 17-hour option.
- The savings are 2600 - 1350 = 1250 pesos.

The final numerical answer is:
1250"
"First, let's determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. So, we calculate twice the amount each goat needs and then subtract 3 pounds:

\[ \text{Hay per sheep} = 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep. There are 15 goats, and each needs 5 pounds of hay:

\[ \text{Hay for goats} = 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

There are 12 sheep, and each needs 7 pounds of hay:

\[ \text{Hay for sheep} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the hay needed for the goats and the sheep gives us the total amount of hay Nate needs:

\[ \text{Total hay} = 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 159 \]"
"First, let's calculate John's total earnings for the week:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Hourly wage} \times \text{Hours worked} = 50 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the cost of gas from his total earnings:
\[ \text{Remaining money after gas} = \text{Total earnings} - \text{Cost of gas} = 300 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 250 \, \text{dollars} \]

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so we subtract that from his remaining money:
\[ \text{Money left after deposit} = \text{Remaining money after gas} - \text{Deposit} = 250 \, \text{dollars} - 100 \, \text{dollars} = 150 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, we need to account for the cost of the pencils. Each pencil costs 10 dollars and he buys 5 pencils:
\[ \text{Cost of pencils} = \text{Number of pencils} \times \text{Cost per pencil} = 5 \times 10 \, \text{dollars} = 50 \, \text{dollars} \]

Subtract the cost of the pencils from the money left after the deposit:
\[ \text{Money left after pencils} = \text{Money left after deposit} - \text{Cost of pencils} = 150 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 100 \, \text{dollars} \]

Finally, we need to determine how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with the remaining money:
\[ \text{Number of pens} = \frac{\text{Money left after pencils}}{\text{Cost per pen}} = \frac{100 \, \text{dollars}}{25 \, \text{dollars/pen}} = 4 \, \text{pens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of letters Craig has spelled out. Craig has spelled out 20 words with 15 letters each. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig has spelled out is:

\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled out. According to the problem, Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled out is:

\[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]

Now, to find the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds, we add the total number of letters spelled out by Craig and his brother:

\[ 300 + 350 = 650 \]

Thus, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is:

\[ \boxed{650} \]"

3. There are 5 different schools.

First, calculate the number of children in one school:
\[ 8 \text{ children/row} \times 7 \text{ rows} = 56 \text{ children/school} \]

Next, calculate the total number of children for all 5 schools:
\[ 56 \text{ children/school} \times 5 \text{ schools} = 280 \text{ children} \]

Therefore, the total number of children in the drill is:
\[ 280 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can redeem with her coupons. The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. Therefore, the total number of bottles from the coupons is:

\[ 9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles/coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles of apple juice are given to the students. There are 29 pupils, and each student receives 2 bottles of apple juice. Therefore, the total number of bottles given to the students is:

\[ 29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles/student} = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher has to find out how many bottles the teacher has left for herself:

\[ 900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

So, the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself is:

\[ 842 \]"
"To calculate the total charge for Patty's Plumbing, we need to consider the visit fee, the labor cost, and the cost of parts.

1. The visit fee is $40.
2. The labor cost is $35 per hour. Since the job took 2.25 hours, the labor cost is \(2.25 \times 35\).
3. The cost of parts is $60.

Let's calculate the labor cost first:
\[ 2.25 \times 35 = 78.75 \]

Now, we add the visit fee, the labor cost, and the cost of parts:
\[ 40 + 78.75 + 60 = 178.75 \]

So, Patty charged:
\[ 178.75 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount. James gets 10 new CDs, and each CD costs $15. Therefore, the total cost is:

\[ 10 \times 15 = 150 \]

Next, we apply the 40% discount to the total cost. A 40% discount means he pays 60% of the original price. So, the cost after the discount is:

\[ 150 \times 0.60 = 90 \]

James decides to sell 5 of the CDs he doesn't like for $40. The total amount he receives from selling these 5 CDs is $40. To find out how much money he is out, we subtract the amount he received from the amount he spent on the CDs:

\[ 90 - 40 = 50 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 50 \]"
"To calculate the total earnings, we need to multiply the number of each type of root crop by its respective price and then sum up all the earnings.

For the yams:
6 yams * $1.5 per yam = $9

For the sweet potatoes:
10 sweet potatoes * $2 per sweet potato = $20

For the carrots:
4 carrots * $1.25 per carrot = $5

Now, we add up all the earnings:
$9 (from yams) + $20 (from sweet potatoes) + $5 (from carrots) = $34

So, Jen will earn $34 if she sells everything.

The final numerical answer is: $34"
"First, let's calculate the distance James swims. He swims 60% of the 20-mile lake, which is:

\[ 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes for him to swim 12 miles at a pace of 2 miles per hour:

\[ \text{Time to swim 12 miles} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

After swimming, he rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is:

\[ \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

The remaining distance to be swum is:

\[ 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

Since he swims at half the speed after resting, his new swimming speed is:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile/hour} \]

The time it takes to swim the remaining 8 miles at this speed is:

\[ \text{Time to swim remaining 8 miles} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Adding up all the times, the total time taken is:

\[ 6 \text{ hours (swimming)} + 3 \text{ hours (rest)} + 8 \text{ hours (swimming)} = 17 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time it took James to get across the lake is:

\[ \boxed{17} \]"
"First, let's determine seven times the number of loaves of bread Sam had last Friday. Since Sam had seventy loaves, we calculate:

\[ 7 \times 70 = 490 \]

Next, we need to find out how many loaves of bread the bakery has, which is 40 less than seven times the number of loaves Sam had. We subtract 40 from 490:

\[ 490 - 40 = 450 \]

So, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 450 \]"
"Jasmine starts with 15 stickers. She loses 7 stickers, so she has:

Therefore, the final number of stickers Jasmine has is:
\[ 13 \]"
"To calculate the total commission Cayley will earn, we need to calculate the commission from each newspaper separately and then sum them up.

For the New York Times:
- Commission rate: 10%
- Cost per copy: $5
- Number of copies: 6

The commission from New York Times is calculated as:
\[ \text{Commission from NYT} = 6 \times 5 \times \frac{10}{100} = 6 \times 5 \times 0.10 = 30 \times 0.10 = 3 \]

For the Wall Street Journal:
- Commission rate: 8%
- Cost per copy: $15
- Number of copies: 10

The commission from Wall Street Journal is calculated as:
\[ \text{Commission from WSJ} = 10 \times 15 \times \frac{8}{100} = 10 \times 15 \times 0.08 = 150 \times 0.08 = 12 \]

Now, we sum the commissions from both newspapers to get the total commission:
\[ \text{Total Commission} = 3 + 12 = 15 \]

So, the total commission Cayley will earn is $15."
"To find out how old Leo is, we can start by determining Marcus's age based on the information given.

1. We know that Deanna is 26 years old.
2. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so Marcus's age is \(26 - 5 = 21\) years.
3. Marcus is also half of Leo’s age, so if Marcus is 21, then Leo's age is \(21 \times 2 = 42\) years.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 42."
"Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as \( A \), by Bahati as \( B \), and by Dinar as \( D \).

From the problem, we know:
1. \( B = A + 20 \)
2. \( B = D + 10 \)
3. \( B + A + D = 45 \)

First, we can express \( D \) in terms of \( A \) using the first two equations:
\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]
Since \( B = A + 20 \), we can substitute \( B \) in the second equation:
\[ A + 20 = D + 10 \]
Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = A + 10 \]

Now we substitute \( B \) and \( D \) in terms of \( A \) into the total points equation:
\[ (A + 20) + A + (A + 10) = 45 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]
Subtract 30 from both sides:
\[ 3A = 15 \]
Divide by 3:
\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine the total number of pages in the book, we need to consider the thickness of the book and the number of pages per inch.

Given:

- For every inch, there are 100 pages.

First, calculate the number of pages in 1 inch:
\[ \text{Pages per inch} = 100 \]

Next, calculate the number of pages in 1.5 inches:
\[ \text{Pages in 1.5 inches} = 1.5 \times 100 \]

Now, perform the multiplication:
\[ 1.5 \times 100 = 150 \]

Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is:
\[ \boxed{150} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total time Vince spent stapling reports. He started at 8:00 AM and finished at 11:00 PM. 

From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours. Converting this into minutes, we get:
\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes, we divide 900 by 15:
\[ 900 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, the total number of reports he staples is:
\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 1800 \]"
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up early.

1. **Total sleep time**: Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Converting this to minutes, we get \(8 \times 60 = 480\) minutes.
2. **Time spent sleepwalking**: Kim sleepwalked from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is \(2:38 - 2:15 = 23\) minutes.
3. **Time she woke up early**: Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom, which is 5 minutes.

Now, we subtract the time spent sleepwalking and the time she woke up early from the total sleep time:
\[480 - 23 - 5 = 452\]

Therefore, the number of minutes Kim slept on her bed that day is 452 minutes."
"First, let's determine the number of measuring cups Jonathan has. Since he has two dozen measuring cups, we calculate:

\[ 2 \text{ dozen} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ measuring cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how many measuring spoons Jonathan has. According to the problem, he has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Therefore, we calculate the number of measuring spoons as follows:

\[ \text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = \frac{2 \times 24}{3} = \frac{48}{3} = 16 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons. So, we need to subtract these 6 spoons from the original 16 spoons:

\[ \text{Remaining measuring spoons} = 16 - 6 = 10 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Now, we add the remaining measuring spoons to the number of measuring cups to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining:

\[ \text{Total number of utensils} = 24 \text{ measuring cups} + 10 \text{ measuring spoons} = 34 \]

Thus, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"First, let's determine the initial number of occupied beds in the hospital. Given that the hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied, we can calculate the initial number of occupied beds as follows:

\[ \text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

Next, we need to find out how many patients are admitted into the hospital over the course of 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks (14 days) is:

\[ \text{Total patients admitted} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks by adding the initial number of occupied beds to the total number of patients admitted:

\[ \text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Finally, to find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the total number of occupied beds from the total capacity of the hospital:

\[ \text{Unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 900 = 100 \]

So, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of emails Robyn sends to her family. We know that out of the sixteen emails, seven are work emails. Therefore, the number of non-work emails is:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these non-work emails are sent to her family. According to the problem, two-thirds of the non-work emails are sent to her family. So, the number of emails sent to her family is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

Now, we need to find out how many emails are left after sending emails to her family. This is:

\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

These remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. According to the problem, one-third of these remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. So, the number of emails sent to her boyfriend is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

Therefore, the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day is:

"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate the number that is 20% less than the number Courtney reported.

Courtney reported that there were 48 people at the concert. If this number is 20% more than the actual number, we can set up the following equation to find the actual number of people, which we will call \( x \):

\[ 48 = x + 0.20x \]
\[ 48 = 1.20x \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.20:

\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \). According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2J = 2 \]
Solving for \( J \), we get:
\[ J = 1 \]

Now we can determine how many balls each boy carried:
- Jeffrey carried \( J = 1 \) ball.
- Jason carried \( 2J = 2 \) balls.
- Jordan carried \( 4J = 4 \times 1 = 4 \) balls.

Adding these together, the total number of balls is:
\[ 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 \]

So, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To determine how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the number of holes at the end of the first day.
3. Calculate the number of holes at the end of the third day.
4. Use the information about the number of holes at the end of the third day to find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
- Holes dug on the first day: 10
- Holes dug on the second day: 13
- Holes dug on the third day before filling: 8

Total holes dug by the end of the third day = 10 + 13 + 8 = 31

Next, we know that the island had four times as many holes by the end of the third day as it did at the end of the first day. Let's denote the number of holes at the end of the first day as \( H_1 \). According to the problem, \( 4 \times H_1 = 31 \).

Solving for \( H_1 \):
\[ H_1 = \frac{31}{4} = 7.75 \]

Since the number of holes must be a whole number, and considering the context of digging holes, it seems there might be a slight discrepancy in the problem's setup or interpretation. However, we can proceed with the given numbers and assume the problem intends for us to use the total holes dug by the end of the third day.

At the end of the third day, the pirates filled in 2 holes, so the number of holes at the end of the third day is:
\[ 31 - 2 = 29 \]

Now, we know that by the end of the fourth day, the number of holes is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day, which is 29. Therefore, the number of holes at the end of the fourth day is:
\[ 4 \times 29 = 116 \]

Since the number of holes at the end of the third day is 29, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[ 116 - 29 = 87 \]

Thus, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day is:
\[ \boxed{87} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of corn chips based on the given conditions.

\[ \text{Collins' chips} = 70 + 15 = 85 \]

Next, calculate the total number of corn chips by summing the chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:
\[ \text{Total chips} = 70 + 70 + 85 \]

Now, perform the addition:
\[ 70 + 70 = 140 \]
\[ 140 + 85 = 225 \]

Therefore, the total number of corn chips is:
\[ \boxed{225} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the cost of the travel tickets. The problem states that the travel tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. Jen has to pay $400 for the supplies.

To find 50% of $400, we calculate:
\[ 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the cost of the travel tickets is:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Therefore, the total cost for the travel is $600."
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( X = S + 5 \)
2. \( S = 4A - 13 \)
3. \( X + S + A = 339 \)

First, we substitute the expressions for \( X \) and \( S \) from the first two equations into the third equation.

Substituting \( X = S + 5 \) and \( S = 4A - 13 \) into \( X + S + A = 339 \):

\[ (4A - 13) + 5 + (4A - 13) + A = 339 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 4A - 13 + 5 + 4A - 13 + A = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Add 21 to both sides:

\[ 9A = 360 \]

Divide both sides by 9:

\[ A = 40 \]

Now, we can find \( S \) using \( S = 4A - 13 \):

\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 147 \]"

   - There are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode.
   - Let \( E \) be the number of episodes and \( M \) be the number of minutes per episode.
   - Given \( M = 20 \) minutes per episode.
   - According to the problem, \( E = \frac{M}{2} \).

2. **Calculate the number of episodes:**
   - Substitute \( M = 20 \) into the equation \( E = \frac{M}{2} \):
     \[
     E = \frac{20}{2} = 10
     \]
   - So, there are 10 episodes.

3. **Calculate the total time spent watching the show:**
   - Each episode is 20 minutes long.
   - There are 10 episodes.
   - Total time \( T \) is given by:
     \[
     T = E \times M = 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show is 200 minutes."
"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance the bird traveled in each segment of her journey and then sum these distances.

1. **First Segment:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Direction: Norttherly
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \)

3. **Third Segment:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \)

Now, we sum the distances of all three segments to find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes:

\[
300 \text{ miles} + 36 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 446 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is \( 446 \) miles."

   \frac{1}{2} \text{ dozen} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ brownies}
   \]

3. At her friends' surprise party, she received 4 dozen brownies.
   \[
   4 \text{ dozen} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ brownies}
   \]

Now, let's sum up all the brownies she received:
\[
12 \text{ (initial batch)} + 6 \text{ (from office)} + 48 \text{ (from friends)} = 66 \text{ brownies}
   \]

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. Let's convert this to individual brownies:
\[
1 \frac{1}{2} \text{ dozen} = 1.5 \text{ dozen} = 1.5 \times 12 = 18 \text{ brownies}
   \]

Now, let's subtract the brownies eaten from the total number of brownies:
\[
66 \text{ (total brownies)} - 18 \text{ (eaten brownies)} = 48 \text{ brownies}
   \]

Therefore, the number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is:
\[
\boxed{48}

"First, let's determine the ages of Nani's brother and sister.

Nani's age is 8 years.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so:
\[ \text{Brother's age} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ years} \]

Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani, which means she is 75% of Nani's age:
\[ \text{Sister's age} = 0.75 \times 8 = 6 \text{ years} \]

Now, let's calculate the total age of all three family members:
\[ \text{Total age} = \text{Nani's age} + \text{Brother's age} + \text{Sister's age} \]
\[ \text{Total age} = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 \text{ years} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 30 \]"
"To find the total time Andy will take to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time taken for each type of racquet and then sum these times.

For the racquets strung with synthetic gut:
\[ 3 \text{ racquets} \times 15 \text{ minutes per racquet} = 45 \text{ minutes} \]

For the racquets strung with polyester string:
\[ 5 \text{ racquets} \times 22 \text{ minutes per racquet} = 110 \text{ minutes} \]

For the racquets strung with a hybrid set:
\[ 4 \text{ racquets} \times 18 \text{ minutes per racquet} = 72 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we sum these times to find the total time:
\[ 45 \text{ minutes} + 110 \text{ minutes} + 72 \text{ minutes} = 227 \text{ minutes} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 227 \]"
"To determine the total cost of the phones, we need to consider the pricing structure and the number of phones John is buying.

1. The first two phones cost the full price of $600 each.
2. Each phone after the first two is half price, which means each of these phones costs $600 / 2 = $300.

John is buying phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, which totals 4 phones.

- Cost of the first 2 phones: 2 * $600 = $1200
- Cost of the remaining 2 phones: 2 * $300 = $600

Adding these together gives the total cost:
$1200 + $600 = $1800

So, the total amount John paid for the phones is $1800."
"To find the total number of players in both teams combined, we first need to determine the number of players on Zeke's team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team as follows:

Number of players on Zeke's team = Number of players on Carlton's team + 7
Number of players on Zeke's team = 13 + 7
Number of players on Zeke's team = 20

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams combined, we add the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team:

Total number of players = Number of players on Zeke's team + Number of players on Carlton's team
Total number of players = 20 + 13
Total number of players = 33

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 33."
"To determine the total number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the total length of the fence he is building. The fence is a rectangular shape with a length of 15 feet and a width of 10 feet. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Robert needs 2 wooden slats for every foot of fencing. Therefore, the total number of wooden slats required is:

\[ \text{Total slats} = 50 \times 2 = 100 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 100 \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington initially had and how many she gave away:

- Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges.
- She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which totals to \(2 + 2 = 4\) boxes.

So, the number of boxes she kept is:
\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of oranges in the boxes she kept:
- Each box contains 20 oranges.
- Therefore, the total number of oranges in the 8 boxes is:
\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \]

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges, so we need to find out how many oranges she kept:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 160 = 40 \]

The number of oranges she sold is the total number of oranges minus the number she kept:
\[ 160 - 40 = 120 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 120 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the number of states in the USA. According to the latest data, the United States has 50 states.

Given that India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, we can calculate the number of states in India as follows:
- Half the number of states in the USA is \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \).
- India has 4 more than this, so the number of states in India is \( 25 + 4 = 29 \).

Now, to find the total number of states in both countries together, we add the number of states in India and the number of states in the USA:
- Total number of states = Number of states in India + Number of states in the USA
- Total number of states = 29 + 50 = 79

The final numerical answer is 79."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Tyler wants to buy:
- Dictionary: $18
- Dinosaur book: $13
- Children's cookbook: $8

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Tyler has already saved $14. Therefore, the additional amount he needs to earn is:
Additional amount needed = Total cost - Amount saved
Additional amount needed = $39 - $14 = $25

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn the additional $25, we divide the additional amount needed by his hourly wage:
Hours needed = Additional amount needed / Hourly wage
Hours needed = $25 / $5 = 5 hours

The final numerical answer is 5 hours."
"First, let's determine how many cherries Richard has. We know that Robert has 30 cherries and that he has 10 more cherries than Richard. Therefore, Richard has:

\[ \text{Cherries Richard has} = \text{Cherries Robert has} - 10 = 30 - 10 = 20 \]

Next, we know the total number of cherries is 60. We can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting the number of cherries Richard and Robert have from the total:

\[ \text{Cherries Jerry has} = \text{Total cherries} - (\text{Cherries Richard has} + \text{Cherries Robert has}) = 60 - (20 + 30) = 60 - 50 = 10 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Cherries Robert has} - \text{Cherries Jerry has} = 30 - 10 = 20 \]

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"To determine how much Sunny earned over the two days, we need to calculate the number of boxes sold for each type of baked good on both days and then compute the total earnings.

First, let's find out how many boxes of apple pie Sunny sold on each day:
- On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie.
- On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, so he sold \(15 - 4 = 11\) boxes of apple pie.

Next, let's find out how many boxes of gingerbread Sunny sold on each day:
- On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold \(10 + 5 = 15\) boxes of gingerbread.
- On Saturday, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread.

Now, let's calculate the total number of boxes sold for each type of baked good over the two days:
- Total gingerbread sold: \(10 + 15 = 25\) boxes.
- Total apple pie sold: \(11 + 15 = 26\) boxes.

Next, we calculate the total earnings from each type of baked good:
- Earnings from gingerbread: \(25 \text{ boxes} \times \$6/\text{box} = \$150\).
- Earnings from apple pie: \(26 \text{ boxes} \times \$15/\text{box} = \$390\).

Finally, we sum the earnings from both types of baked goods to find the total earnings:
- Total earnings: \(\$150 + \$390 = \$540\).

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine the total amount of sunscreen Pamela will use while on vacation.

She re-applies an ounce of sunscreen every hour she is outside. She will be outside 4 hours a day for 8 days. Therefore, the total number of hours she will be outside is:
\[ 4 \text{ hours/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ hours} \]

Since she uses 1 ounce of sunscreen per hour, the total amount of sunscreen she will use is:
\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \]

Her sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles. To find out how many bottles she needs, we divide the total amount of sunscreen by the amount each bottle contains:
\[ \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces/bottle}} = 4 \text{ bottles} \]

So, the number of bottles of sunscreen Pamela needs to pack is:
\[ 4 \]

"To find the cost of the red car, we first need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car. The price of the blue car is $100.

\[ 40\% \text{ of } \$100 = 0.40 \times 100 = \$40 \]

So, the red car is $40 cheaper than the blue car. Therefore, the price of the red car is:

\[ \$100 - \$40 = \$60 \]

Now, to find the total cost of both cars, we add the price of the red car and the price of the blue car:

\[ \$60 + \$100 = \$160 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's define the current ages of Emil's dad and brother as \( D \) and \( B \) respectively.

Given:
- Emil is currently 19 years old.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.

First, let's determine Emil's age when he turns 24:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \text{ years} \]

At that time, Emil's dad's age will be:
\[ 19 + 5 = 24 \]
According to the problem, at that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad:
\[ 24 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{(Dad's age at 24)} \]
This confirms that the dad's age at 24 is indeed 24.

Next, at the time Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother:
\[ 24 = 2 \times \text{(Brother's age at 24)} \]
So, the brother's age at 24 will be:
\[ \frac{24}{2} = 12 \]

Now, we need to find the current ages of Emil's dad and brother. Since the brother is currently:
\[ 12 - 5 = 7 \text{ years old} \]

And the dad is currently:
\[ 24 - 5 = 19 \text{ years old} \]

The sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother is:
\[ 19 + 7 = 26 \]

Thus, the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is:
\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"First, let's determine how many beads Adrianne received from her sister and her friend.

Adrianne's sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother. Since her mother gave her 20 beads, her sister gave her:

Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother. Since her mother gave her 20 beads, her friend gave her:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ beads} \]

Now, let's add up all the beads Adrianne received:
\[ 20 \text{ (from her mother)} + 30 \text{ (from her sister)} + 40 \text{ (from her friend)} = 90 \text{ beads} \]

So, the total number of beads Adrianne has altogether is:

"First, let's determine the amount of crawfish Joe caught each day:

- On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
- On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.
- On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, which is \(\frac{12}{2} = 6\) pounds.

Next, we'll calculate the total amount of crawfish Joe caught over the three days:

\[ 3 \text{ pounds (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ pounds (Friday)} + 6 \text{ pounds (Saturday)} = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to determine how many servings of crawfish he has. Since each serving is 3 pounds, we divide the total amount of crawfish by the amount per serving:

\[ \frac{21 \text{ pounds}}{3 \text{ pounds per serving}} = 7 \text{ servings} \]

"First, let's find out how many students are football players. Since 20% of the class are football players, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \text{ students} \]

So, 6 students are football players. This means the remaining number of students is:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining 24 students are cheerleaders or part of the band. Since 25% of the remaining students are cheerleaders or part of the band, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 24 = 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \text{ students} \]

So, 6 students are either cheerleaders or part of the band. Adding the football players to these students, we get the total number of students leaving early:

\[ 6 \text{ (football players)} + 6 \text{ (cheerleaders or band members)} = 12 \text{ students} \]

"First, let's convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches to make the calculations easier. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the flower bed is:
\[ 111 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 1332 \text{ inches} \]

Each flower plant is 12 inches wide, and there needs to be 1.5 feet (which is 18 inches) between every plant. Therefore, the total space taken by one plant and the space between it and the next plant is:
\[ 12 \text{ inches} + 18 \text{ inches} = 30 \text{ inches} \]

To find out how many plants can fit in the flower bed, we divide the total length of the flower bed by the space taken by one plant and the space between it and the next plant:
\[ \frac{1332 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/plant}} = 44.4 \]

Since Pat can't plant a fraction of a plant, she can plant 44 plants. Pat already owns 17 plants, so she needs to buy:
\[ 44 - 17 = 27 \text{ plants} \]

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for the new plants is:
\[ 27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

For the sunflowers:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

For the carnations:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of soil they have is 30 pounds. So, the remaining soil for roses is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. Therefore, the number of roses they can plant is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to calculate how much Jessica sets aside each month for fancy shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly paycheck.

\[ \text{Monthly savings for shoes} = 25\% \times \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times \$2,000.00 = \$500.00 \]

Next, we need to determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy with her monthly savings. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes per month} = \frac{\$500.00}{\$1,000.00} = 0.5 \]

Since Jessica can only buy whole pairs of shoes, she can buy 0 pairs of shoes per month.

To find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year, we need to multiply the number of pairs she can buy per month by 12 (the number of months in a year).

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes per year} = 0.5 \times 12 = 6 \]

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

The final numerical answer is 6."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, the time required to peel 90 shrimp is:

\[ \text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to saute 30 shrimp. Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, the time required to saute 90 shrimp (which is three times 30 shrimp) is:

\[ \text{Time to saute 90 shrimp} = 3 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Emily can either peel or saute shrimp simultaneously, the total time required to peel and saute 90 shrimp is the longer of the two times calculated. In this case, it is 30 minutes.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 30 \text{ minutes} \]"
"First, let's calculate the temperature change during each phase of the air conditioner's operation.

1. **Low setting for 3 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 2 degrees per hour.
   - Over 3 hours, it will cool the room by \(2 \times 3 = 6\) degrees.

2. **High setting for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 3 degrees per hour.
   - Over 4 hours, it will cool the room by \(3 \times 4 = 12\) degrees.

3. **Off for 2 hours:**
   - The room will warm up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - Over 2 hours, the room will warm up by \(2 \times 2 = 4\) degrees.

Now, let's sum up the total temperature change:
- Cooling due to low setting: -6 degrees
- Cooling due to high setting: -12 degrees
- Warming up due to no air conditioner: +4 degrees

Total temperature change = \(-6 - 12 + 4 = -14\) degrees.

Therefore, the room is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's father when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Bill's father saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Since his father was 30 years old when he saw the comet, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw it for the second time.

3. **Determine the age difference between the first and second sightings:**
   - The comet orbits the sun every 75 years, so the second sighting was 75 years after the first sighting.
   - Therefore, Bill was 90 years old 75 years after he was \(x\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.
   - This gives us the equation: \(x + 75 = 90\).

4. **Solve for \(x\):**
   - \(x = 90 - 75 = 15\).

So, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to break down the information given and calculate each category of checks.

1. **Electric Bill**: Buford writes a check once per month for the electric bill. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes 12 electric bill checks per year.
2. **Gas Bill**: Buford writes a check once per month for the gas bill. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes 12 gas bill checks per year.
3. **Church**: Buford writes a check twice per month to the church. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes \(2 \times 12 = 24\) church checks per year.
4. **Pest and Lawn Service**: Buford writes a check quarterly (every 3 months) to the pest and lawn service. There are 4 quarters in a year, so he writes 4 pest and lawn service checks per year.

Now, we sum up all the checks:
- Electric bill checks: 12
- Gas bill checks: 12
- Church checks: 24
- Pest and lawn service checks: 4

Total number of checks per year = \(12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52\).

The final numerical answer is 52."
"Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as \( F \). According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4}F \). The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany, so the number of flights to France is \( \frac{1}{4}F \) and the number of flights to Germany is also \( \frac{1}{4}F \).

The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, which is half the number of flights the first plane makes. Therefore, the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day is \( 2 \times 44 = 88 \). So, \( F = 88 \).

Now, we can calculate the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day. Since the number of flights to France is \( \frac{1}{4}F \), we substitute \( F = 88 \) into the equation:

\[
\text{Number of flights to France} = \frac{1}{4} \times 88 = 22
\]

Thus, the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"First, let's determine the duration of each wolf's howl.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so:
\[ \text{Chikote's howl duration} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Igneous howls for as long as Tobias and Chikote combined, so:
\[ \text{Igneous's howl duration} = 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, let's find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls in seconds:
\[ \text{Combined duration} = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 \text{ seconds} \]

To convert the combined duration from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):
\[ \text{Combined duration in minutes} = \frac{120}{60} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the age of Wilfred. Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \(A\), \(B\), \(H\), and \(W\) respectively. We know the following:

1. \(A = 3\)
2. \(B = 4\)
3. The total age of the children is 20, so \(A + B + H + W = 20\).
4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is \(\frac{20}{4} = 5\). Therefore, \(H = 2 \times 5 = 10\).

Now we can substitute the known values into the total age equation:
\[3 + 4 + 10 + W = 20\]
\[17 + W = 20\]
\[W = 20 - 17\]
\[W = 3\]

So, the age of Wilfred is \(3\).

Next, we need to determine how much Walter's lawyer will donate. The lawyer will donate three times as much as everyone else donates. To find out how much everyone else donates, we need to add the $200 that Walter's friend is going to donate:

Total donations from others: $200

Now, we calculate the lawyer's contribution:

Lawyer's contribution = 3 * Total donations from others
Lawyer's contribution = 3 * $200 = $600

So, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $600.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{600}

"First, we need to calculate the total number of cookies. Since there were 100 guests and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies/guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies} \]

The bride decided to give half of the cookies to the church next door. Therefore, the number of cookies given to the church next door is:

\[ \frac{1500 \text{ cookies}}{2} = 750 \text{ cookies} \]

Each person in the church next door got 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church next door, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people} \]

So, the number of people in the church next door is:

\[ 50 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 50 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the distribution of the watermelon slices among the family members. Let's denote the total volume of the watermelon as \( V \).

Given that there are 2 adults and 4 kids, and each adult's slice is twice as big as each kid's slice, we can represent the volume of each kid's slice as \( x \). Consequently, the volume of each adult's slice would be \( 2x \).

The total volume of the watermelon is the sum of the volumes of all the slices:
\[ V = 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

Now, we need to find out what percentage of the watermelon each adult gets. Each adult's slice is \( 2x \), and the total volume of the watermelon is \( 8x \). The percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Percentage for each adult} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 25 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on checking on the inpatients. He spends 20 minutes per inpatient and there are 9 inpatients, so:

\[ 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes/inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time he spends on appointments. He has 10 appointments, each taking 30 minutes, so:

\[ 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes/appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's add the time spent on inpatients and appointments to find the total time spent on these activities:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 480 \text{ minutes} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time spent from minutes to hours:

\[ 480 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic in total. Therefore, the time left for him to update his records is:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1 \]"
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to complete all the steps and then subtract this total from the desired serving time of 5:00 pm.

1. Time to make the cake batter: 20 minutes
2. Time to bake the cake: 30 minutes
3. Time to cool the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
4. Time to frost the cake: 10 minutes

Now, let's add up all these times:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Convert 180 minutes into hours and minutes:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Jordan needs 3 hours to complete the cake from start to finish. If she wants the cake to be ready by 5:00 pm, we subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm:
\[ 5:00 \text{ pm} - 3 \text{ hours} = 2:00 \text{ pm} \]

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

The final numerical answer is:
2:00 pm"

"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider the fixed cost of renting the studio and the variable cost per student per session, as well as the number of sessions per week and the number of weeks in a month.

First, let's calculate the total cost per session:
- Fixed cost per session: $25
- Variable cost per student per session: $1.50
- Number of students: 10
- Total variable cost per session: $1.50 * 10 = $15
- Total cost per session: $25 + $15 = $40

Next, let's calculate the total earnings per session:
- Number of days the studio is rented per week: 3
- Number of weeks in a month: Assume 4 weeks for simplicity
- Total sessions per week: 3
- Total sessions per month: 3 * 4 = 12
- Total earnings per session: $40

Finally, let's calculate the total earnings for the month:
- Total earnings per month: $40 * 12 = $480

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"To find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we first need to determine the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes.

For Peter:
- He has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars.
- Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes is \( \frac{64}{4} = 16 \).

For Martha:
- She has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars.
- Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes is \( \frac{56}{7} = 8 \).

Now, to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we subtract the number of chocolate bars in Martha's box from the number in Peter's box:
- The difference is \( 16 - 8 = 8 \).

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha. The final numerical answer is 8."
"First, let's determine the number of female porcupines in the park. Given that the population of porcupines is 50 and the number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population, we can calculate the number of female porcupines as follows:

\[ \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the number of babies born each month is:

\[ \text{Number of babies born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120 \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[ \text{Total number of babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440 \]

The initial population of porcupines is 50. After a year, the total number of porcupines in the park will be the initial population plus the total number of babies born in a year:

\[ \text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1490 \]"
"To determine the cost to fill the swimming pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet.
2. Multiply the volume by 5.9 to convert it to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost to fill the pool at $0.10 per gallon.

First, let's calculate the volume of the pool. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

Substitute these values into the formula:
\[ V = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

Calculate the volume:
\[ V = 25 \times 14 = 350 \]
\[ V = 350 \times 4 = 1400 \]

So, the volume of the pool is 1400 cubic feet.

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. We know that 1 cubic foot is approximately 7.48 gallons. Therefore, we multiply the volume in cubic feet by 7.48 to get the volume in gallons:
\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = 1400 \times 7.48 \]

Calculate the volume in gallons:
\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = 1400 \times 7.48 = 10472 \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:
\[ \text{Cost} = 10472 \times 0.10 \]

Calculate the cost:
\[ \text{Cost} = 1047.20 \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is $1047.20."
"First, let's determine the number of blue sticks. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, and there are 9 red sticks, we can calculate the number of blue sticks as follows:

\[ \text{Number of blue sticks} = \text{Number of red sticks} + 5 = 9 + 5 = 14 \]

Next, we need to find the number of yellow sticks. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. Therefore:

\[ \text{Number of yellow sticks} = \text{Number of blue sticks} - 3 = 14 - 3 = 11 \]

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together:

\[ \text{Total number of sticks} = \text{Number of red sticks} + \text{Number of blue sticks} + \text{Number of yellow sticks} = 9 + 14 + 11 = 34 \]

So, the total number of sticks they have is:

\[ 34 \]"
"First, we calculate the distance Matteo traveled. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Matteo:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 55 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance Shandy traveled:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} = 45 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the distance Matteo traveled from the distance Shandy traveled:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 230 \]"
"To find the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. **Total number of students**: 3000

2. **Students over 16 years old**: Half of the total students.
   \[
   \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
   \]

3. **Students under 16 years old**: The other half of the total students.
   \[
   \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
   \]

4. **Male students over 16 years old**: One-fourth of the students over 16 years old.
   \[
   \frac{1500}{4} = 375
   \]

5. **Female students over 16 years old**: The remaining three-fourths of the students over 16 years old.
   \[
   1500 - 375 = 1125
   \]

6. **Male students under 16 years old**: One-half of the students under 16 years old.
   \[
   \frac{1500}{2} = 750
   \]

7. **Female students under 16 years old**: The remaining half of the students under 16 years old.
   \[
   1500 - 750 = 750
   \]

8. **Total female students**: Sum of female students over 16 years old and female students under 16 years old.
   \[
   1125 + 750 = 1875
   \]

Therefore, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is 1875."
"First, let's determine how many laps each person can run:

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) laps.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps.

Now, to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run:

\[10 - 5 = 5\]

So, Bethany can run 5 more laps than Quinn. The final numerical answer is:

5"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days and then subtract this from the tank's total capacity.

First, let's determine the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day:

- Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity on the first day.
- The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, so Wanda pumped \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons on the first day.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda, so she pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons on the first day.

Next, let's determine the amount of water pumped on the second day:

- Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day, so she pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons on the second day.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day, so she pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons on the second day.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank over the two days:

- Total water pumped by Wanda: \( 4500 + 3000 = 7500 \) gallons.
- Total water pumped by Ms. B: \( 3375 + 1125 = 4500 \) gallons.
- Total water pumped into the tank: \( 7500 + 4500 = 12000 \) gallons.

Finally, we subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity to find out how much water is remaining:

- Remaining water: \( 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \) gallons.

The number of gallons of water remaining for the tank to be full is \(\boxed{6000}\)."
"Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as \( C \).

First, we know that for the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour. This means that after each hour, the power bank retains 91% of its charge from the previous hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining can be calculated as:
\[ C \times (0.91)^5 \]

Next, for the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour, meaning it retains 93% of its charge from the previous hour. So, after these 3 hours, the charge remaining can be calculated as:
\[ C \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 \]

We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ C \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \times C \]

We can cancel \( C \) from both sides of the equation (assuming \( C \neq 0 \)):
\[ (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \]

Now, we need to calculate the left side of the equation:
\[ (0.91)^5 \approx 0.658 \]
\[ (0.93)^3 \approx 0.817 \]
\[ 0.658 \times 0.817 \approx 0.536 \]

So, we have:
\[ 0.536 = 0.28 \]

This indicates that the initial charge \( C \) must be scaled to fit the given final charge. Since \( 0.536C = 0.28 \), we can solve for \( C \):
\[ C = \frac{0.28}{0.536} \approx 0.522 \]

Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately \( 0.522 \) or 52.2%."
"First, let's calculate Janet's total weekly earnings. She earns $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, so her total weekly earnings are:

\[ 10 + 15 = 25 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are:

\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ dollars per week} \]

Next, we need to determine how much she needs to save to buy the car. The down payment for the car is $10,000. She wants to save 20% of this amount:

\[ 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to save $2000 at a rate of $1000 per week. We do this by dividing the total amount she needs to save by her weekly savings:

\[ \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

So, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment for the car.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased:

- Peaches: 3 peaches * $0.50/peach = $1.50
- Pears: 4 pears * $0.50/pear = $2.00
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00/kiwi = $2.00
- Apples: 5 apples * $0.75/apple = $3.75

Now, let's sum these amounts to find the total cost of the fruits he has already bought:

Total cost of purchased fruits = $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar has $10 to spend, so the amount left for plums is:

Amount left for plums = $10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums he can buy is:

Number of plums = $0.75 / $0.25/plum = 3 plums

So, the final numerical answer is 3."
"First, we need to determine the total number of pieces of sweets Anne purchased. Since she bought a box containing 15 packs and each pack has 60 pieces, we calculate the total number of pieces as follows:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs Anne gave to her friends. Since she kept 2 packs, the number of packs she gave away is:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} - 2 \text{ packs} = 13 \text{ packs} \]

These 13 packs are given to her 10 friends equally. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide the number of packs given away by the number of friends:

\[ \frac{13 \text{ packs}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 1.3 \text{ packs per friend} \]

Since each pack contains 60 pieces, we calculate the number of pieces each friend received by multiplying the number of packs each friend received by the number of pieces per pack:

\[ 1.3 \text{ packs per friend} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 78 \text{ pieces per friend} \]

Therefore, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 78 \]"
"To calculate the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating compounded price increases:

\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (1 + \text{Rate})^{\text{Number of Years}} \]

Given:
- Initial Price = $120
- Rate = 5% = 0.05
- Number of Years = 3

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 139 \]

So, the price of carrots after three years would be $139."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many selfies and portraits Olivia uploaded to her albums. We know that she uploaded a total of 72 pictures into 8 albums, with 3 albums dedicated to selfies and 2 albums dedicated to portraits. This means the remaining albums are for other types of pictures.

First, let's calculate the number of albums that are not selfies or portraits:
\[ 8 \text{ total albums} - 3 \text{ selfies albums} - 2 \text{ portraits albums} = 3 \text{ other albums} \]

Since the problem does not specify the number of pictures in the other albums, we can assume that the remaining pictures are distributed equally among the selfies and portraits albums. Therefore, we need to find out how many pictures are in each of the selfies and portraits albums.

The total number of pictures is 72, and these pictures are distributed among 5 albums (3 selfies + 2 portraits). So, the number of pictures per album is:
\[ \frac{72 \text{ pictures}}{5 \text{ albums}} = 14.4 \text{ pictures per album} \]

Since we are dealing with whole pictures, we can infer that the distribution is as follows:
- Each of the 3 selfies albums has 14 pictures (since 3 albums * 14 pictures/album = 42 pictures).
- Each of the 2 portraits albums has 14 pictures (since 2 albums * 14 pictures/album = 28 pictures).

Therefore, the total number of selfies is:
\[ 3 \text{ selfies albums} \times 14 \text{ pictures/album} = 42 \text{ selfies} \]

And the total number of portraits is:
\[ 2 \text{ portraits albums} \times 14 \text{ pictures/album} = 28 \text{ portraits} \]

So, the total number of selfies and portraits is:
\[ 42 \text{ selfies} + 28 \text{ portraits} = 70 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"To determine how long James spends reading, we first need to find out how many minutes it takes him to read one page. Since it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can calculate the time it takes to read one page by dividing 10 minutes by 3 pages:

\[ \text{Time per page} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} \approx 3.33 \text{ minutes per page} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages. We do this by multiplying the time it takes to read one page by 18:

\[ \text{Time to read 18 pages} = 18 \text{ pages} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, James spends 60 minutes reading. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the current number of guests in the hotel, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate accordingly.

1. Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.
2. 24 guests checked out early, reducing the number of guests by 24.
3. 15 guests checked out late, reducing the number of guests by 15.
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, twice this number is \(2 \times 15 = 30\). This means 30 new guests checked in.
5. After dinner, 7 more guests checked in.

Now, let's calculate the number of guests step by step:

- Initial guests: 100
- Guests after early checkouts: \(100 - 24 = 76\)
- Guests after late checkouts: \(76 - 15 = 61\)
- Guests after new check-ins in the afternoon: \(61 + 30 = 91\)
- Guests after dinner: \(91 + 7 = 98\)

Therefore, the hotel now has 98 guests.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of easy, average, and difficult questions in the quiz.

- Total number of questions: 60
- Easy questions: 40% of 60 = 0.40 * 60 = 24 questions
- Average and difficult questions combined: 60 - 24 = 36 questions
- Since the average and difficult questions are equally divided, there are 36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct. Therefore, the number of easy questions she is sure to get correct is:
\[ 75\% \text{ of } 24 = 0.75 \times 24 = 18 \]

Aries is sure to get half of the average and difficult questions correct. Therefore, the number of average and difficult questions she is sure to get correct is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \text{ of } 18 = 9 \]

Adding the number of questions she is sure to get correct from the easy, average, and difficult questions:
\[ 18 \text{ (easy)} + 9 \text{ (average)} + 9 \text{ (difficult)} = 36 \]

So, the total number of points Aries is sure to get is:

"First, let's determine the price of a large stuffed animal. Since each small stuffed animal costs $4 and large stuffed animals cost three times as much, the price of a large stuffed animal is:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( L \). According to the problem, the number of small stuffed animals sold is twice the number of large stuffed animals sold, so the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2L \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as the sum of the earnings from the large stuffed animals and the small stuffed animals. The earnings from the large stuffed animals are \( 12L \) dollars, and the earnings from the small stuffed animals are \( 4 \times 2L = 8L \) dollars. The total earnings are given as $120, so we can set up the following equation:
\[ 12L + 8L = 120 \]
\[ 20L = 120 \]
\[ L = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ L = 6 \]

Since the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2L \), we have:
\[ 2L = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is:

"To determine the total number of sandwiches eaten by the family in one week, we first need to calculate the daily total and then multiply by the number of days in a week.

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, the wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and the son eats 2 sandwiches per day. Therefore, the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by the family is:
\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \text{ sandwiches per day} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of sandwiches eaten in one week is:
\[ 11 \times 7 = 77 \text{ sandwiches} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 77 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total earnings from the cookies. Suzanne sold 80 cookies at $1 each, so her earnings from the cookies are:
\[ 80 \times 1 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total earnings from the cupcakes. Suzanne sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each, so her earnings from the cupcakes are:
\[ 60 \times 4 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's find the total earnings from both the cookies and the cupcakes:
\[ 80 + 240 = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each for helping her, so the total amount she gave away is:
\[ 10 + 10 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we subtract the amount she gave away from her total earnings:
\[ 320 - 20 = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 300 \]"
"The Smith twins found a total of 30 + 30 = 60 eggs. Since all the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends, the number of eggs found by their friends is 100 - 60 - 10 = 30 eggs. 

The final numerical answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the ore mining rate with a steel pickaxe:**
   - A dwarf with an iron pickaxe mines 12 pounds of ore per day.
   - A dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 50% more than a dwarf with an iron pickaxe.
   - 50% of 12 pounds is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6\) pounds.
   - Therefore, a dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines \(12 + 6 = 18\) pounds of ore per day.

2. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in one day:**
   - Each dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 18 pounds of ore per day.
   - 40 dwarves would mine \(18 \times 40 = 720\) pounds of ore per day.

3. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month:**
   - There are 30 days in the month.
   - Therefore, 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes would mine \(720 \times 30 = 21600\) pounds of ore in a month.

The final numerical answer is:
21600"
"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to use the information that the prices are proportional. This means that the cost per sandwich is the same for all package sizes.

First, let's calculate the cost per sandwich for the first package:
- The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3.
- The cost per sandwich is \(\frac{3}{2} = 1.5\) dollars per sandwich.

Next, let's calculate the cost per sandwich for the second package:
- The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6.
- The cost per sandwich is \(\frac{6}{4} = 1.5\) dollars per sandwich.

Since the cost per sandwich is the same for all packages, we can use this to find the cost of the third package, which has 8 sandwiches. The cost per sandwich is $1.5, so for 8 sandwiches, the cost would be:
\[ 8 \times 1.5 = 12 \]

Therefore, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost \(\boxed{12}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine how much of the bedroom set Tom has effectively paid for. He bought the bedroom set for $3000 and sold his old bedroom for $1000, which he used to pay part of the new set. So, the amount he still needs to pay is:

\[ 3000 - 1000 = 2000 \]

Next, Tom has to pay 10% of this remaining amount each month. To find out how much he has to pay per month, we calculate 10% of $2000:

\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 200 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst due to the gust of wind. Sally initially had 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst.

\[ \text{Red balloons that burst} = 25 \times \frac{40}{100} = 25 \times 0.4 = 10 \]

So, the number of red balloons remaining is:

\[ \text{Remaining red balloons} = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Next, Sally accidentally released half of the yellow balloons. She initially had 12 yellow balloons.

\[ \text{Yellow balloons released} = 12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons remaining is:

\[ \text{Remaining yellow balloons} = 12 - 6 = 6 \]

Sally found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining balloons.

\[ \text{Blue balloons added} = 8 \times \frac{75}{100} = 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \]

So, the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school is the sum of the remaining red, yellow, and the added blue balloons.

\[ \text{Total balloons} = \text{Remaining red balloons} + \text{Remaining yellow balloons} + \text{Blue balloons added} \]
\[ \text{Total balloons} = 15 + 6 + 6 = 27 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider all the scenarios and their probabilities.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of the substitute teacher collecting the homework: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of having to turn in homework in this scenario: 50% or 0.50

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having the normal teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of getting an extension from the normal teacher: 40% or 0.40
   - Probability of not getting an extension from the normal teacher: 60% or 0.60
   - Probability of Marcus convincing the teacher his dog ate the assignment: 20% or 0.20
   - Probability of not convincing the teacher: 80% or 0.80

Now, let's calculate the overall probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework:

- **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
  - Probability of having to turn in homework: 50% or 0.50

- **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
  - Probability of not getting an extension: 60% or 0.60
  - Probability of having to turn in homework: 100% - 20% = 80% or 0.80

Now, we combine these probabilities:

- Probability of having to turn in homework in the substitute teacher scenario: 50% or 0.50
- Probability of having to turn in homework in the normal teacher scenario: 80% or 0.80

Total probability of having to turn in homework:
\[ 0.50 + 0.80 = 1.30 \]

However, this total probability exceeds 100%, which indicates that the scenarios are not mutually exclusive. We need to consider the overlap, but since the problem does not specify any overlap, we can simply add the probabilities directly as they are given.

Thus, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:
\[ 130\% \]

However, since a probability cannot exceed 100%, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct approach is to consider the scenarios as independent events and sum their probabilities directly.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{130\%} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of seats that are not occupied by graduates and faculty. The total capacity of the Fine Arts Center is 6000 seats. After accounting for the 950 seats for graduates and the 300 seats for faculty, the number of seats available for distribution to graduates' friends and family is calculated as follows:

\[ 6000 - 950 - 300 = 5750 \]

Next, we need to find out how many tickets each graduate will receive if the 5750 seats are split equally among the 950 graduates. We do this by dividing the number of available seats by the number of graduates:

\[ \frac{5750}{950} = 6.052631578947368 \]

Since the number of tickets must be a whole number, we round 6.052631578947368 to the nearest whole number, which is 6. Therefore, each graduate would receive 6 tickets to give to their friends and family.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we first need to calculate the number of soda bottles he will place along the driveway.

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and he wants to place a bottle every 3 feet. Therefore, the number of bottles is calculated as follows:
\[
\frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet per bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles}
\]

Richard will need to go from one bottle to the next to drop the candy in. Since he starts at the first bottle and goes to the next 7 times, he will need to make 7 trips.

Each trip takes 5 seconds. Therefore, the total time for all the trips is:
\[
7 \text{ trips} \times 5 \text{ seconds per trip} = 35 \text{ seconds}

"First, let's calculate the total amount Jim borrowed during his college years. Since it took him 4 years to finish college and he got $50,000 in loans per year, the total amount of loans he took out is:

\[ 4 \text{ years} \times \$50,000 \text{ per year} = \$200,000 \]

Next, let's determine his income after graduating from college. His income tripled, so his new income is:

\[ \$50,000 \times 3 = \$150,000 \]

Now, let's calculate the income he would have earned if he had not gone to college. His original income was $25,000 per year, so the income he missed out on over the 4 years is:

\[ 4 \text{ years} \times \$25,000 \text{ per year} = \$100,000 \]

The total amount of money Jim would need to earn to cover both the loans and the income he missed out on is:

\[ \$200,000 \text{ (loans)} + \$100,000 \text{ (missed income)} = \$300,000 \]

Now, we need to determine how long it would take him to earn $300,000 at his new income of $150,000 per year. We can calculate this by dividing the total amount by his new annual income:

\[ \frac{\$300,000}{\$150,000 \text{ per year}} = 2 \text{ years} \]

So, it would take Jim 2 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total square feet of fabric Jim needs to buy, we first need to calculate the dimensions of each piece of fabric he requires. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each piece of fabric is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

First, calculate the dimensions of one piece of fabric:
- Length: \( 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \)
- Width: \( 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \)

Next, calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
\[ \text{Area of one piece} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[ \text{Total area} = 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Thus, the total square feet of fabric Jim needs to buy is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered on Tuesday and Wednesday based on the information given for Monday, and then sum the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday.

First, let's find out how many letters were delivered on Tuesday. According to the problem, Tuesday's delivery was 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery. Monday's delivery was 425 letters.

One-fifth of Monday's delivery is:
\[ \frac{425}{5} = 85 \]

So, Tuesday's delivery was:
\[ 85 + 17 = 102 \]

Next, we need to find out how many letters were delivered on Wednesday. The problem states that Wednesday's delivery was 5 more than twice Tuesday's delivery.

Twice Tuesday's delivery is:
\[ 2 \times 102 = 204 \]

So, Wednesday's delivery was:
\[ 204 + 5 = 209 \]

Now, we sum the number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:
\[ 425 \text{ (Monday)} + 102 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 209 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 736 \]

Therefore, the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is:

"To find out how much Johnny's dad lost on average that day, we need to calculate the total amount lost and then divide it by the number of races.

1. **First Race:**
   - Johnny's dad lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost.
   - Amount lost in the first race = $5.
   - Twice the amount lost = 2 * $5 = $10.
   - Amount won in the second race = $10 + $1 = $11.
   - Since he won, this is a positive amount, but for the purpose of calculating loss, we consider the negative of this amount.
   - Amount lost in the second race = -$11.

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Amount won in the second race = $11.
   - 1.5 times the amount won = 1.5 * $11 = $16.5.
   - Amount lost in the third race = -$16.5.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost:
- Total amount lost = Amount lost in the first race + Amount lost in the second race + Amount lost in the third race.
- Total amount lost = $5 + (-$11) + (-$16.5) = $5 - $11 - $16.5 = -$22.5.

To find the average amount lost per race, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races:
- Number of races = 3.
- Average amount lost per race = Total amount lost / Number of races = -$22.5 / 3 = -$7.5.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to convert all measurements to the same unit for easier comparison. Let's use inches.

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, Xavier's height in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Xavier grew 3 inches, so his current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole's initial height was 50 inches. Cole grew 2 inches, so his current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:

"Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( 420 \).

"To determine the number of hours each painter worked, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of days the painters worked:**
   - There are 3 weeks of work.
   - Each week has 7 days.
   - Therefore, the total number of days is \(3 \times 7 = 21\) days.

2. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by the team:**
   - Each day, the team worked \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day.
   - Therefore, the total number of hours worked by the team is \( 21 \times \frac{3}{8} \).

3. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by the team:**

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, Rory retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x + 4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now that we know \( x = 6 \), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

So, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation year by year from 2007 to 2010.

The formula for depreciation is:
\[ \text{Final Value} = \text{Initial Value} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^{\text{Number of Years}} \]

Given:
- Initial Value = $20000
- Depreciation Rate = 21% = 0.21
- Number of Years from 2007 to 2010 = 3

Now, we can plug these values into the formula:
\[ \text{Final Value} = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Value} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Value} = 20000 \times 0.493039 \]
\[ \text{Final Value} = 9860.78 \]

Therefore, the price of the car in the year 2010 is approximately $9860.78."
"First, let's determine the number of English books. Since half of the 50 books are written in English, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of English books} = \frac{50}{2} = 25

"First, let's determine the cost of each item Alison bought:

1. Tank top: $10
2. Running shorts: $5 more than the tank top, so $10 + $5 = $15
3. Tennis shoes: Originally $48, but on sale for half price, so $48 / 2 = $24
4. Athletic socks: $8 original price, with a $2 coupon, so $8 - $2 = $6

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:

Total cost = Cost of tank top + Cost of running shorts + Cost of tennis shoes + Cost of athletic socks

"To determine the cost of renovating the kitchen floor with square tiles, we first need to calculate how many tiles are required to cover the 200 square feet area.

Each tile is a square with a side length of 1 foot, so the area of each tile is:
\[ \text{Area of one tile} = 1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt} \]

Since the total area of the kitchen floor is 200 square feet, the number of tiles needed is:
\[ \text{Number of tiles} = \frac{\text{Total area of the kitchen floor}}{\text{Area of one tile}} = \frac{200 \text{ SqFt}}{1 \text{ SqFt/tile}} = 200 \text{ tiles} \]

Each tile costs $12, so the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Number of tiles} \times \text{Cost per tile} = 200 \text{ tiles} \times 12 \text{ dollars/tile} = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor is:
\[ \boxed{2400} \]"
"To determine how much James pays for insurance a year after his accident, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the increased monthly cost due to the accident.
2. Multiply the increased monthly cost by 12 to find the annual cost.

First, let's calculate the increased monthly cost:
- The normal cost is $120 a month.
- The increase is 60% of $120.

To find 60% of $120:
\[ 0.60 \times 120 = 72 \]

So, the increased monthly cost is:
\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Now, to find the annual cost:
\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, James pays $2304 a year for insurance.

\[
\boxed{2304}

"To determine how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of loads for twin beds:**
   - Greg has 4 twin beds.
   - Each load can wash 2 twin sets of sheets.
   - Therefore, the number of loads needed for the twin beds is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) loads.

2. **Determine the number of loads for the king size bed:**
   - Greg has 1 king size bed.
   - Each load can wash 1 king set of sheets.
   - Therefore, the number of loads needed for the king size bed is \( \frac{1}{1} = 1 \) load.

3. **Calculate the total number of loads per week:**
   - Total loads per week = Loads for twin beds + Loads for king size bed
   - Total loads per week = 2 + 1 = 3 loads.

4. **Calculate the total number of loads per year:**
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.
   - Total loads per year = Loads per week * Weeks per year
   - Total loads per year = 3 * 52 = 156 loads.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 156."
"To determine the total number of movies Jill and her friends can watch in 4 weeks, we need to first calculate the number of movies they watch in one weekend and then extend that to four weekends.

1. **Movies watched on Saturday:**
   - They watch 4 movies on Saturday.

2. **Movies watched on Sunday:**
   - They watch half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday.
   - Therefore, the number of movies watched on Sunday is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \).

3. **Total movies watched in one weekend:**
   - Total movies watched in one weekend = Movies on Saturday + Movies on Sunday
   - Total movies watched in one weekend = 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

4. **Total movies watched in 4 weeks:**
   - Since they watch movies every weekend, they watch 4 weekends in 4 weeks.
   - Total movies watched in 4 weeks = Total movies watched in one weekend \(\times\) Number of weekends
   - Total movies watched in 4 weeks = 6 \(\times\) 4 = 24 movies.

Thus, the total number of movies they can watch in 4 weeks is 24."
"To determine the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection, we need to calculate the number of stickers he collected each year and add them to the number he had two years ago.

1. Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.
2. Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers.
3. This year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year (last year). Since he collected 50 stickers last year, this year he collected \(2 \times 50 = 100\) stickers.

Now, we sum up the stickers from each year:
- Two years ago: 100 stickers
- Last year: 50 stickers
- This year: 100 stickers

Total number of stickers Leo has now:

"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we first need to calculate the total amount of cat food Imma's cats consume per day.

Imma has 3 cats, and she feeds them 60 grams of cat food each time, twice a day. Therefore, the total amount of cat food consumed per day is:

\[ 3 \text{ cats} \times 60 \text{ grams/cat} \times 2 \text{ feedings/day} = 360 \text{ grams/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:

\[ \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams/day}} = 2 \text{ days} \]

So, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days."
"First, let's determine how many slices Jake ate. We know that Becky ate 10 slices and that she ate 3 more slices than Jake. Therefore, Jake ate:

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we know that Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake. Therefore, Silvia ate:

\[ 2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by adding the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:

\[ 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 \text{ slices} \]

So, the total number of slices they ate is:

\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time for the meal is the sum of the times for both parts, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Next, we isolate \( D \) by subtracting 18 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Then, we solve for \( D \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's part as follows:

\[ Betsy's \ part = D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 58 \]"
"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to consider the following charges:

1. The cost of the cast: $200
2. The cost of the visit: $300/hour for a 30-minute visit. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the cost is $300 * 0.5 = $150
3. The cost of the painkillers: $4/pill for 30 pills. So, the cost is $4 * 30 = $120
4. The cost of parking: $6/hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours. So, the cost is $6 * 2 = $12

Now, we sum up all these costs:
$200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"First, we need to determine how many emails James receives that require a response each day. Since 20% of the emails do not require a response, 80% of the emails do require a response.

The number of emails that require a response each day is:
\[ 80 \text{ emails/day} \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ emails/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week. We multiply the number of emails he responds to each day by 5:
\[ 64 \text{ emails/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 320 \text{ emails} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 320 \]"
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to calculate the number of classes for each day and then sum them up.

- On Monday, 32 classes visited.
- On Tuesday, twice as many visited as on Monday, so \(2 \times 32 = 64\) classes.
- On Wednesday, three times as many visited as on Monday, so \(3 \times 32 = 96\) classes.
- On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
- On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, we sum the number of classes for each day:

\[
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25

"To find John's average score across the 4 tests, we need to add up all his scores and then divide by the number of tests.

John's scores are: 100, 100, 100, and 80.

First, we sum up all the scores:
\[ 100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380 \]

Next, we divide the total sum by the number of tests, which is 4:
\[ \frac{380}{4} = 95 \]

So, John's average score across the 4 tests is 95."
"First, let's calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club. They ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them.

\[ \text{Pizzas eaten by glee club} = 20 \times \frac{70}{100} = 20 \times 0.7 = 14 \]

So, the number of pizzas left for the glee club is:

\[ \text{Pizzas left for glee club} = 20 - 14 = 6 \]

Next, let's calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the football team. They ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

The football team ate 80% of these pizzas.

\[ \text{Pizzas eaten by football team} = 40 \times \frac{80}{100} = 40 \times 0.8 = 32 \]

So, the number of pizzas left for the football team is:

\[ \text{Pizzas left for football team} = 40 - 32 = 8 \]

Now, let's find the total number of pizzas left by adding the pizzas left for both the glee club and the football team:

\[ \text{Total pizzas left} = 6 + 8 = 14 \]

"First, let's determine the number of big coupons Anthony wants to send out. Since he wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, and he plans to send out 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is:

\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, and he is sending out 700 small coupons:

\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, and he is sending out 1400 big coupons:

\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of mailing all the coupons, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the cost of mailing the big coupons:

\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:

\[ 24500 \text{ cents} = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:

\[ \boxed{245} \]"
"First, let's determine how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney ordered. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which means she ordered \(10 - 3 = 7\) meatball sub sandwiches.

Next, we need to find out how many meatball sub sandwiches Mark ate. Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, so Sidney was left with \(7 - 4 = 3\) meatball sub sandwiches.

Then, Sidney ordered another three meatball sub sandwiches, so the total number of meatball sub sandwiches she had after the new order is \(3 + 3 = 6\).

Since each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is \(6 \times 4 = 24\).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Number of Trucks**: Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks dispatched for delivery.

2. **Fertiliser per Truck**: Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser.

3. **Mechanical Failures**: A quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures. Therefore, the number of trucks that failed is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks}
   \]

4. **Remaining Trucks**: The number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:
   \[
   20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks}
   \]

5. **Total Fertiliser Delivered**: Each of the 15 trucks delivered 20 tons of fertiliser. Therefore, the total amount of fertiliser delivered is:
   \[
   15 \times 20 = 300 \text{ tons}
   \]

Thus, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is:
\[

"To determine the cost Dennis will incur to purchase 6 pounds of butter under the given promotion, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total amount of butter needed:**
   Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
   \[
   \text{Total butter needed} = 6 \text{ dozen} \times 1 \text{ pound/dozen} = 6 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Understand the promotion:**
   The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter get one half off."" This means for every 2 pounds of butter purchased, Dennis only pays for 1 pound.

3. **Calculate the number of sets of 2 pounds needed:**
   Since Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter, we divide by 2 to find the number of sets:
   \[
   \text{Number of sets} = \frac{6 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds/set}} = 3 \text{ sets}
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost for each set:**
   The cost of butter is $4.00 per pound. For each set of 2 pounds, Dennis pays for 1 pound:
   \[
   \text{Cost per set} = 1 \text{ pound} \times \$4.00/\text{pound} = \$4.00
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost for 3 sets:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 3 \text{ sets} \times \$4.00/\text{set} = \$12.00

Next, we need to account for the 4 people who could not come:

- Total guests who will attend: 45 - 4 = 41

Now, we need to calculate the cost based on the given pricing structure:

- The base fee for renting the theater for 20 guests is $125.
- The additional fee is $6 for each guest beyond the initial 20.

The number of additional guests beyond the initial 20 is:

- Additional guests: 41 - 20 = 21

The cost for the additional guests is:

- Additional cost: 21 * $6 = $126

Finally, we add the base fee to the additional cost to get the total cost:

- Total cost: $125 + $126 = $251

The final numerical answer is $251."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Maggie spent a quarter of her money. Since she had $60 initially, the amount she spent is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15
   \]
   Therefore, the amount of money Maggie has left is:
   \[
   60 - 15 = 45
   \]

2. Riza spent one-third of her money. Since she had $60 initially, the amount she spent is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
   \]
   Therefore, the amount of money Riza has left is:
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40

"First, let's determine the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats:
\[ 10 + 4 = 14 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Together, the first and second monkeys eat:
\[ 10 + 14 = 24 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. Therefore, the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day is:
\[ \frac{315}{7} = 45 \text{ bananas each day} \]

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we subtract the number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day:
\[ 45 - 24 = 21 \text{ bananas each day} \]

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

Therefore, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is 250 + 500 = 750 pieces."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the roses Jenny bought. Since roses cost $2 each, the cost for 15 roses is:
\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2/\text{rose} = \$30 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jenny has initially. She arrived with five 5 dollar bills, so she has:
\[ 5 \times \$5 = \$25 \]

Since the total cost of the roses is $30 and Jenny only has $25, she needs an additional $5 to pay for the roses. However, the question asks how many quarters she leaves with, which implies we need to find out how many quarters she receives in change.

The change she receives is:
\[ \$30 - \$25 = \$5 \]

Since quarters are worth $0.25 each, the number of quarters she receives is:
\[ \frac{\$5}{\$0.25/\text{quarter}} = 20 \text{ quarters} \]

Therefore, the number of quarters Jenny leaves with is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"

"First, let's calculate how many toothpicks Melanie has already saved. She saves 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks:

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie needs a total of 200 toothpicks. She has already saved 120 toothpicks, so she still needs:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks, we divide the number of toothpicks she still needs by the number of toothpicks she saves each week:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 8 \]"
"First, let's determine the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. The original price of the watch is $2000, and he bought it at 75% of its original price.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers bought the watch for} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price. The original price was $2000, and the friend bought it for $1800.

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

"First, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually.

Jenny buys 10 bunches of bananas, and each bunch has an average of 4 bananas. Therefore, the total number of bananas she buys is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Since each banana costs $0.80, the total cost if she bought the bananas individually would be:
\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches.

Jenny buys 10 bunches, and each bunch costs $3.00. Therefore, the total cost if she bought the bananas in bunches is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

Now, to find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we subtract the total cost of buying in bunches from the total cost of buying individually:
\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

So, Jenny saved:
\[ \$2.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) and the amount of fence Harry gets as \( H \). According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so we can write:

\[ H = S + 60 \]

Since the total amount of fence is 100 feet, we also have:

\[ S + H = 100 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Subtract 60 from both sides:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply by their respective prices.

First, let's find out how many of each type of bike were sold:
- Total bikes sold = 300
- Trekking bikes sold = 50% of 300 = 0.5 * 300 = 150
- BMX bikes sold = 15% of 300 = 0.15 * 300 = 45
- MTB bikes sold = Total bikes sold - Trekking bikes sold - BMX bikes sold = 300 - 150 - 45 = 65

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike:
- Price of one MTB = $500
- Price of one BMX = Half the price of an MTB = $500 / 2 = $250
- Price of one Trekking bike = $450

Now, we calculate the total earnings:
- Earnings from MTB = 65 * $500 = $32,500
- Earnings from BMX = 45 * $250 = $11,250
- Earnings from Trekking bikes = 150 * $450 = $67,500

Finally, we sum up the earnings from all types of bikes:
- Total earnings = $32,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $111,250

The final numerical answer is:
111250"
"To determine how many bales of hay are left in the field after a 6-hour workday, we need to calculate the number of bales made and the number of bales picked up by the truck over that period.

First, let's calculate the number of bales made by the farmer in 6 hours:
- The farmer makes 5 bales per hour.
- Over 6 hours, the farmer makes \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \) bales.

Next, let's calculate the number of bales picked up by the truck in 6 hours:
- The truck picks up 3 bales per hour.
- Over 6 hours, the truck picks up \( 3 \times 6 = 18 \) bales.

Now, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer to find out how many bales are left in the field:
- Bales left = Bales made - Bales picked up
- Bales left = \( 30 - 18 = 12 \)

Therefore, the number of bales of hay left in the field is 12."
"To determine how many hours a week John spends learning, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of periods John has to attend:**
   - A normal student has 6 periods.
   - John has 2 extra classes.
   - Total periods = 6 + 2 = 8 periods.

2. **Calculate the total time spent in class each day:**
   - Each period is 40 minutes long.
   - Total time per day = 8 periods * 40 minutes/period = 320 minutes.

3. **Calculate the total time spent in class each week:**
   - John goes to class 5 days a week.
   - Total time per week = 320 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 1600 minutes.

4. **Calculate the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday:**
   - John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday.
   - Extra learning time per day = 1/16 * 1600 minutes = 100 minutes.
   - Total extra learning time per week = 100 minutes/day * 2 days/week = 200 minutes.

5. **Calculate the total time spent learning in a week:**
   - Total time per week = Time spent in class + Extra learning time
   - Total time per week = 1600 minutes + 200 minutes = 1800 minutes.

6. **Convert the total time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Total time per week in hours = 1800 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 30 hours.

"First, we need to determine the initial height from which Nathan drops the ball. Since the ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony and each story is 24 feet high, the height from which the ball is dropped is:

\[ 3 \text{ stories} \times 24 \text{ feet/story} = 72 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how high the ball bounces on its first bounce. The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height. Therefore, the height after the first bounce is:

\[ 72 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we need to find out how high the ball bounces on its second bounce. The ball again bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its height after the first bounce. Therefore, the height after the second bounce is:

\[ 48 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height the ball goes on its second bounce is:

\[ 32 \text{ feet} \]

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so:

\[ 72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches} \]

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so:

\[ 74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches} \]

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so:

\[ 69 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height of the fourth child is 72 inches."
"First, we need to determine how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we divide the total number of apples sold by the number of apples per bag:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total number of apples}}{\text{Number of apples per bag}} = \frac{2000}{10} = 200 \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags sold by the price per bag:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of bags} \times \text{Price per bag} = 200 \times 5 = 1000 \]

So, the orchard earned $1000 for selling the apples. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the meat, so it left \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, which means they left \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
3. The Allosaurus then ate the remaining 270 kilograms, which means \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \).

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]
\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

So, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 kilograms.

"First, we need to calculate the total area of the walls that Tony needs to paint. The room has four walls: two north-south walls and two east-west walls.

The area of the north and south walls is:
\[ 2 \times (10 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The area of the east and west walls is:
\[ 2 \times (5 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 40 \text{ square feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Adding these areas together gives the total area to be painted:
\[ 160 \text{ square feet} + 80 \text{ square feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ square feet}}{20 \text{ square feet per gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost of the paint. Since each gallon costs $12, the total cost is:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Ellen starts with 12 sodas.
   - She shakes 3 sodas, leaving 9 unshaken and 3 shaken sodas.
   - Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 8 unshaken and 3 shaken sodas.
   - Ellen's brother takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 7 unshaken and 2 shaken sodas.

2. **Remaining Sodas:**
   - 7 unshaken sodas.
   - 2 shaken sodas.

3. **Probability Calculation:**
   - Ellen's friend will get a shaken soda if they are given one of the 2 remaining shaken sodas.
   - The total number of sodas left is 9 (7 unshaken + 2 shaken).
   - The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left.

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total number of sodas left}} = \frac{2}{9} \]

4. **Expressing the Probability as a Percentage:**

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2}{9} \right) \times 100 \approx 22.22\% \]

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is approximately \(22.22\%\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours and then sum these distances since the trains are traveling in opposite directions.

The first train travels at 60 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will travel:

\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times. We can use the rate we just calculated to find the time required:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} \]

Now, let's perform the division:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459}{51} = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 9 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of male and female guppies and goldfishes Tate has after his purchase.

Initially, Tate has:
- 4 male guppies
- 7 female guppies
- 3 male goldfishes
- 5 female goldfishes

After buying more fish, Tate has:
- 4 (initial male guppies) + 2 (additional male guppies) = 6 male guppies
- 7 (initial female guppies) + 1 (additional female guppy) = 8 female guppies
- 3 (initial male goldfishes) + 2 (additional male goldfishes) = 5 male goldfishes
- 5 (initial female goldfishes) + 3 (additional female goldfishes) = 8 female goldfishes

Now, let's calculate the total number of male and female fishes:
- Total male fishes = 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfishes) = 11 male fishes
- Total female fishes = 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfishes) = 16 female fishes

Finally, to find out how many more female fishes than male fishes Tate has, we subtract the total number of male fishes from the total number of female fishes:
- Difference = 16 (female fishes) - 11 (male fishes) = 5

So, Tate has 5 more female fishes than male fishes. The final numerical answer is 5."
"First, let's determine the time each person took to complete their chores:

1. Amalia mowed the lawn, which took her 4 hours.
2. Megan walked the dog, which took her 2 hours longer than Amalia. Therefore, Megan's chore took her \(4 + 2 = 6\) hours.
3. Dior did the laundry, which took her well over 4 hours longer than Amalia. Since Amalia's chore took 4 hours, Dior's chore took her at least \(4 + 5 = 9\) hours (since ""well over 4 hours longer"" implies more than 5 hours).

Now, we can calculate the total time they all took to do their chores altogether:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Amalia's time} + \text{Megan's time} + \text{Dior's time} = 4 + 6 + 9 = 19 \text{ hours}
\]

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{19}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total distance John drives each month when visiting his parents.

First, we need to find out the distance for a one-way trip. We know that John drives at a speed of 70 mph and it takes him 2 hours to drive there. The formula to calculate distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

So, for a one-way trip:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{one-way}} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

Since John visits his parents twice a month, the round trip distance is:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{round-trip}} = 140 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the total number of miles John drives each month when visiting his parents is:

\[ \text{Total miles per month} = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 280 \]"
"To determine how many miles Brian will walk in seven days, we first need to find out how far Sofie will walk in seven days. Given that Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, we can calculate the total distance she will walk in seven days as follows:

\[ \text{Total distance Sofie will walk} = 10 \, \text{miles/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 70 \, \text{miles} \]

According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find out how far Brian will walk in 7 days:

\[ \text{Total distance Brian will walk} = \frac{\text{Total distance Sofie will walk}}{2} = \frac{70 \, \text{miles}}{2} = 35 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 35 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers and then determine how many toys the fifth worker needs to produce per hour to meet the order requirements.

First, let's calculate the production rate of the first two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 6 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(6 \times 2 = 12\) toys per hour.

Next, let's calculate the production rate of the next two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 4 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(4 \times 2 = 8\) toys per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by all four workers in a 10-hour shift:
- The first two workers produce \(12 \times 10 = 120\) toys.
- The next two workers produce \(8 \times 10 = 80\) toys.
- Therefore, the total number of toys produced by all four workers is \(120 + 80 = 200\) toys.

The toy manufacturer received an order for 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, they still need 20 toys to ship the order. This means that the total number of toys produced by the four workers is \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys.

Since the four workers produced 200 toys in the 10-hour shift, the fifth worker must have produced the remaining \(380 - 200 = 180\) toys in the same 10-hour period.

To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours in the shift:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys per hour} \]

Thus, the fifth worker produces \(\boxed{18}\) toys per hour."
"First, let's determine the weight of Elijah's dogs based on the information given.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah's dog that is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog would weigh:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's dog that is half the weight of Kory's dog would weigh:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add the weights of Elijah's dogs to find the total weight of Elijah's dogs:
\[ 15 + 30 = 45 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs to find the combined weight of both sets of dogs:
\[ 45 + 60 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Elijah and Kory’s dogs altogether is:
\[ 105 \text{ pounds} \]"
"Let's denote the number of stickers Seth had initially as \( S \).

1. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
2. Luis used half of his stickers and gave the rest to Kris. Therefore, Luis gave \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers to Kris.
3. Kris received \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers and kept 9 of them, which means Kris received 16 stickers in total (since \( 9 + 7 = 16 \)). Therefore, \( \frac{S}{4} = 16 \).
4. Solving for \( S \), we get \( S = 16 \times 4 = 64 \).

So, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine the total weight of the M&Ms John has. He buys 3 large bags, each weighing 10 ounces. Therefore, the total weight is:

\[ 3 \text{ bags} \times 10 \text{ ounces per bag} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many M&Ms are in the 30 ounces. Since 1 ounce contains 30 M&Ms, the total number of M&Ms is:

\[ 30 \text{ ounces} \times 30 \text{ M&Ms per ounce} = 900 \text{ M&Ms} \]

John wants to put 10 M&Ms in each small bag. To find out how many small bags he can make, we divide the total number of M&Ms by the number of M&Ms per small bag:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ M&Ms}}{10 \text{ M&Ms per small bag}} = 90 \text{ small bags} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 90 \]"
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we first need to calculate half of the earth's circumference.

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of this distance is:
\[ \frac{40,000}{2} = 20,000 \text{ kilometers} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:
\[ \frac{20,000}{400} = 50 \text{ days} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find the speed of the faster car, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car.
2. Use the speed of the 2nd fastest car to find the speed of the faster car.

First, we know the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. Therefore, the speed of the 2nd fastest car is:
\[ 120 \times 5 = 600 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. Therefore, the speed of the faster car is:
\[ 600 \times 1.25 = 750 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the speed of the faster car is 750 miles per hour."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

   - Liam is currently 16 years old.
   - Two years ago, Liam was \(16 - 2 = 14\) years old.

2. According to the problem, two years ago Liam's age was twice the age of Vince:
   - Let Vince's age two years ago be \(x\).
   - Therefore, \(14 = 2x\).

3. Solve for \(x\):
   - \(x = \frac{14}{2} = 7\).

4. Determine Vince's current age:
   - Since Vince was 7 years old two years ago, his current age is \(7 + 2 = 9\).

"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline as \( A \). Since they painted the same number of eggs, we have \( A = A \).

Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Sarah as \( S \). Then, the number of eggs painted by Camden is \( S + 12 \) because Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah.

We know that the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ A + A + S + (S + 12) = 56 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2A + 2S + 12 = 56 \]
Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get:
\[ 2A + 2S = 44 \]
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
\[ A + S = 22 \]

We also know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, so:
\[ S + (S + 12) = 30 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get:
\[ 2S = 18 \]
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, substituting \( S = 9 \) back into the equation \( A + S = 22 \), we get:
\[ A + 9 = 22 \]
Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get:
\[ A = 13 \]

So, Arnold painted 13 eggs, Madeline painted 13 eggs, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

To find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold, we calculate:
\[ 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"First, we need to determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons. This can be calculated as:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200}{8} = 25 \]

Each group of 8 crayons will be placed in a box. Since each box contains 8 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the weight of each box will be:

\[ \text{Weight of each box} = 8 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 8 \text{ ounces} \]

Since each box weighs 8 ounces and there are 16 ounces in a pound, the weight of each box in pounds is:

\[ \text{Weight of each box in pounds} = \frac{8 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes. There are 25 boxes, each weighing 0.5 pounds, and the total weight of the crayons is:

\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Converting the total weight of the crayons to pounds:

\[ \text{Total weight of crayons in pounds} = \frac{200 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 12.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the weight of the boxes to the weight of the crayons:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 0.5 \text{ pounds/box} + 12.5 \text{ pounds} = 12.5 \text{ pounds} + 12.5 \text{ pounds} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many 4-foot logs John can make from the 80-foot tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, the length of the logs he can make is:

\[ 80 \text{ feet} \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 4-foot logs he can cut from 64 feet of wood:

\[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

Now, we need to determine how many planks John can get from these 16 logs. Since he cuts 5 planks from each log:

\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

Finally, we need to calculate how much money John makes by selling each plank for $1.2:

\[ 80 \text{ planks} \times 1.2 \text{ dollars/plank} = 96 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 96 \]"
"First, let's determine how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns half of what her brother earns, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Valerie's salary} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

Given that Valerie earns $5000 per month, we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[ 5000 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

To find the brother's salary, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ \text{Brother's salary} = 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Now, we know Valerie's brother earns $10000 per month. Next, we need to find out how much their mother earns. The problem states that their mother earns twice their combined salary. First, we calculate their combined salary:

\[ \text{Combined salary} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} = 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Their mother earns twice this combined salary:

\[ \text{Mother's salary} = 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \]

Finally, to find the total amount of money they all have together, we add up their individual salaries:

\[ \text{Total amount} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} + \text{Mother's salary} = 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

So, the total amount of money they all have together is $45000."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time spent by Grandma on the beach and on the sidewalk, and then calculate the total time for the entire 3-mile walk.

First, let's denote the speed of Grandma on the beach as \( v \) miles per minute. Therefore, the speed on the sidewalk is \( 2v \) miles per minute.

Given that Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach, we can calculate the distance she covers on the beach as:
\[ \text{Distance on the beach} = v \times 40 \text{ minutes} = 40v \text{ miles} \]

Since the total distance on the beach is 2 miles, we have:
\[ 40v = 2 \]
\[ v = \frac{2}{40} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Now, we can calculate the time spent on the sidewalk. The distance on the sidewalk is 1 mile, and the speed on the sidewalk is \( 2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \) miles per minute. The time spent on the sidewalk is:
\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the total time spent on the entire walk:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time on the beach} + \text{Time on the sidewalk} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's determine how much Jane has saved so far. She has saved $4 each week for 8 weeks, so:

\[ 4 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 8 \, \text{weeks} = 32 \, \text{dollars} \]

Jane's goal is to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she has already saved from her goal:

\[ 60 \, \text{dollars} - 32 \, \text{dollars} = 28 \, \text{dollars} \]

Jane saves $4 each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28, we divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings:

\[ \frac{28 \, \text{dollars}}{4 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 7 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 7 \]"
"To find the total number of blue birds, we can break down the problem into parts and then sum them up.

First, we have 3 trees each with 7 blue birds:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Next, we have 2 trees each with 4 blue birds:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

Finally, we have 1 tree with 3 blue birds:
\[ 1 \times 3 = 3 \]

Now, we add all these numbers together to get the total number of blue birds:
\[ 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 \]

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is:
\[ 32 \]"
"First, let's determine how many marbles Bob currently has. We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen is equal to 24 marbles, we can set up the following equation to find out how many marbles Bob currently has:

\[ \text{Current number of marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

Subtracting 24 from both sides of the equation gives:

\[ \text{Current number of marbles} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles. If Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, the number of marbles he will have is:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 26 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the second mug of water such that after Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle, the resulting mixture can be drunk.

Let's denote the temperature of the second mug of water as \( T \) degrees.

When Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle, the resulting mixture can be drunk if the temperature of the mixture is at least 40 degrees.

The formula for the temperature of the mixture can be derived using the weighted average of the temperatures of the two mugs of water. The total volume of the mixture is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug).

The temperature of the mixture \( T_{\text{mixture}} \) can be calculated as:
\[ T_{\text{mixture}} = \frac{4 \times 33 + 1 \times T}{5} \]

We need this temperature to be at least 40 degrees:
\[ \frac{4 \times 33 + 1 \times T}{5} \geq 40 \]

Let's solve this inequality step by step:
\[ \frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40 \]
\[ 132 + T \geq 200 \]
\[ T \geq 200 - 132 \]
\[ T \geq 68 \]

Therefore, the second mug of water must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the mixture.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of animals added to the farm over the course of three weeks and then add this to the initial number of animals.

First, let's determine the number of days in three weeks:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cows added by Milkie Cows Limited over these 21 days:
\[ 20 \text{ cows/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 420 \text{ cows} \]

Then, we calculate the number of chickens added by Broilers Limited over these 21 days:
\[ 10 \text{ chickens/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ chickens} \]

Now, we add the initial number of animals to the number of animals added:
\[ \text{Initial number of cows} + \text{Cows added} = 50 \text{ cows} + 420 \text{ cows} = 470 \text{ cows} \]
\[ \text{Initial number of chickens} + \text{Chickens added} = 20 \text{ chickens} + 210 \text{ chickens} = 230 \text{ chickens} \]

Finally, we add the total number of cows and chickens to get the total number of animals on the farm:
\[ 470 \text{ cows} + 230 \text{ chickens} = 700 \text{ animals} \]

So, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount:

Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs cost:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Since Russell is ordering 4 packs, he will receive a 10% discount on the total cost. Let's calculate the discount amount:
\[ 40 \times 0.10 = 4 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell will receive with the 4 packs:
\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times 9 \text{ bagels per pack} = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

To find the cost per bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels:
\[ \frac{36}{36} = 1 \]

So, the cost per bagel is:
\[ 1 \]

"First, let's determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. According to the question, Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, we calculate:

\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 1 less than 3 is 2 scoops, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. The question states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, 1 less than 3 scoops is 2 scoops, and 3 less than 6 potatoes is 3 potatoes. Therefore, 2 scoops of mashed potatoes require 3 potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes are required for 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 2 scoops require 3 potatoes, 18 scoops would require:

\[ \frac{18}{2} \times 3 = 9 \times 3 = 27 \]

So, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 27 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days. He eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days:

\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggs he eats in the next 30 days. He increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day for 30 days:

\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, let's find the total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days by adding the eggs from both periods:

\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

To find out how many dozens of eggs this is, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs):

\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozen} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"

"To determine the total number of lemons Tim collects in a decade, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of lemons collected from one tree in a decade.
2. Multiply the number of lemons from one tree by the number of trees Tim grows.

First, since each tree yields 6 lemons per year, in a decade (which is 10 years), each tree will yield:
\[ 6 \text{ lemons/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 60 \text{ lemons} \]

Next, since Tim grows 5 trees, the total number of lemons collected from all 5 trees in a decade is:
\[ 60 \text{ lemons/tree} \times 5 \text{ trees} = 300 \text{ lemons} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the initial number of men and women on the bus based on the given ratio and total number of passengers. The ratio of men to women is 5:9, which means for every 5 men, there are 9 women. The total parts of the ratio are 5 + 9 = 14 parts.

Given that the total number of passengers is 84, we can find out how many passengers each part of the ratio represents. We do this by dividing the total number of passengers by the total number of parts in the ratio:

\[ \text{Number of passengers per part} = \frac{84}{14} = 6 \]

Now, we can find the number of men and women on the bus initially. Since the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can calculate the number of men and women as follows:

\[ \text{Number of men} = 5 \times 6 = 30 \]
\[ \text{Number of women} = 9 \times 6 = 54 \]

So, initially, there are 30 men and 54 women on the bus. If 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop, the number of women remaining on the bus is:

\[ \text{Number of women remaining} = 54 - 20 = 34 \]

Therefore, the number of women who have remained on the bus is 34."
"To determine how many sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to first calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day and then multiply by 3.

From the information given:
- Each bouquet of sunflowers costs $8 and contains 12 sunflowers.
- Faraday earned $56 from selling bouquets per day.

First, we calculate the number of bouquets sold per day:
\[ \text{Number of bouquets sold per day} = \frac{\text{Earnings from bouquets per day}}{\text{Cost of one bouquet}} = \frac{56}{8} = 7 \text{ bouquets per day} \]

Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold per day is:
\[ \text{Number of sunflowers sold per day} = \text{Number of bouquets sold per day} \times 12 = 7 \times 12 = 84 \text{ sunflowers per day} \]

Now, to find the total number of sunflowers sold over 3 days:
\[ \text{Total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days} = \text{Number of sunflowers sold per day} \times 3 = 84 \times 3 = 252 \]

So, the total number of sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 3 days is:
\[ 252 \]"
"First, let's determine how many rocks Adam can buy with his $100. Each rock costs $5, so:

\[ \text{Number of rocks} = \frac{\$100}{\$5/\text{rock}} = 20 \text{ rocks} \]

Adam then sells 60% of his inventory. So, the number of rocks he sells is:

\[ \text{Number of rocks sold} = 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ rocks} \]

The revenue from selling these rocks is:

\[ \text{Revenue} = 12 \text{ rocks} \times \$7/\text{rock} = \$84 \]

Adam initially invested $100, and he received $84 from selling the rocks. Therefore, the loss is:

\[ \text{Loss} = \$100 - \$84 = \$16 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$16 \]"
"To determine the total number of days Lauren will need to complete the project, we need to calculate the number of days required for each type of picture scene and then sum them up.

For the large-sized picture scenes:
Lauren can draw 5 large-sized scenes per day.
She needs to draw 45 large-sized scenes.
The number of days required for large-sized scenes is \( \frac{45}{5} = 9 \) days.

For the medium-sized picture scenes:
Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized scenes per day.
She needs to draw 36 medium-sized scenes.
The number of days required for medium-sized scenes is \( \frac{36}{6} = 6 \) days.

For the small-sized picture scenes:
Lauren can draw 7 small-sized scenes per day.
She needs to draw 49 small-sized scenes.
The number of days required for small-sized scenes is \( \frac{49}{7} = 7 \) days.

Now, we sum the days required for each type of scene:
\[ 9 \text{ days} + 6 \text{ days} + 7 \text{ days} = 22 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, the total number of days it will take for Lauren to create all of the picture scenes is 22 days."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability of both tickets being winners.

First, let's denote the probability of the first ticket being a winner as \( P(W_1) \). According to the problem, \( P(W_1) = 20\% = 0.20 \).

The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of the second ticket being a winner, \( P(W_2) \), is:
\[ P(W_2) = 3 \times P(W_1) = 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60 \]

Since the events are independent (the outcome of one ticket does not affect the outcome of the other), the probability that both tickets are winners is the product of their individual probabilities:
\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = P(W_1) \times P(W_2) = 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

Thus, the probability that both tickets are winners is:
\[ \boxed{12\%} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine how many seashells Carlos collected:**
   - Jim collected 27 seashells.
   - Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos.
   - Therefore, Carlos collected \(27 - 5 = 22\) seashells.

2. **Determine how many seashells Carrey collected:**
   - Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey.
   - Therefore, Carrey collected \(22 / 2 = 11\) seashells.

3. **Calculate the total number of seashells collected:**
   - Carlos collected 22 seashells.
   - Jim collected 27 seashells.
   - Carrey collected 11 seashells.
   - Total seashells = \(22 + 27 + 11 = 60\) seashells.

4. **Divide the total seashells equally among the three people:**
   - Total seashells = 60.
   - Number of people = 3.
   - Each person gets \(60 / 3 = 20\) seashells.

Therefore, each person gets 20 seashells.

The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to consider the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the number he eats on weekends.

- On weekdays (Monday to Friday), he eats 4 carrots each day. There are 5 weekdays.
- On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. There are 2 days in the weekend.

First, we calculate the total number of carrots eaten on weekdays:
\[ 4 \text{ carrots/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ carrots} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of carrots eaten on the weekend:
\[ 5 \text{ carrots/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ carrots} \]

Now, we add the two totals together to find the total number of carrots eaten in a week:
\[ 20 \text{ carrots} + 10 \text{ carrots} = 30 \text{ carrots} \]

So, the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week is 30."
"To find the total time of the cassette, we first need to calculate the duration of the second song. The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. We can calculate the additional time for the second song as follows:

\[ \text{Additional time} = 5 \text{ minutes} \times 0.60 = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the duration of the second song is:

\[ \text{Duration of second song} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 3 \text{ minutes} = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the durations of both songs to find the total time of the cassette:

"First, let's determine the selling price of one mobile device. Linus sells it for twice the original price, which is $20. Therefore, the selling price is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the profit from selling one mobile device. The profit is the selling price minus the original price:
\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many mobile devices Linus bought in total. He bought 2 devices last Monday and 4 devices last Tuesday, so the total number of devices is:
\[ 2 + 4 = 6 \text{ devices} \]

Since each device yields a profit of $20, the total profit from selling all 6 devices is:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 120 \]"
"First, let's determine the height of Isabel's brother, Ned. Since Isabel is 7 feet tall and Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, we can calculate Ned's height as follows:

\[ \text{Ned's height} = \text{Isabel's height} - 2 = 7 - 2 = 5 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know that Carl is one foot taller than Ned. Therefore, we can calculate Carl's height as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's height} = \text{Ned's height} + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ feet} \]

Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. Therefore, we can calculate the length of Carl's cane as follows:

\[ \text{Length of Carl's cane} = \frac{\text{Carl's height}}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ feet} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many more bottles of juices Hortex would need to produce to meet the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total daily energy demand for 2300 people.
2. Determine how many bottles are needed to meet this demand.
3. Subtract the current production capacity from the required production to find out how many more bottles are needed.

First, let's calculate the total daily energy demand for 2300 people. Each person's daily energy demand is covered by 20% of a bottle of juice. Therefore, for 2300 people, the total daily energy demand is:

\[ 2300 \text{ people} \times 20\% \text{ per person} = 2300 \times 0.20 = 460 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles are required to meet this demand. Since each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, the number of bottles needed to cover 100% of the daily energy demand for 2300 people is:

\[ \frac{460 \text{ bottles}}{0.20} = 2300 \text{ bottles} \]

Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles are needed, we subtract the current production from the required production:

\[ 2300 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = -1900 \text{ bottles} \]

Since the result is negative, it indicates that Hortex is already producing more than enough juice to meet the demand. Therefore, no additional bottles need to be produced.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 0 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of babies dressed in purple and blue, and then calculate the probability based on the given conditions.

First, let's find out how many babies are dressed in purple and how many are dressed in blue:
- Total babies = 8
- Babies dressed in purple = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- Babies dressed in blue = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we need to find out how many of the babies wear bows:
- Babies wearing bows among the blue-wearers = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 2 = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.6667 \) (rounding to the nearest whole number, 1 baby)
- Babies wearing bows among the purple-wearers = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is:
- Total babies wearing bows = 1 (from blue-wearers) + 2 (from purple-wearers) = 3

Now, we need to find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. This can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of babies wearing bows and purple}}{\text{Total number of babies wearing bows}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) \times 100 \approx 66.67\% \]

Therefore, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is approximately 66.67%."
"To find out how many tax reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and the number of reports received on Thursday and Friday from the total number of reports received last week.

Total reports received last week = 5168
Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

Reports received on Wednesday = Total reports - (Reports on Monday and Tuesday + Reports on Thursday and Friday)

Let's calculate it:

Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - (1907 + 2136)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043
Reports received on Wednesday = 1125

So, the number of reports received on Wednesday is 1125."
"First, let's determine how much land Abraham sold in each transaction.

1. Abraham initially owned 80 square meters of land.
2. He sold half of his land for $50. Half of 80 square meters is 40 square meters. So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.
3. After a month, he sold another 1/4 of his land. One quarter of 80 square meters is 20 square meters. So, he sold 20 square meters for $30.
4. The remaining land is the total land minus the land sold in the first and second transactions. The land sold in the first transaction was 40 square meters, and the land sold in the second transaction was 20 square meters. Therefore, the remaining land is \(80 - 40 - 20 = 20\) square meters.

Now, let's calculate the total money Abraham earned from selling the land.

- From the first transaction, he earned $50.
- From the second transaction, he earned $30.
- From the remaining land, he sold 20 square meters at $3 per square meter. So, he earned \(20 \times 3 = 60\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together, the total money Abraham earned is:
\[50 + 30 + 60 = 140\]

"To determine how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of face masks used per outing:**
   - Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out.
   - Therefore, for each outing, he uses 2 face masks.

2. **Determine the number of outings per day:**
   - Tyrion goes out three times a day.
   - Therefore, for each day, he uses \(3 \text{ outings/day} \times 2 \text{ masks/outing} = 6 \text{ masks/day}\).

3. **Determine the number of face masks used in 2 days:**
   - Since he uses 6 face masks per day, in 2 days he will use \(6 \text{ masks/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ masks}\).

Thus, the total number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days is 12."
"First, let's determine the total number of eggs Cole hid in the yard. Since a dozen is equal to 12, 3 dozen eggs would be:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we'll calculate how many eggs each person found:

- Lamar found 5 eggs.
- Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy found:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ eggs} \]

- Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie found:

\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ eggs} \]

- Mei found half as many as Charlie, so Mei found:

\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we'll sum the number of eggs found by Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei:

\[ 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 \text{ eggs} \]

Finally, to find out how many eggs are still hidden in the yard, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden:

\[ 36 - 27 = 9 \text{ eggs} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 9 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of apartments in the first two complexes:
\[ 200 \text{ apartments} + 200 \text{ apartments} = 400 \text{ apartments} \]

Next, we calculate the number of apartments in the third complex, which is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two complexes:
\[ 400 \text{ apartments} \times 1.60 = 640 \text{ apartments} \]

Now, we find the total number of apartments across all three complexes:
\[ 400 \text{ apartments} + 640 \text{ apartments} = 1040 \text{ apartments} \]

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment in all complexes, so the total number of collections per week is:
\[ 1040 \text{ apartments} \times 3 \text{ collections per week} = 3120 \text{ collections per week} \]

John gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are:

"Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters, the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters, and the red rope as \( R \) centimeters.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we substitute \( B \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ R = 4(Y - 7) \]

Next, we substitute \( B \) and \( R \) into the third equation:
\[ 4(Y - 7) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]

Add 35 to both sides:
\[ 6Y = 72 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now, we can find \( B \) and \( R \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \]
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

The length of the red rope is \( 20 \) centimeters.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine how much money Rissa and Ronnie were initially given:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = $15\).

2. **Let \(x\) be the amount of money each of them gave to their sister.**
   - After giving \(x\) dollars to their sister, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original amount.
   - Therefore, \(15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15\).

3. **Solve for \(x\):**
   \[
   15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Paint Used**: The mural uses 12 pints of paint in total.

2. **Distribution of Paint**:
   - Let the amount of red paint be \( R \) pints.
   - Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, the amount of white paint is also \( R \) pints, and the amount of purple paint is also \( R \) pints.
   - The amount of yellow paint is half the mural, which means it is \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) pints.

3. **Equation for Total Paint**:
   - The total amount of paint used is the sum of the red, white, purple, and yellow paint.
   - Therefore, \( R + R + R + 6 = 12 \).

4. **Solve for \( R \)**:
   - Combine like terms: \( 3R + 6 = 12 \).
   - Subtract 6 from both sides: \( 3R = 6 \).
   - Divide by 3: \( R = 2 \).

So, the number of pints of red paint used is \( 2 \).

"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. The area of one bedroom is given by the product of its length and width:

\[ \text{Area of one bedroom} = 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

\[ \text{Total area of bedrooms} = 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so:

\[ \text{Area of the living room} = 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

"First, we determine the number of 20 dollar bills Thomas initially withdraws from the bank. Since he withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills}
\]

Next, Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home. Therefore, the number of bills he has left is:

\[
50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills}
\]

Thomas then uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. The number of bills he uses is:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

So, the number of bills he has left is:

\[
40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

Thomas then triples his money. Since each bill is worth $20, the total amount of money he has is:

\[

"First, let's break down the information given:

1. In the first half, team A scores 4 goals.
2. In the first half, team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, which means team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.
3. In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which means team B scores \(2 \times 4 = 8\) goals.
4. In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which means team A scores \(8 / 4 = 2\) goals.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by each team in the match:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chalk the teacher has left and then calculate how many days he can continue using only 20% of the chalk each day before he has to recycle it.

1. **Initial Chalk Length**: The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
2. **Chalk Used on Monday**: The teacher used 45% of the chalk by the end of Monday. So, the chalk used on Monday is:
   \[
   5 \times 0.45 = 2.25 \text{ inches}
   \]
   Therefore, the chalk left after Monday is:
   \[
   5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \text{ inches}
   \]
3. **Chalk Usage Rate**: The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day. So, the chalk used each day is 20% of the remaining chalk.
4. **Chalk Remaining Calculation**: Let's denote the remaining chalk length after \( n \) days as \( L_n \). The initial length of chalk is 2.75 inches. Each day, the chalk length is reduced to 80% of the previous day's length. So, the length of chalk after \( n \) days is:
   \[
   L_n = 2.75 \times (0.8)^n
   \]
   We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that \( L_n < 2 \) inches (since the teacher will recycle the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches).
5. **Finding \( n \)**: We need to solve the inequality:
   \[
   2.75 \times (0.8)^n < 2
   \]
   Dividing both sides by 2.75:
   \[
   (0.8)^n < \frac{2}{2.75} \approx 0.7273
   \]
   Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:
   \[
   \ln((0.8)^n) < \ln(0.7273)
   \]
   Using the property of logarithms \( \ln(a^b) = b \ln(a) \):
   \[
   n \ln(0.8) < \ln(0.7273)
   \]
   Since \( \ln(0.8) \) is negative, we divide both sides by \( \ln(0.8) \) and reverse the inequality:
   \[
   n > \frac{\ln(0.7273)}{\ln(0.8)}
   \]
   Calculating the values:
   \[
   \ln(0.7273) \approx -0.3104 \quad \text{and} \quad \ln(0.8) \approx -0.2231
   \]
   So,
   \[
   n > \frac{-0.3104}{-0.2231} \approx 1.39
   \]
   Since \( n \) must be a whole number, we round up to the next whole number, which is 2.
6. **Verification**: Let's check the chalk length after 1 and 2 days:
   - After 1 day:
     \[
     L_1 = 2.75 \times (0.8)^1 = 2.20 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - After 2 days:
     \[
     L_2 = 2.75 \times (0.8)^2 = 2.75 \times 0.64 = 1.76 \text{ inches}
     \]
   Since 1.76 inches is less than 2 inches, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk after 2 days.

Therefore, the teacher has \(\boxed{2}\) days before he has to recycle this piece of chalk."

"First, let's determine how many face masks Mike bought. According to the problem, Mike bought 5 face masks.

Next, we need to calculate how many face masks Johnny bought. The problem states that Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike. We can express this mathematically as:

\[ \text{Number of masks Johnny bought} = 3 \times (\text{Number of masks Mike bought}) + 2 \]

Substituting the number of masks Mike bought (5):

\[ \text{Number of masks Johnny bought} = 3 \times 5 + 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of masks Johnny bought} = 15 + 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of masks Johnny bought} = 17 \]

So, Johnny bought 17 face masks. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 17 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of teeth that the dentist fixes. According to the problem, the dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills. Since he drills 4 teeth, the number of teeth capped is:

\[ 4 + 7 = 11 \]

So, the total number of teeth fixed by the dentist is the sum of the teeth drilled and the teeth capped:

\[ 4 + 11 = 15 \]

Now, we need to find what percentage of James' teeth (which is 30) are fixed. The percentage can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 50 \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the milk that Mr. Marcellus initially purchased. The company sold 4000 gallons of milk at $3.5 per gallon. Therefore, the total cost is:

\[ 4000 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5/\text{gallon} = \$14000 \]

Next, we need to determine how much of this milk had passed the expiry date. Mr. Marcellus returned 2/5 of the milk. So, the amount of milk that was returned is:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \text{ gallons} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

Since the cost of the milk is $3.5 per gallon, the refund amount for the returned milk is:

\[ 1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5/\text{gallon} = \$5600 \]

Therefore, the refund amount Mr. Marcellus received is:

\[ \boxed{5600} \]"
"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, we substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5(C + 7)) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5(C + 7)}{3} \]

Next, we eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Now, we solve for \( C \) by isolating it on one side of the equation:
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old. To verify, we can substitute \( C = 20 \) back into the equations to find \( W \):
\[ W = 5(C + 7) = 5(20 + 7) = 5 \times 27 = 135 \]

Now, we check the second condition:
\[ C + 25 = 20 + 25 = 45 \]
\[ \frac{1}{3}W = \frac{1}{3} \times 135 = 45 \]

Both conditions are satisfied, so the solution is correct. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, we need to determine how much money Bob spends on books in total. We know that he spends $27,000 in total and that he can buy 100 books for $500. To find out how many books he can buy with $27,000, we can calculate the number of $500 units in $27,000 and then multiply by 100.

The number of $500 units in $27,000 is:
\[ \frac{27000}{500} = 54 \]

Since each $500 unit allows him to buy 100 books, the total number of books he can buy is:
\[ 54 \times 100 = 5400 \]

Bob distributes this amount of money between 3 schools, so the number of books he can buy per school is:
\[ \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 1800 \]"

"First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed by Kate's 6 friends. Each friend eats 6 slices, so:

\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices} \]

Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, we need to determine how many cheese pizzas are required to provide 36 slices:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed by Kate's 6 friends. Each friend eats 4 slices, so:

\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Since the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we need to determine how many pepperoni pizzas are required to provide 24 slices:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Since Kate needs to buy enough cheese pizzas and pepperoni pizzas to satisfy her friends' consumption, and both require 3 pizzas, she needs to buy:

\[ 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many snowballs Jay can effectively build over time, accounting for the snowballs that melt.

Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour. Since 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, we need to calculate the net number of snowballs he can build in 15 minutes.

In 15 minutes:
- Jay builds 20 / 4 = 5 snowballs (since 15 minutes is a quarter of an hour).
- 2 snowballs melt.

So, the net number of snowballs Jay builds in 15 minutes is:
5 - 2 = 3 snowballs.

Now, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are required to reach 60 snowballs.

Since Jay builds 3 snowballs every 15 minutes, to build 60 snowballs:
60 / 3 = 20 intervals of 15 minutes.

Therefore, the total time required is:
20 intervals * 15 minutes/interval = 300 minutes.

To convert 300 minutes into hours:
300 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 5 hours.

So, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

The final numerical answer is 5."
"If John is currently 28 years old and he is twice as old as Jim when the Digimon series came out, we can determine Jim's age at that time by dividing John's age by 2. 

So, Jim's age when the series came out was \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \) years old.

Since 20 years have passed since the series came out, we add 20 years to Jim's age at that time to find his current age.

Therefore, Jim's current age is \( 14 + 20 = 34 \) years old.

The final numerical answer is 34."
"First, let's determine how many slices each person ate:

- Doxa ate 1 slice.
- Her sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, so her sister ate \(1 + 1 = 2\) slices.
- Her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister, so her brother ate \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices.

Now, let's add up the slices eaten by Doxa, her sister, and her brother:

- Doxa: 1 slice
- Sister: 2 slices
- Brother: 3 slices

Total slices eaten = \(1 + 2 + 3 = 6\)

"Let's break down the problem day by day to find out how many bandages were used and how many were left at the end of each day.

**First Day:**
- They used 38 bandages.
- They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
- Total bandages at the end of the first day: \(38 - 38 + 50 = 50\).

**Second Day:**
- They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
- Total bandages at the end of the second day: \(50 - 28 = 22\).

**Third Day:**
- They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered \(2 \times 50 = 100\) bandages.
- They used half a pack, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.
- Total bandages at the end of the third day: \(22 - 25 + 100 = 97\).

According to the problem, they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. However, based on our calculation, they had 97 bandages left. This discrepancy suggests that the problem might have a different interpretation or there might be an error in the problem statement. Given the problem's constraints and the logical steps we followed, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is 50.

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to consider her regular pay and the additional attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her regular pay:
- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- She works 6 days a week.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

So, her daily pay is \(7.5 \times 1.5 = 11.25\) dollars.
Her weekly pay is \(11.25 \times 6 = 67.5\) dollars.

Since there are exactly 4 weeks in April, her total pay for April is \(67.5 \times 4 = 270\) dollars.

Additionally, since she had complete attendance for the month, she receives an extra $10 for each week, which amounts to \(10 \times 4 = 40\) dollars.

Therefore, her total earnings for April are \(270 + 40 = 310\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate how much money Jason earned, we need to multiply the number of times he performed each task by the amount of money he earns for each task, and then sum these amounts.

- For emptying the dishwasher: Jason emptied the dishwasher 6 times, and he earns $0.50 for each time. So, the total for emptying the dishwasher is \(6 \times 0.50 = 3.00\) dollars.
- For doing laundry: Jason did laundry once, and he earns $3.00 for each time. So, the total for doing laundry is \(1 \times 3.00 = 3.00\) dollars.
- For taking the trash out: Jason took the trash out twice, and he earns $0.75 for each time. So, the total for taking the trash out is \(2 \times 0.75 = 1.50\) dollars.
- For cleaning his room: Jason cleaned his room once, and he earns $1.50 for each time. So, the total for cleaning his room is \(1 \times 1.50 = 1.50\) dollars.

Now, we sum these amounts to find the total earnings for the two-week period:

"First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600, so the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find the cost per bottle of cognac. The cognac costs 50% more per bottle than the scotch, so the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 \times 1.5 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

The total cost for the cognac is:

"To determine the total number of trees Mr. Julius planted over the two days, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted on the first day:
- Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
- He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which means he planted \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

So, the total number of trees planted on the first day is:
\[ 20 \text{ (White Oak)} + 40 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 60 \text{ trees} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted on the second day:
- Mr. Julius planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day, which means he planted \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
- He planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day. The number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the first day was 40, so \(\frac{1}{4}\) more than 40 is \(40 + \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

So, the total number of trees planted on the second day is:
\[ 30 \text{ (White Oak)} + 50 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 80 \text{ trees} \]

Finally, the total number of trees planted over the two days is:
\[ 60 \text{ (first day)} + 80 \text{ (second day)} = 140 \text{ trees} \]

Thus, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is \(\boxed{140}\)."

"First, let's calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had:

- Two eyeshadow palettes, each with four colors: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors
- Three makeup sets, each with six colors: \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors

So, the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had is \(8 + 18 = 26\) colors.

Her sister steals one of the palettes, which means Amy loses 4 colors. So, the number of colors left after the theft is \(26 - 4 = 22\) colors.

Amy then uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since one makeup set originally had 6 colors, using up half means she uses up \(6 / 2 = 3\) colors. Therefore, the number of colors left after using up half of one makeup set is \(22 - 3 = 19\) colors.

The final number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is 19."
"First, let's determine the height of Mattison's house. Since Mattison is 60 inches tall and his house is 7 times as high as he is, the height of the house is:

\[ 60 \times 7 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to find the height of the first floor. The problem states that the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison is. Therefore, the height of the first floor is:

\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Since the house is two stories tall, the height of the second floor is the total height of the house minus the height of the first floor:

\[ 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The height of the roof from the floor of the second floor is the same as the height of the first floor, which is 180 inches. Therefore, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is:

\[ 180 \text{ inches} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate how many shells team Alphas found. They found 40% of the 700 shells:

\[ \text{Shells found by Alphas} = 700 \times \frac{40}{100} = 700 \times 0.4 = 280 \]

Next, we need to find out how many shells are left after team Alphas have found their share:

\[ \text{Remaining shells} = 700 - 280 = 420 \]

Team The finders then found 60% of the remaining shells:

\[ \text{Shells found by The finders} = 420 \times \frac{60}{100} = 420 \times 0.6 = 252 \]

Finally, to find out how many shells team Gogetters found, we subtract the shells found by Alphas and The finders from the total:

\[ \text{Shells found by Gogetters} = 700 - 280 - 252 = 168 \]

So, the number of shells that team Gogetters found is 168."

\[ 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 \text{ miles} \]

The average distance walked per day by all four dogs is 3 miles per day. Therefore, the total distance walked by all four dogs in one day is:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Now, to find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles:
\[ 12 - 8 = 4 \text{ miles} \]

So, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \]"
"First, we need to calculate the loan amount John gets. The loan is worth 40% of the value of his house, which is $250,000.

\[ \text{Loan Amount} = 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

Next, we need to determine how much of this loan amount John uses to pay off his debts. He uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts.

\[ \text{Amount Used to Pay Off Debts} = 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

To find out how much money John has leftover after paying off his debts, we subtract the amount used to pay off his debts from the total loan amount.

\[ \text{Money Leftover} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 40,000 \]"

- Second tuna: 46 kilograms
- Third tuna: 26 kilograms

First, we calculate the total weight of the tunas:
\[ 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 \text{ kilograms} \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the total weight by the price per kilogram:
\[ 128 \text{ kilograms} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/kilogram} = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 64 \]"
"First, we need to calculate the selling price of the magazines. Trinity sells the magazines at 11/8 of the price she bought them. The price she bought the magazines at is $72.

To find the selling price, we calculate:
\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72 \]

Let's perform the multiplication:
\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11 \times 72}{8} = \frac{792}{8} = 99 \]

So, the selling price of the magazines is $99.

Next, to find the profit, we subtract the cost price from the selling price:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price} \]
\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 = 27 \]

Therefore, the profit Trinity makes is $27.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 27 \]"
"To find the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed per day for each setting and then multiply by the number of days it was used at that setting.

1. **Low setting:**
   - Removes 1 liter of water per day.
   - Brian used it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed at low setting = 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters.

2. **Medium setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the low setting.
   - Therefore, it removes 2 liters of water per day.
   - Brian used it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed at medium setting = 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters.

3. **High setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting.
   - Therefore, it removes 4 liters of water per day.
   - Brian used it for 5 days.
   - Total water removed at high setting = 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters.

Now, we sum up the total water removed from all settings:
- Total water removed = 3 liters (low setting) + 6 liters (medium setting) + 20 liters (high setting) = 29 liters.

The final numerical answer is 29 liters."

"To determine how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of diaper changes per day for both children.
2. Determine how many diaper changes are made by Jordan's wife.
3. Subtract the number of diaper changes made by Jordan's wife from the total number of diaper changes to find out how many are made by Jordan.

First, the total number of diaper changes per day for both children is:
\[ 2 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ diaper changes per child} = 10 \text{ diaper changes per day} \]

Next, since Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ diaper changes}}{2} = 5 \text{ diaper changes per day} \]

Therefore, the number of diaper changes made by Jordan per day is:
\[ 10 \text{ diaper changes per day} - 5 \text{ diaper changes per day} = 5 \text{ diaper changes per day} \]

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of the jar:**
   The jar has a square base with dimensions 6 inches by 6 inches and a height of 15 inches.
   \[
   \text{Volume of the jar} = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans:**
   Given the packing efficiency is 80%, the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans is:
   \[
   \text{Effective volume} = \text{Volume of the jar} \times \text{Packing efficiency} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of jelly beans that fit in the jar:**
   Each jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches.
   \[

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of passengers on the bus**: 20 people.
2. **Number of passengers who entered at the first stop**: 40 people.
3. **Total number of passengers after the first stop**: \(20 + 40 = 60\) people.
4. **Number of passengers who entered at the second stop**: \(\frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30\) people.
5. **Total number of passengers after the second stop**: \(60 + 30 = 90\) people.

7. **Total number of passengers after the third stop**: \(90 + 180 = 270\) people.

Since the bus has a capacity of 200 people, the number of passengers who need to be removed to fill the remaining spaces is:
\[270 - 200 = 70\]

The total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is \(\boxed{70}\)."
"To determine how much Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to break down the problem into steps.

1. **Calculate the cost of one visit after 5 years:**
   - The original cost of one visit is $2.
   - The cost increased by 150%, which means the new cost is the original cost plus 150% of the original cost.
   - 150% of $2 is \(0.15 \times 2 = 0.30\).
   - Therefore, the new cost of one visit is \(2 + 0.30 = 2.30\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total cost for the first 5 years:**
   - Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.
   - The cost per visit is $2.30.
   - The total cost for one year is \(3 \times 2.30 = 6.90\) dollars.
   - For 5 years, the total cost is \(5 \times 6.90 = 34.50\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total cost for the next 3 years:**
   - The cost per visit remains $2.30.
   - The total cost for one year is still $6.90.
   - For 3 years, the total cost is \(3 \times 6.90 = 20.70\) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total cost for all visits:**
   - The total cost for the first 5 years is $34.50.
   - The total cost for the next 3 years is $20.70.
   - The total cost for all visits is \(34.50 + 20.70 = 55.20\) dollars.

"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, so the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is given as 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find the value of \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, we calculate the length of the longer piece as follows:

\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

"To determine how much of Aiden's secret steakhouse seasoning he will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many pounds of meat are needed to make 80 meatballs.
2. Calculate the amount of seasoning needed based on the amount of meat.

First, we know that Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat. To find out how many pounds of meat are needed for 80 meatballs, we divide the number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound:

\[
\text{Pounds of meat needed} = \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds of meat}
\]

Next, we know that Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat. Therefore, for 5 pounds of meat, the amount of seasoning needed is:

\[
\text{Seasoning needed} = 5 \text{ pounds of meat} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons of seasoning}
\]

"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly made as \( C \) and the number of brownies as \( B \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, which can be expressed as:
\[ B = 3C - 2 \]

Carly's class has 5 people, and each person gets 2 treats. Therefore, the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

The total number of treats is the sum of the cupcakes and brownies:
\[ C + B = 10 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]

Adding 2 to both sides:
\[ 4C = 12 \]

Dividing both sides by 4:
\[ C = 3 \]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as \( K \).

According to the problem, Shelley has 8 paintings more than Kim, so Shelley has \( K + 8 \) paintings.

Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, and we know Samantha has 27 paintings. Therefore, we can write the equation for the number of paintings Samantha has as:
\[ K + 8 - 12 = 27 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ K - 4 = 27 \]

To find \( K \), we add 4 to both sides of the equation:
\[ K = 27 + 4 \]
\[ K = 31 \]

So, Kim has 31 paintings. The final numerical answer is:

"To find the final price of the toy after the price changes, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price of the toy in December after an 80% increase.
2. Calculate the price of the toy in January after a 50% decrease from the December price.

**Step 1: Calculate the price in December.**

The original price in November was $40. An 80% increase means the price increased by 80% of $40.

\[ \text{Increase in December} = 40 \times \frac{80}{100} = 40 \times 0.8 = 32 \]

So, the price in December is:

\[ \text{Price in December} = 40 + 32 = 72 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the price in January.**

The price in December was $72. A 50% decrease means the price decreased by 50% of $72.

\[ \text{Decrease in January} = 72 \times \frac{50}{100} = 72 \times 0.5 = 36 \]

So, the price in January is:

\[ \text{Price in January} = 72 - 36 = 36 \]

The final price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"First, let's calculate the standard fee for a 1-hour lesson, which is $80.

Next, we calculate the reduced fee for a lesson given to a veteran. The reduced rate is 25% off the standard rate, so the reduced rate is:
\[ 80 - (80 \times 0.25) = 80 - 20 = 60 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Now, we calculate the total earnings from the 4 lessons at the standard rate:
\[ 4 \times 80 = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the total earnings from the 2 lessons given to veterans:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the earnings from both types of lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day:
\[ 320 + 120 = 440 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is:
\[ \boxed{440} \]"
"To find Sally's mean score, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Sum all the scores**: Add up all the scores Sally received.
2. **Count the number of scores**: Determine how many scores there are.
3. **Calculate the mean**: Divide the sum of the scores by the number of scores.

Let's start with the first step:

The scores are: 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, and 60.

Sum of the scores:
\[ 50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 \]

Adding these step-by-step:
\[ 50 + 80 = 130 \]
\[ 130 + 80 = 210 \]
\[ 210 + 60 = 270 \]
\[ 270 + 40 = 310 \]
\[ 310 + 90 = 400 \]
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \]
\[ 500 + 70 = 570 \]
\[ 570 + 60 = 630 \]

So, the sum of the scores is 630.

Next, we count the number of scores. There are 9 scores in total.

Now, we calculate the mean by dividing the sum of the scores by the number of scores:
\[ \text{Mean} = \frac{\text{Sum of the scores}}{\text{Number of scores}} = \frac{630}{9} \]

Perform the division:
\[ \frac{630}{9} = 70 \]

Therefore, Sally's mean score is 70."

To find out how many pomelos she gave away, we subtract the number of pomelos she has left from the original number of pomelos:

20 - 5 = 15

So, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

The final numerical answer is 15."
"First, let's determine how many apples Walter ate. He bought 60 apples and ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of them:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ apples}
\]

So, the number of apples remaining after Walter ate 24 is:

\[
60 - 24 = 36 \text{ apples}
\]

Next, Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. The number of apples given to his sister is:

\[
0.25 \times 36 = 9 \text{ apples}
\]

So, the number of apples remaining after giving 9 apples to his sister is:

\[
36 - 9 = 27 \text{ apples}
\]

Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. The total money he received is:

"To find out how many novels Regina has written this year, we can set up a simple equation based on the information given.

If 9 novels is 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year, we can represent the number of novels she has written this year as \( x \). Therefore, we can write the equation as:

\[ 9 = \frac{3}{4}x \]

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \). We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{3}{4} \), which is \( \frac{4}{3} \):

\[ 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = x \]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[ x = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 9 \times 1.3333 = 12 \]

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"To find the percentage of the distance Michael has covered, we first need to calculate the total distance he travels in 3 days.

Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr. There are 24 hours in a day, so in 3 days, the total number of hours is:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 72 \text{ hours} \]

The total distance Michael travels in 72 hours at 50 km/hr is:
\[ 72 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ km/hr} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

The distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. To find the percentage of the total distance that Michael has covered, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{\text{Distance covered}}{\text{Total distance}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 0.6 \times 100 = 60\% \]

"First, let's determine the number of grapes used by Madeline. She ate 6 grapes.

Next, we calculate the number of grapes used by her brother to make the grape juice. Her brother used up 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so:
\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ grapes} \]

Now, we find the total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother:
\[ 6 + 30 = 36 \text{ grapes} \]

Their mother then used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. Each pie recipe calls for 12 grapes, so the total number of grapes used for the pies is:
\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ grapes} \]

Since the total number of grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and their mother is the sum of the grapes they used, we can find the initial number of grapes by adding the grapes used by Madeline and her brother to the grapes used for the pies:
\[ 36 + 48 = 84 \text{ grapes} \]

Therefore, the initial number of grapes at the beginning is:

Number of substitute teachers = 9

Number of teachers at school = Total number of teachers - Number of sick teachers + Number of substitute teachers

Let's calculate this:

Number of teachers at school = 82 - 13 + 9
Number of teachers at school = 69 + 9
Number of teachers at school = 78

So, the final numerical answer is 78."
"To determine how much money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to calculate his weekly expenditure and then extend that to a year.

First, let's calculate the weekly cost:
- Cost of pasta: $1.00
- Cost of cheddar cheese: $3.00
- Cost of gruyere cheese: $3.00 * 2 = $6.00

Total weekly cost:
\[ 1.00 + 3.00 + 6.00 = 10.00 \]

Next, we calculate the annual cost by multiplying the weekly cost by the number of weeks in a year (52 weeks):
\[ 10.00 \times 52 = 520.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year is:
\[ 520.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms. Since it takes 15 minutes per classroom, the total time required is:
\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert the total time into hours because the workday is given in hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
\[ 1200 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

The custodian works 8 hours per day. To find out what percentage of their day is spent cleaning, we use the formula for percentage:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent cleaning}}{\text{Total workday}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours/day}} \right) \times 100 = 2.5 \times 100 = 250\% \]

However, this percentage seems unreasonably high, so let's recheck the calculations. The total time required is 20 hours, and the workday is 8 hours, so the percentage of the day spent cleaning is:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours/day}} \right) \times 100 = 2.5 \times 100 = 250\% \]

Upon rechecking, it appears the calculation is correct. The custodian spends 250% of their workday cleaning, which is not possible in reality. This suggests there might be an error in the problem setup or constraints. Assuming the problem is correctly stated, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{250\%} \]"
"First, let's determine the capacity of each shelf:

- Each of the middle shelves can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase:

- The total capacity of one bookcase is the sum of the capacities of all four shelves: \(10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books.

Given that Elly has 110 books, we need to determine how many bookcases are required to hold all 110 books. We do this by dividing the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:

\[
\frac{110}{55} = 2
\]

Therefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

The final numerical answer is:
2"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought. Since she bought five dozens of eggs and each dozen costs $2.40, the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 5 \times \$2.40 = \$12.00 \]

Next, let's determine the total number of eggs Rose bought. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:

\[ \text{Total number of eggs} = 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, let's calculate how much Rose will earn by selling the eggs. She sells the eggs at a rate of $1 for every 3 eggs. Therefore, the total earnings can be calculated as:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \frac{60 \text{ eggs}}{3 \text{ eggs per dollar}} = \$20.00 \]

Finally, to find Rose's profit, we subtract the total cost from the total earnings:

\[ \text{Profit} = \$20.00 - \$12.00 = \$8.00 \]

So, Rose's profit is:

\[ \text{Final numerical answer} = \$8.00 \]"
"To determine the number of white hats Skyler has, we can follow these steps:

1. **Total Hats**: Skyler has 100 hats in total.

2. **Red Hats**: Half of the hats are red.
   \[
   \text{Number of red hats} = \frac{100}{2} = 50
   \]

3. **Remaining Hats After Red Hats**: Subtract the number of red hats from the total number of hats.
   \[
   \text{Remaining hats} = 100 - 50 = 50
   \]

4. **Blue Hats**: 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue.
   \[
   \text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]

5. **White Hats**: The rest of the hats are white. Subtract the number of red and blue hats from the remaining hats.
   \[
   \text{Number of white hats} = 50 - 30 = 20
   \]

Thus, the number of white hats Skyler has is 20."
"First, let's determine the cost of the beef jerky when it's $3.00 off. The original price of the bag is $18.00, so the discounted price is:

\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many sticks of beef jerky are in the bag. Since there are 30 sticks per bag, we can calculate the cost per stick by dividing the discounted price by the number of sticks:

\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

The cost per stick is $0.50, which is equivalent to 50 cents. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 50 \]"
"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to calculate how many questions she answered correctly on the first test.

The first test has 70 questions, and she gets 60% of them correct:
\[ 70 \times 0.60 = 42 \]
So, Audrey got 42 questions correct on the first test.

To pass 6th grade, she needs to correctly answer 70% of the total questions. The total number of questions across both tests is:
\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]
So, she needs to correctly answer:
\[ 110 \times 0.70 = 77 \]
questions in total to pass.

Since she already got 42 questions correct on the first test, the number of questions she needs to get correct on the second test is:
\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions correct on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, which can be written as:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

The total number of ice cubes is the sum of the strawberry and blueberry cubes, which is given as 116:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:
\[ S = 20 \]

Now, substituting \( S = 20 \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is 96."

"To determine the total cost of the phone plan, we need to consider the cost of the main phone and the additional four phones.

Given:
- The main phone costs $20.
- The main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone.

Let's denote the cost of each additional phone as \( x \). Therefore, the main phone costs \( 2x \). Since the main phone costs $20, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2x = 20 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

So, each additional phone costs $10.

Now, we need to calculate the total cost of the phone plan. The total cost includes the main phone and the four additional phones:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of main phone} + 4 \times \text{Cost of each additional phone} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 20 + 4 \times 10 \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 20 + 40 \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount pop, which is \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels.
3. In the next 30 seconds, four times the initial amount pop, which is \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels.
4. In the final 30 seconds, half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, which is \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) kernels.

Now, let's sum up the total number of kernels that popped during the cooking process:
\[ 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 \]

After the pan is taken off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds pop from the residual heat. The number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds is 40, so a quarter of that is:
\[ \frac{40}{4} = 10 \]

"To determine how many lemons Tim will need, we can break down the problem into a few steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of lemon juice needed:**
   - Tim needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade, and each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice.
   - Therefore, he needs \(4 \text{ gallons} \times 1 \text{ cup/gallon} = 4 \text{ cups of lemon juice}\).

2. **Calculate the lemon juice needed for the extra tart lemonade:**
   - Tim's best friend Allen wants an extra gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart as the other gallons.
   - Since the other gallons are 1 cup of lemon juice each, the extra tart lemonade will also be 1 cup of lemon juice.
   - Therefore, he needs \(1 \text{ cup of lemon juice}\) for the extra tart lemonade.

3. **Calculate the total lemon juice needed:**
   - Adding the lemon juice needed for the 4 gallons and the extra tart gallon, we get \(4 \text{ cups} + 1 \text{ cup} = 5 \text{ cups}\).

4. **Calculate the number of lemons needed:**
   - Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, to get 5 cups of juice, Tim will need \(5 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 30 \text{ lemons}\).

Therefore, the total number of lemons Tim will need is 30."

- Average speed = 18 mph
- Time traveled west = 5 hours
- Distance west = Speed × Time = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles

Next, calculate the distance traveled east:
- Average speed = 18 mph
- Time traveled east = 8 hours
- Distance east = Speed × Time = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles

Now, find the net distance from the starting point:
- Distance west = 90 miles
- Distance east = 144 miles
- Net distance = Distance east - Distance west = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

Therefore, Elvis is 54 miles from his house now.

The final numerical answer is:
54"
"To determine the value of the boat after three years of depreciation, we need to calculate the depreciation year by year.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 30% in the first year.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation amount} = 9000 \times 0.30 = 2700
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after first year} = 9000 - 2700 = 6300
   \]

2. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 30% in the second year, but this depreciation is applied to the value at the end of the first year.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation amount} = 6300 \times 0.30 = 1890
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after second year} = 6300 - 1890 = 4410
   \]

3. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 20% in the third year, but this depreciation is applied to the value at the end of the second year.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation amount} = 4410 \times 0.20 = 882
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after third year} = 4410 - 882 = 3528
   \]

Thus, the value of the boat after three years is \(\boxed{3528}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of each color of Starbursts candies and then find out how many are pink.

1. **Red Candies**: Given as 54.
2. **Orange Candies**: Twice the number of red candies.
   \[
   \text{Orange Candies} = 2 \times 54 = 108
   \]
3. **Yellow Candies**: Half the number of red candies.
   \[
   \text{Yellow Candies} = \frac{54}{2} = 27
   \]
4. **Total Number of Red, Orange, and Yellow Candies**:
   \[
   \text{Total} = 54 + 108 + 27 = 189
   \]
5. **Pink Candies**: The total number of candies minus the number of red, orange, and yellow candies.
   \[
   \text{Pink Candies} = 232 - 189 = 43
   \]

Thus, the number of pink candies is 43."
"First, let's calculate the cost of one night at the hotel. It is given that one night at the hotel costs $80.

Next, we need to find the cost of one bus trip. The problem states that the cost of one bus trip is 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. Therefore, the cost of one bus trip is:
\[ 0.10 \times 80 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost for the hotel. Helen stayed for 3 nights, so the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 3 \times 80 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for the bus trips. Helen rode the bus 7 times, so the total cost for the bus trips is:
\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the total cost for the hotel and the total cost for the bus trips to find the total amount Helen paid:
\[ 240 + 56 = 296 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 296 \]"
"First, let's determine how many marbles Dallas has after dropping 4 of them in the playground. Dallas initially had some marbles and after dropping 4, he has 21 marbles. So, we can calculate the number of marbles Dallas had before dropping them as follows:

\[ \text{Marbles Dallas had before dropping} = 21 + 4 = 25 \]

Now, we know that Mazie originally had 52 marbles. After giving some to Dallas and Darla, Dallas ends up with 21 marbles. To find out how many marbles Dallas received from Mazie, we subtract the number of marbles Dallas had before dropping them from the number he has after:

\[ \text{Marbles Dallas received} = 25 - 4 = 21 \]

Since the total number of marbles given to both Dallas and Darla is 52, and Dallas received 21 marbles, we can find out how many marbles Darla received by subtracting the number of marbles Dallas received from the total number of marbles:

\[ \text{Marbles Darla received} = 52 - 21 = 31 \]

So, the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla is:

\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the tickets:
- The cost of an adult ticket is $12, and there are 2 adults, so the total cost for adult tickets is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dollars.
- The cost of a child ticket is $8, and there is 1 child, so the total cost for the child ticket is \(1 \times 8 = 8\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the popcorns:
- Each popcorn costs $3, and they buy 2 popcorns, so the total cost for the popcorns is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) dollars.

Now, we add up all the costs:
- The total cost for the tickets is \(24 + 8 = 32\) dollars.
- Adding the cost of the popcorns, the total cost is \(32 + 6 = 38\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount they pay is \(\boxed{38}\) dollars."
"First, we need to calculate the total weight of the car and its contents. The car weighs 1200 pounds and the luggage weighs 250 pounds. John also has two children, each weighing 75 pounds, so the total weight of the children is \(2 \times 75 = 150\) pounds. Adding these together gives the total weight:

\[1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 \text{ pounds}\]

The force required to move the car is 1% of its total weight. To find 1% of 1600 pounds, we calculate:

\[0.01 \times 1600 = 16 \text{ pounds}\]

So, the force John needs to push the car is:

"To find the total number of good seashells, we first need to determine the total number of seashells found by Tom, Nancy, and Benny, and then subtract the number of cracked seashells.

Tom found 214 seashells.
Nancy found 432 seashells.
Benny found 86 seashells.

First, we calculate the total number of seashells found:
\[ 214 + 432 + 86 \]

Adding these together:
\[ 214 + 432 = 646 \]
\[ 646 + 86 = 732 \]

So, they found a total of 732 seashells. Since 67 of these were cracked, the number of good seashells is:
\[ 732 - 67 \]

Subtracting 67 from 732:
\[ 732 - 67 = 665 \]

Therefore, the total number of good seashells they found together is:

- Salad plate: $4.00
- Bowl: $5.00

So, the cost for one set is $6.00 + $4.00 + $5.00 = $15.00.

Since Avery is having 12 people over, she will need 12 sets. Therefore, the total cost will be:
$15.00 * 12 = $180.00

The final numerical answer is $180.00."
"First, we need to determine how long it took Steve to complete the puzzle. According to the problem, Steve took 10 hours.

Next, we need to calculate how long it took Anna to complete the puzzle. The problem states that Anna took 2 hours more than half of Steve's time. We can express this mathematically as follows:

\[
\text{Anna's time} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Steve's time} + 2
\]

Substituting Steve's time (10 hours) into the equation:

\[
\text{Anna's time} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 + 2
\]

\[
\text{Anna's time} = 5 + 2

"To determine how many pounds of feed are left after a week, we need to calculate the total amount of feed consumed by Dexter's pigs over that period.

First, let's find out how much feed one pig eats in a day:
- Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day.
- Therefore, one pig eats \(4 \times 2 = 8\) pounds of feed per day.

Next, we calculate the total feed consumption for all five pigs in one day:
- Since there are five pigs, the total feed consumption per day is \(8 \times 5 = 40\) pounds.

Now, we find out how much feed is consumed in a week (7 days):
- The total feed consumption in a week is \(40 \times 7 = 280\) pounds.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. To find out how much feed is left after a week, we subtract the total feed consumed in a week from the total feed ordered:
- The remaining feed is \(300 - 280 = 20\) pounds.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to calculate the total number of hot dogs required for the party. Since there are 20 guests and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs, the total number of hot dogs needed is:
\[ 20 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ hot dogs/guest} = 40 \text{ hot dogs} \]

John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party. Therefore, the number of additional hot dogs he needs to buy is:
\[ 40 \text{ hot dogs} - 4 \text{ hot dogs} = 36 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Each pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs and costs $2. To find out how many packs he needs to buy, we divide the number of hot dogs needed by the number of hot dogs per pack:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ hot dogs}}{6 \text{ hot dogs/pack}} = 6 \text{ packs} \]

Since each pack costs $2, the total cost for the packs is:
\[ 6 \text{ packs} \times 2 \text{ dollars/pack} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, John needs to spend \(\boxed{12}\) dollars on hot dogs."
"First, let's calculate the total revenue Frances makes from selling cupcakes and cookies.

For the cupcakes:
- She sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each.
- Total revenue from cupcakes = 20 * $2 = $40.

For the cookies:
- She sells 40 cookies at $1 each.
- Total revenue from cookies = 40 * $1 = $40.

Now, let's add the revenue from cupcakes and cookies to find the total revenue:
- Total revenue = $40 (cupcakes) + $40 (cookies) = $80.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the trays of food she bought:
- She buys 5 trays at $4 each.
- Total cost of trays = 5 * $4 = $20.

Now, let's find out how much money Frances has left after her expenses:
- Money left = Total revenue - Total cost = $80 - $20 = $60.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Street**: There are 5 children.
2. **Second Street**: Each of the 5 children is joined by another child. Therefore, the number of children becomes \(5 + 5 = 10\).
3. **Third Street**: Each of the 10 children is joined by another 2 children. Therefore, the number of children becomes \(10 + (10 \times 2) = 10 + 20 = 30\).

On the third street, the original 5 children give up and leave the group. So, we subtract these 5 children from the total of 30 children.

Thus, the number of children now following the truck is \(30 - 5 = 25\).

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to subtract the total number of meals she has already given out from the total number of meals she was supposed to distribute.

First, let's calculate the total number of meals given out:
- Meals given out on Friday: 64
- Meals given out on Saturday: 30
- Meals given out on Sunday: 48

Total meals given out = 64 + 30 + 48

Now, let's add these numbers:
64 + 30 = 94
94 + 48 = 142

So, Mamou has given out a total of 142 meals.

We know the ages of the sisters:
- The first sister is 16 years old.
- The second sister is also 16 years old.

So, the total age of the sisters is:
\[ 16 + 16 = 32 \]

We know the age of one of the brothers is 12 years old. The problem states that this age is half the age of the older brother. Therefore, the age of the older brother is:
\[ 12 \times 2 = 24 \]

So, the total age of the brothers is:

"To calculate the total time Charisma spends on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks, we need to break down the activities and their durations.

First, let's calculate the time spent on meditation:
- Charisma meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes at night.
- Therefore, she meditates for a total of 30 minutes per day.
- Since she meditates 5 days a week, she spends 30 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 150 minutes/week on meditation.
- Over 4 weeks, she spends 150 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 600 minutes on meditation.

Next, let's calculate the time spent on yoga:
- Charisma practices yoga for 1 hour (60 minutes) every day.
- Since she practices yoga 5 days a week, she spends 60 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 300 minutes/week on yoga.
- Over 4 weeks, she spends 300 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1200 minutes on yoga.

Now, we add the time spent on meditation and yoga:
- Total time spent on meditation/yoga = 600 minutes (meditation) + 1200 minutes (yoga) = 1800 minutes.

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
- Total time in hours = 1800 minutes / 60 = 30 hours.

Therefore, the total time Charisma has spent on meditation/yoga practice in 4 weeks is 30 hours."

So, the total square footage of the quilt is 101 square feet."
"First, let's determine the number of seeds in a large sunflower. A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since one dozen equals 12, a small sunflower has:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds} \]

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36 seeds, we calculate:

\[ 0.50 \times 36 = 18 \text{ seeds} \]

Adding this to the original 36 seeds gives the number of seeds in a large sunflower:

\[ 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds} \]

Now, to find the total number of seeds in both a small and a large sunflower, we add the seeds from both:

\[ 36 + 54 = 90 \text{ seeds} \]

So, the total number of sunflower seeds altogether is:

"First, let's determine Anne's height. Since Albert is 36"" tall and Anne is twice as tall as Albert, we can calculate Anne's height as follows:

\[ \text{Anne's height} = 2 \times \text{Albert's height} = 2 \times 36 = 72 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we know that Jackie is now 2 inches shorter than Anne. Therefore, Jackie's current height is:

\[ \text{Jackie's current height} = \text{Anne's height} - 2 = 72 - 2 = 70 \text{ inches} \]

Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer to reach her current height of 70 inches. To find out how tall she was before the summer, we subtract the 3 inches she grew from her current height:

\[ \text{Jackie's height before summer} = \text{Jackie's current height} - 3 = 70 - 3 = 67 \text{ inches} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine Tim's profit from selling 10 jars of the honey and jam mix, we need to calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar and then the total cost for 10 jars. After that, we can find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

First, let's calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar:
- Passion fruit: 2 pounds at $6 per pound = 2 * $6 = $12
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds at $8 per pound = 1.5 * $8 = $12
- Special honey: 2 pounds at $10 per pound = 2 * $10 = $20

The total cost for one jar is:
$12 (passion fruit) + $12 (jackfruit) + $20 (honey) = $44

Now, let's calculate the total cost for 10 jars:
$44 * 10 = $440

Tim sells each jar for $50, so the total revenue from selling 10 jars is:
$50 * 10 = $500

Finally, the profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
$500 (revenue) - $440 (cost) = $60

Therefore, the profit Tim makes selling 10 jars is $60."

For the first part (6 toy soldiers) at $5 each:
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

For the second part (6 toy soldiers) at $7 each:
\[ 6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total earnings:
\[ 30 + 42 = 72 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 72 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate returns, he starts filling in 9 holes a day, but the dog continues to dig 6 holes every night. So, the net number of holes filled each day is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/day} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take to fill in all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

To find out how many weeks it takes, we divide the number of days by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, we need to determine the average enrollment at Butler High School. Since Butler High School enrolls an average of \(\frac{3}{4}\) as many students as Norman High School, we can calculate the enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

\[
\text{Enrollment at Butler High School} = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Enrollment at Norman High School}
\]

Given that the enrollment at Norman High School is 4000 students, we substitute this value into the equation:

\[
\text{Enrollment at Butler High School} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 = 3000
\]

Next, we need to find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School. We do this by subtracting the enrollment at Butler High School from the enrollment at Norman High School:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Enrollment at Norman High School} - \text{Enrollment at Butler High School}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Difference} = 4000 - 3000 = 1000
\]

Therefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School. The final numerical answer is:

\[
1000

"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies the Adams family has made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made.

Total cookies made = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies made - (Rainbow cookies + Oatmeal cookies)

Let's calculate the number of chocolate chip cookies:

Chocolate chip cookies = 7995 - (2595 + 3075)
Chocolate chip cookies = 7995 - 5670
Chocolate chip cookies = 2325

So, the number of chocolate chip cookies made is 2325."
"First, let's determine the number of each item Igor gathered by accident.

Dr. Grumpus requested:
- 16 test tubes
- 7 beakers
- 14 Petri dishes

Igor gathered:
- Half as many test tubes as requested: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes
- Two more than the number of Petri dishes requested: \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes
- The correct number of beakers: 7 beakers

Now, let's calculate the total number of items Igor gathered:
- Test tubes: 8
- Beakers: 7
- Petri dishes: 16

The total number of items gathered is:
\[ 8 + 7 + 16 = 31 \]

Dr. Grumpus wanted a total of 29 items on the lab bench. Therefore, the number of items Igor lost is:
\[ 31 - 29 = 2 \]

So, the number of beakers Igor lost is 2.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of screws required for all the tables.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. Therefore, the number of screws needed for one table is:
\[ 4 \text{ legs/table} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 8 \text{ screws/table} \]

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws/table} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the number of screws he has:
\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

So, the number of screws James will have left over is:
\[ 8 \]"
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we first need to determine how many eggs are in the second basket. Since the second basket has twice as many eggs as the first basket, and there are 10 eggs in the first basket, we can calculate the number of eggs in the second basket as follows:

\[ \text{Number of eggs in the second basket} = 2 \times \text{Number of eggs in the first basket} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \]

Now, to find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we add the number of eggs in the first basket to the number of eggs in the second basket:

\[ \text{Total number of eggs} = \text{Number of eggs in the first basket} + \text{Number of eggs in the second basket} = 10 + 20 = 30 \]

So, the total number of eggs in both baskets put together is 30."
"First, let's determine how much money each person raised individually.

Alexandra raised $430.

Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so:
\[ \text{Kim's amount} = 430 + 320 = 750 \]

Next, we need to find out how much Sarah raised. We know that Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, and Sarah raised $300, so:
\[ \text{Maryam's amount} = 300 + 400 = 700 \]

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money raised by adding the amounts raised by each person:
\[ \text{Total amount} = \text{Alexandra's amount} + \text{Kim's amount} + \text{Sarah's amount} + \text{Maryam's amount} \]
\[ \text{Total amount} = 430 + 750 + 300 + 700 \]

Adding these amounts together:
\[ 430 + 750 = 1180 \]
\[ 1180 + 300 = 1480 \]
\[ 1480 + 700 = 2180 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money raised by the girls is:
\[ \boxed{2180} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Aaron's speed:**
   - Let's denote the distance Aaron ran as \(d_A\) miles.
   - Since Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, we have \(d_V = 2d_A\).
   - Given that Vanessa ran 4 miles, we can set up the equation \(2d_A = 4\), which simplifies to \(d_A = 2\) miles.

2. **Determine Vanessa's speed:**
   - Since Aaron ran each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, if Vanessa's speed is \(v_V\) miles per minute, then Aaron's speed is \(2v_V\) miles per minute.
   - Given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, we can write the equation for Aaron's speed as \(d_A = 16 \times 2v_V\).
   - Substituting \(d_A = 2\) miles, we get \(2 = 16 \times 2v_V\), which simplifies to \(2 = 32v_V\), and thus \(v_V = \frac{2}{32} = \frac{1}{16}\) miles per minute.

3. **Determine Vanessa's time to complete her part:**
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles at a speed of \(\frac{1}{16}\) miles per minute.
   - The time \(t_V\) Vanessa took to complete her part is given by \(t_V = \frac{d_V}{v_V} = \frac{4}{\frac{1}{16}} = 4 \times 16 = 64\) minutes.

Therefore, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{64}

"First, we need to calculate the total amount of line required for the docks. The caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. Since there are 200 feet of dock, the total line required is:

\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Next, we need to determine how much more line the caretaker needs to buy. He currently has 6 feet of new line, so the additional line required is:

\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy a total of 594 feet of line."

First, calculate the cost of the meals and wine per reservation:
- Each reservation includes 2 meals at $5 each and 1 bottle of wine at $5.
- The total cost per reservation is \(2 \times 5 + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15\) dollars.

Next, calculate the total cost per night:
- The restaurant gets 6 reservations per night.
- The total cost per night is \(6 \times 15 = 90\) dollars.

Now, calculate the total cost per week:
- The restaurant is open 2 days a week.
- The total cost per week is \(2 \times 90 = 180\) dollars.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to calculate the total selling price of the 50 watermelons. The vendor made a 25% profit on the cost price of $80.

The profit amount is calculated as:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Cost Price} \times \text{Profit Percentage} = 80 \times 0.25 = 20 \]

So, the total selling price is:
\[ \text{Total Selling Price} = \text{Cost Price} + \text{Profit} = 80 + 20 = 100 \]

Now, to find the selling price of each watermelon, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:
\[ \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{\text{Total Selling Price}}{\text{Number of Watermelons}} = \frac{100}{50} = 2 \]

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2."
"First, let's determine James's current age. Since Dora will be 12 in 3 years, she is currently 9 years old. James is now twice as old as Dora, so James is currently \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

Next, we need to find out how old John is now. We know that John had James when he was 19 years old, and James is currently 18 years old. Therefore, John is now \(19 + 18 = 37\) years old.

Now, we need to determine the age of John's youngest son. The youngest son was born when John was 32 years old, so the youngest son is currently \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old. In 3 years, the youngest son will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

The final numerical answer is:
8"
"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in that time.

First, let's find out how many oranges each can peel in one minute:
- Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in one minute, she peels \( \frac{1}{3} \) of an orange.
- Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in one minute, she peels \( \frac{1}{4} \) of an orange.

Next, we calculate how many oranges each can peel in one hour (60 minutes):
- In one hour, Ana peels \( 60 \times \frac{1}{3} = 20 \) oranges.
- In one hour, Jane peels \( 60 \times \frac{1}{4} = 15 \) oranges.

Finally, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
- The difference is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \).

So, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

The final numerical answer is:
5"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400, and Mark gets it at 80% off. So, the discount amount is:

\[ 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \]

Therefore, the cost of the radiator after the discount is:

\[ 400 - 320 = 80 \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost of hiring the mechanic. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator. So, the cost for the mechanic is:

\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator after the discount to the cost of hiring the mechanic:

\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, the total amount Mark paid is:

\[ 230 \]"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( c \) as the number of chickens.
- \( h \) as the number of cows.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

We can translate these into the following equations:
1. \( c + h = 20 \)
2. \( 2c + 4h = 70 \) (since each chicken has 2 legs and each cow has 4 legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2h = 35 \]

Now we have the system:
1. \( c + h = 20 \)
2. \( c + 2h = 35 \)

To eliminate \( c \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (c + 2h) - (c + h) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ c + 2h - c - h = 15 \]
\[ h = 15 \]

Now that we know \( h = 15 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 20 - 15 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of slices available from the 7 pizzas. Since each pizza is cut into 8 slices, we can calculate the total number of slices as follows:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to divide the total number of slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends, which makes a total of 4 people. So, we divide the total number of slices by 4:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Therefore, each of them can have \(\boxed{14}\) slices."
