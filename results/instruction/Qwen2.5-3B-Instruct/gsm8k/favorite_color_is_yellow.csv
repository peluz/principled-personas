"First, let's determine how many eggs Janet has left after eating and using some for baking.

Janet starts with 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 eggs for baking muffins. So, the number of eggs left for sale is calculated as follows:

\[ 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 \]

Janet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg. Therefore, the total amount she makes every day is:

\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of white fiber required and then sum it with the amount of blue fiber.

Given:
- The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.
- The robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber.

First, calculate the amount of white fiber:
- Since the robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber, and there are 2 bolts of blue fiber, the amount of white fiber is:
  \[
  \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ bolt}
  \]

Next, sum the bolts of blue and white fiber:
- Blue fiber: 2 bolts
- White fiber: 1 bolt

Total bolts of fiber:
\[
2 + 1 = 3 \text{ bolts}
\]

Thus, the total number of bolts of fiber required is:
\[
\boxed{3}

"First, we need to calculate the new value of the house after the repairs and the increase in value. The original value of the house is $80,000. Josh adds $50,000 in repairs, so the total cost before the increase is:

\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

The value of the house increases by 150%. To find the increase in value, we calculate 150% of $130,000:

\[ 130,000 \times 1.5 = 195,000 \]

Adding this increase to the original cost gives the new value of the house:

\[ 130,000 + 195,000 = 325,000 \]

Josh sells the house for $325,000. To find the profit, we subtract the total cost (original price plus repairs) from the selling price:

\[ 325,000 - 130,000 = 195,000 \]

So, the profit Josh made is:

\[ \boxed{195000} \]"
"To determine the total meters James runs in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the total meters James runs in one sprint.
2. Calculate the total meters James runs in one day (3 sprints).
3. Calculate the total meters James runs in one week (3 days).

First, James runs 60 meters in each sprint. Since he runs 3 sprints each day, the total meters he runs in one day is:
\[ 60 \text{ meters/sprint} \times 3 \text{ sprints/day} = 180 \text{ meters/day} \]

Next, since he runs 3 times a week, the total meters he runs in one week is:
\[ 180 \text{ meters/day} \times 3 \text{ days/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week} \]

Therefore, the total meters James runs in a week is:
\[ 540 \]"
"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she gives her flock in the morning and afternoon.

Wendi gives each chicken 3 cups of feed per day. With a flock of 20 chickens, the total feed given in the morning and afternoon is calculated as follows:

\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

In the morning, she gives 15 cups of feed, and in the afternoon, she gives 25 cups of feed. So, the total feed given in the morning and afternoon is:

\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

The total feed given in the morning and afternoon is 40 cups. Since the total feed required for the day is 60 cups, the amount of feed needed for the final meal is:

\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:

\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of 16 glasses, considering the pricing structure.

1. The first glass costs $5.
2. Every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $5 * 0.60 = $3.

So, for every pair of glasses, the cost is $5 + $3 = $8.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can pair them up into 8 pairs (16 / 2 = 8).

The total cost for 8 pairs is 8 * $8 = $64.

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses.

\[
\boxed{64}
\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of sheep in each city based on the given relationships and the number of sheep in Seattle.

1. Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. Therefore, Charleston has \(4 \times 20 = 80\) sheep.
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Therefore, Toulouse has \(2 \times 80 = 160\) sheep.

Now, we sum the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle:
\[160 + 80 + 20 = 260\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{260}

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the time taken for each part of the download.

1. **First 40% of the download:**
   - The file size is 200 GB.
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 0.40 \times 200 = 80 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) minutes.

2. **Windows update installation:**
   - This takes 20 minutes.

3. **Restarting the download:**
   - After the update, Carla has to start the download from the beginning.
   - The remaining 60% of the file is \( 0.60 \times 200 = 120 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 120 GB is \( \frac{120}{2} = 60 \) minutes.

Adding these times together:
- Time for the first 40%: 40 minutes
- Time for the update installation: 20 minutes
- Time for the restart and download of the remaining 60%: 60 minutes

Total time = \( 40 + 20 + 60 = 120 \) minutes.

The final numerical answer is 120 minutes."
"To determine how far John is from home at the end of 4 hours, we need to break down his journey into segments and calculate the distance for each segment.

1. **First Segment:**
   - Time: 3 hours
   - Speed: 60 mph
   - Distance: \(3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ mph} = 180 \text{ miles}\)

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Time: 2 hours (in traffic)
   - Speed: 0 mph
   - Distance: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 0 \text{ mph} = 0 \text{ miles}\)

3. **Third Segment:**
   - Time: 0.5 hours
   - Speed: 30 mph
   - Distance: \(0.5 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ miles}\)

4. **Fourth Segment:**
   - Time: 3.5 hours (since the total time is 4 hours and the first 2 hours were in traffic)
   - Speed: 80 mph
   - Distance: \(3.5 \text{ hours} \times 80 \text{ mph} = 280 \text{ miles}\)

Now, we sum up the distances from all segments to find the total distance traveled:
\[180 \text{ miles} + 0 \text{ miles} + 15 \text{ miles} + 280 \text{ miles} = 475 \text{ miles}\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break it down into regular hours and overtime hours.

Eliza's regular rate is $10 per hour. For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
\[ 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \]

For the overtime hours, she works 5 hours over the regular 40 hours. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate:
\[ 1.2 \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$12/\text{hour} \]
So, her earnings for the 5 overtime hours are:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

Adding the earnings from regular hours and overtime hours gives us her total earnings for the week:
\[ \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$460 \]"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the number of downloads for each month and then sum them up.

1. **First Month Downloads:**
   The program had 60 downloads in the first month.

2. **Second Month Downloads:**
   The number of downloads in the second month was three times the downloads in the first month.
   \[
   \text{Second Month Downloads} = 3 \times 60 = 180
   \]

3. **Third Month Downloads:**
   The number of downloads in the third month was reduced by 30% from the second month.
   \[
   \text{Reduction} = 30\% \text{ of } 180 = 0.30 \times 180 = 54
   \]
   \[
   \text{Third Month Downloads} = 180 - 54 = 126
   \]

4. **Total Downloads Over Three Months:**
   \[
   \text{Total Downloads} = \text{First Month Downloads} + \text{Second Month Downloads} + \text{Third Month Downloads}
   \]

"To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money from the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point at which this profit becomes positive.

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:
- Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons.
- Each lemon is sold for $1.5.
- Therefore, the annual revenue from lemons is \(7 \times 1.5 = 10.5\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the annual cost of maintaining the tree:
- The cost to water and feed the tree is $3 per year.

Now, we can find the net profit each year by subtracting the annual cost from the annual revenue:
- Net profit per year = Annual revenue - Annual cost
- Net profit per year = \(10.5 - 3 = 7.5\) dollars.

Carlos starts earning money when the net profit becomes positive. Since the initial cost to plant the tree is $90, we need to determine how many years it will take for the net profit to cover this initial cost.

Let \(n\) be the number of years it takes to earn back the initial cost. The total net profit after \(n\) years is \(7.5n\). We set this equal to the initial cost to find \(n\):
\[7.5n = 90\]

Solving for \(n\):
\[n = \frac{90}{7.5} = 12\]

Therefore, it will take 12 years before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had as \( x \).

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

3. She then sold half of what was left at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]

4. According to the problem, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

Let's simplify the equation step by step:
\[
\frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
\]
\[
\frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2x}{3} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 = 5
\]
\[
\frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{x}{3} + 1 = 5
\]
\[
\frac{2x - x}{3} - 1 = 5
\]
\[
\frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5
\]
\[
\frac{x}{3} = 6
\]
\[
x = 18
\]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{18}

"First, let's calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we have:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after those who enrolled in contemporary dance have been accounted for:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Now, 25% of these remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Finally, the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is the remaining students after those who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance have been accounted for:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance, we calculate:

\[ \frac{12}{20} \times 100\% = 0.60 \times 100\% = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the entire students that enrolled in hip-hop dance is 60%."
"To determine which purchase plan maximizes profit, we need to calculate the future value of each item based on the expected market growth and then compare the profit from each.

For the jewelry:
- Current value: $5,000
- Expected growth: 2.5%
- Future value of jewelry = $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,000 * 1.025 = $5,125

For the electronic gadgets:
- Current value: $8,000
- Expected growth: 1.2%
- Future value of electronic gadgets = $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,000 * 1.012 = $8,096

Now, we calculate the profit for each option:
- Profit from jewelry = Future value of jewelry - Current value of jewelry = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets = Future value of electronic gadgets - Current value of electronic gadgets = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Comparing the profits:
- Profit from jewelry: $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets: $96

The merchant would maximize profit by choosing to purchase the jewelry, which would result in a profit of $125.

Final numerical answer:
125"

"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to break down her earnings from both teaching and coaching.

First, let's calculate her annual earnings from teaching:
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual teaching hours = 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year
Annual teaching earnings = 1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her annual earnings from coaching:
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual coaching hours = 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year
Annual coaching earnings = 750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year

Now, we add her annual earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:
Annual salary = Annual teaching earnings + Annual coaching earnings
Annual salary = $35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

The final numerical answer is $57,500."

"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time Marissa wants to spend hiking.
2. Determine the distance she has already hiked.
3. Calculate the remaining distance.
4. Determine the required speed for the remaining distance.

First, let's calculate the total time Marissa wants to spend hiking. Since her average speed should be 4 miles per hour, and she wants to hike a total of 12 miles, the total time \( T \) she wants to spend hiking is:
\[ T = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we determine the distance she has already hiked. She has walked 4 miles in 1 hour and another 2 miles in another hour, so the distance she has already hiked is:
\[ 4 \text{ miles} + 2 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

The remaining distance is:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we need to find the speed \( v \) she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in the remaining 2 hours (since she has already spent 2 hours hiking the first 6 miles):
\[ v = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 3 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, let's determine the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink. Since two-thirds of the orange drink is water, we calculate:

\[
\text{Water in orange drink} = \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters}
\]

Next, let's determine the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since three-fifths of the pineapple drink is water, we calculate:

\[
\text{Water in pineapple drink} = \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = \frac{45}{5} = 9 \text{ liters}
\]

After spilling one liter of the orange drink, the amount of orange drink left is:

\[
10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters}
\]

The total amount of water in the remaining mixture is the sum of the water from the orange drink and the pineapple drink:

\[
\text{Total water} = \frac{20}{3} + 9 = \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3} \approx 15.67 \text{ liters}
\]

The total volume of the mixture after spilling one liter of the orange drink is:

\[
9 + 15 = 24 \text{ liters}
\]

Therefore, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{47}{3}}

- The first 3 customers each bought 1 DVD, so that's \(3 \times 1 = 3\) DVDs.
- The next 2 customers each bought 2 DVDs, so that's \(2 \times 2 = 4\) DVDs.
- The last 3 customers did not buy any DVDs, so that's \(3 \times 0 = 0\) DVDs.

Adding these together, the total number of DVDs sold is \(3 + 4 + 0 = 7\).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
7"
"To determine how many centimeters shorter the candle will be after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, we first need to calculate the total time the candle burns.

The time from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is 4 hours.

Given that the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we can calculate the total melting over 4 hours as follows:
\[ \text{Total melting} = \text{Rate of melting} \times \text{Time} = 2 \, \text{cm/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 8 \, \text{cm} \]

Therefore, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the original price of the book, we need to understand that Kyle paid 75% of the original price (since he got a 25% discount). Let's denote the original price by \( P \). Therefore, we have:

\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we need to solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's perform the division:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was \( 26 \).

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 26 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered except for the boxes of pizza.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
The cost of 4 apples is \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Adding these together gives:
\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\] dollars.

Marie paid a total of $50. If we subtract the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples from the total amount paid, we can find out how much she spent on the boxes of pizza:
\[50 - 33 = 17\] dollars.

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, we can determine the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered by dividing the amount spent on pizza by the cost per box:
\[17 \div 8.50 = 2\] boxes.

Therefore, the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"To find out how much Mishka spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of each type of clothing item and then sum them up.

The cost of the shorts is:
\[ 3 \text{ pairs} \times \$16.50 \text{ per pair} = 3 \times 16.50 = \$49.50 \]

The cost of the pants is:
\[ 3 \text{ pairs} \times \$22.50 \text{ per pair} = 3 \times 22.50 = \$67.50 \]

The cost of the shoes is:
\[ 3 \text{ pairs} \times \$42 \text{ per pair} = 3 \times 42 = \$126 \]

Now, we sum up the costs of all the items:
\[ \$49.50 + \$67.50 + \$126 = \$243 \]

So, Mishka spent a total of:
\[ \$243 \]"
"To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of servings she will consume and then find out the total cost based on the price per carton.

First, calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days:
\[ \text{Total servings} = 60 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ serving/day} = 60 \text{ servings} \]

Next, determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need. Since each carton contains 15 servings:
\[ \text{Number of cartons} = \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

Now, calculate the total cost for 4 cartons of ice cream. Each carton costs $4.00:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 4 \text{ cartons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To determine how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to calculate the distance from his first stop to his second stop.

Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, so the distance from the start to his first stop is 20 miles.

His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip is 60 miles, the distance to his second stop is:
\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \text{ miles} \]

The distance between his first and second stops is the difference between the distance to his second stop and the distance to his first stop:
\[ 45 - 20 = 25 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the number of miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

The cost of the first pair of high heels is $33. The cost of the second pair of high heels is twice the cost of the first pair, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = 104 \]

So, the cost of the boots is \( 104 \) dollars.

\[
\boxed{104}
\]"
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the ages of Darrell and Allen in terms of a variable. Let Darrell's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a positive integer. According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

To find the value of \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen. Darrell's age is \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\) and Allen's age is \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\).

Next, we need to find Allen's age 10 years from now. Adding 10 years to Allen's current age, we get:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"To find the average guess, we first need to determine each friend's guess and then calculate the average.

1. The first friend's guess is 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half the first friend's guess:
   \[
   \text{Second friend's guess} = \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60
   \]
3. The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess:
   \[
   \text{Third friend's guess} = 80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100
   \]

Now, we calculate the average of these guesses:
\[
\text{Average guess} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
80

"To determine how many hours a week John spends taking care of the dogs, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. First, calculate the total hours John spends on one dog per day:
   \[
   0.5 \text{ hours/dog/day}
   \]

2. Next, calculate the total hours John spends on all 10 dogs per day:
   \[
   0.5 \text{ hours/dog/day} \times 10 \text{ dogs} = 5 \text{ hours/day}
   \]

3. Finally, calculate the total hours John spends on all 10 dogs per week. Assuming there are 7 days in a week:
   \[
   5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week}
   \]

So, the total number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs in a week is:
\[
\boxed{35}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these as the following equations:
\[ G + S = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins \( S \) is 40, we can find the number of gold coins \( G \) using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 70 \]"
"First, let's determine how many jewels Aaron has. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Since Raymond has 40 jewels, we can calculate half of Raymond's jewels as follows:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Now, we add 5 to this number to find out how many jewels Aaron has:

\[
20 + 5 = 25
\]

Next, we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. The problem states that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Since Aaron has 25 jewels, we subtract 2 from this number to find out how many jewels Siobhan has:

\[
25 - 2 = 23
\]

Therefore, the number of jewels Siobhan has is:

\[
\boxed{23}
\]"
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points he scores in the second 20 minutes, we calculate 25% of 4 points and add it to the original 4 points:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]
So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \text{ points} \]

Adding the points from both periods, the total number of points Mike scored is:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
2. Determine how many sets of 4 yogurts are needed to meet this number.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the price per set.

First, let's find out how many yogurts Terry eats in 30 days:
\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost. Since each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00:
\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times 5 \text{ dollars/set} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days is:
\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John makes from selling his lego sets. He has 13 lego sets and sells each for $15.

\[
13 \text{ lego sets} \times 15 \text{ dollars/lego set} = 195 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, let's determine how much money John spends on the video games. He buys 8 video games for $20 each.

\[
8 \text{ video games} \times 20 \text{ dollars/video game} = 160 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we can find out how much money John has left after buying the video games. We know he has $5 left after these purchases.

\[
195 \text{ dollars} - 160 \text{ dollars} = 35 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since the problem states that John has $5 left after buying the video games, we can verify that the remaining $5 is indeed the difference between the money he made from selling the lego sets and the money he spent on the video games.

Finally, we need to determine how many lego sets John still has. Since he sold all 13 lego sets, he does not have any lego sets left.

\[
\text{Number of lego sets left} = 13 - 13 = 0
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{0}
\]"
"To find out how fast John runs, we need to determine the total distance he covers in a week and the total time he spends running.

First, let's calculate the total distance John runs in a week:
- John runs 60 miles in total.
- He runs 3 days a week.

Next, let's calculate the time he spends running each day:
- On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
- On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours each day.

Now, let's calculate the total time he spends running in a week:
- Total time = Time on the first day + Time on the second day + Time on the third day
- Total time = 3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 6 hours

To find his speed, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how far Dana can travel in six hours given her running, walking, and skipping speeds, and the time she spends on each activity.

First, let's find Dana's walking speed. We know that her skipping speed is half her running speed, and she skips at 3 miles per hour. Therefore, her running speed is:
\[ \text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine the time she spends running and walking. Since she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, and the total time is six hours, we can calculate the time spent on each activity:
\[ \text{Time spent running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Time spent walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the distance she can travel by running and walking:
\[ \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time spent running} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time spent walking} \]

To find the walking speed, we use the fact that her walking speed is four times her walking speed, and her running speed is six miles per hour. Since her running speed is six miles per hour, her walking speed is:
\[ \text{Walking speed} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now we can calculate the distance she can walk in four hours:
\[ \text{Distance walking} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, we add the distances she can travel by running and walking to find the total distance:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance walking} = 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"

2. Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone. Therefore, Ben's iPhone is \(2 \times 1 = 2\) years old.
3. Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) years old.

The final numerical answer is 8."
"First, let's determine how far Polly can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone. We know that without the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet. When holding the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther. Therefore, the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone is:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's breath can reach up to 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance Polly can throw the javelin:

\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 200 \]"
"Grandma Jones had a total of 5 apple pies, each cut into 8 pieces. Therefore, the total number of pieces of pie initially was:

\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

"First, let's determine the number of calories left for the day. The daily calorie target is 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories. Therefore, the remaining calories you can consume are:

\[ 2000 - 1800 = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories are in one serving of the bag of chips. According to the nutritional info, one serving has 250 calories. Since a 300g bag contains 5 servings, we can calculate the number of servings in the entire bag:

\[ \frac{300 \text{ grams}}{5 \text{ servings}} = 60 \text{ grams per serving} \]

Now, we need to determine how many servings of chips you can eat with the remaining 200 calories. We do this by dividing the remaining calories by the calories per serving:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories per serving}} = 0.8 \text{ servings} \]

Since each serving is 60 grams, we can find out how many grams you can eat by multiplying the number of servings by the grams per serving:

\[ 0.8 \text{ servings} \times 60 \text{ grams per serving} = 48 \text{ grams} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 48 \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of making the candles. Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax and wicks for every 10 candles. For 20 candles, he will need 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks. Given that the cost for 1 pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.00, the cost for 2 pounds will be:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pound} = \$20.00 \]

Next, we calculate the revenue from selling the candles. If Charlie sells each candle for $2.00 and he makes 20 candles, the total revenue will be:

\[ 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00 \text{ per candle} = \$40.00 \]

Now, to find the net profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00 \]

So, the net profit if Charlie makes and sells 20 candles is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of articles written on each day.
2. Calculate the total number of hours spent writing articles over the three days.

**Step 1: Determine the number of articles written on each day.**

- **Monday:** Meredith wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday:** She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles on Tuesday.
- **Wednesday:** She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. This means she wrote \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles on Wednesday.

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of hours spent writing articles over the three days.**

- **Monday:** \( 5 \) articles \(\times 4 \) hours/article = \( 20 \) hours.
- **Tuesday:** \( 7 \) articles \(\times 4 \) hours/article = \( 28 \) hours.
- **Wednesday:** \( 14 \) articles \(\times 4 \) hours/article = \( 56 \) hours.

Now, sum the hours spent over the three days:

The total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days is \(\boxed{104}\)."
"To determine how many Post-it notes were in the package that Candice purchased, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of Post-it notes used at work.
2. Determine the total number of Post-it notes before and after the purchase.
3. Calculate the number of Post-it notes in the package purchased.

First, Candice used 220 Post-it notes at work. She started with 80 Post-it notes and had 23 remaining after placing them on the coffee cups. Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased as \( x \).

The total number of Post-it notes before the purchase was 80, and after purchasing \( x \) more, she had 23 left. Therefore, the total number of Post-it notes she had before using them at work was \( 80 + x \). After using 220 Post-it notes, she had 23 left, so the equation is:
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package that she purchased is \(\boxed{163}\)."
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Given that each blue tie costs $40 and he spent a total of $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of each red tie. Since red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, the cost of each red tie is:

\[ \text{Cost per red tie} = \text{Cost per blue tie} + 0.5 \times \text{Cost per blue tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60 \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

Finally, the total amount John spent on ties is the sum of the cost of the blue ties and the cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total spent on ties} = \text{Total spent on blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 800 \]"

So, the total length of the wire in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 6-inch pieces can be cut from the 48-inch wire. We do this by dividing the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, the number of pieces Tracy obtained is:
\[ 8 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of units in the building. The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units. Therefore, the total number of units is:

\[ 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units/floor} = 120 \text{ units} \]

Next, we need to find out how many units are occupied. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is:

\[ 120 \text{ units} \times \frac{3}{4} = 90 \text{ units} \]

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

\[ 120 \text{ units} - 90 \text{ units} = 30 \text{ units} \]

So, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is:

\[ 30 \]"
"To determine how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs produced per week.
2. Convert the weekly egg count into dozens.
3. Calculate the weekly revenue from selling the eggs.

First, we calculate the number of eggs produced per week:
\[ 252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Next, we convert the weekly egg count into dozens. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen:
\[ \frac{1764 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 147 \text{ dozen} \]

Finally, we calculate the weekly revenue from selling the eggs at $2 per dozen:
\[ 147 \text{ dozen} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 294 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, Lloyd makes \(\boxed{294}\) dollars on eggs per week."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Tom to travel back from his destination. However, the question does not specify the distance he traveled to get to his destination. Without this information, we cannot calculate the time it takes for him to travel back.

"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, and he removes 30 comic books.

\[ \text{Total weight of comic books} = 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. So, the remaining weight that needs to be removed is:

\[ \text{Remaining weight to be removed} = 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[ \text{Number of toys to be removed} = \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 15 \]"
"To determine the day with the higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for Thursday and Friday separately.

**Thursday:**
- Revenue from truck tires: \(6 \text{ tires} \times \$60 \text{ per tire} = \$360\)
- Revenue from car tires: \(4 \text{ tires} \times \$40 \text{ per tire} = \$160\)
- Total revenue on Thursday: \(\$360 + \$160 = \$520\)

**Friday:**
- Revenue from car tires: \(12 \text{ tires} \times \$40 \text{ per tire} = \$480\)
- Revenue from truck tires: \(0 \text{ tires} \times \$60 \text{ per tire} = \$0\)
- Total revenue on Friday: \(\$480 + \$0 = \$480\)

Now, we compare the total revenues:
- Thursday's revenue: \$520
- Friday's revenue: \$480

The difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday is:
\[ \$520 - \$480 = \$40 \]

The day with the higher revenue is Thursday, and the difference in revenue is \$40.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has.

First, we know that the two house cats, Patchy and Trixie, have had kittens. According to the information provided:
- Patchy has had thrice the number of adopted kittens.
- Trixie has had 12 kittens.

Let's denote the number of adopted kittens as \( x \). Therefore, Patchy has had \( 3x \) kittens.

Given that Trixie has had 12 kittens, we can set up the equation:
\[ 3x = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

So, Patchy has had \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) kittens.

Now, we add the number of adopted kittens to the number of kittens from the house cats:
- Adopted kittens: 7
- Kittens from Patchy: 12
- Kittens from Trixie: 12

Total number of kittens:
\[ 7 + 12 + 12 = 31 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payment into two halves of the year and then sum them up.

1. **First Half of the Year:**
   - The streaming service charges $140 per month.
   - There are 6 months in the first half of the year.
   - Total cost for the first half: \( 140 \times 6 = 840 \) dollars.

2. **Second Half of the Year:**
   - The service charges 10% less than the initial amount.
   - The reduced monthly charge: \( 140 - (140 \times 0.10) = 140 - 14 = 126 \) dollars.
   - There are also 6 months in the second half of the year.
   - Total cost for the second half: \( 126 \times 6 = 756 \) dollars.

3. **Total Cost for the Year:**
   - Sum of the costs for both halves: \( 840 + 756 = 1596 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is **1596 dollars**."
"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to calculate how much gas she has used and how much gas is left in her tank.

Sophia has used 4 gallons of gas to travel 100 miles. This means that the gas consumption rate is 100 miles per 4 gallons, or 25 miles per gallon.

The tank holds 12 gallons of gas. Since she has already used 4 gallons, the remaining gas in the tank is:
\[ 12 \text{ gallons} - 4 \text{ gallons} = 8 \text{ gallons} \]

To find out how many miles she can drive with the remaining 8 gallons of gas, we use the gas consumption rate of 25 miles per gallon:
\[ 8 \text{ gallons} \times 25 \text{ miles per gallon} = 200 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Sophia can drive 200 miles on a single tank of gas."
"First, let's determine how long Jim spends on TV and reading in one session. 

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV. He then reads for half as long as he watches TV, which is:
\[ \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, in one session, he spends:
\[ 2 \text{ hours (TV)} + 1 \text{ hour (reading)} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours he spends on TV and reading in one week. Since he does this 3 times a week:
\[ 3 \text{ hours/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week} \]

Finally, to find out how many hours he spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly total by 4:

"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food required for the first 180 days and then for the rest of the puppy's life within the first year.

First, calculate the amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days:
\[ 1 \text{ cup/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to determine how many days are left in the first year after the first 180 days. Since there are 365 days in a year:
\[ 365 \text{ days} - 180 \text{ days} = 185 \text{ days} \]

For the remaining 185 days, the puppy will be fed 2 cups of dog food per day:
\[ 2 \text{ cups/day} \times 185 \text{ days} = 370 \text{ cups} \]

Now, add the dog food required for the first 180 days and the remaining 185 days:

\[
\text{Laundry done by David} = \frac{400 \text{ pounds}}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to find out how much laundry Raymond does. The problem states that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. Therefore, we can calculate the amount of laundry Raymond does by dividing the amount Sarah does by 2:

\[
\text{Laundry done by Raymond} = \frac{400 \text{ pounds}}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we need to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Laundry done by Raymond} - \text{Laundry done by David} = 200 \text{ pounds} - 100 \text{ pounds} = 100 \text{ pounds}

"To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in both ways and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost if Vincent buys flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50:
- Each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50.
- To find out how many packages of 3 flowers are needed to get 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 3: \(18 \div 3 = 6\).
- Therefore, the cost for 18 flowers in packages of 3 is \(6 \times 2.50 = 15\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Vincent buys flowers in packages of 2 for $1:
- Each package of 2 flowers costs $1.
- To find out how many packages of 2 flowers are needed to get 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 2: \(18 \div 2 = 9\).
- Therefore, the cost for 18 flowers in packages of 2 is \(9 \times 1 = 9\) dollars.

Now, we compare the two costs:
- The cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 is $15.
- The cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 is $9.
- The difference in cost is \(15 - 9 = 6\) dollars.

Thus, Vincent saves 6 dollars by buying 18 flowers at the better price. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of games they lost as \( L \). According to the problem, the number of games they won is \( L + 8 \). The total number of games played is the sum of the games won and the games lost, which is given as 22. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ L + (L + 8) = 22 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Next, we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( L \):

\[ 2L = 14 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( L \):

\[ L = 7 \]

So, the number of games they lost is 7. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is:

\[ 7 + 8 = 15 \]

Thus, the number of games they won is \(\boxed{15}\)."

"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Sylvie's initial salary, which is $600.
2. Calculate the increase in her salary after 5 years of service, which is 10% of her initial salary.
3. Add this increase to her initial salary to get her new salary after 5 years.
4. Since the company policy only applies to those who have stayed for 5 years, Sylvie's salary will not increase further after this period.

Let's calculate the increase in her salary:
\[ \text{Increase} = 10\% \times 600 = 0.10 \times 600 = 60 \]

Now, add this increase to her initial salary:
\[ \text{New Salary} = 600 + 60 = 660 \]

Since Sylvie has already stayed for 5 years and the policy only applies to those who have stayed for 5 years, her salary will remain at $660 for the next three years.

"To solve this problem, let's define the ages of the kids using variables based on the information given:

- Let \( J \) be Jackson's age.
- Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Amy's age is \( J + 5 \).
- Amy is also 2 years younger than Corey, so Corey's age is \( J + 5 + 2 = J + 7 \).
- James is 10 years old and 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey's age is \( 10 + 1 = 11 \).

Since Corey's age is 11, we can set up the equation:
\[ J + 7 = 11 \]

Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 11 - 7 \]
\[ J = 4 \]

So, Jackson is 4 years old.

Given that 2/5 of the 200 students are boys, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:
\[ \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

Since the rest of the students are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. Given that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout, we can calculate the number of girls in the girl scout as:
\[ \text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[ \text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 40 \]"
"First, we need to determine how many hours James slept. Since James slept only \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what Harry slept, we calculate:

\[ \text{Hours James slept} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we find out how many more hours Harry slept than James by subtracting the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:

\[ \text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the volume of tomatoes before cooking:**
   - Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces.
   - Since the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked, the original volume of tomatoes before cooking was twice the volume of the sauce.
   - Therefore, the original volume of tomatoes was \( 32 \times 2 = 64 \) ounces.

2. **Determine the number of tomatoes:**
   - Each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes.
   - To find out how many 16-ounce cans are needed to make 64 ounces of tomatoes, we divide the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of one can.
   - The number of 16-ounce cans needed is \( \frac{64}{16} = 4 \) cans.
   - Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes is \( 4 \times 3 = 12 \).

Thus, Freda used 12 tomatoes.

The final numerical answer is:
12"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Initially, there were 30 cars on the motorway.
- 5 cars exited the motorway, so the number of cars remaining on the motorway after the exits is \(30 - 5 = 25\) cars.
- In the remaining 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through the traffic jam.
- Let \(x\) be the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes.

Since the 25 cars remaining on the motorway after the exits are the ones that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes plus the 20 cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

Solving for \(x\):
\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

The final numerical answer is:
5"
"First, let's calculate the total number of potted plants Mary currently has. She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so:

\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Mary received 18 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery, so the total number of potted plants she has now is:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants} \]

Tomorrow, Mary will give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family. Therefore, the number of plants she will give away is:

\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Subtracting the number of plants she will give away from the total number of plants she has now, we get the number of potted plants Mary will remain with:

\[ 98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 58 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of doorbell rings made by each friend and then sum them up.

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. Therefore, the second friend pressed the doorbell \(20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25\) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. Therefore, the third friend pressed the doorbell \(60 + 10 = 70\) times.

Now, we sum the doorbell rings from all four friends:
\[20 + 25 + 60 + 70 = 175\]

The total number of doorbell rings is \(\boxed{175}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of pages Solo needs to read:

- Science: 4 pages
- Social Studies: 20 pages
- History: 7 pages
- Geography: 8 pages

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday. Therefore, the remaining pages he needs to read are:

Remaining pages = Total pages - Pages read on Monday
Remaining pages = 39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read, on average, in one day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days left:

Pages per day = Remaining pages / Number of days left
Pages per day = 24 / 4 = 6 pages

So, Solo needs to read, on average, 6 pages per day."
"To determine how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to break down his water consumption by weekdays and weekends.

First, let's calculate the number of glasses of water John drinks on a weekday:
- John drinks 1 glass of water with breakfast.
- John drinks 1 glass of water with lunch.
- John drinks 1 glass of water with dinner.
- John drinks 1 glass of water before bed.

So, on a weekday, John drinks \(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4\) glasses of water.

Since there are 5 weekdays in a week, the total number of glasses of water John drinks on weekdays is:
\[ 4 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ glasses} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of glasses of water John drinks on a weekend day:
- John drinks 1 glass of water with dinner.

So, on a weekend day, John drinks \(1\) glass of water.

Since there are 2 weekend days in a week, the total number of glasses of water John drinks on weekends is:
\[ 1 \text{ glass/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 2 \text{ glasses} \]

Finally, to find the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we add the glasses consumed on weekdays and weekends:
\[ 20 \text{ glasses} + 2 \text{ glasses} = 22 \text{ glasses} \]

Thus, the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is:
\[ \boxed{22} \]"
"To determine how many minutes it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total distance the fog bank needs to cover:**
   The city is 42 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge.

2. **Determine the rate at which the fog bank covers the city:**
   The fog bank covers every 3 miles in 10 minutes.

3. **Calculate the number of 3-mile segments in the 42-mile city:**
   \[
   \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/segment}} = 14 \text{ segments}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total time required to cover all segments:**
   Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each 3-mile segment, the total time for 14 segments is:
   \[
   14 \text{ segments} \times 10 \text{ minutes/segment} = 140 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Therefore, the fog bank will take 140 minutes to cover the whole city.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total number of pieces**: 1000

2. **Pieces placed by Poppy**: A quarter of the total pieces.
   \[
   \text{Pieces placed by Poppy} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250
   \]

3. **Remaining pieces after Poppy**: Subtract the pieces placed by Poppy from the total.
   \[
   \text{Remaining pieces} = 1000 - 250 = 750
   \]

4. **Pieces placed by Poppy's mom**: A third of the remaining pieces.
   \[
   \text{Pieces placed by mom} = \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250
   \]

5. **Remaining pieces after mom**: Subtract the pieces placed by mom from the remaining pieces after Poppy.
   \[
   \text{Remaining pieces} = 750 - 250 = 500
   \]

Therefore, the number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed is 500."
"If Amir eats 5 cookies, and Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir, then Cody eats \(3 \times 5 = 15\) cookies.

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to determine the inner dimensions of a single box and then calculate its volume. After that, we can multiply by 3 to get the total volume.

The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, the inner dimensions of each box are:
- Length: \(5 - 2 \times 1 = 3\) inches
- Width: \(6 - 2 \times 1 = 4\) inches
- Height: \(4 - 2 \times 1 = 2\) inches

The volume of one inner box is:
\[ \text{Volume of one box} = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume is:
\[ \text{Total inner volume} = 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ cubic inches} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 72 \]"
"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we can first calculate the total hours he watched TV from Monday to Friday and then subtract the hours he watched on the other days.

From Monday to Tuesday, he watched:
\[ 1 \text{ hour/night} \times 2 \text{ nights} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

On Wednesday, he watched:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \]

On Thursday, he watched:
\[ 1 \text{ hour} + 0.5 \text{ hours} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \]

On Friday, he watched:
\[ 1 \text{ hour/episode} \times 2 \text{ episodes} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we sum up the hours watched from Monday to Friday:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} + 0.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. Therefore, the hours he watched on Wednesday are:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} - 6 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is:
\[ \frac{1 \text{ hour}}{0.5 \text{ hours/episode}} = 2 \text{ episodes} \]

So, the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry meant to bake as \( x \). According to the problem, he actually baked twice as many as he meant to, plus 15 more cookies. This can be expressed as:
\[ x + 15 \]

After baking, he drops 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has left is:
\[ (x + 15) - 5 = x + 10 \]

We are given that after dropping 5 cookies, he has a total of 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x + 10 = 110 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 110 - 10 \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, Henry meant to bake 100 cookies. Since he actually baked twice as many as he meant to, plus 15 more, we can verify:
\[ 2 \times 100 + 15 = 215 \]

However, the problem asks for the number of cookies he baked last year, which is the number he meant to bake, \( x \). Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas without any cashback:

\[ \text{Cost per gallon} = \$3.00 \]
\[ \text{Number of gallons} = 10 \]
\[ \text{Total cost without cashback} = 3.00 \times 10 = \$30.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cashback received for 10 gallons:

\[ \text{Cashback per gallon} = \$0.20 \]
\[ \text{Total cashback} = 0.20 \times 10 = \$2.00 \]

Now, let's subtract the total cashback from the total cost to find the final amount after cashback:

\[ \text{Final amount} = \$30.00 - \$2.00 = \$28.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$28.00 \]"
"To find the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate, we first need to calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups each of them had.

For Marcell:
- He had 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- Therefore, the total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell had is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

For Beatrice:
- She had 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- Therefore, the total number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice had is \(2 \times 24 = 48\).

Next, we find the total number of fruit roll-ups they both had together:
- Total = Marcell's total + Beatrice's total = \(42 + 48 = 90\).

To find the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate, we divide the total number of fruit roll-ups by the number of people (which is 2):
- Average = \(\frac{90}{2} = 45\).

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
45"
"First, let's determine the speed at which Julia rows the boat. It takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Therefore, her rowing speed is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet per second} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes her to row the entire 64 seconds distance to the shore:

\[ \text{Time to row 64 seconds} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds per 20 feet}} = 4 \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. To find out how much water the boat took on during the entire 80 feet row, we can set up the following proportion:

\[ \text{Water taken on} = \left( \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 80 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

So, the amount of water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To determine how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Number of Teachers**: There are 4 teachers.
2. **Lessons per Teacher per Day**: Each teacher has 2 lessons per day.
3. **Lessons per Day in Total**: Since there are 4 teachers and each has 2 lessons, the total number of lessons per day is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) lessons.
4. **Cleanings per Lesson**: The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson.
5. **Total Cleanings per Day**: To find the total number of cleanings in a day, we multiply the total number of lessons by the number of cleanings per lesson. This gives us \(8 \times 3 = 24\) cleanings.

Thus, the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day."

"To solve this problem, we need to work through the relationships given step by step.

1. **Determine the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold:**
   - Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
   - Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
   - Let \( B \) be the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold.
   - Therefore, \( 6B = 1800 \).
   - Solving for \( B \):
     \[
     B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300
     \]
   - So, Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs.

2. **Determine the number of birds in Jamal's photograph:**
   - The maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold (300) is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph.
   - Let \( N \) be the number of birds in Jamal's photograph.
   - Therefore, \( 300 = 50N \).
   - Solving for \( N \):
     \[
     N = \frac{300}{50} = 6
     \]
   - So, there are 6 birds in Jamal's photograph.

3. **Determine the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph:**
   - Jamal's photograph is of ducks at the zoo.
   - Since the photograph contains 6 birds, and assuming all birds are ducks (as no other type of bird is mentioned), the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is 6.

Thus, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the leftover lumber Sasha has:

- Ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards at $10 each: \(10 \times 10 = $100\)
- Five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at $16 each: \(5 \times 16 = $80\)

The total cost of the leftover lumber is: \(100 + 80 = $180\)

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the leftover lumber:

- Ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards at $15 each (assuming the price has increased by 50% from $10 to $15): \(10 \times 15 = $150\)
- Five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at $24 each (assuming the price has increased by 50% from $16 to $24): \(5 \times 24 = $120\)

The total revenue from selling the leftover lumber is: \(150 + 120 = $270\)

Finally, the profit Sasha makes is the total revenue minus the total cost:

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost = $270 - $180 = $90

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water, which is given as 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total number of parts in the ratio is 7 + 13 = 20 parts.

Katy used a total of 120 parts (teaspoons of sugar and cups of water combined). To find out how many parts correspond to the teaspoons of sugar, we can set up a proportion based on the ratio:

\[
\frac{7}{20} = \frac{\text{number of teaspoons of sugar}}{120}
\]

Let \( x \) be the number of teaspoons of sugar. Then,

\[
\frac{7}{20} = \frac{x}{120}
\]

To find \( x \), we can cross-multiply:

\[
7 \times 120 = 20 \times x
\]

\[
840 = 20x
\]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{840}{20} = 42

"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of vehicles initially imported.
2. Calculate the number of vehicles that were imported on the second day.
3. Determine the number of containers imported on the second day.

Initially, there were 2 containers, each with 5 vehicles:
\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles/container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

After the second day, the total number of vehicles became 30. Therefore, the number of vehicles imported on the second day is:
\[ 30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles} \]

Since each container has 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Lylah's salary four years ago.
2. Calculate Adrien's salary four years ago.
3. Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.
4. Calculate Lylah's salary four years later.
5. Sum the salaries of Adrien and Lylah four years later.

First, let's find Lylah's salary four years ago. We know that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. If Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, then:

\[ \text{Adrien's salary four years ago} = 1.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary four years ago} \]

\[ 40000 = 1.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary four years ago} \]

\[ \text{Lylah's salary four years ago} = \frac{40000}{1.30} \]

\[ \text{Lylah's salary four years ago} = 30769.23 \]

Next, we calculate Adrien's salary four years later. We know that his salary increased by 40% from four years ago:

\[ \text{Adrien's salary four years later} = 40000 \times 1.40 \]

\[ \text{Adrien's salary four years later} = 56000 \]

Now, we calculate Lylah's salary four years later. Since both salaries increased by the same percentage, Lylah's salary also increased by 40%:

\[ \text{Lylah's salary four years later} = 30769.23 \times 1.40 \]

\[ \text{Lylah's salary four years later} = 43076.92 \]

Finally, we sum the salaries of Adrien and Lylah four years later:

\[ \text{Total salary four years later} = 56000 + 43076.92 \]

\[ \text{Total salary four years later} = 99076.92 \]

Therefore, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is $99076.92."

"First, let's calculate the distance Rosie covers in the initial 3 hours at a speed of 10 miles per hour.

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

After the initial 3 hours, Rosie runs at a speed of 5 miles per hour for the remaining time. The remaining time is:

This means there are \( 60 - 20 = 40 \) letters still needing stamps.

Since there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters, and she had already stamped 20 of them, the number of letters that were in the pile when Jennie began is \( 30 - 20 = 10 \).

Therefore, the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began is 10."

   \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is \(\boxed{880}\)."
"To calculate the profit the hospital makes from these visits, we need to determine the revenue and the cost for each patient and then sum these over the number of patients seen in a day.

First, let's calculate the revenue from each patient:
- Each patient is seen for 24 minutes.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the fraction of an hour each patient is seen is \( \frac{24}{60} = 0.4 \) hours.

The doctors charge $150 per hour:
- Revenue from each patient = \( 0.4 \times 150 = 60 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost for each patient:
- The hospital charges $200 per hour.
- Cost for each patient = $200.

Now, we can calculate the profit for each patient:
- Profit per patient = Revenue - Cost = $60 - $200 = -$140.

Since the hospital sees 500 people a day, the total profit for the day is:
- Total profit = 500 patients \(\times\) (-$140) = -$70,000.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{-70000}
\]"
"Initially, Nissa hires 60 seasonal workers. A third of them quit after children vomit on them, which means \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) elves quit. So, the number of elves remaining is \( 60 - 20 = 40 \).

Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. Therefore, the number of elves left is \( 40 - 10 = 30 \).

The final numerical answer is 30."

"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many miles Walt walked on Tuesday.
2. Calculate the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday.
3. Subtract the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday from the total miles walked from Monday to Wednesday to find the miles walked on Wednesday.

First, we know that Walt walked 4 miles on Monday. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he did on Monday. Therefore, the miles walked on Tuesday are:
\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday:
\[ 4 \text{ miles (Monday)} + 24 \text{ miles (Tuesday)} = 28 \text{ miles} \]

We are given that the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we subtract the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday from the total miles walked from Monday to Wednesday:
\[ 41 \text{ miles (Monday through Wednesday)} - 28 \text{ miles (Monday through Tuesday)} = 13 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the number of miles Walt walked on Wednesday is:

Then, let's calculate the cost of the cookies:
\[ 2 \text{ cookies} \times \$1.00 \text{ per cookie} = \$2.00 \]

Now, let's add up the cost of the subs, chips, and cookies:
\[ \$15.00 + \$3.00 + \$2.00 = \$20.00 \]

Next, we need to add the 20% delivery fee. To find the delivery fee, we calculate 20% of the subtotal:
\[ 20\% \times \$20.00 = 0.20 \times \$20.00 = \$4.00 \]

Adding the delivery fee to the subtotal gives:
\[ \$20.00 + \$4.00 = \$24.00 \]

Finally, we add the $5.00 tip to the total:
\[ \$24.00 + \$5.00 = \$29.00 \]

So, the total cost of Rory's delivery order is:

"First, let's calculate how many questions Mark completed on each test based on the time he had to complete them.

For the first test:
- Mark had 8 hours to complete the test.
- He completed 5 questions per hour.
- Therefore, the number of questions he completed on the first test is \(8 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ questions/hour} = 40 \text{ questions}\).
- Since the test had 75 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete is \(75 - 40 = 35 \text{ questions}\).

For the second test:
- Mark had 6 hours to complete the test.
- He completed 5 questions per hour.
- Therefore, the number of questions he completed on the second test is \(6 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ questions/hour} = 30 \text{ questions}\).
- Since the test had 100 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete is \(100 - 30 = 70 \text{ questions}\).

Now, we sum the incomplete questions from both tests:
- Incomplete questions from the first test: 35
- Incomplete questions from the second test: 70
- Total incomplete questions: \(35 + 70 = 105\).

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine the number of semi-automatic cars. We know there are 20 cars in total, 12 of which are automatic and 4 are manual. The number of semi-automatic cars can be calculated by subtracting the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars:

\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = \text{Total cars} - \text{Automatic cars} - \text{Manual cars} \]
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 \]

Next, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total cars}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of the cars that are semi-automatic is 20%."
"Let's denote the number of queens as \( Q \), the number of baby bees as \( B \), and the number of worker bees as \( W \).

According to the problem:
1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so \( W = 2B \).
2. There are twice as many baby bees as queens, so \( B = 2Q \).

We also know the total number of bees is 700:
\[ W + B + Q = 700 \]

Substituting \( W = 2B \) and \( B = 2Q \) into the total bees equation:
\[ 2B + B + Q = 700 \]
\[ 3B + Q = 700 \]

Since \( B = 2Q \), we can substitute \( B \) with \( 2Q \) in the equation:
\[ 3(2Q) + Q = 700 \]
\[ 6Q + Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now, we can find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]
\[ W = 2B = 2 \times 200 = 400 \]

Therefore, the number of worker bees is:
\[ \boxed{400} \]"

"First, let's calculate the total cost of nonfood items before tax:

- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

Total cost of nonfood items = $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $15

Next, we calculate the tax on the nonfood items. The tax rate is 10%, so the tax amount is:

Tax amount = 10% of $15 = 0.10 * $15 = $1.50

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of the nonfood items to get the final cost:

Final cost = Total cost of nonfood items + Tax amount = $15 + $1.50 = $16.50

The final numerical answer is $16.50."

- Profit: $92 - $72 = $20

Therefore, the profit Lucas will make each week is $20."
"To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of harvests John can have in a year.
2. Determine the total number of pineapples harvested based on the number of harvests.

First, since John harvests his pineapples every 3 months, we need to find out how many 3-month periods there are in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests/year} \]

Next, we know that John has 100 pineapples per hectare and he has 10 hectares. Therefore, the total number of pineapples per harvest is:
\[ 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} \times 10 \text{ hectares} = 1000 \text{ pineapples/harvest} \]

Since John can harvest 1000 pineapples per harvest and he can do this 4 times in a year, the total number of pineapples he can harvest in a year is:
\[ 1000 \text{ pineapples/harvest} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours, let's break down the information given:

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, half as many bees as left in the first 6 hours return. So, \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees return.
3. In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as left in the first 6 hours leave. So, \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees leave.

Now, we need to calculate the number of bees that return in the last 6 hours. According to the problem, every bee that left before the last 6 hours returns to the hive in this period. The number of bees that left before the last 6 hours is the sum of the bees that left in the first 6 hours and the bees that left in the next 6 hours:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

First, let's convert the distance from miles to feet since the speeds are given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance: \(3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}\)
Tim's distance: \(2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}\)

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each to travel the distance.

Steve's time: \(\frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}\)
Tim's time: \(\frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

The winner is Steve, who takes 36 minutes to get home. The loser is Tim, who takes 40 minutes to get home. The difference in their travel times is:

"To calculate the total amount Shawnda made, we need to determine the cost of inflating the tires for each type of vehicle and then sum these costs.

1. For the bicycles: Each bicycle has 2 tires, and each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. Since 5 people came with bicycles, the total cost for the bicycles is:
   \[
   5 \text{ bicycles} \times 2 \text{ tires/bicycle} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 5 \times 2 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 250 \text{ cents}
   \]
   Converting cents to dollars:
   \[
   250 \text{ cents} = 2.50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. For the tricycles: Each tricycle has 3 tires, and each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. Since 3 people came with tricycles, the total cost for the tricycles is:
   \[
   3 \text{ tricycles} \times 3 \text{ tires/tricycle} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 3 \times 3 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 225 \text{ cents}
   \]
   Converting cents to dollars:
   \[
   225 \text{ cents} = 2.25 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. For the unicycle: A unicycle has 1 tire, and each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. Since 1 person came with a unicycle, the total cost for the unicycle is:
   \[
   1 \text{ unicycle} \times 1 \text{ tire/unicycle} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 1 \times 1 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 25 \text{ cents}

"Let's denote the initial number of french fries in the pack as \( x \).

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
4. After the pigeons, the number of fries left is \( x - 14 - 7 - 9 = x - 20 \).
5. The raccoon then ate two thirds of the remaining fries, so it ate \( \frac{2}{3}(x - 20) \) fries, leaving \( \frac{1}{3}(x - 20) \) fries.
6. An ant then ate the last remaining french fry, leaving 5 fries.

So, we have:
\[ \frac{1}{3}(x - 20) = 5 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x - 20 = 15 \]
\[ x = 35 \]

Therefore, the initial number of french fries in the pack was 35.

The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly class schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the hours for the Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:
- Kimo has 3 classes each day on these days.
- Each class is 1 hour long.
- Therefore, each of these days he spends \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours in class.

Since there are 3 such days in a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), the total hours for these days in one week is:
\[3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 9 \text{ hours/week}\]

Next, let's calculate the hours for the Tuesdays and Thursdays:
- Kimo has 2 classes each day on these days.
- Each class is 2 hours long.
- Therefore, each of these days he spends \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours in class.

Since there are 2 such days in a week (Tuesday and Thursday), the total hours for these days in one week is:
\[2 \text{ days} \times 4 \text{ hours/day} = 8 \text{ hours/week}\]

Now, we add the hours from both sets of days to get the total hours Kimo spends in class each week:
\[9 \text{ hours/week} + 8 \text{ hours/week} = 17 \text{ hours/week}\]

Finally, we multiply the weekly total by the number of weeks in the semester (16 weeks):
\[17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours}\]

Thus, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:
\[
\boxed{272}

"First, we need to convert all the lengths to the same unit for easier calculation. We will use inches for this problem.

Each roll is 4 inches long, and Bill bakes 300 rolls:
\[ 300 \text{ rolls} \times 4 \text{ inches/roll} = 1200 \text{ inches} \]

Each croissant is 6 inches long, and Bill bakes 120 croissants:
\[ 120 \text{ croissants} \times 6 \text{ inches/croissant} = 720 \text{ inches} \]

Each baguette is 2 feet long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is:
\[ 2 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 24 \text{ inches} \]
Bill bakes 60 baguettes:
\[ 60 \text{ baguettes} \times 24 \text{ inches/baguette} = 1440 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we add up the total length of all the baked goods in inches:
\[ 1200 \text{ inches} + 720 \text{ inches} + 1440 \text{ inches} = 3360 \text{ inches} \]

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[ \frac{3360 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 280 \text{ feet} \]

So, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is:
\[ \boxed{280} \]"
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order to last for 2 months, we first need to calculate the total number of bananas required by each type of ape per month and then for 2 months.

- Therefore, the total distance Blake runs is \(15 \times 200 = 3000\) yards.

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs:
- Kelly runs back and forth once to the 40-yard line and back, which is a total of 80 yards.
- She does this 34 times.
- Therefore, the total distance Kelly runs is \(34 \times 80 = 2720\) yards.

Now, we compare the distances:
- Blake runs 3000 yards.
- Kelly runs 2720 yards.

The difference in the distance they run is:
\[ 3000 - 2720 = 280 \text{ yards} \]

Thus, the winner (Blake) runs 280 yards farther than the loser (Kelly).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{280}

Adding these amounts together gives:
\[ \$6 + \$8 + \$20 = \$34 \]

So, the total amount Raphael spent is:
\[ \$34 \]"
"Initially, Finn sees 11 tadpoles swimming in the pond. Then, 6 tadpoles come out of hiding, so the number of tadpoles Finn can see increases to 11 + 6. After that, 2 tadpoles hide under a rock, so the number of tadpoles Finn can see decreases by 2.

Calculation:
11 + 6 - 2 = 15

Finn can see 15 tadpoles in the pond now."
"To find the water depth on Wednesday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the depth of the water on Tuesday.
2. Calculate the depth of the water on Wednesday based on the depth on Tuesday.

First, we know the depth of the water on Monday is 17 feet. On Tuesday, the depth increased by 7 feet:
\[ \text{Depth on Tuesday} = 17 + 7 = 24 \text{ feet} \]

Next, on Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday:
\[ \text{Depth on Wednesday} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ feet} \]

So, the tank’s water depth on Wednesday is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of each type of fish caught by Locsin based on the information given:

- Starfish: Anakin caught 10 starfish, so Locsin caught \(10 - 5 = 5\) starfish.
- Sea horses: Anakin caught 6 sea horses, so Locsin caught \(6 - 3 = 3\) sea horses.
- Clownfish: Anakin caught 3 clownfish, so Locsin caught \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin:

- Total starfish: \(10 + 5 = 15\)
- Total sea horses: \(6 + 3 = 9\)
- Total clownfish: \(3 + 5 = 8\)

Adding these together gives the total number of fish caught:

\[15 + 9 + 8 = 32\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{32}
\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the price increase step by step over the 36 months. The price increases by 20% every two months. Let's break it down:

1. **Initial Price**: $20
2. **Price after 2 months**: The price increases by 20% of $20.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 20 \times 0.20 = 4
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 20 + 4 = 24
   \]
3. **Price after 4 months**: The price increases by 20% of $24.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 24 \times 0.20 = 4.8
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 24 + 4.8 = 28.8
   \]
4. **Price after 6 months**: The price increases by 20% of $28.8.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 28.8 \times 0.20 = 5.76
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 28.8 + 5.76 = 34.56
   \]
5. **Price after 8 months**: The price increases by 20% of $34.56.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 34.56 \times 0.20 = 6.912
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 34.56 + 6.912 = 41.472
   \]
6. **Price after 10 months**: The price increases by 20% of $41.472.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 41.472 \times 0.20 = 8.2944
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 41.472 + 8.2944 = 49.7664
   \]
7. **Price after 12 months**: The price increases by 20% of $49.7664.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 49.7664 \times 0.20 = 9.95328
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 49.7664 + 9.95328 = 59.71968
   \]

We can see that the price increases by 20% every two months. To generalize this, we can use the formula for compound interest, where the price after \(n\) periods is given by:
\[
P_n = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n
\]
where \(P_0\) is the initial price, \(r\) is the rate of increase per period, and \(n\) is the number of periods.

Here, \(P_0 = 20\), \(r = 0.20\), and \(n = 18\) (since 36 months is 18 periods of 2 months each).

\[
P_{36} = 20 \times (1 + 0.20)^{18}
\]
\[
P_{36} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}
\]

Now, we calculate \((1.20)^{18}\):
\[
(1.20)^{18} \approx 10.488
\]

Thus,
\[
P_{36} = 20 \times 10.488 \approx 209.76
\]

Therefore, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is approximately \(\boxed{209.76}\)."
"First, let's determine the cost of one red car. We know that one red car costs $4. Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and an action figure costs $5, the cost of 3 action figures is:

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Therefore, the doll costs $15.

Next, we need to find the cost of one red car. We are given that one red car costs $4. Now, we can calculate the total cost of all the toys:

- The cost of 5 red cars is:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \]

- The cost of 3 action figures is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

- The cost of the doll is:
\[ 15 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost of all the toys:
\[ 20 + 15 + 15 = 50 \]

So, the total value of all the toys is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate the missed income if Jackie does her taxes herself. She would lose 3 hours of freelance work, and she earns $35 per hour from freelance work. Therefore, the missed income is:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105 \]

Next, we need to determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant. The accountant charges $90, which is the amount she would lose by doing her own taxes. Therefore, if she hires the accountant, she will have $90 more than if she did her own taxes.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the computer accessories Elvira bought:

- Screen: €157
- Keyboard and mouse: €74
- Scanner: €102
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Total cost of accessories = €157 + €74 + €102 + €74 + €102 = €509

Elvira's total budget is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost of the accessories from her budget:

Money left for clothing = €1500 - €509 = €991

So, the final numerical answer is:
€991"
"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit to make 15 Spanish flans, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs required.

Each Spanish flan requires 3 eggs. Therefore, for 15 flans, the total number of eggs needed is:
\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we know that Sandra receives 9 eggs each time she babysits. To find out how many times she needs to babysit to get 45 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she receives per babysitting session:
\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysittings} \]

Thus, Sandra has to babysit 5 times to gather enough eggs to make 15 Spanish flans. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \). According to the problem, Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write the first equation as:
\[ S = 2B \]

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write the second equation as:
\[ (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \]
Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ B + S + 4 = 28 \]
Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get:
\[ B + S = 24 \]

Now we substitute the expression for \( S \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ B + 2B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's current age is 8, we can find Seth's current age using the first equation:
\[ S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is currently 16 years old. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To find out how much money Jimmy has, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the amount of money Ethel has as \( E \) and the amount of money Jimmy has as \( J \).

According to the problem, Ethel has $8, so \( E = 8 \).

The problem states that Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has. This can be written as:
\[ J = 2E + 2 \]

Now, substituting the value of \( E \) into the equation:
\[ J = 2(8) + 2 \]
\[ J = 16 + 2 \]
\[ J = 18 \]

So, Jimmy has $18.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 18 \]"
"To calculate the total miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to consider his daily walking distance and the fact that he walks 10 miles on weekends.

From Monday to Friday, he walks 20 miles each day. So, for 5 days, he walks:
\[ 20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles} \]

On Saturday and Sunday, he walks 10 miles each day. So, for 2 days, he walks:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Adding the miles walked from Monday to Friday and the miles walked on the weekend gives us the total miles walked in a week:
\[ 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 120 \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of each item:
- The cost of the hat is $25.
- The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat, so it is \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.
- The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket. The average is calculated as \(\frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50\) dollars.

Now, we add up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform:
\[25 + 75 + 50 = 150\]

So, the total cost of each uniform is $150."
"To find the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to calculate the legs from each group of creatures separately and then sum them up.

For the spiders:
\[ 80 \text{ spiders} \times 8 \text{ legs per spider} = 640 \text{ legs} \]

For the insects:
\[ 90 \text{ insects} \times 6 \text{ legs per insect} = 540 \text{ legs} \]

For the rare mutant invertebrates:
\[ 3 \text{ invertebrates} \times 10 \text{ legs per invertebrate} = 30 \text{ legs} \]

Now, we add the legs from all groups together:
\[ 640 \text{ legs} + 540 \text{ legs} + 30 \text{ legs} = 1210 \text{ legs} \]

So, the total number of legs Jake sees is:
\[ 1210 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the ages of Sally Two, Granny Red, and Sally Four, and then sum these ages along with the age of the fourth bird, which is not specified but we can assume it's the same as the others for the purpose of this question.

Given:
- Sally Thirtytwo (S32) is 8 years old.
- Sally Four (S4) is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so S4 = 8 years old.
- Granny Red (GR) is two times as old as Sally Four, so GR = 2 * S4 = 2 * 8 = 16 years old.
- Sally Two (ST) is three years older than Granny Red, so ST = GR + 3 = 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we sum the ages of the four birds:
- Age of Sally Two: 19 years
- Age of Granny Red: 16 years
- Age of Sally Four: 8 years
- Age of the fourth bird (assuming it's the same as the others): 8 years

Total age = 19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 51 years

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much Jessica pays in a year if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we first need to calculate the total minimum monthly payments for all her debts.

The minimum monthly payments are:
- Student loans: $300
- Credit card: $200
- Mortgage: $500

The total minimum monthly payment is:
\[ 300 + 200 + 500 = 1000 \]

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. To find 50% more, we calculate 50% of the minimum monthly payment and add it to the minimum monthly payment:
\[ 1000 \times 0.50 = 500 \]
\[ 1000 + 500 = 1500 \]

So, Jessica pays $1500 per month. To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply her monthly payment by 12:
\[ 1500 \times 12 = 18000 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 18000 \]"
"To determine how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel and cut each potato and then multiply by the total number of potatoes.

First, let's calculate the time to peel and cut one potato:
- Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
- Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

Convert the time to peel one potato to seconds for easier calculation:
- 1.5 minutes = 1.5 * 60 seconds = 90 seconds

Now, add the time to peel and cut one potato:
- Total time for one potato = 90 seconds (peeling) + 5 seconds (cutting) = 95 seconds

Next, calculate the total time for 60 potatoes:
- Total time for 60 potatoes = 60 * 95 seconds

Perform the multiplication:
- 60 * 95 = 5700 seconds

Finally, convert the total time back to minutes:
- 5700 seconds = 5700 / 60 minutes = 95 minutes

Thus, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

\[
\boxed{95}

"First, let's calculate the total revenue from selling lemonade. They sell 20 glasses per gallon at $0.50 per glass, so the revenue per gallon is:
\[ 20 \text{ glasses/gallon} \times \$0.50/\text{glass} = \$10/\text{gallon} \]

Given that their profit is $25, we can express the profit as the total revenue minus the total cost. Let \( x \) be the number of gallons they made. The total revenue is \( \$10x \) and the total cost is the cost of lemons plus the cost of sugar. The cost of lemons is $3 per gallon and the cost of sugar is $2 per gallon, so the total cost is:
\[ (\$3 + \$2)x = \$5x \]

The profit is given by:
\[ \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = \$10x - \$5x = \$5x \]

We know the profit is $25, so:
\[ \$5x = \$25 \]
\[ x = \frac{\$25}{\$5} = 5 \]

They made 5 gallons of lemonade. The cost of lemons for 5 gallons is:
\[ \$3 \text{ per gallon} \times 5 \text{ gallons} = \$15 \]

So, the amount they spent on lemons is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we first need to determine the number of Chinese participants. Given that there are 240 Asians in total and 80 of them are Japanese, the number of Chinese participants is:

\[ 240 - 80 = 160 \]

We know that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. Therefore, the number of girls on the Chinese team can be found by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants:

\[ 160 - 60 = 100 \]

So, the number of girls on the Chinese team is 100."
"To determine how much money Zaid will have left after all his expenses and donations, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount spent on rent.
2. Calculate the amount spent on car fuel.
3. Determine the remaining amount after rent and car fuel.
4. Calculate the donation to charity.
5. Determine the remaining amount after the donation.
6. Subtract the amounts given to his daughter and wife from the remaining amount.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Calculate the amount spent on rent:**
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount spent on car fuel:**
   \[
   \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Determine the remaining amount after rent and car fuel:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining after rent and car fuel} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the donation to charity:**
   \[
   \text{Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}

"To determine the number of votes the loser received, we first need to calculate the number of votes the winner received. The winner got \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total votes. Given that the total number of votes cast was 80, we can calculate the number of votes the winner received as follows:

\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60
\]

Since the total number of votes cast is 80, the number of votes the loser received is the total number of votes minus the number of votes the winner received:

\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20
\]

Thus, the number of votes the loser got is:

\[
\boxed{20}

"Let's denote the number of white carnations Sandra ordered as \( w \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, so the number of red roses is \( 4w \).
2. Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which are five times the number of white carnations, so \( 200 = 5w \).

First, we solve for \( w \) using the equation \( 200 = 5w \):
\[
w = \frac{200}{5} = 40
\]

Now that we know \( w = 40 \), we can find the number of red roses:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Mark's age two years ago:**
   - Jan's current age is 30.
   - Two years ago, Jan was \(30 - 2 = 28\) years old.
   - Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time.
   - Half of Jan's age two years ago was \(\frac{28}{2} = 14\).
   - Therefore, Mark was \(14 + 5 = 19\) years old two years ago.

2. **Determine Mark's current age:**
   - Since Mark was 19 two years ago, his current age is \(19 + 2 = 21\).

3. **Determine Jean's current age:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark.
   - Therefore, Jean's current age is \(21 + 2 = 23\).

"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 1600 meters (4 laps) relay race.

For the first team, each member runs their leg in 55 seconds. Since there are four members, the total time for the first team is:
\[ 55 \text{ seconds/member} \times 4 \text{ members} = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

For the second team, the first runner takes 60 seconds, the second runner takes 57 seconds (3 seconds faster than the first), the third runner takes 54 seconds (3 seconds faster than the second), and the fourth runner takes 51 seconds (3 seconds faster than the third). The total time for the second team is:
\[ 60 \text{ seconds} + 57 \text{ seconds} + 54 \text{ seconds} + 51 \text{ seconds} = 222 \text{ seconds} \]

The difference in time between the second team and the first team is:
\[ 222 \text{ seconds} - 220 \text{ seconds} = 2 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, the faster team (the first team) will win by:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then compare them.

First, let's determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

\[ P(\text{number greater than 3}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Next, let's determine the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:

\[ P(\text{even on first roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll, given that the first roll was even, is also:

\[ P(\text{even on second roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of both events happening (rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll) is the product of the individual probabilities:

\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25 \]

Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by calculating the difference in probabilities and then converting that difference to a percentage:

\[ \text{Difference in probabilities} = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 \]

To express this difference as a percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage difference} = 0.25 \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, it is 25% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"

"Let's break down the distribution of straw among the rodents:

1. **Rats**: There are 3 cages of rats, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Let \( r \) be the number of rats. Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is \( 6r \).

2. **Hamsters**: There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. Let \( h \) be the number of hamsters. Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is \( 5h \).

3. **Rabbits**: There are 20 pieces of straw distributed among the rabbits.

The total number of pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents is given as 160. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 6r + 5h + 20 = 160 \]

Simplifying this equation:

\[ 6r + 5h = 140 \]

We need to find the number of rats in each cage, which is \( r \). To do this, we need to find integer values for \( r \) and \( h \) that satisfy the equation \( 6r + 5h = 140 \).

Let's solve for \( r \) in terms of \( h \):

\[ 6r = 140 - 5h \]
\[ r = \frac{140 - 5h}{6} \]

For \( r \) to be an integer, \( 140 - 5h \) must be divisible by 6. Let's check the values of \( h \) that satisfy this condition:

- If \( h = 4 \):
  \[ 140 - 5 \times 4 = 140 - 20 = 120 \]
  \[ r = \frac{120}{6} = 20 \]

So, \( r = 20 \) and \( h = 4 \) is a solution. This means there are 20 rats and 4 hamsters.

Since there are 3 cages of rats, the number of rats in each cage is:

\[ \frac{20}{3} \]

However, since the number of rats must be an integer, and 20 is not divisible by 3, we need to re-evaluate the problem constraints. Given the problem setup, it seems there might be an error in the interpretation or the problem constraints. But based on the given data and the equation, the number of rats in each cage would be:

\[ \boxed{\frac{20}{3}} \]

However, since the number of rats must be an integer, the problem might need rechecking for consistent integer solutions."
"To calculate the amount Mandy should give Benedict after 3 months, we need to consider the monthly interest of 2% on the initial debt of $100.

First, calculate the interest for one month:
\[ \text{Interest per month} = 100 \times \frac{2}{100} = 2 \]

Since the interest is compounded monthly, the total interest for 3 months is:
\[ \text{Total interest for 3 months} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

Adding the total interest to the initial debt gives the total amount Mandy should pay:
\[ \text{Total amount} = 100 + 6 = 106 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 106 \]"
"Let's denote the number of bags of wheat as \( n \).

The cost per bag includes the purchase price and the transportation cost, which is \( 20 + 2 = 22 \) dollars per bag.

The total cost for \( n \) bags is \( 22n \) dollars.

The selling price per bag is $30, so the total revenue from selling \( n \) bags is \( 30n \) dollars.

The trader made a total profit of $400, which means the total revenue minus the total cost equals $400. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 30n - 22n = 400 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 8n = 400 \]

To find \( n \), we divide both sides by 8:

\[ n = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food:

The cost of the tickets is $20.25.

The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, so:
\[ \text{Cost of food} = 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Next, we add the cost of the tickets and the cost of the food to find the total cost of the tickets and food:
\[ \text{Total cost of tickets and food} = 20.25 + 15.75 = 36.00 \]

They also went on 2 different rides, each costing $33, so the total cost for the rides is:
\[ \text{Total cost for rides} = 2 \times 33 = 66 \]

Now, we add the total cost of the tickets and food to the total cost for the rides to find the overall total cost:
\[ \text{Overall total cost} = 36.00 + 66 = 102.00 \]

Since they agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the overall total cost by 3:
\[ \text{Cost per person} = \frac{102.00}{3} = 34.00 \]

So, each of them paid:
\[ \boxed{34.00} \]"
"To determine the total number of peaches John collects, we need to calculate the product of the number of minutes he works and the number of peaches he collects per minute.

John works for 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total number of minutes he works is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

John collects 2 peaches per minute. Therefore, the total number of peaches he collects is:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \times 2 \text{ peaches/minute} = 360 \text{ peaches} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 360 \]"
"To determine how many pounds of insects the flock of ten ducks needs per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weekly consumption for the flock.
2. Divide the total weekly consumption by the number of days in a week to find the daily consumption.

First, the total weekly consumption for the flock is:
\[ 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 35 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Next, we need to find the daily consumption by dividing the total weekly consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week):
\[ \frac{35 \text{ pounds/week}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net increase in the number of trees Tom has each year, and then apply the percentage of trees that die after 10 years.

1. **Net increase in trees per year**: Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees, so the net increase is \(10 - 2 = 8\) trees per year.

2. **Trees after 10 years without any loss**: If Tom had no trees dying, the number of trees after 10 years would be \(50 + 8 \times 10 = 50 + 80 = 130\) trees.

3. **Trees that die after 10 years**: 30% of the trees die after 10 years. So, the number of trees that die is \(0.30 \times 130 = 39\) trees.

4. **Trees left after the loss**: Subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees after 10 years. So, the number of trees left is \(130 - 39 = 91\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{91}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Placement on Friday:**
   - Sue's front yard starts with 18 pink plastic flamingos.

2. **Action on Saturday:**
   - The neighbors take back one third of the flamingos.
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
   - These 6 flamingos are taken back and painted white.
   - The number of flamingos left on Sue's front yard is \( 18 - 6 = 12 \).
   - The neighbors then put these 6 white flamingos back out.
   - The total number of flamingos on Sue's front yard is now \( 12 + 6 = 18 \).

3. **Action on Sunday:**
   - The neighbors add another 18 pink plastic flamingos.
   - The total number of flamingos on Sue's front yard is now \( 18 + 18 = 36 \).

4. **Counting the Flamingos:**
   - Pink flamingos: 36
   - White flamingos: 6

5. **Difference Calculation:**
   - The number of pink flamingos minus the number of white flamingos is \( 36 - 6 = 30 \).

Therefore, at noon on Sunday, there are 30 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the cost of a pencil and an eraser combined:
- A pencil costs $1.20.
- An eraser costs $0.30.

So, the combined cost of a pencil and an eraser is:
\[ 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50 \]

Since a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined, a pen costs $1.50.

Now, to find the cost of 8 pens:
\[ 1.50 \times 8 = 12.00 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 12.00 \]"
"To determine how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we first need to calculate the total amount of carrots that will be distributed to the 40 restaurants.

Each restaurant receives 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. Therefore, the total amount of carrots distributed is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds/restaurant} \times 40 \text{ restaurants} = 80 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of carrots available is 200 pounds. To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we subtract the total amount distributed from the total amount available:
\[ 200 \text{ pounds} - 80 \text{ pounds} = 120 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To find the number of children in the city of Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

Total population = 23786
Number of men = 8417
Number of women = 9092

Number of children = Total population - (Number of men + Number of women)

Let's calculate the number of children:
Number of children = 23786 - (8417 + 9092)

First, add the number of men and women:
8417 + 9092 = 17509

Now, subtract this sum from the total population:
23786 - 17509 = 6277

Therefore, the number of children in Soda is 6277."
"To find out how many Pokemon cards Elaine has now, we need to calculate the number of cards she collected each month and then sum them up.

1. **First Month:**
   Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards. After a month, she collected three times that number.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ cards}
   \]
   So, after the first month, she has:
   \[
   20 + 60 = 80 \text{ cards}
   \]

2. **Second Month:**
   In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40 \text{ cards}
   \]
   So, after the second month, she has:
   \[
   80 + 40 = 120 \text{ cards}
   \]

3. **Third Month:**
   In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months.
   \[
   2 \times (60 + 40) = 2 \times 100 = 200 \text{ cards}
   \]
   So, after the third month, she has:
   \[
   120 + 200 = 320 \text{ cards}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now is:
\[
\boxed{320}

"First, let's determine how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher each week. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers and a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B.

Next, we calculate the payment from Publisher A. Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, the payment from Publisher A is:
\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

Since Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, Publisher B pays Mark:
\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10 \text{ cents/sentence} \]
Therefore, the payment from Publisher B is:
\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we add the payments from both publishers:
\[ 2500 \text{ cents} + 5000 \text{ cents} = 7500 \text{ cents} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{7500} \]"

"To calculate John's total earnings for the year after winning the award, we need to consider both the monetary reward and the salary increase.

First, let's calculate the salary increase:
- John's current weekly salary is $2000.
- The raise is 5% of his current salary.
- The raise amount is \( 2000 \times 0.05 = 100 \) dollars per week.

Next, we calculate his new weekly salary after the raise:
- New weekly salary = $2000 + $100 = $2100.

Now, we calculate his total earnings for the year:
- There are 52 weeks in a year.
- His total earnings from the raise over the year are \( 2100 \times 52 = 109200 \) dollars.

Additionally, he received a one-time monetary reward of $5000.

Adding these together gives his total earnings for the year:

"To determine the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to break down the problem into parts and calculate each part step by step.

1. **Sandwiches for lunch:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 5 days.
   - Each sandwich uses 2 slices of cheese.
   - Total slices of cheese used for sandwiches = \(5 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 10 \text{ slices}\).

2. **Omelets for breakfast:**
   - Carl ate omelets 3 days in the week.
   - Each omelet uses 1 more slice of cheese than a sandwich, so each omelet uses \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices of cheese.
   - Total slices of cheese used for omelets = \(3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices}\).

3. **Macaroni and cheese for dinner:**
   - Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese to last him several dinners for the week and used 8 slices of cheese in it.
   - Total slices of cheese used for macaroni and cheese = 8 slices.

Now, we sum up the slices of cheese used for all the meals:
\[10 \text{ slices (sandwiches)} + 9 \text{ slices (omelets)} + 8 \text{ slices (macaroni and cheese)} = 27 \text{ slices}\]

"To find the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we first need to calculate the sum of her current scores and then determine what the sixth score should be.

The scores of the first five tests are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. The sum of these scores is:
\[ 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 440 \]

Let's denote the score on the sixth test as \( x \). The average of the six test scores will be:
\[ \frac{440 + x}{6} \]

We want this average to be 93, so we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{440 + x}{6} = 93 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first multiply both sides of the equation by 6:
\[ 440 + x = 558 \]

Next, we subtract 440 from both sides:
\[ x = 118 \]

Therefore, Brinley needs to score 118 on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93. The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total kilometers Micheal rode, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first four weeks and the next three weeks.

**First Four Weeks:**
- Micheal rode at least 5 times a week.
- Each time he rode, he covered 25 kilometers.
- Therefore, in one week, he rode \(5 \times 25 = 125\) kilometers.
- Over four weeks, he rode \(4 \times 125 = 500\) kilometers.

**Next Three Weeks:**
- Micheal decided to ride 2 times a week.
- Each time he rode, he covered 60 kilometers.
- Therefore, in one week, he rode \(2 \times 60 = 120\) kilometers.
- Over three weeks, he rode \(3 \times 120 = 360\) kilometers.

**Total Kilometers:**
- Adding the kilometers from both periods, we get \(500 + 360 = 860\) kilometers.

The total number of kilometers Micheal rode is \(\boxed{860}\)."
"To determine the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we first need to find the weight of each candied apple. Given that each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams and each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, we can calculate the weight of each candied apple as follows:

\[ \text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{\text{Weight of each chocolate bar}}{2} = \frac{40 \text{ grams}}{2} = 20 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then sum them up.

\[ \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 \text{ grams} = 1000 \text{ grams} \]
\[ \text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20 \text{ grams} = 1600 \text{ grams} \]

Adding these together gives the total weight of the bag of candy:

\[ \text{Total weight of the bag of candy} = 1000 \text{ grams} + 1600 \text{ grams} = 2600 \text{ grams} \]

2. On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. So, she bought \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes.
3. On Wednesday, she bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. So, she bought \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

Now, we sum up the cakes bought over the three days:
\[4 + 12 + 60 = 76\]

Therefore, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is \(\boxed{76}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each.

Half a dozen plates is equal to 6 plates. So, the total cost for 6 plates is:
\[ 6 \times 6000 = 36000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much less twenty dozen cups cost compared to $36000. The problem states that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than $36000.

So, the cost of twenty dozen cups is:
\[ 36000 - 1200 = 34800 \]

Now, we need to find the cost of one cup. Since twenty dozen cups is equal to 240 cups, we divide the total cost of twenty dozen cups by 240 to find the cost of one cup:
\[ \frac{34800}{240} = 145 \]

Therefore, the total cost of buying each cup is:
\[ 145 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, let's determine how much money Sara earns from babysitting and mowing the lawn:
- Sara earns $5 each time she babysits, and she babysits 4 times, so she earns \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars from babysitting.
- Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, and we need to find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to afford the $70.

Let's denote the number of times Sara needs to mow the lawn as \(x\). The total amount of money Sara will have after mowing the lawn is the sum of the money she already has and the money she earns from mowing the lawn:
\[10 + 4x\]

We need this total to be at least $70 to afford the jacket and shoes:
\[10 + 4x \geq 70\]

Subtract 10 from both sides to isolate the term with \(x\):
\[4x \geq 60\]

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \(x\):
\[x \geq 15\]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn at least 15 times to afford the jacket and shoes. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{15}

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \). According to the problem, the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs every day. Additionally, it is given that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which can be expressed as:

\[ w = r + 2 \]

The total number of eggs collected each day can be expressed as:

\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation \( 3r + 5w = 42 \):

\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify and solve for \( r \):

\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens. To verify, we can calculate the number of white chickens and the total eggs collected:

\[ w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \]
\[ 3r + 5w = 3(4) + 5(6) = 12 + 30 = 42 \]

The calculations confirm that the solution is correct. Therefore, the number of red chickens Jerry has is:

\[
\boxed{4}

"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

We substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. We know his walking speed is 3 miles per hour. The time \( t \) it takes to walk a certain distance \( d \) at a speed \( v \) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Here, the distance \( d \) is 15 miles and his speed \( v \) is 3 miles per hour:

\[ t = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park."
"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of customers on the second day.
2. Calculate the total number of customers over the three days.
3. Find the number of customers on the third day by subtracting the total number of customers on the first and second days from the total number of customers over the three days.

First, we know that on the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than on the first day:
\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \text{ customers} \]

Next, we know the total number of customers over the three days is 500. To find the number of customers on the third day, we subtract the number of customers on the first and second days from the total number of customers:
\[ 500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250 \]

So, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. 

Given that both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( S - 4 \times 4 = S - 16 \) gallons, and the big pool had \( B - 4 \times 4 = B - 16 \) gallons. According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, so we can write the equation:
\[ B - 16 = 2(S - 16) \]
Expanding and simplifying this equation, we get:
\[ B - 16 = 2S - 32 \]
\[ B = 2S - 16 \]

Now, we know that the current amounts of water in the pools are related by the fact that the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( B = 2S - 16 \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

By setting the right-hand sides of these equations equal to each other, we get:
\[ 2S - 16 = 4S \]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[ -16 = 2S \]
\[ S = -8 \]

Since the amount of water cannot be negative, we need to recheck the setup. The correct interpretation is that the small pool has \( S \) gallons and the big pool has \( 4S \) gallons. The leak rate affects the current amounts, so we need to adjust for the 4 minutes of leakage. The current amounts are:
\[ S - 16 \]
\[ 4S - 16 \]

Given that the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ 4S - 16 = 4(S - 16) \]
\[ 4S - 16 = 4S - 64 \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 4S - 16 = 4S - 64 \]
\[ -16 = -64 \]
This is a contradiction, so we need to solve the correct system:
\[ S = 16 \]
\[ B = 4S = 4 \times 16 = 64 \]

So, the current amount of water in the small pool is \( S = 16 \) gallons. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of her purchase.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Lori earns $8.00 per hour at her part-time job. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44.00 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She promised to return the original $2000 plus an additional 10% of that amount.

The additional amount is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she promised to return is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Janeth is paying $165 per month for 12 months. The total amount she will pay over 12 months is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she promised to return to find her remaining balance:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack, and then find their average age in three years.

1. **Determine Harriet's current age:**
   Harriet is currently 21 years old.

2. **Determine Zack's current age:**
   Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, we can calculate Zack's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. **Determine Adrian's current age:**
   Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age:
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years old}
   \]

4. **Calculate their ages in three years:**
   - Harriet's age in three years: \(21 + 3 = 24\)
   - Zack's age in three years: \(42 + 3 = 45\)
   - Adrian's age in three years: \(63 + 3 = 66\)

5. **Calculate the average age of the three in three years:**
   \[
   \text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Harriet's age in three years} + \text{Zack's age in three years} + \text{Adrian's age in three years}}{3} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna, and then use the total points to find Jojo's score.

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. So, Yuri's score is:
   \[
   \text{Yuri's score} = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44
   \]
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna's score is:
   \[
   \text{Brianna's score} = 68 + 17 = 85
   \]

Now, we know the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[
\text{Total points by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna} = 68 + 44 + 85 = 197
\]

The total points scored by all four students is 251. Therefore, Jojo's score is:
\[
\text{Jojo's score} = 251 - 197 = 54
\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"To determine the total time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles and sudoku puzzles separately and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
- It takes Carmen 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles over the weekend.

\[
\text{Time spent on crossword puzzles} = 10 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 3 \text{ puzzles} = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the time spent on sudoku puzzles:
- It takes Carmen 5 minutes to finish one sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 sudoku puzzles over the weekend.

\[
\text{Time spent on sudoku puzzles} = 5 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 8 \text{ puzzles} = 40 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we sum the time spent on both puzzles:

\[
\text{Total time spent} = 30 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 70 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time Carmen spent playing these games is:

\[

"Initially, the tank has 120 liters of water. Celine used 90 liters to water her garden, so the amount of water left in the tank is:

\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters} \]

Celine then collected rainwater that is twice the amount left in the tank. Since there are 30 liters left, the amount of rainwater collected is:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters} \]

Adding the collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank gives:

\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final amount of water in the tank is:

\[ 90 \text{ liters} \]"
"Andy plants 90 geraniums and 40 fewer petunias than geraniums. Therefore, he plants 90 - 40 = 50 petunias. The total number of flowers he plants is 90 geraniums + 50 petunias = 140 flowers.

"To find the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years, we first need to calculate the amount spent on advertising in the second year. The company spent $15000 on advertising for the first year. For the second year, they spent a third of that amount.

Amount spent on advertising in the second year = \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15000 = 5000\)

Now, we add the amounts spent in both years to find the total.

Total amount spent on advertising = Amount spent in the first year + Amount spent in the second year
Total amount spent on advertising = $15000 + $5000 = $20000

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Travel by Bus:**
   - Andrew takes 6 days to travel by bus from New Jersey to Rochester.

2. **Travel by Car:**
   - The travel by car takes half as many days as the bus trip.
   - Therefore, the travel by car takes \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) days.

3. **Return Trip:**
   - Andrew plans to return from Rochester to New Jersey by car.
   - The return trip by car will also take 3 days.

4. **Total Travel Days:**
   - The total number of days Andrew will travel is the sum of the days for the trip to Rochester and the return trip.

Thus, the total number of days Andrew will travel is 9 days."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cards James has after the changes:

- Initial fire type cards: 30
- Initial grass type cards: 20
- Initial water type cards: 40

After losing 8 water type cards:
- Water type cards left: 40 - 8 = 32

After buying 14 new grass type cards:
- Grass type cards now: 20 + 14 = 34

Now, the total number of cards James has is:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 34
- Water type: 32

The total number of cards is:
30 + 34 + 32 = 96

The number of water type cards left is 32. To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 = 0.3333 \times 100 = 33.33\% \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33%.

"First, let's determine how many pieces Kalinda and her mom can place together per minute.

Kalinda places 4 pieces per minute.
Her mom places half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

Together, they can place \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces per minute.

The puzzle has 360 pieces. To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can place together per minute:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60:

"First, let's determine how many watermelons were ready for harvest after the first two months. Since 30% of the 120 watermelons were ready, we calculate:

\[ 0.30 \times 120 = 36 \]

So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest and Ashlyn took them home. This means the number of watermelons remaining after she took the ready ones home is:

\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest two weeks later. Since 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready, we calculate:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63 \]

This means 63 watermelons were ready for harvest and Ashlyn took them home. Therefore, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:

\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the cars before tax and registration fees. Each car costs $20,000, and Mark buys 12 cars.

\[ \text{Total cost of cars} = 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000 \]

Next, we calculate the tax on the cars. The tax rate is 10%.

\[ \text{Tax on cars} = 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000 \]

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of the cars to get the total cost before registration fees.

\[ \text{Total cost before registration} = 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000 \]

Then, we calculate the registration fees. Each car has a registration fee of $1,000, and Mark has 12 cars.

\[ \text{Total registration fees} = 12 \times 1,000 = 12,000 \]

Finally, we add the total registration fees to the total cost before registration to get the final amount Mark pays.

\[ \text{Total amount paid} = 264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \text{Number of bugs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of ants} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \]

To find the total number of insects in the garden, we add the number of ants and the number of bugs:

\[ \text{Total number of insects} = \text{Number of ants} + \text{Number of bugs} = 50 + 25 = 75 \]

The total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"To solve this problem, we start by determining how many penguins jump into the ocean and how many go into the cave. We know there are 36 penguins in total.

First, we calculate one-third of the penguins that jump into the ocean:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
\]
So, 12 penguins jump into the ocean.

Next, we calculate one-third of the penguins that go into the cave:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
\]
So, 12 penguins go into the cave.

Now, we find the total number of penguins that leave the snow to either swim or eat:
\[
12 + 12 = 24
\]

To find out how many penguins are still left sunbathing, we subtract the number of penguins that left from the total number of penguins:

"First, let's determine how much Steve's girlfriend eats. Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, and Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, his girlfriend eats:

\[ \text{Steve's girlfriend's consumption} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ tomatoes per day} \]

Next, we calculate the total consumption per week. Since there are 7 days in a week, Steve eats:

\[ \text{Steve's weekly consumption} = 6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ tomatoes per week} \]

And his girlfriend eats:

\[ \text{Girlfriend's weekly consumption} = 3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ tomatoes per week} \]

So, the total consumption per week is:

\[ \text{Total weekly consumption} = 42 + 21 = 63 \text{ tomatoes per week} \]

Given that a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, the number of vines needed is:

\[ \text{Number of vines} = \frac{63}{3} = 21 \]

Thus, Steve needs \(\boxed{21}\) vines."
"To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we first need to calculate the total number of pizza slices required.

John has 20 friends, and each friend will have 4 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices needed is:

Next, we need to figure out how many pizzas are required to provide these 80 slices. Each pizza is sliced into 8 portions. To find out how many pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 10 \text{ pizzas} \]

Thus, John needs to order:
\[ \boxed{10} \text{ pizzas} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the process Ram uses to make new pens from the empty ones. Ram can make one full pen by mixing the ink from five empty pens. This means that for every five empty pens, he gets one new full pen.

Ram starts with 25 pens. He will use these 25 pens to make new pens until he runs out of empty pens to mix. Since he can make one new pen from five empty pens, we can calculate how many new pens he can make from the initial 25 pens:

\[ \text{Number of new pens} = \frac{25}{5} = 5 \]

After making these 5 new pens, he will have used up 25 empty pens, and he will have 0 empty pens left to make more new pens. Therefore, the total number of pens Ram will have is the initial 25 pens plus the 5 new pens he made:

\[ \text{Total pens} = 25 + 5 = 30 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 30 \]"

"First, let's calculate the number of students who went out through exit A. Since 30% of the students went out through exit A, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Students through exit A} = 30\% \times 1000 = 0.30 \times 1000 = 300 \]

After students have left through exit A, the number of students remaining in the hall is:

\[ \text{Remaining students} = 1000 - 300 = 700 \]

Next, we calculate the number of students who went out through exit B. According to the problem, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining students went out through exit B:

\[ \text{Students through exit B} = \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420 \]

The number of students who went out through exit C is the rest of the students after those who went through exits A and B have left. Therefore, we subtract the number of students who went through exits A and B from the total number of students remaining after exit A:

\[ \text{Students through exit C} = 700 - 420 = 280 \]

So, the number of students who went out through exit C is:

\[ \boxed{280} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's start by determining how many candies Robert has. We know that John has twice as many candies as Robert and that John has 54 candies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find out how many candies Robert has:

\[ \text{John's candies} = 2 \times \text{Robert's candies} \]
\[ 54 = 2 \times \text{Robert's candies} \]
\[ \text{Robert's candies} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Now that we know Robert has 27 candies, we can find out how many candies James has. We know that James has 6 more candies than Robert:

\[ \text{James's candies} = \text{Robert's candies} + 6 \]
\[ \text{James's candies} = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Next, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's candies} - \text{James's candies} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

So, John has 21 more candies than James. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many pen pals Mike has left after stopping being pen pals with 2 of them. Initially, he had 5 pen pals, so after stopping being pen pals with 2, he has:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals} \]

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each pen pal sends:

\[ 2 \text{ letters/week} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 10 \text{ pages/week} \]

Since there are 3 pen pals, the total number of pages sent by all pen pals in a week is:

\[ 3 \text{ pen pals} \times 10 \text{ pages/pen pal/week} = 30 \text{ pages/week} \]

Mike responds to each of these 30 pages, so he writes 30 pages a week. He can write a page every 6 minutes, so the total time he spends writing in minutes is:

\[ 30 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

- There are 32 snails in the second aquarium.
- The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is \( 32 - 4 = 28 \).
- This difference is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums.

Let's denote the total number of fish in both aquariums as \( 2F \) (since there are \( F \) fish in each aquarium).

According to the problem, the difference in the number of snails is twice the total number of fish:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2F \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ F = 7 \]

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"First, let's calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist works for the movie. She requires 6 hours each day and needs it done 4 times a week for 5 weeks.

Total hours worked = 6 hours/day * 4 days/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours

Next, we calculate the total cost before the discount. The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.

Total cost before discount = 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000

Now, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost.

Discount amount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.10 * $30,000 = $3,000

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find out how much Jean paid.

Total cost after discount = $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

So, Jean paid $27,000."

   - According to the problem, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, so the number of wolves killed today is \( 3c \).
   - Also, Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, so the number of cougars killed today is \( 15 - 3 = 12 \).

3. **Calculating Today's Wolves:**
   - Since today's number of cougars is 12, the number of wolves killed today is \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \).

4. **Total Animals Killed:**
   - Wolves killed in total: \( 10 \text{ (previous night)} + 36 \text{ (today)} = 46 \)
   - Cougars killed in total: \( 15 \text{ (previous night)} + 12 \text{ (today)} = 27 \)

5. **Final Total:**
   - Total animals killed: \( 46 \text{ (wolves)} + 27 \text{ (cougars)} = 73 \)

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{73}

"First, let's determine how many times Anne went down the water slide. Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30.

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.30 \times 30 = 9 \]

So, Anne went down the slide:

\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \text{ times} \]

Next, we need to find out how many times Robert went down the slide. Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne, so we multiply the number of times Anne went down by 4.

\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 84 \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of cows Mr. Sylas has after buying the new cows. Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, which totals:

\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows/stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows, so the total number of cows he has now is:

\[ 200 \text{ cows} + 40 \text{ cows} = 240 \text{ cows} \]

Next, Mr. Sylas divides these 40 new cows equally among the 20 stalls. Each stall will get:

\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows/stall} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. Since each stall has 2 cows, 8 stalls will have:

\[ 8 \text{ stalls} \times 2 \text{ cows/stall} = 16 \text{ cows} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 16 \]"
"To determine the total amount of money Brady has in his piggy bank, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and bill separately and then sum these values.

1. **Pennies**: Each penny is worth $0.01. Brady has 100 pennies.
   \[
   100 \text{ pennies} \times 0.01 \text{ dollars/penny} = 1 \text{ dollar}
   \]

2. **Nickels**: Each nickel is worth $0.05. Brady has 40 nickels.
   \[
   40 \text{ nickels} \times 0.05 \text{ dollars/nickel} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Dimes**: Each dime is worth $0.10. Brady has 20 dimes.
   \[
   20 \text{ dimes} \times 0.10 \text{ dollars/dime} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Dollar Bills**: Each dollar bill is worth $1.00. Brady has 40 dollar bills.
   \[
   40 \text{ dollar bills} \times 1.00 \text{ dollars/dollar bill} = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum the values of all the coins and dollar bills:
\[
1 \text{ dollar} + 2 \text{ dollars} + 2 \text{ dollars} + 40 \text{ dollars} = 45 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Brady has in his piggy bank is:

"First, we need to determine the total length of the redwood tree in feet, which is given as 200 feet.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the entire redwood tree before any damage. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can find the total weight by dividing the total length of the tree by the length of each section and then multiplying by the weight of each section.

\[
\text{Total weight of the tree} = \left(\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}}\right) \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 20 \times 400 = 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to account for the damage caused by the termites. The termites ate 30% of the tree's wood, which means 70% of the tree remains. We calculate the remaining weight as follows:

\[
\text{Remaining weight} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70 = 5600 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the final weight of the redwood tree is:

\[
\boxed{5600 \text{ pounds}}

"To calculate the total amount Nancy has to pay, we need to consider both the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee.

First, we calculate the cost of the overdue books:
- Nancy has 8 books overdue.
- Each book costs $0.50.
- Therefore, the total cost for the books is \(8 \times 0.50 = 4.00\) dollars.

Next, we add the flat fee for having at least one book over a week overdue:
- The flat fee is $2.00.

Now, we add the cost of the books to the flat fee:
- Total cost = Cost of books + Flat fee
- Total cost = $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00

So, the total amount Nancy has to pay is $6.00.

\[
\boxed{6.00}

"Let's denote the number of apples Jamal has as \( J_a \) and the number of bananas Jamal has as \( J_b \).

From the information given:
1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, so if Andrea has 52 apples, then Jamal has \( 52 - 8 = 44 \) apples.
2. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so \( J_b = J_a + 4 \).
3. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so if Jamal has \( J_b \) bananas, then Andrea has \( \frac{J_b}{2} \) bananas. Since Andrea has 52 apples, we can use this to find the number of bananas Jamal has.

First, we know Jamal has 44 apples, so:
\[ J_b = 44 + 4 = 48 \]
This means Jamal has 48 bananas. Since Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, Andrea has:
\[ \frac{48}{2} = 24 \] bananas.

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits:
- Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas, so Andrea has \( 52 + 24 = 76 \) fruits.
- Jamal has 44 apples and 48 bananas, so Jamal has \( 44 + 48 = 92 \) fruits.

The total number of fruits is:
\[ 76 + 92 = 168 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{168} \]"
"To determine the total amount of flour Carla needs, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she is making and then convert that into the amount of flour required.

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, which totals to:
\[ 36 + 30 = 66 \text{ cookies} \]

We know that 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies. To find out how many cups of flour are needed for 66 cookies, we can set up a proportion:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{66 \text{ cookies}} \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 66 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{132}{12} = 11 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow."
"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we first need to calculate how many pennies are in two thirds of the total pennies.

Given that there are 9,300 pennies in the cup, we calculate two thirds of 9,300 as follows:

\[
\text{Number of pennies in the stack} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9300
\]

First, we perform the multiplication:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9300 = \frac{2 \times 9300}{3} = \frac{18600}{3} = 6200
\]

So, there are 6,200 pennies in the stack.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, the total dollar amount in the stack is:

\[
\text{Total dollar amount} = 6200 \times 0.01 = 62
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[

\[ \text{Number of trees Ferdinand has} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we need to find out how many trees Harry has. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has:

\[ \text{Number of trees Harry has} = 2 \times 3 + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11 \]

Now, to find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Number of trees Harry has} - \text{Number of trees Ferdinand has} = 11 - 3 = 8 \]

So, Harry has 8 more trees than Ferdinand. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 8 \]"
"First, let's determine how much money each girl has individually.

Carmen has $100.

Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so:
\[ \text{Samantha's money} = 100 + 25 = 125 \]

Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so:
\[ \text{Daisy's money} = 125 + 50 = 175 \]

Now, to find out how much all three girls have combined, we add their individual amounts together:
\[ \text{Total money} = 100 + 125 + 175 \]

Adding these amounts:
\[ 100 + 125 = 225 \]
\[ 225 + 175 = 400 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money all three girls have combined is:

"First, let's calculate the total price of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

The selling price of the house is $350,000.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price:
\[ \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500 \]

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price:
\[ \text{Transfer Fee} = 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000 \]

Now, let's add the brokerage fee and the transfer fee to the selling price to get the total price of the house:
\[ \text{Total Price} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500 \]

Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. To find out how much more the total price of the house is than her budget, we subtract her budget from the total price:
\[ \text{Difference} = 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500 \]

So, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 9500 \]"
"First, let's calculate the transfer fees. The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Transfer Fees} = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000 \]

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee. The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000 \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount paid for the transfer fees and the brokerage fee.

\[ \text{Total Fees} = 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000 \]

Mr. Tan also paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount of the house. To find the net proceeds, we subtract the total fees and the loan amount from the selling price.

\[ \text{Net Proceeds} = 400,000 - 32,000 - 250,000 = 118,000 \]

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is $118,000."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes for the oil to heat up to 400 degrees. We know it takes 20 minutes to heat the oil to 300 degrees, and it then takes 40% longer to heat it to 400 degrees.

40% of 20 minutes is:
\[ 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the additional time needed to heat the oil to 400 degrees is 8 minutes. Therefore, the total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that it takes 5 minutes less time to cook the chicken than it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees. So, the cooking time is:
\[ 28 - 5 = 23 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees and the time it took to cook the chicken:
\[ 28 + 23 = 51 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken is:

"To calculate the total amount spent by the real estate agent on buying all the ads, we need to calculate the cost for the newspaper ads and the television ads separately, and then add them together.

For the newspaper ads:
Cost per newspaper ad = $5
Number of newspaper ads = 50
Total cost for newspaper ads = $5 * 50 = $250

For the television ads:
Cost per television ad = $75
Number of television ads = 15
Total cost for television ads = $75 * 15 = $1125

Now, we add the total costs for both types of ads:
Total cost = Total cost for newspaper ads + Total cost for television ads
Total cost = $250 + $1125 = $1375

The real estate agent spent $1375 on buying all the ads."
"To find the number of blue golf balls, we start by determining the number of golf balls. Since half of the 16 balls are golf balls, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of golf balls} = \frac{16}{2} = 8
\]

Next, we know that half of these golf balls are blue. Therefore, we calculate the number of blue golf balls as follows:

\[
\text{Number of blue golf balls} = \frac{8}{2} = 4

"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and then sum them up.

1. The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
2. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has \(300 + 12 = 312\) M&Ms.
3. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, so it has \(300 / 2 = 150\) M&Ms.

Now, we sum the M&Ms from all three bags:
\[300 + 312 + 150 = 762\]

So, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762.

"To determine the total number of windows in John's houses, we need to consider both the windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows in each house.

First, let's calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms:
- Each house has 3 bedrooms.
- Each bedroom has 2 windows.
- Therefore, the number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is \(3 \text{ bedrooms} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows}\).

Next, we add the additional windows in each house:
- Each house has 4 additional windows.

Now, we calculate the total number of windows in one house:
- Windows in bedrooms: 6
- Additional windows: 4
- Total windows in one house: \(6 + 4 = 10\)

Since John has 2 houses, we multiply the total number of windows in one house by 2:
- Total windows in both houses: \(10 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 20 \text{ windows}\)

Thus, the total number of windows between the houses is \(\boxed{20}\)."

\[ 4.20 + 9.45 + 1.35 = 15.00 \]

The mother pays with $20. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:

\[ 20.00 - 15.00 = 5.00 \]

So, the change the cashier gives back is $5.00."
"First, let's determine the number of stitches for each part of the sweater:

- The collar takes a tenth of the stitches for the body of the sweater. Since the body takes 900 stitches, the collar takes \( \frac{900}{10} = 90 \) stitches.
- The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar. Since the collar takes 90 stitches, the rosette takes \( 2 \times 90 = 180 \) stitches.

Now, let's calculate the total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette:
- Collar: 90 stitches
- Rosette: 180 stitches
- Total for collar and rosette: \( 90 + 180 = 270 \) stitches

The total number of stitches for the whole sweater is 1800. Therefore, the number of stitches used for the body and the sleeves is:
- Body: 900 stitches
- Total for body and sleeves: \( 1800 - 270 = 1530 \) stitches

Since there are two sleeves, we need to find out how many stitches each sleeve takes. Let \( x \) be the number of stitches for each sleeve. Then:
- Total for two sleeves: \( 2x \)
- Total for body and sleeves: \( 900 + 2x = 1530 \)

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 2x = 1530 - 900 \]
\[ 2x = 630 \]
\[ x = \frac{630}{2} \]
\[ x = 315 \]

Therefore, each sleeve takes 315 stitches. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{315} \]"

   - The solo song has 54 lines.
   - Sean has to memorize all 54 lines of the solo song.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song.
   - Number of lines in the first scene = \(2 \times 54 = 108\).
   - Sean has to memorize a third of the lines in the first scene.
   - Number of lines Sean has to memorize in the first scene = \(\frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36\).

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the solo song.
   - Number of lines in the second scene = \(54 + 6 = 60\).
   - Sean has to memorize four-fifths of the lines in the second scene.
   - Number of lines Sean has to memorize in the second scene = \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48\).

Now, we sum up the lines Sean has to memorize for all parts of his role:
- Solo song: 54 lines

"First, let's determine how many cards had the letter A on them. Since 2/5 of the cards had the letter A, we calculate:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 80 = \frac{160}{5} = 32
\]

So, 32 cards had the letter A on them. This leaves us with:

\[
80 - 32 = 48
\]

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining 48 cards had the letter B on them. Since 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24
\]

This leaves us with:

\[
48 - 24 = 24

"To calculate the total time Matthew will take to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we first calculate the time for each type of hole separately and then sum them up.

For the small holes:
- Time to dig one small hole = 3 minutes
- Number of small holes = 30
- Total time for small holes = 3 minutes/hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes

For the large holes:
- Time to dig one large hole = 10 minutes
- Number of large holes = 15
- Total time for large holes = 10 minutes/hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes

Now, we add the total time for both types of holes:
- Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert the total time from minutes to hours:
- Total time in hours = 240 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we start with the information given: the sum of their current ages is 20.

Let's denote Mico's current age as \( M \) and Marco's current age as \( R \). According to the problem, we have:
\[ M + R = 20 \]

In 10 years, Mico's age will be \( M + 10 \) and Marco's age will be \( R + 10 \). The sum of their ages in 10 years will be:
\[ (M + 10) + (R + 10) \]

We can simplify this expression:
\[ (M + 10) + (R + 10) = M + R + 10 + 10 = M + R + 20 \]

Since we know from the problem statement that \( M + R = 20 \), we substitute this value into the equation:
\[ M + R + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40 \]

Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, which translates to \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. This can be written as \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

First, we substitute the expression for \( R \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Next, we expand and simplify the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old. To verify, we calculate Ruby's current age:
\[ R = 6S = 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

In 9 years, Sam will be \( 6 + 9 = 15 \) years old, and Ruby will be \( 36 + 9 = 45 \) years old. Checking the condition that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
\[ 45 = 3 \times 15 \]
This is true, confirming our solution.

"First, let's determine the number of spots a mamba has. Since a cobra has 70 spots and a mamba has half as many spots as a cobra, a mamba has:

\[ \frac{70}{2} = 35 \text{ spots} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, so the total number of spots for the cobras is:

\[ 40 \times 70 = 2800 \text{ spots} \]

There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots, so the total number of spots for the mambas is:

\[ 60 \times 35 = 2100 \text{ spots} \]

Adding the spots of all the cobras and mambas together gives:

\[ 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \text{ spots} \]

To find half the number of spots they all have combined, we calculate:

\[ \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

"First, let's determine the total number of people who will be eating the pizza.

- There are 12 team members.
- There are 3 coaches.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so \(12 \text{ team members} \times 2 \text{ guests/team member} = 24 \text{ guests}\).

Adding these together, the total number of people is:
\[ 12 \text{ team members} + 3 \text{ coaches} + 24 \text{ guests} = 39 \text{ people} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Each pizza serves 3 people, so we divide the total number of people by the number of people each pizza can serve:
\[ \frac{39 \text{ people}}{3 \text{ people/pizza}} = 13 \text{ pizzas} \]

Each pizza costs $15, so the total cost for 13 pizzas is:

"To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we first need to calculate the total length used by the topaz gemstones and then subtract that from the total length of the necklace.

Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace. Therefore, the total length used by the topaz gemstones is:
\[ 8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. So, the length used by the sterling silver beads is:
\[ 25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches} \]

Each sterling silver bead is 0.25 inches long. To find out how many sterling silver beads are used, we divide the length used by the beads by the length of one bead:
\[ \frac{17 \text{ inches}}{0.25 \text{ inches/bead}} = 68 \text{ beads} \]

Thus, the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace is:
\[ \boxed{68} \]"
"To find the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot altogether, we need to calculate the number of stories each wrote in both weeks and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of stories each wrote in the second week:
- Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week and doubled that in the second week, so she wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories in the second week.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week and doubled that in the second week, so he wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories in the second week.
- Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week and doubled that in the second week, so she wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories in the second week.

Next, we sum up the total number of stories written by each of them over the two weeks:
- Alani wrote \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories in total.
- Braylen wrote \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories in total.
- Margot wrote \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories in total.

Finally, we add up the total number of stories written by all three:
\[60 + 120 + 180 = 360\]

So, the total number of stories they wrote altogether is \(\boxed{360}\)."
"First, let's determine the current age of Ann's brother. Since Ann is 9 years old and her brother is twice her age, we can calculate her brother's age as follows:

\[ \text{Brother's current age} = 2 \times \text{Ann's age} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we need to find out how old her brother will be in 3 years. We add 3 years to his current age:

\[ \text{Brother's age in 3 years} = \text{Brother's current age} + 3 = 18 + 3 = 21 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 21 \]"
"Kelly has 5 quarters, and since each quarter is worth 25 cents, the total value of the quarters is:
\[ 5 \times 25 = 125 \text{ cents} \]

She also has 2 dimes, and since each dime is worth 10 cents, the total value of the dimes is:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Adding the value of the quarters and the dimes gives:
\[ 125 + 20 = 145 \text{ cents} \]

If she buys a can of pop for 55 cents, the amount of cents she will have left is:
\[ 145 - 55 = 90 \text{ cents} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 90 \]"
"To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we first need to calculate the total number of stars accounted for by the rows of 8 and 6 stars, and then subtract this from the total number of stars on the flag.

The total number of stars on the flag is 76. The flag has three rows of 8 stars and two rows of 6 stars. Let's calculate the number of stars in these rows:

- Three rows of 8 stars: \(3 \times 8 = 24\)
- Two rows of 6 stars: \(2 \times 6 = 12\)

Adding these together gives the number of stars in the rows of 8 and 6 stars:
\[24 + 12 = 36\]

Now, we subtract the number of stars in these rows from the total number of stars on the flag to find the number of stars in the rows of 5 stars:
\[76 - 36 = 40\]

Since each row of 5 stars contains 5 stars, we divide the remaining number of stars by 5 to find the number of rows of 5 stars:
\[40 \div 5 = 8\]

Therefore, the number of rows of 5 stars is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"First, we need to calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight for 80 flagstones is:

\[ 80 \times 75 = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how many trucks are required to transport 6000 pounds, given that each truck can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds. We do this by dividing the total weight by the capacity of one truck:

\[ \frac{6000}{2000} = 3 \]

Since the division results in a whole number, 3 trucks are needed to transport the 80 flagstones in one trip. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"First, we need to determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, we calculate the speed of the slow lane car as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of slow lane car} = \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it took the car in the fast lane to travel 480 miles. We use the formula for time, which is distance divided by speed:

\[ \text{Time taken by fast lane car} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at a constant speed of 30 miles per hour, we can calculate the time it took for the slow lane car to travel the same 480 miles using the same formula for time:

\[ \text{Time taken by slow lane car} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

\[ 16 \text{ hours} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Izzy's medals} = \text{Ali's medals} - 5 = 22 - 5 = 17 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:

\[ \text{Total medals} = \text{Ali's medals} + \text{Izzy's medals} = 22 + 17 = 39 \]

According to the problem, the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have:

\[ \text{Total medals given out} = 10 \times \text{Total medals} = 10 \times 39 = 390 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 390 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available:

Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, and there are 8 packets.
\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars/packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of chocolate bars that the adults will get:

Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, and there are 4 adults.
\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars/adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults will get from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children:
\[ 40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Finally, we need to distribute the remaining chocolate bars equally among the 8 children:
\[ \frac{16 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars/child} \]

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"To determine how much money Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she works and then convert that time into earnings based on her rate.

Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. Since she pauses for half an hour, the actual working time is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} - 0.5 \text{ hours} = 2.5 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we convert the working time into minutes:
\[ 2.5 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes. To find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes, we divide 150 by 10:
\[ 150 \text{ minutes} \div 10 \text{ minutes/interval} = 15 \text{ intervals} \]

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, her total earnings are:
\[ 15 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ dollars/interval} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 75 \]"
"First, let's determine the initial points for each player:

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Next, we check if any of the players get an extra point in the fourth round. According to the rules, a player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points.

- Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so Mike gets an extra point.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so Jim does not get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so Tony gets an extra point.

Now, we add the extra points to their initial points:

- Mike's new total is \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
- Jim's new total remains \(18\) points.
- Tony's new total is \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

Finally, we calculate the total points for all three players:

\[22 + 18 + 43 = 83\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{83}

"First, let's determine the ages of Will's sons. The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest son is half as old as the oldest, which means the youngest son is 4 years old.

Next, we calculate how many oranges each son washes. The oldest son washes 8 oranges, and the youngest son washes 4 oranges. Therefore, the total number of oranges washed by both sons is:

\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \]

Will initially bought 15 oranges. After his sons wash 12 oranges, the number of oranges left unwashed is:

\[ 15 - 12 = 3 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"To find the total count of activities Darren did in the two days, we need to calculate the number of each activity he did on both days and then sum them up.

**First Day:**
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

**Second Day:**
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, let's calculate the total for each day:

**First Day Total:**
\[ 100 \text{ (pushups)} + 50 \text{ (squats)} + 20 \text{ (dumbbell presses)} = 170 \]

**Second Day Total:**
\[ 120 \text{ (pushups)} + 40 \text{ (squats)} + 40 \text{ (dumbbell presses)} = 200 \]

Finally, the total count of activities for the two days:
\[ 170 + 200 = 370 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day by the household.
2. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week by the household.
3. Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

First, let's calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day by the household. Since each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal and there are 5 members, and they eat rice at lunch and dinner, the total consumption per day is:
\[ 5 \text{ people} \times 0.2 \text{ kg/meal/person} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 2 \text{ kg/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week:
\[ 2 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ kg/week} \]

Now, we determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last:
\[ \frac{42 \text{ kg}}{14 \text{ kg/week}} = 3 \text{ weeks} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we first need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week.

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he did not sell any bread on those days. Over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday), he sold 20 crates. From Tuesday to Thursday, he sold the following number of crates:
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates

Now, let's add up the crates sold from Tuesday to Thursday:
\[ 15 + 12 + 18 = 45 \]

Adding the crates sold over the weekend:
\[ 45 + 20 = 65 \]

Sam's target for the week was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off by, we subtract the total crates sold from the target:
\[ 120 - 65 = 55 \]

Therefore, Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{55} \]"
"To determine the total cost of the antique desk to Carmen, we need to calculate the bids she placed and the bids of the other bidders.

Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so she bids 3 times. Each of her bids increases by $50. Therefore, her bids are:
- First bid: $200
- Second bid: $200 + $50 = $250
- Third bid: $250 + $50 = $300

The other 3 bidders each bid once, and since they bid in sequence, their bids are:
- First of the other bidders: $200 + $50 = $250
- Second of the other bidders: $250 + $50 = $300
- Third of the other bidders: $300 + $50 = $350

Carmen wins with her third bid of $300. To find the total cost to Carmen, we sum her bids:
\[ 200 + 250 + 300 = 750 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{750} \]"
"To calculate the total amount John pays for driving a year, we need to break down the costs into miles driven and bonuses given to the driver.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven in a year:
- John drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back home each day, so he drives 60 miles per day.
- He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year, so he drives 60 miles * 5 days/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles/year.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the miles driven:
- He is charged $2 per mile, so the cost for the miles driven is 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000.

Now, let's calculate the total bonus given to the driver:
- He gives a $150 bonus per month, and there are 12 months in a year, so the total bonus is $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800/year.

Finally, let's add the cost of the miles driven and the total bonus to find the total amount John pays a year for driving:
- Total cost = Cost of miles driven + Total bonus = $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

The final numerical answer is $31,800."
"To determine how many minutes Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we first need to calculate the total amount of time he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.

On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes.
On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes.

Adding these together:
\[ 23 + 16 = 39 \text{ minutes} \]

Peter wants to exercise for twice this amount on Tuesday. Therefore, we need to multiply the combined time by 2:
\[ 39 \times 2 = 78 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Peter has to exercise for \(\boxed{78}\) minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To determine the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the folding process and how the pages are printed.

1. **Folding the Paper**: When a piece of paper is folded vertically, it creates two layers. This means that each piece of paper can be used to print two pages.
2. **Printing Layout**: In the given layout, page 1 is printed on the left back, page 2 is printed on the left front, page 32 is printed on the right back, and page 31 is printed on the right front. This means that each page is printed on one side of the folded paper.

Since each piece of paper is used to print two pages, and the tabloid has 32 pages, we can calculate the number of pieces of paper needed as follows:

\[ \text{Number of pieces of paper} = \frac{\text{Total number of pages}}{\text{Pages per piece of paper}} = \frac{32}{2} = 16 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 16 \]"
"First, let's determine how much Annika spent on food and snacks. She spent half of her $50 on food and snacks, which is:

\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

So, she spent $25 on food and snacks. After spending $25, the amount of money she has left is:

\[ 50 - 25 = 25 \]

Next, she spent an additional $10 on rides. Subtracting this from the remaining $25, we get:

\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Therefore, the amount of money left with Annika is:

\[ 15 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 15 \]"
"To determine the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of books sold in the current year:**
   - There are currently 50 unsold books.
   - The total number of books is 250.
   - Therefore, the number of books sold in the current year is:
     \[
     250 - 50 = 200 \text{ books}
     \]

2. **Verify the number of books sold in the first year:**
   - Elise sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year.
   - The number of books sold in the current year is 200.
   - Therefore, the number of books sold in the first year is:
     \[
     2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ books}
     \]

3. **Determine the number of books sold in the second year:**
   - The total number of books sold over the three years is 250.
   - The number of books sold in the first year is 400.
   - The number of books sold in the current year is 200.
   - Therefore, the number of books sold in the second year is:
     \[
     250 - 400 - 200 = -150 \text{ books}
     \]
   - This negative value indicates an error in the problem setup or interpretation. Given the constraints, it seems there might be a misunderstanding. Let's re-evaluate the problem with the given data.

4. **Re-evaluate the problem with the given data:**
   - The number of books sold in the current year is 45.
   - The number of books sold in the first year is twice the number sold in the current year:
     \[
     2 \times 45 = 90 \text{ books}
     \]
   - The total number of books sold over the three years is 250.
   - Therefore, the number of books sold in the second year is:
     \[
     250 - 90 - 45 = 115 \text{ books}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total amount of money earned in the second year:**
   - Each book sells for $20.
   - The number of books sold in the second year is 115.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money earned in the second year is:
     \[
     115 \times 20 = 2300 \text{ dollars}
     \]

The total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is \(\boxed{2300}\)."
"To determine how much money Watson made in April, we need to calculate his earnings from his hourly wage and his weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate Watson's daily earnings:
- Watson works 10 hours a day.
- He earns $10 per hour.

\[ \text{Daily earnings} = 10 \, \text{hours/day} \times 10 \, \text{\$/hour} = 100 \, \text{\$/day} \]

Next, let's calculate his weekly earnings:
- Watson works 5 days a week.
- He earns $100 per day.

\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 100 \, \text{\$/day} \times 5 \, \text{days/week} = 500 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Since Watson received a $300 bonus each week if the company performed well, his total weekly earnings when the company performed well are:

\[ \text{Total weekly earnings} = 500 \, \text{\$/week} + 300 \, \text{\$/week} = 800 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Now, we need to determine how many weeks are in April. April typically has 4 weeks.

\[ \text{Total earnings for April} = 800 \, \text{\$/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 3200 \, \text{\$} \]

Thus, the total amount of money Watson made in April, given that the company performed very well for the whole month, is:

"To determine how many people John lost to, we first need to calculate how many people he beat and then subtract that number from the total number of people he arm wrestled.

John beats 80% of the 20 people he arm wrestled. To find out how many people he beats, we calculate 80% of 20:

\[ 0.80 \times 20 = 16 \]

This means John beat 16 people. Since he arm wrestled 20 people in total, the number of people he lost to is:

\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many loaves of bread are sold in the morning. Since two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning, we calculate:

\[
\text{Morning sales} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
\]

Next, we find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales:

\[
\text{Loaves left after morning} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
\]

In the afternoon and evening, half of the remaining loaves are sold equally. Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening combined is:

\[
\text{Afternoon and evening sales combined} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
\]

Since the loaves sold in the afternoon and evening are sold equally, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[
\text{Afternoon sales} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \text{ loaves}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{5}

"To determine the savings, we need to calculate the total cost if bought at full price and then subtract the total cost if bought with the discounts.

First, let's calculate the cost of 2 tubs of ice cream at full price:
- Full price for 1 tub of ice cream: $13
- Cost for 2 tubs at full price: \( 2 \times 13 = 26 \)

Next, let's calculate the cost of 4 packets of milk at full price:
- Full price for 1 packet of milk: $11 (since the discount for milk is $0.5, the full price is $11)
- Cost for 4 packets at full price: \( 4 \times 11 = 44 \)

Now, let's calculate the total cost if bought with the discounts:
- Discounted price for 1 tub of ice cream: $11
- Cost for 2 tubs at discounted price: \( 2 \times 11 = 22 \)
- Discounted price for 1 packet of milk: \( 11 - 0.5 = 10.5 \)
- Cost for 4 packets at discounted price: \( 4 \times 10.5 = 42 \)

Finally, let's calculate the savings:
- Total cost at full price: \( 26 + 44 = 70 \)
- Total cost with discounts: \( 22 + 42 = 64 \)

"To determine the number of new limbs Helena's serum will cause a person to grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and extra legs that grow based on the given growth rates.

The serum makes a person grow an extra arm every three days. So, in fifteen days, the number of extra arms grown is:
\[ \frac{15}{3} = 5 \text{ extra arms} \]

The serum also makes a person grow an extra leg every five days. So, in fifteen days, the number of extra legs grown is:
\[ \frac{15}{5} = 3 \text{ extra legs} \]

The total number of new limbs grown after fifteen days is the sum of the extra arms and extra legs:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \]

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
\[ 6 \text{ suits} \times \$100 \text{ per suit} = \$600 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
\[ 3 \text{ suitcases} \times \$50 \text{ per suitcase} = \$150 \]

Now, let's determine the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit:
\[ 5 \times \$100 + \$700 = \$500 + \$700 = \$1200 \]

Now, let's sum up all the expenses:
\[ \$600 \text{ (suits)} + \$150 \text{ (suitcases)} + \$1200 \text{ (flight ticket)} = \$2050 \]

The total amount Theo has for the trip is $6000. He wants to save $2000, so the amount he can spend on the trip is:
\[ \$6000 - \$2000 = \$4000 \]

To find out how much he can spend on gifts, we subtract the total expenses from the amount he can spend:
\[ \$4000 - \$2050 = \$1950 \]

Therefore, the amount Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa is:

"To determine the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum up the results.

First, let's identify the number of people in the family:
- There are 5 people in the family.

Next, we categorize the consumption:
- Three people eat 3 eggs each day.
- The remaining two people eat 2 eggs each day.

Calculate the daily egg consumption for the three people:
\[ 3 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ eggs/person/day} = 9 \text{ eggs/day} \]

Calculate the daily egg consumption for the two people:
\[ 2 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ eggs/person/day} = 4 \text{ eggs/day} \]

Now, add the daily egg consumption of both groups:
\[ 9 \text{ eggs/day} + 4 \text{ eggs/day} = 13 \text{ eggs/day} \]

To find the total egg consumption for a week (7 days), multiply the daily consumption by 7:
\[ 13 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 91 \text{ eggs} \]

Thus, the family will consume \(\boxed{91}\) eggs in a week."

- Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn.
- Trent is 5 years older than Jane.

First, calculate Jane's age:
\[ \text{Jane's age} = \text{Quinn's age} - 3 = 30 - 3 = 27 \]

Next, calculate Trent's age:
\[ \text{Trent's age} = \text{Jane's age} + 5 = 27 + 5 = 32 \]

So, Trent is 32 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 32 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the current population of Chile based on the given information.

First, let's determine Noah's age six years ago. Since Cera is currently 46 years old, six years ago she was:
\[ 46 - 6 = 40 \text{ years old} \]

Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah's age six years ago was:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ years old} \]

Therefore, Noah's current age is:
\[ 20 + 6 = 26 \text{ years old} \]

According to the problem, six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age. Six years ago, Noah was 20 years old, so the population of Chile six years ago was:
\[ 3000 \times 20 = 60000 \]

Since the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now, the current population of Chile is:
\[ 60000 \times 2 = 120000 \]

Thus, the population of Chile now is:
\[ \boxed{120000} \]"
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 30 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha initially invited:

- Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each, so that's \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people.
- She also invited 3 families with 4 people each, so that's \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people.

Adding these together, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we need to account for the people who couldn't come due to illness and those with previous commitments:

- 8 people couldn't come due to illness.
- 1/4 of the 8 people with illness had previous commitments, so \(8 \times \frac{1}{4} = 2\) people had previous commitments.

Therefore, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Subtracting the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited gives us the number of people who showed up for the party:

\[24 - 10 = 14\]

So, the final numerical answer is:
14"
"First, let's determine the number of marbles Solomon received from his father. Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna. His father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Therefore, the number of marbles Solomon received from his father is:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store. He initially had 50 marbles in the store and added 20 marbles from Johanna. Then, his father gave him 8 more marbles. So, the total number of marbles is:

\[
50 + 20 + 8 = 78
\]

Each marble weighs 2 kg. Therefore, the total weight of the marbles is:

\[
78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kg}
\]

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{156}

"First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is in the shape of a rectangular prism, and the volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth (height) = 5 feet

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 5 \]

Calculating the volume:

\[ V = 24 \times 5 = 120 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost to fill the pool is given by the volume of the pool multiplied by the cost per cubic foot:

\[ \text{Cost} = \text{Volume} \times \text{Cost per cubic foot} \]

Given that the cost per cubic foot is $0.1:

\[ \text{Cost} = 120 \times 0.1 \]

Calculating the cost:

\[ \text{Cost} = 12 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The number of boys in the classroom is 30.
2. The number of girls is 3 times the number of boys. Therefore, the number of girls is \(3 \times 30 = 90\).
3. The number of nongendered children is \(\frac{1}{10}\) of the number of boys. Therefore, the number of nongendered children is \(\frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3\).

To find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children together:

\[
\text{Total children} = \text{Number of boys} + \text{Number of girls} + \text{Number of nongendered children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123
\]

The total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and there are 45 electric wires, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles.

Let \( P \) be the number of electric poles and \( W \) be the number of electric wires. According to the ratio, we have:
\[ \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Given \( W = 45 \), we substitute this value into the proportion:
\[ \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \]

To find \( P \), we solve the equation by cross-multiplying:
\[ P \times 3 = 45 \times 1 \]
\[ 3P = 45 \]
\[ P = \frac{45}{3} \]
\[ P = 15 \]

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

\[
\boxed{15}

"First, let's determine the total number of people at the party at the beginning. There were 25 men and 15 women, so the total number of people was:

\[ 25 + 15 = 40 \]

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. This means that 1/4 of 40 people left:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

So, 10 people left the party. If 22 men stayed at the party, we can determine the number of men who left by subtracting the number of men who stayed from the total number of men:

\[ 25 - 22 = 3 \]

Since 10 people in total left the party and 3 of them were men, the remaining 7 people must have been women. Therefore, the number of women who left is:

\[ 15 - 7 = 8 \]

So, the number of women left at the party is:

\[ 15 - 8 = 7 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 7 \]"
"First, we need to determine the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book and the book costs $4, we can calculate the cost of the magazine as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of magazine} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cost of book} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of the pen, which is $1 less than the cost of the magazine. Therefore:

\[ \text{Cost of pen} = \text{Cost of magazine} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 \]

So, the cost of the pen is $1."
"First, let's determine the total number of pencils Jam has. We know that Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. Let's denote the number of pencils in each box as \( x \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]

To find the value of \( x \), we solve the equation step by step:

\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]
\[ 3x = 26 - 2 \]
\[ 3x = 24 \]
\[ x = \frac{24}{3} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, each box contains 8 pencils. Now, we can calculate the total number of pencils Jam has:

\[ 3 \times 8 + 2 = 24 + 2 = 26 \]

Jam has 26 pencils. Her sister Meg has 46 pencils. To find out how many boxes are needed to store all their pencils, we need to determine the total number of pencils and then divide by the number of pencils each box can hold (which is 8).

The total number of pencils is:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Now, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total weakening of the coffee due to the cooling and the addition of cream.

First, let's calculate the weakening due to cooling. Each degree of cooling weakens the coffee by 13 milliliters. Shannon cools the coffee by 65 degrees, so the weakening due to cooling is:
\[ 65 \text{ degrees} \times 13 \text{ milliliters/degree} = 845 \text{ milliliters} \]

Next, we need to account for the weakening due to the addition of cream. Adding 15 milliliters of cream weakens the coffee by 12 milliliters. Therefore, the weakening due to the addition of cream is:
\[ 15 \text{ milliliters} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/15 milliliters} = 12 \text{ milliliters} \]

Now, we add the weakening due to cooling and the weakening due to the addition of cream to find the total weakening of the coffee:
\[ 845 \text{ milliliters} + 12 \text{ milliliters} = 857 \text{ milliliters} \]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is \(\boxed{857}\) milliliters weaker when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream."
"To determine how many old records the 5 people brought in, we need to understand the trade ratio and how it applies to the number of new records they received.

Given:
- 2 old records can be traded for 1 new record.
- 5 people leave with 7 new records.

First, we need to find out how many old records are required to get 7 new records. Since 2 old records trade for 1 new record, to get 7 new records, we need:
\[ 7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records per new record} = 14 \text{ old records} \]

Therefore, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records."
"First, let's determine the number of junior and senior programmers.

Given that the total number of employees is 100 and the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:
\[ \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers is:
\[ \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Next, we know that each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total amount paid to junior programmers per month is:
\[ \text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

The senior programmers are paid $400 more than the junior programmers, so each senior programmer is paid:
\[ \text{Payment to each senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400 \]

Therefore, the total amount paid to senior programmers per month is:
\[ \text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

Finally, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers:
\[ \text{Total payment} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{224000} \]"
"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the number of people on the bus became \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on, so the number of people on the bus became \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).

We are given that at the third stop, there were 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( 14 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 14 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school: \(24 - 2 = 22\) lollipops left.
3. He passes 14 lollipops to his friends: \(22 - 14 = 8\) lollipops left.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which means he buys \(2 \times 14 = 28\) lollipops: \(8 + 28 = 36\) lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night: \(36 - 3 = 33\) lollipops.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning: \(33 - 2 = 31\) lollipops.

So, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is 31.

"To determine how long it will take to fully charge the cell phone from 60% to 100%, we first need to calculate the percentage of charging required. The phone needs to charge from 60% to 100%, which is a 40% increase.

Given that the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the total time required for a 40% increase as follows:

\[ \text{Time required} = 40 \text{ percentage points} \times 3 \text{ minutes/percentage point} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to convert this time from minutes to hours:

\[ 120 \text{ minutes} = \frac{120}{60} \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \text{ hours} \]"
"Erin initially has 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her another 10 lollipops, so she now has:

"First, let's calculate the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip where they spent $80. For every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. 

Rewards earned = $80 / $20 = 4 rewards

Each reward is worth $1 off, so the customer earned 4 rewards, which means they can get $4 off their next purchase.

Next, let's calculate the rewards earned from their current shopping trip where they spent $43. 

Rewards earned = $43 / $20 = 2.15

Since rewards can only be in whole numbers, the customer earns 2 rewards (as they can only use whole rewards).

The customer can use these 2 rewards to get $2 off their purchase. However, they also used a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. Since they used 2 rewards, the coupon took 2 * $1 = $2 off the price.

So, the total discount from the rewards and the coupon is $2 + $2 = $4.

The original cost of the shopping trip was $43. After applying the $4 discount, the customer pays:

$43 - $4 = $39

Therefore, the customer paid $39 on this shopping trip."
"To determine which job Nick will make more money at, we need to calculate the net pay for both jobs.

**Job A:**
1. Annual gross pay: $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
2. State tax rate: 20%
3. State tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
4. Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

**Job B:**
1. Annual gross pay: $42,000
2. Property tax: $6,000
3. Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
4. Net income tax rate: 10%
5. Net income tax: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
6. Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:
- Job A net pay: $24,000
- Job B net pay: $32,400

The difference in net pay between Job B and Job A is:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate compared to the other job."

"First, let's calculate the value of Maria's shares after the first year. Maria initially buys 8 shares at $8 each, so the initial total value of her shares is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8/\text{share} = \$64 \]

After the first year, the stock price increases by 50%. The new price per share after the increase is:

\[ \$8 \times (1 + 0.50) = \$8 \times 1.50 = \$12 \]

So, the value of her 8 shares after the first year is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12/\text{share} = \$96 \]

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. The new price per share after the decrease is:

"First, let's determine how many hot dogs Thomas ate. Since Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, we calculate:

\[ \text{Thomas's hot dogs} = 3 \times \text{Luke's hot dogs} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Next, we find out how many hot dogs John ate. John ate half the amount that Thomas ate, so:

\[ \text{John's hot dogs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Thomas's hot dogs} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \]

Now, to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number John ate:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's hot dogs} - \text{Luke's hot dogs} = 3 - 2 = 1 \]

So, John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). Consequently, the number of students in the smallest group will be \( x - 10 \).

Given that the total number of students is 200, we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of students in all three groups:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two equal groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:

Thus, the number of students in the smallest group is 60."
"Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \) and the number of chickens as \( H \). According to the problem, the total number of animals is 60, and there are twice as many chickens as cows. This gives us the following equations:

\[ H + C = 60 \]
\[ H = 2C \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( C \):

\[ 2C + C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:

\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of legs. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:

\[ \text{Total legs} = (2 \times H) + (4 \times C) = (2 \times 40) + (4 \times 20) = 80 + 80 = 160 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the weights of the animals based on the given information and then calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal.

1. **Weight of the Pink Frog:**
   - Given: 50 pounds.

2. **Weight of the Blue Beetle:**
   - Since the pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle, the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.

3. **Weight of the Green Toad:**
   - Since the pink frog weighs the same as the green toad, the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.

4. **Weight of the Yellow Snake:**
   - The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake.
   - Therefore, the yellow snake weighs \( 50 + 10 = 60 \) pounds.

5. **Weight of the Red Bird:**
   - The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird.
   - Therefore, the red bird weighs \( 50 - 20 = 30 \) pounds.

Now, we have the weights of all the animals:
- Pink Frog: 50 pounds
- Blue Beetle: 50 pounds
- Green Toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow Snake: 60 pounds
- Red Bird: 30 pounds

Next, we calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the additional distance Tyson should run each day.
2. Determine the total distance Tyson runs each day after taking the coach's advice.
3. Calculate the total distance Tyson runs in a month.
4. Since June has 30 days, we will multiply the daily distance by 30.

First, let's find out how much more Tyson should run each day. The coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters than he currently runs. Since Tyson currently runs 5000 meters, the additional distance is:
\[ \text{Additional distance} = 5000 \times \frac{1}{5} = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

So, the total distance Tyson should run each day is:
\[ \text{Total daily distance} = 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters} \]

Next, we calculate the total distance Tyson runs in a month. Since June has 30 days, the total distance is:
\[ \text{Total distance in June} = 6000 \times 30 = 180000 \text{ meters} \]

Therefore, the total distance Tyson covered in June is:

\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \text{ legs} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of legs:
\[ 160 + 150 = 310 \]

So, the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is:
\[ 310 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Jenny buys in a week:
\[ 1 \text{ bag} \times 36 \text{ cookies per bag} = 36 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cookies Jenny puts in her son's lunch box over the week:
\[ 4 \text{ cookies/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 20 \text{ cookies} \]

Then, we calculate the number of cookies her husband eats over the week:
\[ 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ cookies} \]

Now, we can find out how many cookies are left for Jenny to eat by subtracting the cookies given to her son and the cookies eaten by her husband from the total number of cookies:
\[ 36 \text{ cookies} - 20 \text{ cookies} - 7 \text{ cookies} = 9 \text{ cookies} \]

So, Jenny eats:
\[ 9 \text{ cookies} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 9 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the shirts without any discount. Davos bought 2 shirts, each costing $30, so the total cost is:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to apply the 40% discount. A 40% discount means Davos pays 60% of the original price. To find out how much he pays, we calculate 60% of $60:

\[ 60 \times 0.60 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final amount Davos paid for the 2 shirts is:

\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"First, let's calculate the daily revenue from tractors:
- They sold 10 tractors a day.
- Each tractor was sold for $100.

So, the daily revenue from tractors is:
\[ 10 \text{ tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate the daily revenue from silos:
- They sell 5 silos a day.
- Each silo is sold for $220.

So, the daily revenue from silos is:
\[ 5 \text{ silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day} \]

Now, we need to find the percentage increase in daily revenue from making silos compared to making tractors:
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New revenue} - \text{Old revenue}}{\text{Old revenue}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\$1100 - \$1000}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{\$100}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage more they are making per day now is:
\[ \boxed{10\%} \]"
"To calculate the total annual cost for Madeline's dog, we need to break down the costs for each category and then sum them up for a year.

1. **Food Cost:**
   - Cost per week: $25
   - Weeks per month: 4
   - Monthly cost of food: $25 * 4 = $100
   - Annual cost of food: $100 * 12 = $1200

2. **Treats Cost:**
   - Cost per month: $20
   - Annual cost of treats: $20 * 12 = $240

3. **Medicine Cost:**
   - Cost per month: $100
   - Annual cost of medicine: $100 * 12 = $1200

Now, we sum up the annual costs for all categories:
- Annual cost of food: $1200
- Annual cost of treats: $240
- Annual cost of medicine: $1200

Total annual cost: $1200 + $240 + $1200 = $2640

The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total hours of Peyton's after-work activities, let's break down each activity:

- Monday: Yoga class - 1 hour
- Tuesday: Cooking class - 3 times the yoga class, so 3 * 1 = 3 hours
- Wednesday: Cheese-tasting event - 0.5 hours
- Thursday: Museum tour - half the cooking class, so 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours
- Friday: Errands - 2 hours

Now, let's sum these up:

1 (Monday) + 3 (Tuesday) + 0.5 (Wednesday) + 1.5 (Thursday) + 2 (Friday) = 7.5 hours

The total number of hours for all of Peyton's after-work activities is 7.5 hours."
"First, let's determine the number of plant pots needed for the roses. Since the number of plant pots needed for the roses is twice the number needed for the daisies, and 30 plant pots are needed for the daisies, the number of plant pots needed for the roses is:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of plant pots needed for both the daisies and the roses:

\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \]

April had already bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many plant pots she has left over, we subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number of plant pots she already bought:

\[ 100 - 90 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of plant pots April has left over is:

\[ 10 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Andrea started with $36.
2. She spent some money on a sweater that cost $11.
3. She also gave her brother $4.

To find out how much money Andrea saved, we need to subtract the total amount she spent from the initial amount she had.

First, calculate the total amount spent:
\[ \text{Total spent} = \text{Cost of sweater} + \text{Amount given to brother} = 11 + 4 = 15 \]

Next, subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:
\[ \text{Amount saved} = \text{Initial amount} - \text{Total spent} = 36 - 15 = 21 \]

So, Andrea saved $21.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 21 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming.

John spends 6 hours boating. He spends half that time swimming, which is:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total time he spent watching shows. He watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is:
\[ 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 \text{ hours} \]

This 15 hours represents 30% of the total time he spent on his vacation. Let \( T \) be the total time spent on the vacation. We can set up the equation:
\[ 0.30T = 15 \]

Solving for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John spent 40% of his total time sightseeing. Therefore, the time spent sightseeing is:
\[ 0.40 \times 50 = 20 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Annabelle will earn from her first job. She earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours, so her earnings from the first job are:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Annabelle will earn from her second job. She earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours, so her earnings from the second job are:
\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's find the total amount of money Annabelle will have after working at both jobs. She already has $80 in her savings, so her total savings will be:
\[ 80 + 200 + 75 = 355 \text{ dollars} \]

The phone costs $400, so the amount of money Annabelle still needs to save is:
\[ 400 - 355 = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"First, let's determine the height of the second tree. Since the second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, and the shortest tree is 6 feet tall, the height of the second tree is:
\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the combined height of the shortest and the second tree:
\[ 6 + 11 = 17 \text{ feet} \]

The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and the second tree:
\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height of the tallest tree is:
\[ 34 \text{ feet} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the toy cars Dean bought. Since each toy car costs $2 and he bought 6 of them, the total cost for the toy cars is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the teddy bears Dean bought. Since each teddy bear costs $1 and he bought 5 of them, the total cost for the teddy bears is:
\[ 5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's find the total amount Dean spent on the toy cars and teddy bears:
\[ 12 + 5 = 17 \text{ dollars} \]

Dean initially had $28, so after spending $17, the amount of money he has left is:
\[ 28 - 17 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

Dean's mother then gives him an extra $10, so the total amount of money Dean has now is:
\[ 11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we first need to calculate the total cost of the activities she wants to do for herself and her friends.

1. **Cost of mini-golf**: Morgan wants to play one round of mini-golf, which costs $5.
2. **Cost of arcade tokens**: Morgan wants to have $5 worth of arcade tokens.
3. **Cost of go-karts**: Morgan wants to ride the go-karts twice, and each ride costs $10, so the total cost for go-karts is $10 * 2 = $20.

Now, we add up the costs of these activities:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of mini-golf} + \text{Cost of arcade tokens} + \text{Cost of go-karts} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 5 + 5 + 20 = 30 \]

Morgan's total budget for the party is $90. After accounting for the $30 spent on the activities, the remaining budget is:
\[ \text{Remaining budget} = 90 - 30 = 60 \]

Each friend will get $5 worth of arcade tokens, and the cost of mini-golf and go-karts is already covered by Morgan's budget. Therefore, the number of friends she can invite is determined by the remaining budget for arcade tokens:
\[ \text{Number of friends} = \frac{\text{Remaining budget}}{\text{Cost per friend's tokens}} \]
\[ \text{Number of friends} = \frac{60}{5} = 12 \]

So, Morgan can invite 12 friends. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Marisa spends on lollipops each day. Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and she buys 4 lollipops each day. So, the cost per day is:

\[ 4 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 100 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, 100 cents is equivalent to 1 dollar. So, Marisa spends $1 each day on lollipops.

Next, we need to determine how much money Marisa saves each day. Since she gets $5 as pocket money every day and spends $1 on lollipops, the amount she saves each day is:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars} - 1 \text{ dollar} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much she saves over 5 days. Since she saves $4 each day, over 5 days she saves:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Billy spent on gumballs. He bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, so the total cost for the gumballs is:
\[ 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Since he took half of his change and spent it on gumballs, the total amount of money he had initially was twice the amount he spent on gumballs:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Billy started with $10, so the amount of money he spent on candy is:
\[ 10 - 4 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of the candy is $1.5 per pound. To find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we divide the total amount spent on candy by the cost per pound:
\[ \frac{6}{1.5} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( x \). According to the problem, Carver's age (45 years) is 5 years less than twice his son's age. We can express this relationship with the following equation:

\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 25 \]"
"First, let's calculate the distance of the entire trip from the first city to the third city and back to the first city.

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city back to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the second and third city trip, which is \(100 - 50 = 50\) miles.

So, the total distance for one complete round trip (first to second, then second to third, and finally third to first) is:
\[75 + 100 + 50 = 225 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[225 \times 3 = 675 \text{ miles}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance traveled in one day by the service interval:
\[\frac{675}{18000} = \frac{675 \div 75}{18000 \div 75} = \frac{9}{240} = \frac{3}{80}\]

To find out how many days it goes between services, we take the reciprocal of \(\frac{3}{80}\), which is \(\frac{80}{3}\). Calculating this gives:
\[\frac{80}{3} \approx 26.67\]

Since the train can't go a fraction of a day between services, we round up to the next whole number. Therefore, the train goes between services every 27 days.

The final numerical answer is:
\[27\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the amount of stuffing required for a collie bed. Since a collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed, we calculate the average of 8 pounds and 2 pounds:

\[
\text{Stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds. Since each chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing and Mark is making 4 chihuahua beds:

\[
\text{Total stuffing for chihuahua beds} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

Then, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the collie beds. Since each collie bed requires 5 pounds of stuffing and Mark is making 3 collie beds:

\[
\text{Total stuffing for collie beds} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the total stuffing required for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds to find the total amount of stuffing Mark needs:

\[
\text{Total stuffing} = 8 + 15 = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
23

"First, let's calculate the time John spent driving to his friend's house. The distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, and he drives at a speed of 70 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time taken to drive to his friend's house is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} = \frac{200 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{200}{70} \text{ hours} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 2.857 \text{ hours} \]

Next, John took a detour that added 10 miles to his trip, making the total distance to his friend's house 210 miles. The time taken for this detour is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{210}{70} \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the time John spent driving back home. The distance home is 240 miles, and he drives at a speed of 80 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{back home}} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = \frac{240}{80} \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, the total time for the trip is the sum of the time to his friend's house, the time for the detour, and the time back home:

\[ \text{Total Time} = \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} + \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} + \text{Time}_{\text{back home}} = \frac{20}{7} + 3 + 3 \]

To add these times together, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 7 and 1 is 7, so we convert 3 to a fraction with a denominator of 7:

\[ 3 = \frac{21}{7} \]

So the total time is:

\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{20}{7} + \frac{21}{7} + \frac{21}{7} = \frac{20 + 21 + 21}{7} = \frac{62}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 8.857 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total time for the trip is:

\[ \boxed{\frac{62}{7}} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of fourth-grade students at Small Tree School. We know there are 96 fourth-graders in total.

Next, we need to find out how many fourth-grade boys there are. Since 43 of the 96 students are girls, the number of boys is:
\[ 96 - 43 = 53 \]

On Friday, 5 girls were absent. Therefore, the number of girls present on Friday is:
\[ 43 - 5 = 38 \]

Additionally, 4 boys were absent on Friday. Let \( B \) represent the number of boys present on Friday. The total number of students present on Friday is 96, and we know 38 of them are girls. Therefore, the number of boys present is:
\[ 96 - 38 = 58 \]

Since 4 boys were absent, the number of boys present is:
\[ 58 - 4 = 54 \]

Thus, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School who were present on Friday is:
\[ \boxed{54} \]"
"If there are 6 girls in the park and twice the number of boys, then there are \(2 \times 6 = 12\) boys in the park.

"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test, we start by calculating the total points she has already scored on her first two tests.

Points scored on the first test: 15 points
Points scored on the second test: 18 points

Total points scored on the first two tests:
\[ 15 + 18 = 33 \]

Jane needs a total of at least 42 points across all three tests. To find out how many points she needs on her third test, we subtract the points she has already scored from the required total:

\[ 42 - 33 = 9 \]

Therefore, the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass is:
\[ 9 \]"
"Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as \( C \). According to the problem, \( C = 3 \).

The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is four times the number of customers minus 5, which can be expressed as \( 4C - 5 \). Substituting \( C = 3 \) into this expression, we get:
\[ 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7. \]
So, 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting.

The number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is three times the number of shoplifters, which can be expressed as \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \).

Now, we know the total number of customers and shoplifters who were kicked out:
\[ C + 7 = 3 + 7 = 10. \]

The total number of people kicked out of the Walmart is 50. Therefore, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40. \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we need to first find out how many points Erin had after scoring 14 points.

Given:
- Sara scored 8 points.
- Erin now has three times more points than Sara.

First, calculate the points Erin has now:
\[ \text{Erin's points now} = 3 \times \text{Sara's points} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Erin scored 14 points after reaching 24 points. Therefore, the points Erin had before scoring the 14 points are:
\[ \text{Erin's points before} = \text{Erin's points now} - \text{points scored} = 24 - 14 = 10 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total cost, we need to break down the expenses into different components and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of picture frames:**
   - Each picture frame costs $20.
   - Each frame needs to be etched at an additional 20% cost.
   - The total cost per frame is $20 + 20% of $20 = $20 + $4 = $24.
   - There are 44 seniors, so the total cost for the picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. **Cost of pins:**
   - 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each.
   - The total cost for the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

3. **Cost of cords for officers:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so there are 44 / 4 = 11 officers.
   - Each officer will receive a cord that costs $12.
   - The total cost for the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, we sum up all the costs:
- Cost of picture frames: $1056
- Cost of pins: $10
- Cost of cords: $132

Total cost = $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

"To determine the total cost for Ethan if he makes his own hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the savings from the DIY option and then subtract that from the original cost.

The original cost of the wallpaper is $400. The DIY option saves 20% of this cost. First, we calculate 20% of $400:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.20 \times 400 = 80 \]

This means Ethan saves $80 by making his own wallpaper. Therefore, the total cost for Ethan to make his own wallpaper is:

\[ 400 - 80 = 320 \]

So, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is:

\[ \boxed{320} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Friday Sales**: The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.
2. **Saturday Sales**: The store sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday. Therefore, the number of pairs sold on Saturday is:
   \[
   14 \times 2 = 28 \text{ pairs}
   \]
3. **Sunday Sales**: The store sold one-half the number of pairs sold on Saturday. Therefore, the number of pairs sold on Sunday is:

1 hour (Tuesday) + 2 hours (Thursday) + 2 hours (Saturday) = 5 hours.

So, the total number of hours Hallie had dance practice in a week is 5 hours."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of pieces of equipment and then calculate the cost of the functioning pieces.

1. Let's denote the total number of pieces of equipment as \( N \).
2. According to the problem, 40% of the total number of pieces were faulty. Therefore, the number of faulty pieces is \( 0.4N \).
3. Consequently, the number of functioning pieces is \( N - 0.4N = 0.6N \).
4. The total cost of the equipment is $400,000. Since the faulty pieces are returned, the company only pays for the functioning pieces.
5. The cost of the functioning pieces is \( 0.6N \times \frac{400000}{N} = 0.6 \times 400000 = 240000 \).

Thus, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $240,000.

\[
\text{Number of apples sold on Monday} = \frac{\$56}{\$4 \text{ per apple}} = 14 \text{ apples}
\]

Next, we know that on Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples. On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of apples picked on Wednesday is:

\[
\text{Number of apples picked on Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ apples}
\]

To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we sum the apples picked on each day:

\[
\text{Total number of apples} = \text{Apples picked on Monday} + \text{Apples picked on Tuesday} + \text{Apples picked on Wednesday}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
\text{Total number of apples} = 14 + 12 + 24 = 50
\]

Thus, the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days is:

\[
\boxed{50}

"To determine how many socks Lindsay has missed, we first need to calculate the total number of socks she has washed.

Lindsay washes 10 pairs of socks. Since each pair consists of 2 socks, the total number of socks from the pairs is:
\[ 10 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ socks per pair} = 20 \text{ socks} \]

Additionally, Lindsay washes 15 loose socks. So, the total number of socks she has washed is:
\[ 20 \text{ socks from pairs} + 15 \text{ loose socks} = 35 \text{ socks} \]

Lindsay started with 50 socks. To find out how many socks she has missed, we subtract the number of socks she has washed from the total number of socks:
\[ 50 \text{ socks} - 35 \text{ socks} = 15 \text{ socks} \]

Therefore, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is:

"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we first need to calculate the total interest she will pay over the five months and then find the total amount she will repay. Finally, we will divide this total repayment amount by the number of months.

The formula for the total amount to be repaid is:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} \]
\[ \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Here, the principal (P) is $3,650, the rate (R) is 10% or 0.10, and the time (T) is 5 months. Since the interest rate is given as an annual rate, we need to convert the time into years. There are 12 months in a year, so 5 months is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of a year.

First, calculate the interest:
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 151.665 \]

Now, calculate the total amount to be repaid:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 151.665 = 3801.665 \]

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month for 5 months, we divide the total amount by 5:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3801.665}{5} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.333 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.33 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 760.33 \]"
"First, we calculate the distance Cho hiked. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Cho, the speed is 14 kilometers per hour and the time is 8 hours. So, the distance Cho hiked is:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{h} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, we calculate the distance Chloe hiked. The speed for Chloe is 9 kilometers per hour and the time is 5 hours. So, the distance Chloe hiked is:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{h} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked, we subtract the distance Chloe hiked from the distance Cho hiked:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 80 + 40 = 120 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of silver pesos they have together:
\[ 50 + 100 = 150 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of gold pesos they have together:
\[ 80 + 120 = 200 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Finally, to find the total number of pesos they have together, we add the total number of silver pesos and the total number of gold pesos:

"First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she can make 3 pitchers, the total number of cups is:
\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups/pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to determine the revenue from selling all 36 cups of lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue is:
\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1/\text{cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to find out how much it costs her to make the lemonade. She spent $18 to buy the supplies, so the cost is:
\[ \$18 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue:
\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Millie sells all of the lemonade, and she sells an average of 4 cups per hour. Therefore, the profit per hour is:
\[ \frac{\$18}{4 \text{ hours}} = \$4.50/\text{hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we need to determine the total amount of land he had before selling 3/5 of it. If he had 12.8 hectares left after selling 3/5 of his land, then the 12.8 hectares represent the remaining 2/5 of his land (since 1 - 3/5 = 2/5).

Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had at first as \( L \). According to the problem, \( \frac{2}{5}L = 12.8 \) hectares.

To find \( L \), we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{5}L = 12.8 \]

To solve for \( L \), we multiply both sides of the equation by \( \frac{5}{2} \):
\[ L = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} \]

Now, let's calculate the value of \( L \):
\[ L = 12.8 \times 2.5 \]
\[ L = 32 \]

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 50\% \times 52 = 0.5 \times 52 = 26 \]

Since the choir is evenly split between boys and girls, the number of boys is also 26. Therefore, the total number of female members in the choir is:

\[ \text{Number of female members} = \text{Number of girls} = 26 \]

On the day of the performance, only the female members are performing. However, half of the female members can't make it to the show because their bus breaks down. So, the number of female members who can't make it is:

\[ \text{Number of female members who can't make it} = \frac{1}{2} \times 26 = 13 \]

This means the number of female members who do make it to the show is:

\[ \text{Number of female members who make it} = 26 - 13 = 13 \]

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

\[ \text{Total number of people who sang} = \text{Number of female members who make it} + \text{Number of teachers} = 13 + 3 = 16 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many popsicles Betty and Sam each have based on the given ratio and total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. The total parts of the ratio are 5 + 6 = 11 parts.

Given that the total number of popsicles is 165, we can find out how many popsicles each part of the ratio represents by dividing the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts in the ratio:
\[ \text{Number of popsicles per part} = \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can find out how many popsicles Betty and Sam have:
- Betty has \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \) popsicles.
- Sam has \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

"First, let's convert all the time spent into the same unit. We'll use minutes for this calculation.

Carol spends 4 hours writing a song. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 4 hours is:
\[ 4 \times 60 = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

She spends half that much time recording it, which is:
\[ \frac{240}{2} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

She spends 90 minutes editing it.

The total time spent on all activities is:
\[ 240 + 120 + 90 = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

To find the percentage of her total work time that she spent editing, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{90}{450} \right) \times 100 = \frac{90 \times 100}{450} = \frac{9000}{450} = 20\% \]

"To determine how much money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of sandwiches needed.
2. Determine the total amount of meat and cheese required.
3. Calculate the cost of the meat and cheese.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of sandwiches needed.**
There are 20 people and each sandwich serves 4 people.
\[ \text{Total sandwiches needed} = \frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people/sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total amount of meat and cheese required.**
Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.
\[ \text{Total meat required} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound/sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]
\[ \text{Total cheese required} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound/sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of the meat and cheese.**
The meat costs $7.00 per pound and the cheese costs $3.00 per pound.
\[ \text{Cost of meat} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times \$7.00/\text{pound} = \$35.00 \]
\[ \text{Cost of cheese} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times \$3.00/\text{pound} = \$15.00 \]

"First, let's determine the initial number of corns Allan has. According to the problem, there is twice as much corn as cannolis. Given that Allan initially has 40 cannolis, we can calculate the initial number of corns as follows:

\[ \text{Initial number of corns} = 2 \times \text{Initial number of cannolis} = 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

Next, Allan bought 60 more cannolis at the store. Therefore, the new number of cannolis is:

\[ \text{New number of cannolis} = \text{Initial number of cannolis} + 60 = 40 + 60 = 100 \]

Now, Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he had after buying the additional cannolis. So, the number of corns he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of corns bought} = \text{New number of cannolis} - 40 = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Adding these 60 corns to the initial number of corns, the new total number of corns is:

\[ \text{New total number of corns} = \text{Initial number of corns} + \text{Number of corns bought} = 80 + 60 = 140 \]

Finally, to find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house, we add the new total number of corns to the new total number of cannolis:

\[ \text{Combined total} = \text{New total number of corns} + \text{New number of cannolis} = 140 + 100 = 240 \]

Thus, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:

4. **Remaining Steps**: After these steps, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps. Therefore, the total steps taken before the jog are:
   \[
   5,000 \text{ (school and home)} + 1,000 \text{ (short walk)} + 2,000 \text{ (remaining steps)} = 8,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

5. **Steps Taken During Jog**: To find out how many steps he took during his jog, we subtract the total steps taken before the jog from his daily goal:
   \[
   10,000 \text{ (total goal)} - 8,000 \text{ (steps taken before jog)} = 2,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

Thus, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is:

"First, we need to calculate the total number of words in the book. The book is 45 pages long and averages 200 words per page. Therefore, the total number of words in the book is:
\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Toby to read the entire book. Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute. Therefore, the time it takes to read the book is:
\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby plans to leave as soon as he finishes the book and it takes him 10 minutes to get to the airport. Therefore, the total time Toby will spend from starting to read until he reaches the airport is:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby has 60 minutes until he needs to be at the airport. Therefore, the number of minutes early Toby will be is:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 40 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by employees in May:**
   - Number of employees in May: 40
   - Hours worked per employee per week: 40
   - Weeks in May: 4 (assuming May has 4 weeks)
   - Total hours worked in May: \( 40 \text{ employees} \times 40 \text{ hours/employee/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 6400 \text{ hours} \)

2. **Calculate the total amount paid to employees in May:**
   - Hourly wage: $15
   - Total amount paid in May: \( 6400 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 96000 \text{ dollars} \)

3. **Calculate the number of employees whose contracts expired in June:**
   - Number of employees whose contracts expired: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \)

4. **Calculate the total number of employees remaining in June:**
   - Number of employees remaining: \( 40 - 10 = 30 \)

5. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by employees in June:**
   - Hours worked per employee per week: 40
   - Weeks in June: 4 (assuming June has 4 weeks)
   - Total hours worked in June: \( 30 \text{ employees} \times 40 \text{ hours/employee/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 4800 \text{ hours} \)

6. **Calculate the total amount paid to employees in June:**
   - Hourly wage: $15
   - Total amount paid in June: \( 4800 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 72000 \text{ dollars} \)

7. **Calculate the total amount paid to employees in both months:**
   - Total amount paid in May: $96000
   - Total amount paid in June: $72000
   - Total amount paid in both months: \( 96000 + 72000 = 168000 \text{ dollars} \)

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{168000}

"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is sold in a special deal: ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means for the first pound, Sally pays $3, and for the second pound, she pays $3/2 = $1.50. Therefore, the total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells. The seashells cost $1.50 each, and Sally bought 4 of them. So, the total cost for the seashells is $1.50 * 4 = $6.00.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of all the items Sally bought. The cost of the taffy is $4.50, the cost of the seashells is $6.00, and the cost of the magnets is $0.25 * 4 = $1.00. Adding these together, the total cost is $4.50 + $6.00 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Sally's parents gave her $10 to spend. After spending $11.50, she would be $11.50 - $10 = -$1.50. Since she cannot have negative money, it means she is $1.50 short. Therefore, Sally does not have any money left and is actually $1.50 in debt.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{-1.50}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the two packs of fireworks. The first pack costs $400, and the second pack costs twice as much, which is $800. Adding these together gives:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost of the two packs of fireworks. A 20% discount means Tim pays 80% of the original cost. So, we calculate 80% of $1200:

\[ 1200 \times 0.80 = 960 \]

Now, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted cost of the fireworks:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is:

\[ \boxed{1110} \]"
"Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies a night. Over 30 days, she will eat:
\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, the number of dozens she needs to make is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. We know that 5% of the candles are dangerous and have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. Additionally, 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode. Therefore, 1% of the candles are dangerous and do not have the defect.

First, let's find out how many candles are dangerous:
\[ 50000 \times 0.05 = 2500 \text{ candles} \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these dangerous candles also have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. Since 5% of the candles are dangerous and have the defect, we calculate:
\[ 2500 \times 0.05 = 125 \text{ candles} \]

Thus, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is:
\[ \boxed{125} \]"
"First, we need to determine the discount price for each blouse. The regular price of each blouse is $20, and there is a 30% discount.

To find the discount amount, we calculate 30% of $20:
\[ \text{Discount amount} = 0.30 \times 20 = 6 \]

Subtract the discount amount from the regular price to find the sale price of each blouse:
\[ \text{Sale price} = 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so we need to find the total cost for 4 blouses at the sale price:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 4 \times 14 = 56 \]

Thus, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:
\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees as \( A_{\text{tall}} \), from the shortest trees as \( A_{\text{short}} \), and from the average trees as \( A_{\text{avg}} \).

From the problem, we know:
- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, so \( A_{\text{tall}} = 30 \).
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, so \( A_{\text{short}} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \).
- Joanne gathers \( A_{\text{avg}} \) apples from the average trees.

Her sister gathers:
- Twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
- Three times as many apples from the shortest trees, so \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
- No apples from the average trees, so \( 0 \) apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne and her sister is 500. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total apples gathered as:
\[ A_{\text{tall}} + A_{\text{short}} + A_{\text{avg}} + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 30 + 15 + A_{\text{avg}} + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Simplifying the left side:
\[ 150 + A_{\text{avg}} = 500 \]

Solving for \( A_{\text{avg}} \):
\[ A_{\text{avg}} = 500 - 150 \]
\[ A_{\text{avg}} = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{350} \]"
"Let's denote the number of camels as \( C \) and the number of dromedaries as \( D \).

From the problem, we have two equations:
1. The total number of heads: \( C + D = 180 \)
2. The total number of humps: \( 2C + D = 304 \)

We can solve these equations step by step. First, we'll subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( D \):

\[ (2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180 \]
\[ 2C + D - C - D = 124 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

Now that we know the number of camels, we can substitute \( C = 124 \) back into the first equation to find \( D \):

\[ 124 + D = 180 \]
\[ D = 180 - 124 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 56 \]"
"To determine the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we need to break down the distances traveled each day and then sum them up.

1. **First 4 days:**
   - Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the first 4 days: \( 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \).

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - Tom traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days.
   - Distance traveled in the next 2 days: \( 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \).

3. **The next day:**
   - Tom did not travel at all.
   - Distance traveled on the next day: \( 0 \text{ km} \).

4. **Second week:**
   - Tom traveled 300 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the second week: \( 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \).

Now, we sum up all the distances:
- First 4 days: \( 800 \text{ km} \)
- Next 2 days: \( 240 \text{ km} \)
- The next day: \( 0 \text{ km} \)
- Second week: \( 2100 \text{ km} \)

Total distance traveled: \( 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km} \).

The total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is \(\boxed{3140}\) kilometers."
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to work backwards from the information given about Peter's locker.

1. We know that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
2. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. Therefore, we can find the size of Zack's locker by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4:
   \[
   \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]
3. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. Therefore, we can find the size of Timothy's locker by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2:

"To determine how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to find the difference in elevation between Oliver and Stanley's comb.

Stanley's comb is at an elevation of 10,000 feet (where Stanley was standing) minus the 4,000 feet it fell, which gives us:
\[ 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 \text{ feet} \]

Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. Therefore, the number of feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb is:
\[ 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 \text{ feet} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how much money Mr. Josue received from the second bank. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is $4000. Therefore, the amount from the second bank is:
\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Mr. Josue received from both banks:
\[ 4000 + 8000 = 12000 \]

Now, we add the total amount of money he received from the banks to his initial capital:
\[ 5000 + 12000 = 17000 \]

Thus, the total capital Mr. Josue has now is:

"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, which means a total of \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cats were taken away. Therefore, the number of cats remaining on the rock is \(50 - 20 = 30\).

Later, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse they'd seen. The number of cats that ran away is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \). Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is \(30 - 18 = 12\).

"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service for Bill, we need to break down the cost into different periods based on the pricing changes.

1. **First 6 months**: The cost is $8 per month.
   \[
   6 \text{ months} \times \$8/\text{month} = \$48
   \]

2. **Next 2 months (months 7 and 8)**: The cost is the normal price of $12 per month.
   \[
   2 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$24

"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:
\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much Cole saved from each type of jeans. Cole saved a total of $6, and he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. This means he saved:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]
from the jogger jeans, and the rest, which is:
\[ 6 - 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]
from the tattered jeans.

Now, let's verify the savings. The cost of the tattered jeans is $28, and Cole saved $4 from it. The cost of the jogger jeans is $22, and Cole saved $2 from it. The total savings are:
\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]
which matches the given information.

The question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. The original cost of the jogger jeans is $22, and the original cost of the tattered jeans is $28. The difference is:

"First, let's determine the total number of bird feeders Lillian has. She builds 3 and buys 3 more, so she has a total of 3 + 3 = 6 bird feeders.

Next, we need to calculate the number of birds that each type of feeder attracts. The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each, and the bird feeders Lillian made attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, which means they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

Now, we can calculate the total number of birds that can be expected to visit the garden each day. Since there are 3 store-bought feeders and 3 bird feeders Lillian made, the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders is 3 * 20 = 60 birds, and the total number of birds attracted by the bird feeders Lillian made is 3 * 30 = 90 birds.

Adding these together, the total number of birds expected to visit the garden each day is 60 + 90 = 150 birds.

"First, let's determine the cost of the soup. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. Since the bagel costs $4, we can calculate the cost of the soup as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of soup} = \text{Cost of bagel} + 0.25 \times \text{Cost of bagel} \]
\[ \text{Cost of soup} = 4 + 0.25 \times 4 \]
\[ \text{Cost of soup} = 4 + 1 \]
\[ \text{Cost of soup} = 5 \]

Next, we know the cake costs half the price of the bagel. Since the bagel costs $4, the cake costs:

\[ \text{Cost of cake} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cost of bagel} \]
\[ \text{Cost of cake} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 \]
\[ \text{Cost of cake} = 2 \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the dinner by adding the cost of the soup, the bagel, and the cake:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of soup} + \text{Cost of bagel} + \text{Cost of cake} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 5 + 4 + 2 \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 11 \]

So, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for the dinner she ordered."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of cards Kenny started with. Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( x \).

Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards, so he sells 2/3 of them. The number of cards he sells is \( \frac{2}{3}x \). He sells each card for $1.5, so the total amount of money he earns from selling the cards is \( 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}x = x \).

According to the problem, after selling the cards, Kenny has $50 in spending cash and the remaining $50 to buy the ticket to the amusement park, which costs $100. This means the total amount of money he has after selling the cards is $100. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x = 100 \]

So, Kenny started with \( x = 100 \) cards.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- The pot and pans set costs $120.00.
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so the total for the utensils is $5.00 * 5 = $25.00.

Adding these together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[ 120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $165.00:
\[ 0.20 \times 165.00 = 33.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Charlotte has to pay:

"First, we need to determine how much gas is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we can calculate the amount of gas per container as follows:

\[ \text{Gas per container} = \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5 \text{ containers}} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Josey needed \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a container, so we calculate the amount of gas she needed in gallons:

\[ \text{Gas needed by Josey} = \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to convert gallons to pints. Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we can convert \( \frac{3}{4} \) gallons to pints as follows:

\[ \text{Gas needed by Josey in pints} = \frac{3}{4} \times 8 \text{ pints} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine how much money George spent on chips. We know that George got 3 bags of chips and each bag costs 40 cents. Therefore, the total cost for the chips is:
\[ 3 \times 40 \text{ cents} = 120 \text{ cents} \]

Since George spent $5, which is 500 cents, and he had 1% of his money left after buying the chips, we can calculate how much money he had left:
\[ 500 \text{ cents} - 120 \text{ cents} = 380 \text{ cents} \]
This means that 1% of his money is 380 cents, so 100% of his money is:
\[ 380 \text{ cents} \times 100 = 38000 \text{ cents} \]
This confirms that George initially had 500 cents, and after spending 120 cents on chips, he had 380 cents left, which is 7.6% of his initial amount, not 1%. Let's correct this and assume he had 500 cents initially and spent 120 cents on chips, leaving him with 380 cents, which is 7.6% of 500 cents, not 1%. This means we need to recheck the problem statement or our interpretation. However, the problem states he had 1% left, so we'll assume the problem is correctly stated and proceed with the given numbers.

Now, we need to find out how much money George spent on candy bars. Since he spent 120 cents on chips, the remaining 380 cents must have been spent on candy bars. Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so the number of candy bars he bought is:
\[ \frac{380 \text{ cents}}{75 \text{ cents per candy bar}} = \frac{380}{75} = \frac{76}{15} \approx 5.0667 \]
Since the number of candy bars must be a whole number, and considering the context of the problem, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 5.

Therefore, the number of candy bars George bought is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"

"First, let's determine the amount of onions Antoine uses. The recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, and he doubles that amount:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00 \text{ per pound} = \$8.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box is $2.00:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00 \text{ per box} = \$4.00 \]

Adding the cost of the onions and the beef stock gives us the total cost:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

\[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00 \text{ per serving} \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is:

\[ \$2.00 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ \$2.00 \]"
"First, let's determine the time it takes for Wayne to drive to the theater. According to the problem, it takes Wayne 4 minutes to drive to the theater.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes for Bernadette to drive to the theater. The problem states that the drive from Bernadette’s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne’s hotel. Therefore, we calculate the time for Bernadette's drive as follows:
\[
\text{Time for Bernadette's drive} = 4 \times \text{Time for Wayne's drive} = 4 \times 4 \text{ minutes} = 16 \text{ minutes}
\]

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. To find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave, we subtract the time it takes Wayne to drive to the theater from the time it takes Bernadette to drive to the theater:
\[
\text{Time Bernadette should leave earlier} = \text{Time for Bernadette's drive} - \text{Time for Wayne's drive} = 16 \text{ minutes} - 4 \text{ minutes} = 12 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, Bernadette should leave 12 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}

"To solve this problem, we need to convert the length from yards to feet and then use the area to find the width. Finally, we will calculate the perimeter.

1. **Convert the length from yards to feet:**
   - 1 yard = 3 feet
   - Length = 3 yards = 3 * 3 feet = 9 feet

2. **Find the width using the area formula:**
   - Area = Length * Width
   - 360 square feet = 9 feet * Width
   - Width = 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet

3. **Calculate the perimeter:**
   - Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
   - Perimeter = 2 * (9 feet + 40 feet) = 2 * 49 feet = 98 feet

The final numerical answer is 98 feet."
"First, let's calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

So, the total number of beads Elizabeth bought is:
\[ 1 \text{ pack of red} + 2 \text{ packs of clear} = 1 \times 20 + 2 \times 20 = 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ beads} \]

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

So, the total number of beads Margareth bought is:
\[ 3 \text{ packs of blue} + 4 \text{ packs of red} = 3 \times 20 + 4 \times 20 = 60 + 80 = 140 \text{ beads} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:
\[ 140 \text{ beads} - 60 \text{ beads} = 80 \text{ beads} \]

So, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven. Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour. Therefore, the total temperature increase from the oven is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, we calculate the temperature decrease due to the window. Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Therefore, the total temperature decrease from the window is:
\[ \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 3 \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 6 \text{ degrees} \]

Now, we can find the final temperature by starting with the initial temperature and adding the temperature increase from the oven and then subtracting the temperature decrease from the window:

"First, let's convert all times to minutes for easier calculation:
- Jon's total time: \(40 + 100 + 50 = 190\) minutes.
- James' swim time: \(40 \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36\) minutes.
- James' bike time: \(100 + 5 = 105\) minutes.
- James' run time: Let's denote this as \(R\) minutes.

James' total time is the sum of his swim, bike, and run times:
\[36 + 105 + R = 141 + R\]

We know that Jon won the race by 10 minutes, so James' total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[141 + R = 190 + 10\]
\[141 + R = 200\]
\[R = 200 - 141\]
\[R = 59\]

So, James took 59 minutes to do the run. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's convert the length of Movie C from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the length of Movie C in minutes as follows:

\[ 1.25 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, the length of Movie B in minutes is:

\[ 75 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, we can find the length of Movie A by dividing the length of Movie B by 4:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ minutes}}{4} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"First, we need to determine how many miles the horse runs. The horse runs at a speed of 32 miles per hour for 30 minutes, which is half an hour. Therefore, the distance the horse runs is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 32 \, \text{MPH} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 16 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of hay the horse eats. Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, the total amount of hay eaten is:

\[ \text{Total Hay} = 16 \, \text{miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \, \text{bail/mile} = 8 \, \text{bails} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the hay. Since each bail of hay costs $3, the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 8 \, \text{bails} \times 3 \, \text{dollars/bail} = 24 \, \text{dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which amounts to:

\[ \text{Total Money} = 6 \times 5 = 30 \, \text{dollars} \]

The change Michael has after buying the hay is:

\[ \text{Change} = \text{Total Money} - \text{Total Cost} = 30 - 24 = 6 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the regular price of the popcorn as \( P \).

The cost of the super ticket is $20, and the cost of the popcorn and soda with the super ticket is $20 + $1 = $21.

The cost of buying a movie ticket for $12 and a popcorn and soda at regular prices is $12 + \( P \) + $3 = $15 + \( P \).

According to the problem, you saved $2 by choosing the super ticket. Therefore, the cost of the super ticket minus the cost of buying a movie ticket and a popcorn and soda at regular prices is $2. We can set up the following equation:

\[ 21 - (15 + P) = 2 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 21 - 15 - P = 2 \]
\[ 6 - P = 2 \]
\[ P = 6 - 2 \]
\[ P = 4 \]

So, the regular price of the popcorn is $4.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the initial cost per balloon and then calculate the new cost per balloon after the price increase. Finally, we will use this new cost to find out how much Bentley paid for 170 balloons.

First, let's find the initial cost per balloon. The total cost for 20 balloons was $900. Therefore, the cost per balloon initially is:
\[
\text{Initial cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars}
\]

Two days later, the cost per balloon increased by $20. So, the new cost per balloon is:
\[
\text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we need to find out how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons at the new price. The total cost for 170 balloons at the new price is:
\[
\text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = 170 \times 65

"First, let's determine how many sapphires Jenna has left after the trade. Jenna starts with 8 sapphires and trades 3 of them, so she has:

\[ 8 - 3 = 5 \text{ sapphires} \]

Next, we calculate the value of the sapphires Jenna has left. Since each sapphire is worth $800, the value of the 5 sapphires is:

\[ 5 \times 800 = 4000 \text{ dollars} \]

Jenna trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. Now, we need to determine the value of the rubies. Since each ruby is worth $1200, the value of the 2 rubies is:

\[ 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the total value of all Jenna's jewels, we add the value of the sapphires and the value of the rubies:

"First, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the raised bed) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

For one raised bed, the volume is:

\[ V = 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:

\[ \text{Total Volume} = 10 \times 32 \, \text{cubic feet} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of Bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet per bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{dollars per bag} = 1920 \, \text{dollars} \]

Thus, the total cost for the potting soil is:

"First, let's determine the number of green cards. We know that there are 15 red cards and that the number of green cards is 60% more than the number of red cards.

The number of green cards can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + (0.60 \times 15) \]

Let's calculate this:
\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + (0.60 \times 15) = 15 + 9 = 24 \]

Next, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards:
\[ \text{Number of yellow cards} = \text{Number of red cards} + \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + 24 = 39 \]

Now, we can find the total number of cards by adding the number of red, green, and yellow cards:
\[ \text{Total number of cards} = \text{Number of red cards} + \text{Number of green cards} + \text{Number of yellow cards} = 15 + 24 + 39 \]

"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of the feed.

1. **Sugar Cubes:**
   - Each box weighs 1 pound.
   - He buys 2 boxes.
   - Total weight of sugar cubes = 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

2. **Carrots:**
   - Each bag weighs 12 pounds.
   - He buys 4 bags.
   - Total weight of carrots = 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

3. **Hay:**
   - Each bale weighs 75 pounds.
   - He buys 42 bales.
   - Total weight of hay = 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

4. **Oats:**
   - Each sack weighs 65 pounds.
   - He buys 20 sacks.
   - Total weight of oats = 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

Now, we sum the weights of all the feed items to find the total weight:
- Total weight = Weight of sugar cubes + Weight of carrots + Weight of hay + Weight of oats
- Total weight = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 pounds.

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find the number of trips needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since partial trips are not possible):
- Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity = 4500 / 2250 = 2.

Therefore, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

"First, let's calculate the total number of pencils the class started with. Since there are 30 students and each student started with 10 pencils, the total number of pencils is:

\[ 30 \times 10 = 300 \]

After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. So, the number of pencils used is:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 300 = 60 \]

This means the number of pencils remaining after two months is:

\[ 300 - 60 = 240 \]

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. So, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 240 = 80 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of cookies Matt can have is given by the formula: half the number of carrot sticks plus two extra. This can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Cookies} = \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know that Matt wants to eat a total of 5 cookies. So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first isolate the term involving \( x \) by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides by 2:
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, we need to convert all measurements to the same unit for easier calculation. Since the shark's length is given in feet, we will convert the remoras' length from inches to feet.

There are 12 inches in a foot, so the length of each remora is:
\[ 6 \text{ inches} = \frac{6}{12} \text{ feet} = 0.5 \text{ feet} \]

Since there are 2 remoras, the combined length of the remoras is:
\[ 2 \times 0.5 \text{ feet} = 1 \text{ foot} \]

Now, we need to find what percentage of the shark's body length (10 feet) is the combined length of the remoras (1 foot). The formula to calculate the percentage is:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Length of remoras}}{\text{Length of shark}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1 \text{ foot}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"

"To find out how many kids are not allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion. First, we calculate the number of kids who are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both.

The number of kids allergic to dairy is 9.
The number of kids allergic to peanuts is 6.
The number of kids allergic to both is 3.

Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion, the number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both is:
\[ 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

This means 12 kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both. Therefore, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is the total number of kids in the class minus the number of kids who are allergic to something:
\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \]

So, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"

"First, let's calculate the cost of the plane tickets. Since Tom and his wife each need a plane ticket, the total cost for the plane tickets is:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of the hotel. The hotel is 20% more expensive than its normal price. The normal price of the hotel per day is $1500. Therefore, the increased price per day is:
\[ 1500 + (0.20 \times 1500) = 1500 + 300 = 1800 \]

Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 1800 \times 3 = 5400 \]

Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel to find the total cost of the trip:
\[ 10000 + 5400 = 15400 \]

Thus, the total cost of the trip is:
\[ \boxed{15400} \]"

"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we first need to determine the weight of the 2010 penny. We know that the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. Given that the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains, we can calculate the weight of the 2010 penny as follows:

\[
\text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48 \text{ grains}
\]

Let's perform the multiplication:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 48 = 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ grains}
\]

Now, we add the weight of the 2010 penny to the weight of the 1959 penny to find the combined weight:

"First, let's determine how many songs Luri currently has on his player. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, we can calculate the number of songs Luri has as follows:

\[ \text{Number of songs Luri has} = 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

Next, we need to find out how many more songs each can add to their player. Since each player can store up to 100 songs, the number of additional songs Gabriel can add is:

\[ \text{Additional songs Gabriel can add} = 100 - 20 = 80 \]

Similarly, the number of additional songs Luri can add is:

\[ \text{Additional songs Luri can add} = 100 - 60 = 40 \]

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel, we subtract the number of additional songs Luri can add from the number of additional songs Gabriel can add:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total height of the human pyramid based on the heights of the cheerleaders.

First, let's determine the average height of the cheerleaders. There are 10 cheerleaders, with 9 of them being 64 inches tall and 1 being 60 inches tall. The average height can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Average height} = \frac{(9 \times 64) + 60}{10} = \frac{576 + 60}{10} = \frac{636}{10} = 63.6 \text{ inches}
\]

Now, we need to determine the height of the human pyramid. The pyramid is structured as follows:
- 4 girls on the bottom layer
- 3 girls on the second layer
- 2 girls on the third layer
- 1 girl on the top layer

The total height of the pyramid is the sum of the heights of all the girls in the pyramid. Since the average height of the cheerleaders is 63.6 inches, we can assume that the height of the pyramid is approximately 63.6 inches.

Thus, the height of the human pyramid is:

\[
63.6 \text{ inches}
\]

To convert this height into feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):

\[
63.6 \text{ inches} \div 12 = 5.3 \text{ feet}

"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let's denote the number of guests by \( n \).

**Cost at the first venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Cost of food per guest: $5
- Total cost at the first venue: \( 200 + 5n \)

**Cost at the second venue:**
- Cost per guest: $25
- Cost of food per guest: $0 (included in the price)
- Total cost at the second venue: \( 25n \)

We need to find the value of \( n \) for which the costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5n = 25n \]

To solve for \( n \), we first isolate \( n \) on one side of the equation:
\[ 200 + 5n = 25n \]
\[ 200 = 25n - 5n \]
\[ 200 = 20n \]

Next, we solve for \( n \):
\[ n = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ n = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \( 10 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \( D \). According to the problem, Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects. Additionally, David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects. The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides to isolate the term with \( D \):

\[ 4D = 36 \]

Now, divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( D \):

\[ D = 9 \]

Since David found 9 insects, Lily found \( D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \) insects. Therefore, the number of insects Lily found is:

Next, let's determine how many 2 x 8 pieces Frederick can buy with his $24. Each 2 x 8 costs $6.

\[
\text{Number of 2 x 8 pieces} = \frac{\$24}{\$6} = 4 \text{ pieces}
\]

Now, let's calculate the total number of popsicle sticks he can get from the 2 x 4 pieces. Each 2 x 4 piece gives 200 sticks.

\[
\text{Total sticks from 2 x 4 pieces} = 6 \times 200 = 1200 \text{ sticks}
\]

Next, let's calculate the total number of popsicle sticks he can get from the 2 x 8 pieces. Each 2 x 8 piece gives 400 sticks.

\[
\text{Total sticks from 2 x 8 pieces} = 4 \times 400 = 1600 \text{ sticks}
\]

Since Frederick is buying the cheapest lumber, he should buy the 2 x 4 pieces. Therefore, the most popsicle sticks he can make is from the 2 x 4 pieces.

\[
\text{Final number of popsicle sticks} = 1200
\]

\[
\boxed{1200}

"To determine the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his sled dogs, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
2. Determine how many pairs of snowshoes are needed.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of pairs of snowshoes.

First, we know that each dog has 4 legs and there are 6 dogs:
\[ 4 \text{ legs/dog} \times 6 \text{ dogs} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, we need to find out how many pairs of snowshoes are required:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs/pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs} \]

Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, so the total cost for 12 pairs is:
\[ 12 \text{ pairs} \times 12 \text{ dollars/pair} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is:
\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"To determine how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we first need to calculate her total weekly cost without the bus pass.

Janet takes two bus trips each day and does this five days a week. Therefore, the number of bus trips she takes in a week is:
\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 10 \text{ trips/week} \]

Each bus trip costs her $2.20, so her total weekly cost without the bus pass is:
\[ 10 \text{ trips/week} \times \$2.20/\text{trip} = \$22.00 \text{ per week} \]

With the weekly bus pass costing $20, the savings per week is:
\[ \$22.00 - \$20.00 = \$2.00 \]

Thus, Janet would save \(\boxed{2}\) dollars by buying the weekly bus pass."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Farm's Cows and Sheep:**
   - The farm has 30 cows.
   - The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has \(2 \times 30 = 60\) cows.

2. **Zoo's Cows and Sheep:**
   - The zoo has 20 sheep.
   - The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has \(\frac{20}{2} = 10\) sheep.

3. **Total Animals:**
   - The farm has 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.
   - The zoo has 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.
   - Combined, the farm and zoo have 40 + 80 = 120 animals.

The final numerical answer is:
120"
"To determine how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we start by understanding the relationship between the quantities bought by Sophia and Rose. According to the problem, Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.

Given:
- Rose bought 12 onions.
- Rose bought 4 potatoes.

Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as \( S_o \) and the number of potatoes Sophia bought as \( S_p \).

From the problem, we know:
\[ 4 \times (S_o + S_p) = 12 + 4 \]

First, we calculate the total number of onions and potatoes Rose bought:
\[ 12 + 4 = 16 \]

Now, we set up the equation:
\[ 4 \times (S_o + S_p) = 16 \]

To find \( S_o + S_p \), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ S_o + S_p = \frac{16}{4} = 4 \]

Thus, Sophia bought a total of 4 onions and potatoes. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we first need to calculate the total number of calories he needs to burn to lose 30 pounds. Given that he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose one pound, the total calories he needs to burn to lose 30 pounds is:

\[ 3500 \text{ calories/pound} \times 30 \text{ pounds} = 105000 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to determine the number of days from December 31st to July 19th. Counting the days:

- December has 31 days, so from December 31st to December 19th is 19 days.
- January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 19th is 19 days.
- February has 28 days in a non-leap year, so from February 1st to February 19th is 19 days.
- March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 19th is 19 days.
- April has 30 days, so from April 1st to April 19th is 19 days.
- May has 31 days, so from May 1st to May 19th is 19 days.
- June has 30 days, so from June 1st to June 19th is 19 days.
- July 1st to July 19th is 19 days.

Adding these up, the total number of days from December 31st to July 19th is:

\[ 19 + 19 + 19 + 19 + 19 + 19 + 19 + 19 = 152 \text{ days} \]

Now, to find the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve, we divide the total calories he needs to burn by the number of days:

\[ \frac{105000 \text{ calories}}{152 \text{ days}} \approx 690.13 \text{ calories/day} \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, Andy needs to maintain a daily calorie deficit of approximately 690 calories to reach his goal. Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 690 \]"
"Gerald earns $30 per day and works for 7 days in a week. Therefore, his total earnings for the week are:

\[ 30 \times 7 = 210 \]

He spent a total of $100. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings:

\[ 210 - 100 = 110 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, the house cost three times as much as the lot, so we can write:

\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

To find \( L \), we divide both sides by 4:

\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000 \]

Now that we know the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):

\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000 \]

So, the cost of the house is $90,000.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 90000 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the canvas bags that Tara bought. She bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each, and each pack costs $4.

Total cost = Number of packs × Number of bags per pack × Cost per pack
Total cost = 8 × 5 × $4
Total cost = 40 × $4
Total cost = $160

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the canvas bags. Tara sold each of the 40 bags for $8.

Total revenue = Number of bags sold × Price per bag
Total revenue = 40 × $8
Total revenue = $320

Now, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $320 - $160
Profit = $160

The final numerical answer is $160."
"To determine the total number of punches Joe threw, we need to break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.

1. **Determine the total duration of the fight:**
   - A fight lasts 5 rounds.
   - Each round lasts 3 minutes.
   - Therefore, the total duration of the fight is \( 5 \text{ rounds} \times 3 \text{ minutes/round} = 15 \text{ minutes} \).

2. **Calculate the total number of punches thrown:**
   - Joe throws 25 punches per minute.
   - Over a 15-minute fight, the total number of punches is \( 25 \text{ punches/minute} \times 15 \text{ minutes} = 375 \text{ punches} \).

Thus, the total number of punches Joe threw is 375."
"First, let's determine how many cookies Josh made. According to the problem, Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made. Since Suzanne made 36 cookies, we can calculate the number of cookies Josh made as follows:

\[ \text{Cookies made by Josh} = \frac{1}{4} \times 36 = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many cookies Kelsie made. The problem states that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. Since Josh made 9 cookies, we can calculate the number of cookies Kelsie made as follows:

\[ \text{Cookies made by Kelsie} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Therefore, the number of cookies Kelsie made is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has. He has four $10 bills and six $20 bills.

The total amount from the $10 bills is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

The total amount from the $20 bills is:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of money Ali has:
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \]

Next, Ali gives half of this total amount to his sister. So, the amount given to his sister is:
\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \]

The remaining amount of money Ali has after giving half to his sister is:
\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \]

Ali then uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining amount to buy dinner. The amount used for dinner is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = \frac{3 \times 80}{5} = \frac{240}{5} = 48 \]

The amount of money Ali has left after buying dinner is:
\[ 80 - 48 = 32 \]

Therefore, the final amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is:

"To determine the total number of skeins of wool Martha will need, we first calculate the number of each item she needs to knit for her 3 grandchildren. Then, we multiply the number of each item by the number of skeins required for that item.

- Hats: 3 hats × 2 skeins per hat = 6 skeins
- Scarves: 3 scarves × 4 skeins per scarf = 12 skeins
- Sweaters: 3 sweaters × 12 skeins per sweater = 36 skeins
- Mittens: 3 pairs × 1 skein per pair = 3 skeins
- Socks: 3 pairs × 2 skeins per pair = 6 skeins

Now, we sum up all the skeins needed:
6 (hats) + 12 (scarves) + 36 (sweaters) + 3 (mittens) + 6 (socks) = 63 skeins

Therefore, Martha will need to buy 63 skeins of wool."
"First, let's calculate the number of problems Chris completes on each day.

On Monday, Chris completes 12 problems.

On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday. Therefore, the number of problems he completes on Tuesday is:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of problems completed by the end of Tuesday:
\[ 12 + 36 = 48 \]

Now, we determine the number of problems remaining after Tuesday:
\[ 100 - 48 = 52 \]

On Wednesday, Chris completes one-quarter of the remaining problems. Therefore, the number of problems he completes on Wednesday is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 52 = 13 \]

We then calculate the number of problems remaining after Wednesday:
\[ 52 - 13 = 39 \]

Thus, the number of math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday is:

"First, let's determine the number of quarts each person can pick per hour:

- Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.
- Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
- Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick \(5 \times 2 = 10\) quarts per hour.
- Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than does Kathy, so Ricky can pick \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, let's add up the quarts picked per hour by all four individuals:

- Tony: 6 quarts
- Bobby: 5 quarts
- Kathy: 10 quarts
- Ricky: 8 quarts

Total quarts picked per hour = \(6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29\) quarts.

"To calculate the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily consumption before adding the new device.
2. Calculate the daily consumption after adding the new device.
3. Calculate the weekly consumption before and after adding the new device.
4. Calculate the weekly cost before and after adding the new device.
5. Find the difference between the weekly costs.

**Step 1: Daily consumption before adding the new device**
- Daily consumption = 12 kilowatts per hour

**Step 2: Daily consumption after adding the new device**
- Daily consumption = 12 kilowatts per hour + 2 kilowatts per hour = 14 kilowatts per hour

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which the painters work and then use that rate to find out how long it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house.

First, let's find out how much one person can paint in one day. Since one person can paint half a house in 5 days, in one day, one person can paint:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \text{ house} \div 5 \text{ days} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ house per day}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much one person can paint in one hour. Since there are 24 hours in a day, one person can paint:
\[
\frac{1}{10} \text{ house per day} \div 24 \text{ hours per day} = \frac{1}{240} \text{ house per hour}
\]

Now, if we have 5 people working together, the combined rate of painting is:
\[
5 \times \frac{1}{240} \text{ house per hour} = \frac{5}{240} \text{ house per hour} = \frac{1}{48} \text{ house per hour}
\]

To find out how many hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house, we take the reciprocal of the combined rate:
\[
\frac{1 \text{ house}}{\frac{1}{48} \text{ house per hour}} = 48 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house. The final numerical answer is:
\[
48

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ophelia has 20 sofas.
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. Therefore, Ophelia has \(20 + 2 = 22\) chairs.
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. So, Jenna has \(3 \times 22 = 66\) chairs.
4. Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, Ophelia also has 22 sofas (as previously calculated).
5. Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so Jenna has \(66 - 2 = 64\) sofas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have together:

- Ophelia's total: \(20\) sofas + \(22\) chairs = \(42\)
- Jenna's total: \(64\) sofas + \(66\) chairs = \(130\)

Adding these together, the total number of sofas and chairs they have is \(42 + 130 = 172\).

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had not purchased the headphone set, we first need to find out how much money he spent on the headphone set.

Tom paid a total of $48 for the CD and the headphone set. The CD cost $4, so the cost of the headphone set is:
\[ 48 - 4 = 44 \]

If Tom had not bought the headphone set, he would have had $44 left to spend on CDs. Since each CD costs $4, the number of CDs he could have bought with $44 is:
\[ 44 \div 4 = 11 \]

Therefore, the number of additional CDs Tom would have been able to buy is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we need to account for the hours he worked out each week, considering the exceptions.

First, let's calculate the total hours if he worked out 4 hours every week:
\[ 4 \text{ hours/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to account for the additional hours he worked out in the two weeks where he worked out 5 hours each week:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

Then, we account for the additional hour he worked out in one week where he worked out 6 hours:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/week} \times 1 \text{ week} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we sum up all the hours:
\[ 32 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:
\[ 48 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

**First Stop:**
- 8 people get off the bus.
- The number of people who get on the bus is 5 times the number who got off, which is \(5 \times 8 = 40\).

So, the number of people on the bus after the first stop is:
\[ 48 - 8 + 40 = 80 \]

**Second Stop:**
- 21 people get off the bus.
- The number of people who get on the bus is 3 times fewer than those who got off, which means they get on 3 times more than those who got off, so \(3 \times 21 = 63\).

So, the number of people on the bus after the second stop is:
\[ 80 - 21 + 63 = 122 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, his current age is \( 27 - 5 = 22 \) years.

2. **Determine the age of Jame's cousin in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 27 + 8 = 35 \) years old.
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \( 2 \times 35 = 70 \).
   - Therefore, Jame's cousin will be \( 70 - 5 = 65 \) years old in 8 years.

3. **Determine Jame's cousin's current age:**
   - If Jame's cousin will be 65 in 8 years, then his current age is \( 65 - 8 = 57 \) years.

4. **Calculate the age difference between Jame and his cousin:**
   - Jame is currently 22 years old.
   - Jame's cousin is currently 57 years old.

"Let's break down the information given:

- The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400.
- The computer costs $1,100.
- The printer costs $400 less than the computer, so the printer costs $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the computer and the printer:
- Cost of the computer: $1,100
- Cost of the printer: $700
- Total cost of the computer and the printer: $1,100 + $700 = $1,800

Since the total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400, we can find the total cost of the 2 monitors by subtracting the total cost of the computer and the printer from the total cost:
- Total cost of the computer and the printer: $1,800
- Total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer: $2,400
- Total cost of the 2 monitors: $2,400 - $1,800 = $600

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the total cost of the 2 monitors by 2:
- Total cost of the 2 monitors: $600
- Cost of one monitor: $600 / 2 = $300

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is $300.

\[

"To find out how many seashells each girl brought, we first need to determine the number of boys and girls. Since there are 20 kids in total and they are divided into two equal groups, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

Each boy brought back 60 seashells. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought by all the boys is:
\[ 10 \text{ boys} \times 60 \text{ seashells/boy} = 600 \text{ seashells} \]

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. So, the total number of seashells brought by the girls is:
\[ 600 \text{ seashells} + 4 \times 600 \text{ seashells} = 600 \text{ seashells} + 2400 \text{ seashells} = 3000 \text{ seashells} \]

Since there are 10 girls, the number of seashells each girl brought is:
\[ \frac{3000 \text{ seashells}}{10 \text{ girls}} = 300 \text{ seashells/girl} \]

Thus, the number of seashells brought by each girl is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"If George has 3 candies left after eating 5, it means George originally had 3 + 5 = 8 candies.

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so its thickness is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so its thickness is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm.

Now, we sum the thicknesses of all four books:
\[31 + 50 + 45 + 62\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[31 + 50 = 81\]
\[81 + 45 = 126\]
\[126 + 62 = 188\]

Therefore, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many more vlogs Emma needs to make to complete her monthly goal of 72 vlogs, we can subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her monthly goal.

Vlogs made so far: 18 (first week) + 21 (second week) + 15 (third week) = 54 vlogs

Monthly goal: 72 vlogs

Vlogs still needed: 72 - 54 = 18 vlogs

So, the final numerical answer is 18."
"To determine how much you ended up paying, we first need to calculate the tip and then add it to the original dinner bill.

The tip is 20% of the $50 dinner bill. To find 20% of $50, we can use the formula:
\[ \text{Tip} = \text{Dinner Bill} \times \frac{20}{100} \]

Let's calculate the tip:
\[ \text{Tip} = 50 \times 0.20 = 10 \]

Now, we add the tip to the original dinner bill to find the total amount you paid:
\[ \text{Total Amount Paid} = \text{Dinner Bill} + \text{Tip} = 50 + 10 = 60 \]

So, the final amount you ended up paying is:
\[ 60 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Sharing:**
   - The total amount is $18.
   - It is shared among 3 boys.
   - Each boy's initial share is \(\frac{18}{3} = 6\) dollars.

2. **Eldest Boy's Actions:**
   - The eldest boy adds $5 to his initial share.
   - His new share is \(6 + 5 = 11\) dollars.
   - The following day, he adds another $10.
   - His total amount after this is \(11 + 10 = 21\) dollars.

3. **Spending:**
   - He spends $8 from his total.
   - His amount after spending is \(21 - 8 = 13\) dollars.

4. **Saving and Tripling:**
   - He triples the amount he has left after spending the $8.
   - His new amount is \(13 \times 3 = 39\) dollars.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{39}

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable parts. Let's denote the daily savings in the first half of April as \( x \). Therefore, the daily savings in the second half of April would be \( 2x \).

April has 30 days, so the first half of April consists of 15 days and the second half also consists of 15 days.

The total savings in April can be calculated as the sum of the savings in the first half and the second half:
\[ 15x + 15(2x) = 15x + 30x = 45x \]

We know that Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 45:
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \]

So, Elvis has to save $25 each day in the first half of the month. For the second half of the month, he needs to save twice this amount, which is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save $50 for each day in the second half of the month.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the apples:
\[ 3 \text{ apples} \times \$1.50 \text{ per apple} = \$4.50 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the oranges:

Then, let's calculate the total cost of the peaches:
\[ 6 \text{ peaches} \times \$0.75 \text{ per peach} = \$4.50 \]

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the fruits:
\[ \$4.50 + \$4.00 + \$4.50 = \$13.00 \]

Verna gave $20 to the seller. To find out how much change she received, we subtract the total cost of the fruits from the amount she gave:
\[ \$20.00 - \$13.00 = \$7.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$7.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Jairus earns for completing 20 tasks. Jairus earns $0.8 for each task, so for 20 tasks, he earns:
\[ 0.8 \times 20 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate how much Jenny earns for completing 20 tasks. Jenny earns $0.5 for each task, so for 20 tasks, she earns:
\[ 0.5 \times 20 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much more Jairus earns than Jenny, we subtract Jenny's earnings from Jairus's earnings:
\[ 16 - 10 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \]"
"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars. The total amount of money is $100, so we can write the equation:

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets $20. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's amount as follows:

\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets $80. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 80 \]"
"Jeff walks 6 miles to work each day since he walks there and back. Therefore, for one day of work, he walks 3 miles to work + 3 miles back home = 6 miles.

"To determine the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Rewriting**: Elise writes the entire alphabet twice.
   - The alphabet has 26 letters.
   - Therefore, writing it twice means \(26 \times 2 = 52\) letters.

2. **Second Rewriting**: Elise writes half of the alphabet once.
   - Half of the alphabet is \(26 / 2 = 13\) letters.
   - Therefore, writing half of the alphabet once means \(13\) letters.

3. **Third Rewriting**: Elise rewrites everything she has already written.
   - This includes the two full alphabets and the half alphabet.
   - The total number of letters already written is \(52 + 13 = 65\).
   - Rewriting everything means writing \(65\) letters again.

Now, we sum up all the letters written:
- First rewriting: \(52\) letters.
- Second rewriting: \(13\) letters.
- Third rewriting: \(65\) letters.

Adding these together:
\[ 52 + 13 + 65 = 130 \]

Thus, the total number of letters Elise has written is \(\boxed{130}\)."

"First, let's calculate the total cost of each item before the discount:

- The cost of five notebooks is \(5 \times \$1.50 = \$7.50\).
- The cost of two pens is \(2 \times \$0.25 = \$0.50\).
- The cost of one calculator is \(1 \times \$12 = \$12\).
- The cost of one geometry set is \(1 \times \$10 = \$10\).

Next, we sum these amounts to find the total cost before the discount:
\[
\$7.50 + \$0.50 + \$12 + \$10 = \$20
\]

Now, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
\[
10\% \text{ of } \$20 = 0.10 \times \$20 = \$2

"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break down the commission structure into two parts: the commission for the first $1000 and the additional commission for the amount over $1000.

1. For the first $1000, the commission is 30%.
2. For the amount over $1000 (which is $1500 in this case), the commission is an additional 10% on top of the 30% already earned.

Let's calculate the commission for each part:

- Commission on the first $1000: \(1000 \times 0.30 = 300\)
- Commission on the amount over $1000: \(1500 \times 0.30 = 450\)
- Additional commission on the amount over $1000: \(450 \times 0.10 = 45\)

"First, let's determine how long it takes Ray to swim a mile when the water is warm.

Given:
- When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.
- When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold.

Let's calculate the time it takes to swim a mile in warm water:
- Twice the time it takes in cold water is \(2 \times 16 = 32\) minutes.
- Adding 2 minutes to this gives \(32 + 2 = 34\) minutes.

So, it takes Ray 34 minutes to swim a mile in warm water.

Next, we calculate the time it takes to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water:
- In cold water, it takes \(16 \times 3 = 48\) minutes to swim 3 miles.
- In warm water, it takes \(34 \times 3 = 102\) minutes to swim 3 miles.

Finally, we find the difference in time between swimming 3 miles in warm water and cold water:
- The difference is \(102 - 48 = 54\) minutes.

Therefore, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate how much John earns in a day. He earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day, so his daily earnings are:
\[ 2 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours/day} = 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \]

Next, let's calculate his weekly earnings. He works 4 days a week, so his weekly earnings are:
\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 4 \, \text{days/week} = 40 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Now, we need to determine how many weeks it will take for John to save $80. We do this by dividing the total amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:
\[ \frac{80 \, \text{dollars}}{40 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 2 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80."

\[ \text{Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo sub} = 3 \times \text{Cost of foot-long fish sub} = 3 \times 40 = 120 \]

Next, we add the cost of the foot-long fish sub and the six-inch cold-cut combo sub to find the total cost:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of foot-long fish sub} + \text{Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo sub} = 40 + 120 = 160 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 160 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes in all the buttons.

First, we know that there are 21 buttons in total. Out of these, 7 buttons have 2 holes each. So, the number of holes in these 7 buttons is:
\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ holes} \]

The rest of the buttons have 4 holes each. Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 of them have 2 holes, the number of buttons that have 4 holes is:
\[ 21 - 7 = 14 \text{ buttons} \]

The number of holes in these 14 buttons is:
\[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \text{ holes} \]

Adding the holes from both types of buttons gives us the total number of holes:
\[ 14 + 56 = 70 \text{ holes} \]

"First, let's determine the volume of Zack's locker. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can calculate the volume of Zack's locker as follows:

\[ \text{Volume of Zack's locker} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Volume of Timothy's locker} \]

Given that Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches, we substitute this value into the equation:

\[ \text{Volume of Zack's locker} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 = 12 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we need to find the volume of Peter's locker, which is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. We can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Volume of Peter's locker} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Volume of Zack's locker} \]

Substituting the volume of Zack's locker into the equation:

Therefore, the volume of Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches."
"First, let's determine the daily recommended cups of coffee for Octavia. Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, if we denote the daily recommended cups of coffee as \( R \), then Octavia drinks \( \frac{R}{2} \) cups of coffee.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks. Therefore, Juan drinks \( 10 \times \frac{R}{2} = 5R \) cups of coffee.

According to Juan's doctor, Juan's coffee intake should be reduced to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. This means Juan needs to reduce his coffee intake from \( 5R \) cups to 4 cups.

To find out by how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we calculate the difference between his current intake and the recommended intake:
\[ 5R - 4 \]

Since \( R \) is the daily recommended cups of coffee, the reduction Juan needs to make is:
\[ 5R - 4 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5R - 4} \]"
"To find the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then add them together.

- Therefore, the total number of hamsters is \(3 \times 10 = 30\).

Next, we calculate the number of guinea pigs:
- There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each.
- Therefore, the total number of guinea pigs is \(3 \times 5 = 15\).

Now, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs to find the total number of rodents:
- The total number of rodents is \(30 + 15 = 45\).

Thus, the pet shop had a total of 45 rodents."
"First, let's determine the weights of Susan and Bob.

Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark. Since Mark weighs 150 pounds, Susan's weight is:

"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the pages read in the first week and add it to the pages read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week. She read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week. So, the total reading time in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pages she can read in 105 minutes. We know that she can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. Therefore, the number of pages she reads per minute is:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of pages read in the first week:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages. So, the total number of pages read in two weeks is:

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equation based on the information given.

Let \( x \) be the nephew's current age.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( 44 + 7 = 51 \) years old.

In 7 years, the nephew's age will be \( x + 7 \).

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. This gives us the equation:
\[ 51 = 3(x + 7) \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ 51 = 3(x + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3x + 21 \]
\[ 51 - 21 = 3x \]
\[ 30 = 3x \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the nephew is currently 10 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to break down the payments Sharon received from the tooth fairy and sum them up.

1. For the first tooth, the tooth fairy gave $5.00.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave $1.00 each.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of $1.00, which is $0.50 each.

Let's calculate the total amount of money Sharon received:

- For the first tooth: $5.00
- For the next three teeth: $1.00 * 3 = $3.00
- For the last two teeth: $0.50 * 2 = $1.00

Now, we sum these amounts:

"To find out how many goals all three teenagers scored, we need to determine the number of goals each teenager scored based on the information provided.

First, we know that Richie scored 80 goals. According to the problem, Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. Therefore, we can calculate the number of goals Mark scored as follows:
\[ \text{Goals scored by Mark} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 20 = 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Next, we know that Richie also scored 45 more goals than Anna. Therefore, we can calculate the number of goals Anna scored as follows:
\[ \text{Goals scored by Anna} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 45 = 80 - 45 = 35 \]

Now, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers by summing the goals scored by each:
\[ \text{Total goals} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} + \text{Goals scored by Mark} + \text{Goals scored by Anna} = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 \]

Thus, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is:

Liam claimed to have made $63. To find out how many more dollars Mitchell made than Liam, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings:
\[ 84 \text{ dollars} - 63 \text{ dollars} = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 21 \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Peter spends on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. Since he spends an equal amount each day and there are 4 days (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday), we can calculate the total amount spent on wooden action figures as follows:

\[ \text{Total spent on wooden action figures} = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Peter started with $70, so after buying the wooden action figures, he has:

\[ \text{Remaining money} = 70 - 20 = 50 \]

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Sunday), Peter will buy plastic action figures. There are 3 days (Thursday, Friday, and Saturday) for which he will buy plastic action figures. Each plastic action figure costs $2, so the total number of plastic action figures he can buy is:

\[ \text{Number of plastic action figures} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week. He bought 4 wooden action figures and 25 plastic action figures, so the total number of action figures is:

\[ \text{Total number of action figures} = 4 + 25 = 29 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total cost, we need to add up all the expenses:

1. The cost of spaying the kitten: $200
2. The cost of the 3 vaccines: $20 each, so 3 * $20 = $60
3. The cost of repairing the 4 broken vases: $12 each, so 4 * $12 = $48

Now, we add these amounts together:

$200 (spaying) + $60 (vaccines) + $48 (repairing vases) = $308

So, the total cost so far is $308."
"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we first need to calculate the total number of roses he grows in a week and then compare it to the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops.

Ford grows 40 roses every week. The flower shops order a total of:
- The first flower shop orders 20 roses.
- The second flower shop orders 15 roses.
- The third flower shop orders 30 roses.

So, the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week is:
\[ 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \]

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops in a month is:
\[ 65 \times 4 = 260 \]

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so in a month, he grows:
\[ 40 \times 4 = 160 \]

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the number of roses he grows from the number of roses ordered:
\[ 260 - 160 = 100 \]

Therefore, the number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"To determine how much money Katina will have remaining in her savings account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount she removes over that period and subtract it from her initial amount.

First, we calculate the total amount removed over 2 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, 2 years consist of:
\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ months} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount removed over these 24 months:
\[ 24 \times 100 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in the savings account:
\[ 3000 - 2400 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the amount of money remaining in the account after 2 years is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of ingredients for 10 sandwiches:

- Cost of bread for 10 sandwiches: $3.00
- Cost of cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches: $30.00

Total cost for 10 sandwiches = $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00

Next, let's calculate the revenue from selling 10 sandwiches:

- Revenue from selling 10 sandwiches at $7.00 each = 10 * $7.00 = $70.00

Now, let's calculate the net profit:

- Net profit = Revenue - Total cost
- Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00

The net profit is $37.00."
"First, we need to determine the total number of crayon pieces Kate has. She has 3 boxes of 64 crayons each, so the total number of crayon pieces is:

\[ 3 \times 64 = 192 \]

Next, we need to find out how many sets of 8 crayon pieces she can melt together to make one muffin. We do this by dividing the total number of crayon pieces by 8:

\[ 192 \div 8 = 24 \]

This means Kate can make 24 muffins. If she sells each muffin for $1.50, the total amount of money she can make is:

\[ 24 \times 1.50 = 36 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"To calculate the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet, we need to consider the cost of the carpet, the cost of padding, the cost of removing the old carpet, and the cost of installing the new carpet.

First, let's calculate the area of the bedroom:
\[ \text{Area} = 18 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the carpet:
\[ \text{Cost of carpet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times \$12/\text{square foot} = \$2592 \]

Then, we calculate the cost of padding:
\[ \text{Cost of padding} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times \$2/\text{square foot} = \$432 \]

Now, we calculate the cost of removing the old carpet:
\[ \text{Cost of removing old carpet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times \$4/\text{square foot} = \$864 \]

Finally, we calculate the cost of installing the new carpet:
\[ \text{Cost of installing new carpet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times \$34/\text{square foot} = \$7344 \]

Adding all these costs together gives us the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$2592 + \$432 + \$864 + \$7344 = \$11232 \]

So, the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet is:

"To find the average number of birds Mack saw per day over the week, we first need to calculate the total number of birds he saw and then divide that by the number of days.

From the information given:
- Days 1 and 2: 50 birds
- Day 3: 0 birds
- Days 4 and 5: 120 birds
- Day 6: 20 birds
- Day 7: 90 birds

First, we calculate the total number of birds seen:
\[ 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 \]

Next, we count the number of days:
\[ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28 \]

Now, we find the average number of birds seen per day by dividing the total number of birds by the number of days:
\[ \frac{280}{28} = 10 \]

So, on average, Mack saw \(\boxed{10}\) birds per day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Starting Value**: Diane gave the number train a starting value of 20.
   \[
   \text{Starting Value} = 20

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage error in Maggie's oven and then apply that same percentage error to the 520 degrees she needs for her recipe.

First, let's calculate the percentage error for the 450 degrees setting:
- The actual temperature is 468 degrees.
- The error is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees.
- The percentage error is (18 / 450) * 100 = 4%.

Now, we apply this 4% error to the 520 degrees required for the recipe:
- The error in degrees for 520 degrees is 520 * 0.04 = 20.8 degrees.
- The actual temperature should be 520 + 20.8 = 540.8 degrees.

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 540.8 degrees.

The final numerical answer is:
540.8"
"To determine the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to add the duration of each movie together.

First, convert the duration of the first movie into minutes:
- The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long.
- 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes.
- Therefore, 1 hour and 30 minutes is \(60 + 30 = 90\) minutes.

Next, convert the duration of the second movie into minutes:
- The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long.
- 2 hours is equal to 120 minutes.
- Therefore, 2 hours and 5 minutes is \(120 + 5 = 125\) minutes.

Now, add the durations of both movies:
- The total duration is \(90 + 125 = 215\) minutes.

Thus, the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is 215 minutes."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we first need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and then subtract that from Herb's price.

Herb's house price = $76,000

30% of Herb's house price = 0.30 * $76,000 = $22,800

Juan's house price = Herb's house price - 30% of Herb's house price
Juan's house price = $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

Now, we add the prices of both houses to find the combined value:

Combined value = Herb's house price + Juan's house price
Combined value = $76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200

The value of the two houses combined is $129,200."
"First, let's determine the number of cups and dishes Judy initially bought.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups.

She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.

At the event, her friend brought 40 cups. Since Judy initially bought 12 cups, her friend brought \(40 - 12 = 28\) more cups than Judy bought.

Her friend also brought 20 more dishes than Judy bought. Since Judy bought 24 dishes, her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend.

Judy's total cups: \(12 + 28 = 40\)
Judy's total dishes: \(24 + 44 = 68\)

The total number of utensils (cups and dishes) brought by both is:
\[40 + 68 = 108\]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the discounted price of one box of contacts. The original price of one box is $100.00, and it is currently 10% off. The discount amount is:

\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the discounted price of one box is:

\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

Since Pete is buying 2 boxes, the total cost for 2 boxes is:

\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost per pair of contacts. Since each box contains 90 single use contacts, 2 boxes will contain:

\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \]

Therefore, the cost per pair of contacts is:

\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total hours Jill worked. Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so the total hours Jill worked is:
\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the hours John worked. John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ hours on Saturday} \]
John also worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so:
\[ 3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ hours on Sunday} \]
Therefore, the total hours John worked is:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the total earnings for both Jill and John. Since they are paid $10 per hour, Jill's earnings are:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]
John's earnings are:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 70 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings:
\[ 70 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total calories burned from aerobics:
- Hannah spends 2 hours doing aerobics.
- Aerobics burn 500 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from aerobics = 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.

Next, let's calculate the total calories burned from running:
- Hannah spends 1 hour running.
- Running burns 600 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from running = 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.

Now, let's find the total calories burned:
- Total calories burned = calories burned from aerobics + calories burned from running
- Total calories burned = 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories.

Finally, we need to determine how much water Hannah needs to drink:
- Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns.
- To find out how much water she needs for 1600 calories, we set up the proportion:
  \[
  \frac{100 \text{ ml}}{200 \text{ calories}} = \frac{x \text{ ml}}{1600 \text{ calories}}
  \]
  Solving for \(x\):
  \[
  x = \frac{100 \text{ ml} \times 1600 \text{ calories}}{200 \text{ calories}} = \frac{160000 \text{ ml-calories}}{200 \text{ calories}} = 800 \text{ ml}
  \]

Therefore, the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink is 800 ml."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the note, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \). Similarly, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of the red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \), we divide both sides by 3:
\[ B = 1500 \]

Now we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
- The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \).
- The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \).

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:
\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"

Now, we calculate the average of these three speeds:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{47 + 52 + 57}{3}
\]

First, we sum the speeds:

\[
47 + 52 + 57 = 156

"First, let's calculate the total cost for the boots on Amazon.com:
- The cost of the boots on Amazon.com is $16.
- The shipping cost on Amazon.com is $4.
- Therefore, the total cost on Amazon.com is $16 + $4 = $20.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the boots on eBay:
- The cost of the boots on eBay is $13.
- The shipping cost on eBay is twice the shipping cost on Amazon.com. Since the shipping cost on Amazon.com is $4, the shipping cost on eBay is 2 * $4 = $8.
- Therefore, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

Now, let's find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon.com:

Therefore, it will take \(\boxed{3}\) days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window."
"To determine how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms every day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of protein John gets from 200 grams of mushrooms in one day.
2. Multiply the daily protein intake by the number of days in a week (7 days).

First, we find the protein content per 200 grams of mushrooms:
- 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein.
- Therefore, 200 grams of mushrooms would contain \(\frac{200}{100} \times 3 = 2 \times 3 = 6\) grams of protein per day.

Next, we calculate the weekly protein intake:
- John eats 6 grams of protein per day.
- In a week, he eats \(6 \times 7 = 42\) grams of protein.

Thus, the total grams of protein John gets per week is 42 grams."
"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Expanding and simplifying the equation:
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
\[ J - 2J = -10 \]
\[ -J = -10 \]
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work for George.

- The base price for each implant is $2000.
- George needs 2 implants, so the cost for the implants is \(2 \times 2000 = 4000\) dollars.
- One of the implants has a porcelain crown, which costs an extra $500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the dental work is \(4000 + 500 = 4500\) dollars.

George has already put down a deposit of $600. So, the remaining amount he needs to pay is \(4500 - 600 = 3900\) dollars.

George makes $15 per hour at work. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:

\[ \text{Hours needed} = \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \text{ hours} \]

So, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work."
"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees, and the other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees. The sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees and \( 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees. The largest angle in the triangle is therefore 90 degrees.

The measure of the largest angle in the triangle is \(\boxed{90}\) degrees."
"First, let's determine the total amount of money Colby has in cents. We know that:
- 1 quarter = 25 cents
- 1 dime = 10 cents
- 1 nickel = 5 cents
- 1 penny = 1 cent

Colby has:
- 8 quarters = 8 * 25 cents = 200 cents
- 6 dimes = 6 * 10 cents = 60 cents
- 14 nickels = 14 * 5 cents = 70 cents
- 15 pennies = 15 * 1 cents = 15 cents

Adding these amounts together gives:
200 cents + 60 cents + 70 cents + 15 cents = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can find out how many gumballs Colby can buy by dividing the total amount of money he has by the cost of one gumball:
345 cents / 5 cents per gumball = 69 gumballs

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of legs in the pet store, we need to consider the number of legs each type of pet has and then multiply by the number of each type of pet.

- Dogs have 4 legs each.
- Cats have 4 legs each.
- Birds have 2 legs each.

Given:
- There are 5 dogs.
- There are 2 cats.
- There are 10 birds.

Now, we calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet:
- Total legs from dogs: \(5 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 20 \text{ legs}\)
- Total legs from cats: \(2 \text{ cats} \times 4 \text{ legs/cat} = 8 \text{ legs}\)
- Total legs from birds: \(10 \text{ birds} \times 2 \text{ legs/bird} = 20 \text{ legs}\)

Finally, we sum the legs from all the pets:

"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz makes in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we can calculate the hourly rate for Ruiz as follows:

\[ \text{Ruiz's hourly rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa makes in one hour. According to the problem, Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we can calculate the amount Marissa makes in one hour as follows:

\[ \text{Marissa's hourly rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 60 \text{ pounds per hour} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of chocolates made by Ruiz and Marissa in 12 hours. First, we calculate the total amount Ruiz makes in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Ruiz's total in 12 hours} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Marissa makes in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Marissa's total in 12 hours} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

"First, let's calculate how much Howard spends each day at the arcade.

On Monday, he spends $8.

On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as he did on Monday, so:
\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as he did on Tuesday, so:
\[ 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount he spends over the three days:
\[ 8 + 16 + 64 = 88 \text{ dollars} \]

Howard originally had $100. After spending $88, the amount of money he has left is:
\[ 100 - 88 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total earnings from selling lemonade, we need to break down the problem into two parts based on the given time periods and then sum the earnings.

For the first four hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.

The total number of cups sold in the first four hours is:
\[ 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

The total earnings from the first four hours is:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = \$30 \]

For the next two hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.

The total number of cups sold in the next two hours is:
\[ 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

The total earnings from the next two hours is:
\[ 20 \text{ cups} \times \$0.60/\text{cup} = \$12 \]

Adding the earnings from both periods gives the total earnings:
\[ \$30 + \$12 = \$42 \]

"First, let's determine the total number of rotations the tires make in a month. Given that the car drives 400 miles a month and the tires rotate 725 times for every 2 miles, we can calculate the total rotations per month as follows:

\[ \text{Rotations per mile} = \frac{725}{2} \]
\[ \text{Rotations per month} = 400 \times \frac{725}{2} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of rotations per month:

\[ \text{Rotations per month} = 400 \times 362.5 = 145000 \]

Now, we know that each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations. To find out how many months the tires can last, we divide the total number of rotations each tire can handle by the number of rotations per month:

\[ \text{Months per tire} = \frac{10,440,000}{145000} \]

Let's calculate this value:

\[ \text{Months per tire} = 72 \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can find out how many years the tires can last by dividing the number of months per tire by 12:

\[ \text{Years per tire} = \frac{72}{12} = 6 \]

Therefore, the tires need to be replaced after 6 years. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To determine the cost of each pump in cents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of washes Jackie can get from one bottle of shampoo.
2. Determine the cost per wash.
3. Convert the cost per wash into cents.

First, we know that the bottle of shampoo gives 120 washes with 2 pumps. If Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, then the bottle will give her 120 washes. The cost of the bottle is $24.00.

Next, we calculate the cost per wash:
\[ \text{Cost per wash} = \frac{\text{Total cost of the bottle}}{\text{Total number of washes}} = \frac{24.00}{120} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per wash} \]

Since we need the cost in cents, we convert $0.20 to cents:
\[ 0.20 \text{ dollars} = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the cost of each pump is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the discounted price of the shirt and the shorts. The shirt originally costs $25, and there is a 30% discount.

The discount amount for the shirt is:
\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]

So, the discounted price of the shirt is:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

The shorts originally cost $35, and there is also a 30% discount.

The discount amount for the shorts is:
\[ 35 \times 0.30 = 10.50 \]

So, the discounted price of the shorts is:
\[ 35 - 10.50 = 24.50 \]

Next, we add the discounted prices of the shirt and the shorts to find the total cost of the outfit:
\[ 17.50 + 24.50 = 42.00 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. After purchasing the outfit, the amount of money he will have left is:
\[ 50 - 42.00 = 8.00 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 8.00 \]"
"To determine how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a week.
2. Determine the total amount of butter needed based on the number of dozens.

First, Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week. There are 7 days in a week, so the total number of dozens of croissants he wants to make is:
\[ 4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we know that it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. Therefore, to find out how many pounds of butter are needed for 28 dozen croissants, we multiply the number of dozens by the amount of butter needed per dozen:
\[ 28 \text{ dozen} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total amount of butter Juan will need is:

"First, we need to calculate the cost to repave Monica's street. The cost is $194 per meter and Monica's street is 150 meters long. Therefore, the cost to repave Monica's street is:

\[ 194 \times 150 = 29100 \]

Next, we calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street. Lewis' street is 490 meters long, so the cost is:

\[ 194 \times 490 = 94860 \]

To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we subtract the cost of repaving Monica's street from the cost of repaving Lewis' street:

\[ 94860 - 29100 = 65760 \]

"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the funding into two parts: the initial funding and the additional funding.

1. **Initial Funding:**
   John receives $100,000 for the first 5 months.

2. **Additional Funding:**
   The research takes 10 times the initial 5 months, which means the total research period is:
   \[
   5 \text{ months} \times 10 = 50 \text{ months}
   \]
   The first 5 months of the additional funding are the same as the initial funding, which is $100,000.

   For the remaining 45 months (50 months total - 5 months initial funding), the funding per month is 50% more than the initial $100,000 per month. Therefore, the additional funding per month is:
   \[
   100,000 \times 1.5 = 150,000
   \]
   The total additional funding for the remaining 45 months is:
   \[
   150,000 \times 45 = 6,750,000
   \]

3. **Total Funding:**
   Adding the initial funding and the additional funding gives:
   \[
   100,000 + 6,750,000 = 6,850,000
   \]

Thus, the total cost of John's research is:
\[
\boxed{6850000}

"To determine how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of meat Prince can sell in one day.
2. Determine the total amount of meat from the bull.
3. Calculate the number of days required to sell the total amount of meat.

First, let's calculate the total amount of meat Prince can sell in one day:
- Prince sells 15 kg of meat every hour.
- He works 10 hours a day.
- Therefore, the amount of meat sold per day is \( 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \).

Next, we know the total amount of meat from the bull is 750 kg. To find out how many days it will take to sell this amount, we divide the total weight of the meat by the amount sold per day:
- Total meat from the bull: 750 kg.
- Meat sold per day: 150 kg/day.
- Number of days required: \( \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \).

"To calculate the total number of cars towed by the tow truck over the week, we can break down the problem into two parts: the first three days and the last four days.

For the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day. Therefore, the total number of cars pulled in the first three days is:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

For the remaining four days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day than it did on the first three days. Since it pulled 10 cars each day on the first three days, it pulled:
\[ 10 \text{ cars} - 4 \text{ cars} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]
Therefore, the total number of cars pulled in the last four days is:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Adding the number of cars pulled over the first three days and the last four days gives us the total number of cars towed that week:

"First, we need to convert Adam's current height from inches to feet to compare it with the required height. Adam is currently 40 inches tall. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert his height to feet as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ inches} = \frac{40}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The minimum height required to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. Therefore, Adam needs to grow:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Adam grows 2 inches per year, which is equivalent to \(\frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6}\) feet per year. To find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet, we divide \(\frac{2}{3}\) by \(\frac{1}{6}\):

\[ \frac{2}{3} \div \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Therefore, Adam will be tall enough to ride the roller coaster in 4 years. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \text{Cost to acquire the cars} = 30\% \times \$250,000 = 0.30 \times \$250,000 = \$75,000 \]

Now, we find the total profit from selling the cars:
\[ \text{Total profit} = \text{Total cost of cars} - \text{Cost to acquire the cars} = \$250,000 - \$75,000 = \$175,000 \]

James gets a 10% commission on the profits:
\[ \text{James's commission} = 10\% \times \$175,000 = 0.10 \times \$175,000 = \$17,500 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$17,500 \]"

"First, let's determine the price of the gold jewel. Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000 and the price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

\[
\text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600
\]

Next, we need to find the price of the silver jewel. The problem states that the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of the gold jewel. Therefore, we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

\[
\text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
\]

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by summing the prices of the diamond jewel, the gold jewel, and the silver jewel:

\[
\text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800

"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to calculate the number of each type of stamp and then sum them up.

1. Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.
2. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. Therefore, the number of truck stamps is:
   \[
   16 + 3 = 19
   \]
3. He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. Therefore, the number of rose stamps is:
   \[
   19 - 9 = 10
   \]

Now, we sum the number of each type of stamp to find the total number of stamps Max bought:
\[
16 \text{ (snowflake)} + 19 \text{ (truck)} + 10 \text{ (rose)} = 45

"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between him and Bob, given their respective speeds.

First, let's find the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap. Since Bob is driving at 55 mph and Tom is driving at 70 mph, Tom is closing the gap at a rate of:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is reducing the 75-mile gap by 15 miles every hour. To find out how long it will take for Tom to close the entire 75-mile gap, we divide the distance by the relative speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

\[ \text{Darren's fish} = \text{Naomi's fish} - 6 = 17 - 6 = 11 \]

Next, we need to find out how many fish Tommy caught. According to the problem, Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. Since Darren caught 11 fish, we can calculate the number of fish Tommy caught as follows:

\[ \text{Tommy's fish} = \text{Darren's fish} + 3 = 11 + 3 = 14 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 14 \]"
"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the maximum cost per class and then find out how many classes he can attend without exceeding this cost.

First, let's denote the total cost of the 10 classes as \( C \). The total cost is given as $60. If the cost per class exceeds $10, they won't sign him up again. Therefore, we need to find the maximum number of classes \( n \) such that the cost per class is not more than $10.

The cost per class if he attends \( n \) classes is:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{n} \]

We need this cost to be less than or equal to $10:
\[ \frac{60}{n} \leq 10 \]

Solving for \( n \):
\[ 60 \leq 10n \]
\[ n \geq 6 \]

This means Manny can miss up to \( 10 - 6 = 4 \) classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

Thus, the number of classes Manny can miss before they don't sign him up again is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we first need to find out how many customers each of them processes in a day.

Given that Jewel processes 50 customers per day, and Julie processes twice as many customers as Jewel, we can calculate the number of customers Julie processes per day as follows:
\[ \text{Customers processed by Julie per day} = 2 \times \text{Customers processed by Jewel per day} = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of customers processed by each of them in a week (7 days):
\[ \text{Total customers processed by Jewel in a week} = 50 \times 7 = 350 \]
\[ \text{Total customers processed by Julie in a week} = 100 \times 7 = 700 \]

Finally, we find the total weekly production by adding the total customers processed by both Julie and Jewel:
\[ \text{Total weekly production} = 350 + 700 = 1050 \]

Thus, the total weekly production for the two is:
\[ \boxed{1050} \]"
"First, let's determine how far Reggie ran. Since Paisley ran 4 miles and Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, we calculate:

\[ \text{Reggie's distance} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ miles} \]

\[ \text{Lynn's distance} = 20 - 3 = 17 \text{ miles} \]

So, Lynn ran 17 miles. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 17 \]"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the cost of one apple and one orange.

Given:
- Four apples cost $5.20.
- Three oranges cost $3.30.

First, we calculate the cost of one apple:
\[ \text{Cost of one apple} = \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of one orange:
\[ \text{Cost of one orange} = \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \]

Now, we need to find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges:
\[ \text{Cost of 5 apples} = 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \]
\[ \text{Cost of 5 oranges} = 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \]

So, Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 12.00 \]"
"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

"To calculate Tim's annual salary after the promotion, we need to consider both the raise and the bonus.

First, let's calculate the raise:
- Tim's monthly salary is $20000.
- The raise is 5% of $20000.
- The raise amount is \( 20000 \times 0.05 = 1000 \).

So, Tim's new monthly salary after the raise is:
- \( 20000 + 1000 = 21000 \).

Next, let's calculate the bonus:
- The bonus is half a month's salary.
- The bonus amount is \( 20000 \times 0.5 = 10000 \).

So, Tim's total monthly salary after the raise and bonus is:
- \( 21000 + 10000 = 31000 \).

Finally, to find out how much Tim will make in a year, we multiply his monthly salary by 12:
- \( 31000 \times 12 = 372000 \).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the suits:
- James buys 10 suits.
- Each suit costs $750.
- Total cost for suits = 10 * $750 = $7500.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the dress pants:
- The cost of each dress pant is 1/5 of the cost of a suit.
- Cost of each dress pant = $750 / 5 = $150.
- James buys 10 dress pants.
- Total cost for dress pants = 10 * $150 = $1500.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the dress shirts:
- James buys 3 dress shirts per suit.
- Since he buys 10 suits, he buys 10 * 3 = 30 dress shirts.
- Each dress shirt costs $60.
- Total cost for dress shirts = 30 * $60 = $1800.

Finally, let's add up the total cost:
- Total cost = Cost of suits + Cost of dress pants + Cost of dress shirts.
- Total cost = $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total time Bill will take to dig the well, we need to calculate the time taken to dig through the soil and the time taken to dig through the clay separately, and then sum these times.

First, let's calculate the time to dig through the soil:
- Bill digs at a rate of 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He needs to dig 24 feet of soil.

\[
\text{Time to dig through soil} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, let's calculate the time to dig through the clay:
- Bill digs at a rate of half of 4 feet per hour, which is 2 feet per hour, through clay.
- He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.

\[
\text{Time to dig through clay} = \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the sales from green hats in the first month:**
   - The sales from red hats in the first month were $400.
   - The sales from green hats in the first month were twice the sales from red hats.
   - Therefore, the sales from green hats in the first month were \( 2 \times 400 = 800 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total sales in the first month:**
   - The total sales in the first month were the sum of the sales from red and green hats.
   - Total sales in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats = \( 400 + 800 = 1200 \) dollars.

3. **Determine the sales in the second month:**
   - The sales in the second month were \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total sales in the first month.
   - Therefore, the sales in the second month were \( \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total sales in two months:**
   - The total sales in two months were the sum of the sales in the first and second months.
   - Total sales in two months = Sales in the first month + Sales in the second month = \( 1200 + 900 = 2100 \) dollars.

"To determine how many dollars were withheld from Sally’s wage, we need to calculate the difference between the amount of money in her bank account at the end of the week and the amount she should have in her bank account if she had received her full weekly wage.

1. Sally's bank account at the start of the week: $200
2. Sally's bank account at the end of the week: $420
3. Sally's weekly wage should be: $300

First, we calculate the total amount of money Sally should have in her bank account if she had received her full weekly wage:
\[ \text{Total amount Sally should have} = \text{Initial amount} + \text{Weekly wage} = 200 + 300 = 500 \]

Next, we find the difference between the amount Sally actually has in her bank account and the amount she should have:
\[ \text{Amount withheld} = \text{Actual amount in bank account} - \text{Total amount Sally should have} = 420 - 500 = -80 \]

Since the result is negative, it indicates that Sally has received $80 more than she should have. Therefore, the amount withheld from her wage is:
\[ \text{Amount withheld} = 80 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's denote:
- \( s \) as the number of sheep,
- \( g \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we know:
1. Each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, and the total number of legs is 70.
2. Each sheep and each goose has one head, and the total number of heads is 20.

This gives us the following equations:
\[ 4s + 2g = 70 \]
\[ s + g = 20 \]

We can solve this system of equations step by step. First, we can simplify the first equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2s + g = 35 \]

Now we have the simplified system:
\[ 2s + g = 35 \]
\[ s + g = 20 \]

Next, we can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate \( g \):
\[ (2s + g) - (s + g) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2s + g - s - g = 15 \]
\[ s = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep is \( s = 15 \).

To verify, we can substitute \( s = 15 \) back into the second equation:
\[ 15 + g = 20 \]
\[ g = 5 \]

Now we check the number of legs:
\[ 4s + 2g = 4(15) + 2(5) = 60 + 10 = 70 \]

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"

Next, we need to find out how much money Rayna has. Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, so:

\[ \text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \]

Now, let's find the total amount of money they have together:

\[ \text{Total money} = \text{Aurelia's money} + \text{Kassidy's money} + \text{Rayna's money} = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 \]

If they decide to share this total amount of money equally among the three of them, each person would get:

\[ \text{Each person's share} = \frac{360}{3} = 120 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{120} \]"

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the candies Adam bought.

The cost of one candy of type A is $0.5, and Adam bought 7 candies of type A. Therefore, the total cost for type A candies is:
\[ 7 \times 0.5 = 3.5 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of one candy of type B is $0.75, and Adam bought 10 candies of type B. Therefore, the total cost for type B candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.75 = 7.5 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the costs of the candies of both types to find the total cost:
\[ 3.5 + 7.5 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

Adam paid the cashier $15. To find the change he received, we subtract the total cost from the amount he paid:
\[ 15 - 11 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the number of good days left in the month, we need to first verify the total number of good, bad, and neutral days based on the information provided.

Christina had twelve good days in total over the thirty days. The first eight days were good, the next eight days were bad, and the last eight days were neutral. This means that the first eight days accounted for 8 good days, and the last eight days accounted for 0 good days. Therefore, the number of good days in the middle eight days is:

\[ 12 - 8 = 4 \]

So, the total number of good days is confirmed to be 12. Now, we need to account for the next three days: the first of these is good, the second is neutral, and the third is good. This means that the next three days add 2 more good days to the total:

\[ 12 + 2 = 14 \]

Thus, the number of good days left in the month is:

"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Number of books Janey has} = 2S + 3 \]

We are given that Janey has 21 books. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 21 \]

To find \( S \), we first subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2S = 18 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 9 \]"
"First, we need to convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can calculate the current height in inches as follows:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine the difference in height needed for the bamboo to reach 600 inches. This can be calculated by subtracting the current height from the target height:

\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

Given that the bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day, we can find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow 360 inches by dividing the required growth by the daily growth rate:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of toys James needs initially. He currently has 4 toys for 4 dogs, so he needs 4 more toys for the 8 new dogs that have arrived. This means he needs 4 toys for the 8 new dogs.

\[ \text{Toys needed for 8 new dogs} = 4 \]

After buying the toys for the 8 new dogs, the number of dogs in the shelter is now \(4 + 8 = 12\). At this point, there are twice as many more dogs than when he left, which means there are 12 more dogs than the initial 4 dogs. This is consistent with the 8 new dogs that arrived.

\[ \text{Current number of dogs} = 12 \]
\[ \text{Initial number of dogs} = 4 \]
\[ \text{More dogs} = 12 - 4 = 8 \]

After buying the toys for the 12 dogs, 3 dogs left the shelter. So, the number of dogs left is \(12 - 3 = 9\).

\[ \text{Final number of dogs} = 9 \]

Now, James needs to buy toys for the 9 dogs in the shelter. Since each dog needs one toy, he needs 9 toys in total.

\[ \text{Total toys needed} = 9 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"First, let's determine how much Dylan invested. Dylan invested \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total amount of $1200.

\[ \text{Dylan's investment} = \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = \frac{2400}{5} = 480 \]

After Dylan's investment, the remaining amount in the account is:

\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

Next, Frances invested \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the remaining $720.

Exceeding load = 720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg

The final numerical answer is 20 kg."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Katarina has 68 cookies.
2. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so Max has \(68 + 5 = 73\) cookies.
3. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has \(73 - 12 = 61\) cookies.
4. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has \(73 + 23 = 96\) cookies.

Now, to find the total number of cookies they all have, we add up the cookies each person has:

\[68 + 73 + 61 + 96\]

Let's calculate the sum:

\[68 + 73 = 141\]
\[141 + 61 = 202\]
\[202 + 96 = 298\]

Therefore, the total number of cookies they have is 298."
"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) centimeters.

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means she adds \( 0.5x \) to the original length. Additionally, she adds 20 cm to the bottom of the dress with a lace trim. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm.

So, the equation representing the final length of the dress is:
\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Now, divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} \]
\[ x = 80 \]

Therefore, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

\[
\boxed{80}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time Chris spent mowing half of his lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half in ""rabbit"" mode.

First, let's convert the times to a consistent unit. We'll use minutes:
- ""Turtle"" mode: 60 minutes
- ""Rabbit"" mode: 40 minutes

Chris mows half of his lawn in each mode. Therefore, the time spent mowing half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Similarly, the time spent mowing half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode is:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

To find the total time spent mowing the entire lawn, we add the time spent in each mode:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is:

\[ \text{Cookies baked by Celinda} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Next, we find the total number of cookies baked by both Greta and Celinda:

\[ \text{Total cookies} = 30 + 60 = 90 \]

They eat 10 cookies while they are cooling, so we subtract these from the total:

\[ \text{Cookies left in the box} = 90 - 10 = 80 \]

Therefore, the number of cookies in the box is:

\[ 80 \]"
"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( Tr \). According to the problem, one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so we can write the first equation as:
\[ T = Tr + 7 \]

We also know that the combined ages of the twins and the triplets is 44, so we can write the second equation as:
\[ T + T + Tr + Tr + Tr = 44 \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 2T + 3Tr = 44 \]

Now we substitute the first equation into the second equation. From \( T = Tr + 7 \), we substitute \( Tr \) with \( T - 7 \):
\[ 2(T - 7) + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 2T - 14 + 3Tr = 44 \]
Since \( Tr = T - 7 \), we substitute \( Tr \) again:
\[ 2T - 14 + 3(T - 7) = 44 \]
\[ 2T - 14 + 3T - 21 = 44 \]
\[ 5T - 35 = 44 \]
\[ 5T = 79 \]
\[ T = \frac{79}{5} \]
\[ T = 15.8 \]

So, the age of one of the twins is \( 15.8 \) years. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the cost of one candy. We know that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20, and each lollipop costs $0.40. Therefore, the cost of five lollipops is:

\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

This means the cost of the four candies is:

\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

So, the cost of one candy is:

\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Now, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:

\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost of 10 candies is:

\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of coins each person has saved over ten years and then sum these amounts.

First, let's determine how many coins Rong has saved in ten years. Rong saves 20 coins per month. There are 12 months in a year, so in ten years, there are \(10 \times 12 = 120\) months. Therefore, the total number of coins Rong has saved is:
\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Next, we need to find out how many coins Neil has saved in ten years. Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong per month. This means Neil saves:
\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \text{ coins/month} \right) = 20 \text{ coins/month} + 8 \text{ coins/month} = 28 \text{ coins/month} \]
So, in ten years, Neil saves:
\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Now, we add the number of coins saved by Rong and Neil to find the total number of coins they have together after ten years:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Since each vaccine costs $20 and John needs 2 vaccines, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \]

Next, let's denote the cost of the heartworm check as \( H \). According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as \( T \). Therefore, we have:
\[ H = 0.6T \]
Since the total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check, we can write:
\[ T = 40 + H \]
Substituting \( H = 0.6T \) into the equation for \( T \), we get:
\[ T = 40 + 0.6T \]
To find \( T \), we need to solve this equation. Subtract \( 0.6T \) from both sides:
\[ T - 0.6T = 40 \]
\[ 0.4T = 40 \]
Divide both sides by 0.4:
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.4} = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To determine the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum these costs.

\[ \text{Price of one banana} = 2 \times 0.5 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

Next, we calculate the price of one orange. Oranges cost three times as much as a banana:
\[ \text{Price of one orange} = 3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for each type of fruit in the crate:
- The crate contains 5 bananas, so the total cost for bananas is:
\[ 5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

- The crate contains 12 apples, so the total cost for apples is:
\[ 12 \times 0.5 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

- The crate contains 7 oranges, so the total cost for oranges is:
\[ 7 \times 3 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we sum the costs of all the fruits to find the total price of the crate:
\[ 5 + 6 + 21 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the price for such a crate of fruit is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"To determine the total area of Brittany's quilted comforter, we first need to find out how many squares of each color there are and then calculate the total number of squares.

1. **Red Squares:**
   \[
   \text{Red Squares} = 14
   \]

2. **Blue Squares:**
   \[
   \text{Blue Squares} = \text{Red Squares} + 4 = 14 + 4 = 18

Adding the fireworks set off in her backyard:

\[ 120 + 15 = 135 \text{ fireworks} \]

So, the total number of fireworks Hannah will see is:

\[ \boxed{135} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of people in the group. Aiden and his 12 friends are going to the cinema, and they meet up with 7 more friends. So the total number of people is:

\[ 1 + 12 + 7 = 20 \]

Each person gets one seat, two drinks, and three snacks. Since each drink and each snack costs $2, we can calculate the cost for each person:

- Cost of drinks per person: \(2 \text{ drinks} \times \$2 \text{ per drink} = \$4\)
- Cost of snacks per person: \(3 \text{ snacks} \times \$2 \text{ per snack} = \$6\)

So, the total cost per person for drinks and snacks is:

\[ \$4 + \$6 = \$10 \]

Since there are 20 people in the group, the total cost for all the drinks and snacks is:

\[ 20 \text{ people} \times \$10 \text{ per person} = \$200 \]

Therefore, the group has spent a total of \$200 on snacks and drinks."
"First, let's determine the capacity of Gordy's truck. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, we can calculate Gordy's truck capacity as follows:

\[ \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = 4000 + 800 = 4800 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know the combined capacity of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks is 11,600 pounds. Let's denote Gary's truck capacity by \( G \). Therefore, we can write the equation for the total capacity as:

\[ 4000 + 4800 + G = 11600 \]

Now, we solve for \( G \):

\[ 8800 + G = 11600 \]
\[ G = 11600 - 8800 \]
\[ G = 2800 \]

So, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2800} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry. We know that each female ate 3 dumplings and there were 6 females. Therefore, the total number of dumplings eaten by the females is:

\[ 6 \text{ females} \times 3 \text{ dumplings/female} = 18 \text{ dumplings} \]

Next, we need to find out how many dumplings each male ate. According to the problem, each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female. Since each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate:

\[ 3 \text{ dumplings} + 1 \text{ dumpling} = 4 \text{ dumplings} \]

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is:

\[ 8 \text{ males} \times 4 \text{ dumplings/male} = 32 \text{ dumplings} \]

To find the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry, we add the dumplings eaten by the females and the dumplings eaten by the males:

\[ 18 \text{ dumplings} + 32 \text{ dumplings} = 50 \text{ dumplings} \]

Thus, the total number of dumplings Larry cooked is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, we need to determine how much money Gerald and Julia received based on the given ratio of 3:2.

The total parts of the ratio are \(3 + 2 = 5\).

Since the total amount of money is $100, each part of the ratio is calculated as:

"First, we need to determine the speed of Martha's turtle. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle and the cat runs at 15 feet per second, we can find the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5.

\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{\text{Cat's speed}}{5} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Next, we need to find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. We do this by multiplying the turtle's speed by the time.

\[ \text{Distance the turtle can crawl} = \text{Turtle's speed} \times \text{Time} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 120 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much more money the firefighters need to reach their goal and then calculate how many additional hours they need to work to raise that amount, given that they raise an equal amount each hour.

1. The goal is to raise $6300.
2. After 3 hours, they have raised $2100.
3. Therefore, the amount of money they still need to raise is:
   \[
   6300 - 2100 = 4200
   \]
4. Since they raise an equal amount each hour, and they raised $2100 in 3 hours, the amount raised per hour is:
   \[
   \frac{2100}{3} = 700
   \]
5. To find out how many more hours they need to raise the remaining $4200, we divide the remaining amount by the amount raised per hour:
   \[
   \frac{4200}{700} = 6
   \]

So, they need to raise for an additional 6 hours. Adding the initial 3 hours, the total number of hours they need to work is:
\[
3 + 6 = 9

"To find the percent of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the percentage of water used by the city for industrial purposes.
2. Subtract this percentage from 100% to find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes.

First, we know that Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. Out of this 40%, 80% is used for industrial purposes. Therefore, the percentage of water used by the city for industrial purposes is:
\[ 40\% \times 80\% = 40\% \times 0.80 = 32\% \]

Next, to find the percentage of water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the industrial usage percentage from the total usage percentage:
\[ 40\% - 32\% = 8\% \]

So, the percent of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is:
\[ 8\% \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"To calculate how much Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we first need to determine the daily charge and then multiply it by the number of days in 2 weeks.

Alex charges $12 per day.

There are 7 days in a week, so in 2 weeks, there are:
\[ 7 \text{ days/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 14 \text{ days} \]

Now, we calculate the total charge for 14 days:
\[ 12 \text{ dollars/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 168 \text{ dollars} \]

"First, let's determine the production rate for each flavor.

For chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for chocolate ice cream is \( \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

For vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for vanilla ice cream is \( \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Next, we calculate the total production for 48 hours.

For chocolate ice cream:
- At a rate of 50 quarts per hour, in 48 hours, the factory would produce \( 50 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts} \).

For vanilla ice cream:
- At a rate of 12.5 quarts per hour, in 48 hours, the factory would produce \( 12.5 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts} \).

Finally, we add the total production of both flavors:
- Total quarts made in 48 hours = 2400 quarts (chocolate) + 600 quarts (vanilla) = 3000 quarts.

The final numerical answer is:
3000"
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of baked good:

- Croissants: 5 croissants * $3.00 each = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls * $2.50 each = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches * $4.00 each = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 blueberry muffins * $1.00 each = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost before the discount:

Total cost before discount = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Marcus gets a 10% discount on his purchase. To find the discount amount:

Discount amount = 10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final bill:

Final bill = $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

So, Marcus' total bill is $45.00."
"First, let's determine the cost of the ice cream deal. For every 2 scoops bought, Erin gets 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50.

The cost for 2 scoops is:
\[ 2 \times 1.50 = 3.00 \]

Since she gets 1 scoop free for every 2 scoops bought, the total number of scoops she can get for $6.00 is calculated by first determining how many sets of 2 scoops she can buy with her $6.00.

The number of sets of 2 scoops she can buy is:
\[ \frac{6.00}{3.00} = 2 \]

So, she can buy 2 sets of 2 scoops, which means she can buy:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ scoops} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much more candy Amy has after two weeks compared to Ginger, we need to calculate the amount of candy each person eats over that period and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the number of days in two weeks:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ days} \]

Next, we calculate how much candy Ginger eats in 14 days:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Then, we calculate how much candy Amy eats in 14 days:
\[ 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we find out how much candy Ginger has left after 14 days:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces} \]

And how much candy Amy has left after 14 days:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces} \]

Finally, we determine how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger:
\[ 58 \text{ pieces} - 44 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy after two weeks. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost James incurred for picking the blueberries. The cost to go picking is $20, and the cost per pound is $1.5. He picked 30 pounds, so the cost for the blueberries is:

\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.5 \text{ per pound} = \$45 \]

Adding the initial cost to go picking, the total cost for James is:

\[ \$20 + \$45 = \$65 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the same amount of blueberries at the store. The store price is $2.5 per pound, and he picked 30 pounds, so the cost at the store is:

\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.5 \text{ per pound} = \$75 \]

To find out how much James saved compared to buying at the store, we subtract the cost James paid from the cost he would have paid at the store:

\[ \$75 - \$65 = \$10 \]

So, James saved $10 by picking the blueberries himself. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the original price of each computer. The company planned to buy each computer for $700, but the actual price was 10% higher than this amount.

To find the new price of each computer:
\[ \text{New Price} = \text{Original Price} + (\text{Original Price} \times 10\%) \]
\[ \text{New Price} = 700 + (700 \times 0.10) \]
\[ \text{New Price} = 700 + 70 \]
\[ \text{New Price} = 770 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of money paid for 500 computers at the new price of $770 each:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Number of Computers} \times \text{New Price per Computer} \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 500 \times 770 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of taps Helga makes with both her feet over the 5-minute period, considering the different tap rates for different parts of her dance.

First, let's determine the number of taps when her arms are at her sides:
- Right foot tap rate: 300 taps per minute
- Left foot tap rate: 250 taps per minute
- Combined tap rate when arms are at her sides: 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute

For 3 minutes (since she dances for a total of 5 minutes with her arms raised for 2 minutes):
\[ 550 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 1650 \text{ taps} \]

Next, let's determine the number of taps when her arms are raised:
- Right foot tap rate: 200 taps per minute
- Left foot tap rate: 200 taps per minute
- Combined tap rate when arms are raised: 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute

For 2 minutes (since she dances with her arms raised for 2 minutes):
\[ 400 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 800 \text{ taps} \]

Now, we add the taps from both parts of the dance:

Next, we need to find Dora's mother's age. The problem states that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. Therefore, we can calculate her mother's age as follows:

\[
\text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4 = 38 - 4 = 34
\]

Now, we can find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother by adding their ages together:

\[
\text{Total combined age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{87}

"First, let's calculate the weight of Cindy's math and science books. Since each of these books weighs 2 pounds and there are two of them, the total weight for the math and science books is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds/book} \times 2 \text{ books} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know the weight of her French book is 4 pounds and her English book is 3 pounds. So, the total weight for her French and English books is:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} + 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Her history book weighs twice as much as her English book. Since her English book weighs 3 pounds, the weight of her history book is:
\[ 2 \times 3 \text{ pounds} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add up the weights of all her books to find the total weight:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds (math and science)} + 7 \text{ pounds (French and English)} + 6 \text{ pounds (history)} = 17 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is:
\[ 17 \text{ pounds} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of votes candidate B received. Candidate A received 20% of the votes, and candidate B received 50% more than candidate A's votes.

Candidate A's votes = 20% of 100 = 0.20 * 100 = 20 votes

Candidate B's votes = Candidate A's votes + 50% of Candidate A's votes
Candidate B's votes = 20 + 0.50 * 20 = 20 + 10 = 30 votes

Now, we can find out how many votes candidate C received by subtracting the votes of candidates A and B from the total number of votes.

Total votes = 100
Votes for candidate C = Total votes - (Votes for candidate A + Votes for candidate B)
Votes for candidate C = 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 votes

So, candidate C received 50 votes."
"First, let's determine how many apples Beck has initially. Since Boris has 100 apples and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, we can calculate the number of apples Beck has as follows:

\[ \text{Beck's apples} = \text{Boris's apples} - 23 = 100 - 23 = 77 \]

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. So, we need to update the number of apples each person has after this transaction:

\[ \text{Boris's apples after giving 10 to Beck} = 100 - 10 = 90 \]
\[ \text{Beck's apples after receiving 10 from Boris} = 77 + 10 = 87 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after this transaction:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Boris's apples} - \text{Beck's apples} = 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of water used for the giant cubes. Peter makes 3 giant cubes, and each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water. Therefore, the total water used for the giant cubes is:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of water used for the medium cubes. Peter makes 7 medium cubes, and each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water. Therefore, the total water used for the medium cubes is:
\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ ounces} \]

Then, let's calculate the total amount of water used for the small cubes. Peter makes 8 small cubes, and each small cube uses 0.5 ounces of water. Therefore, the total water used for the small cubes is:
\[ 8 \times 0.5 = 4 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, let's add up the total amount of water used for all the cubes:
\[ 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. After using 30 ounces, the amount of water left is:
\[ 32 - 30 = 2 \text{ ounces} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's start by determining how many books Steven has. We know that Clara has two times as many books as Steven and Clara has 20 books. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ 2 \times \text{Steven's books} = 20 \]

Solving for Steven's books:

\[ \text{Steven's books} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Now, we know Steven has 10 books. Since Alice has 6 more books than Steven, we can calculate the number of books Alice has:

\[ \text{Alice's books} = \text{Steven's books} + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16 \]

Next, we need to find out how many more books Clara has than Alice. Clara has 20 books and Alice has 16 books, so:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Clara's books} - \text{Alice's books} = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, Clara has 4 more books than Alice. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. Given that a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar, and a gallon jar costs $5, we can calculate the cost of a half-gallon jar as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of gallon jar} - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars:

\[
\text{Total cost for 10 gallon jars} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ dollars}
\]

Then, we calculate the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars:

\[
\text{Total cost for 16 half-gallon jars} = 16 \times 3 = 48 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we add the two amounts to find the total amount of money Cecelia spent:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total number of students**: 50
2. **Students who like to bake**: 10
3. **Students who like to play basketball**: 5
4. **Students who like to play video games or play music**: The rest of the students.

First, we calculate the number of students who like to play video games or play music:
\[ 50 - (10 + 5) = 50 - 15 = 35 \]

Next, we know that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number of students who like to play basketball:
\[ \text{Number of students who like to play music} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, we can find the number of students who like to play video games by subtracting the number of students who like to play music from the total number of students who like to play video games or play music:

"To find the number of boys in each class, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of students in each class.
2. Calculate the number of girls in each class.
3. Subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class to find the number of boys.

First, since the total number of students in the two classes is 80 and each class has the same number of students, each class has:
\[ \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ students} \]

Next, since 40% of the students in each class are girls, the number of girls in each class is:
\[ 40 \times 0.40 = 16 \text{ girls} \]

Therefore, the number of boys in each class is:
\[ 40 - 16 = 24 \text{ boys} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much Jake's family will save by choosing the second amusement park, we need to calculate the total cost for each park and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total cost for the first amusement park:
- The cost for 2 adults at the first park is \(2 \times 26 = 52\) dollars.
- The cost for 2 children at the first park is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the first park is \(52 + 24 = 76\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the second amusement park:
- The cost for 2 adults at the second park is \(2 \times 14 = 28\) dollars.
- The cost for 2 children at the second park is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the second park is \(28 + 20 = 48\) dollars.

Now, we find the savings by subtracting the total cost of the second park from the total cost of the first park:
- The savings are \(76 - 48 = 28\) dollars.

Thus, Jake's family will be able to save \(\boxed{28}\) dollars if they choose the second amusement park over the first."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many students would be in each group if the activity is divided into 12 groups.

First, we find out how many students would be in each group if there are 12 groups:
\[ \text{Number of students per group} = \frac{54 \text{ students}}{12 \text{ groups}} = 4.5 \text{ students per group} \]

Since the number of students per group must be a whole number, it is not possible to divide 54 students into 12 groups of equal size. Therefore, the question implies that the activity can only be divided into 6 groups, as stated in the original problem.

The number of additional groups needed to form 12 groups from the original 6 groups is:
\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during a single weekday and a single weekend day:
- During weekdays, Candy rents out 60 chairs each day.
- During weekends, Candy rents out 100 chairs each day.

Next, we need to determine the number of weekdays and weekend days in a 4-week month:
- There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a single week.
- Therefore, in a 4-week month, there are \(5 \times 4 = 20\) weekdays and \(2 \times 4 = 8\) weekend days.

Now, we can calculate the total number of chairs rented during a 4-week month:
- Chairs rented during weekdays: \(60 \times 20 = 1200\)
- Chairs rented during weekends: \(100 \times 8 = 800\)
- Total chairs rented in one 4-week month: \(1200 + 800 = 2000\)

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The first house needs \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the second house, so the first house needs \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases.
- The third house needs double the first house, so the third house needs \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) cases.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{5}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{5} \):
\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{5} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. The third house needs double the first house, which is:
\[ 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = 2 \times \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

Number of pears = 200 + 0.45 * 200
Number of pears = 200 + 90
Number of pears = 290

Now, to find the total number of fruits, we add the number of bananas and the number of pears:

Total number of fruits = Number of bananas + Number of pears
Total number of fruits = 200 + 290
Total number of fruits = 490

So, the final numerical answer is 490."

"First, let's determine how many books Ahmed read in one hour. According to the problem, Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in one hour. Since Ezra read 300 books, we can set up the following equation to find out how many books Ahmed read:

\[ \text{Ahmed's books} = \frac{\text{Ezra's books}}{2} = \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

So, Ahmed read 150 books in one hour.

Next, we need to find out how many books Ezra will have read after reading an additional 150 books. Since Ezra already read 300 books, adding the additional 150 books gives:

\[ \text{Ezra's total books} = 300 + 150 = 450 \]

Now, we can find the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed. Adding the books read by Ahmed (150) to the books read by Ezra (450) gives:

\[ \text{Total books} = 150 + 450 = 600 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To calculate Tanya's earnings, we need to break down her earnings for each day based on the given conditions.

**Monday:**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She also earns an additional $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Monday:
\[ \text{Base earnings} = 4 \text{ classes} \times 5 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 20 \times 5 \times 15 = \$1500 \]

Next, calculate the additional earnings for Monday:
\[ \text{Additional earnings} = 1 \times \$5 = \$5 \]

So, Tanya's total earnings for Monday are:
\[ \text{Total earnings for Monday} = \$1500 + \$5 = \$1505 \]

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She does not earn the additional $5 per day since she does not teach more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Wednesday:
\[ \text{Base earnings} = 2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 2 \times 2 \times 15 = \$60 \]

Since she does not teach more than 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5 per day.

So, Tanya's total earnings for Wednesday are:
\[ \text{Total earnings for Wednesday} = \$60 \]

**Total earnings for the two days:**
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Total earnings for Monday} + \text{Total earnings for Wednesday} = \$1505 + \$60 = \$1565 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$1565 \]"

"First, let's calculate the total amount Bennet makes from selling the eggplants. He sells 20 eggplants at $3 each, so the total from the eggplants is:

\[ 20 \text{ eggplants} \times \$3/\text{eggplant} = \$60 \]

Bennet wants to make a total of $135. To find out how much more money he needs to make from selling the corn, we subtract the amount he already has from the total he wants:

\[ \$135 - \$60 = \$75 \]

Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for to make the remaining $75, we divide the remaining amount by the number of ears of corn:

\[ \frac{\$75}{25 \text{ ears}} = \$3/\text{ear} \]

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \$3 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total hours Tatiana has available over the weekend:

\[ 7 \text{ hours (Saturday)} + 5 \text{ hours (Sunday)} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we subtract the time she spends reading:

\[ 12 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours (reading)} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the time she spends playing video games. She plays video games for \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the remaining time after reading:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can find out how much time she spends playing soccer by subtracting the time spent on video games and reading from the total available time:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours (video games)} - 3 \text{ hours (reading)} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we calculate the percentage of the weekend Tatiana spends playing soccer:

\[ \text{Remaining pencils} = 50 - 25 = 25 \]

Next, Anthony gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Pencils given to Charlie} = \frac{3}{5} \times 25 = 15 \]

After giving 15 pencils to Charlie, the number of pencils Anthony kept is:

\[ \text{Pencils Anthony kept} = 25 - 15 = 10 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to consider both the time spent driving and the time spent at the museum.

First, let's calculate the time spent driving. The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and Jack drives at a speed of 75 mph. The time spent driving one way is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time spent driving to the museum is:

\[ \text{Time to museum} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Since Jack drives back home at the same speed, the time spent driving back is also 2 hours. Therefore, the total driving time is:

\[ \text{Total driving time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Jack spends 6 hours at the museum. Therefore, the total time Jack is gone from home is the sum of the driving time and the time spent at the museum:

\[ \text{Total time} = 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 10 \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total number of wheels required for the cars and motorcycles.

For the cars:
Henry needs 4 wheels for each car, and he has 57 cars.
\[ 4 \text{ wheels/car} \times 57 \text{ cars} = 228 \text{ wheels} \]

For the motorcycles:
Henry needs 2 wheels for each motorcycle, and he has 73 motorcycles.
\[ 2 \text{ wheels/motorcycle} \times 73 \text{ motorcycles} = 146 \text{ wheels} \]

Next, we add the wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles to find the total number of wheels required:
\[ 228 \text{ wheels} + 146 \text{ wheels} = 374 \text{ wheels} \]

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left after assembling all the toys, we subtract the total number of wheels required from the number of wheels Henry has:
\[ 650 \text{ wheels} - 374 \text{ wheels} = 276 \text{ wheels} \]

So, after applying the 20% discount, you have to pay $800."
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Mike has 600 movies in total.
- A third of the movies are in various series, which means \( \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \) movies are in series.
- The remaining movies are \( 600 - 200 = 400 \) movies.
- 40% of the remaining 400 movies are older movies, which means \( 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \) movies are older.
- The rest of the remaining movies are not in series or older, which is \( 400 - 160 = 240 \) movies.

Now, let's calculate the cost of replacing the movies:

- The cost for the series movies is $6 each, so the total cost for the series movies is \( 200 \times 6 = 1200 \) dollars.
- The cost for the older movies is $5 each, so the total cost for the older movies is \( 160 \times 5 = 800 \) dollars.
- The cost for the remaining movies is $10 each, so the total cost for the remaining movies is \( 240 \times 10 = 2400 \) dollars.

Adding these costs together gives the total cost of replacing the movies:
\[ 1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance driven and the total distance hiked, and then sum these distances to find the total distance to the vacation spot.

First, let's determine the speed at which they hiked. The problem states that they hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Since they drove at an average of 50 miles per hour, half of this speed is:
\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ miles per hour} \]
So, their hiking speed is:
\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we calculate the distance they hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at a speed of 20 miles per hour, so the distance hiked is:
\[ 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we calculate the distance they drove. They drove for 6 hours at a speed of 50 miles per hour, so the distance driven is:
\[ 50 \times 6 = 300 \text{ miles} \]

The total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked:
\[ 300 + 30 = 330 \text{ miles} \]

"To determine the difference in scores between Ava and Emma, we need to calculate the points each player earns based on the given conditions.

Let's denote:
- \( E \) as the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- \( B \) as the number of berries Emma collects.
- \( T \) as the time Emma finishes the level in seconds.

Ava's score can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Ava's score} = 10 \times (E + 8) + 5 \times (B + 3) + 30 \times (T + 4) \]

Emma's score can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Emma's score} = 10 \times E + 5 \times B + 30 \times T \]

The difference in their scores is:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Ava's score} - \text{Emma's score} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = [10 \times (E + 8) + 5 \times (B + 3) + 30 \times (T + 4)] - [10 \times E + 5 \times B + 30 \times T] \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 10 \times E + 80 + 5 \times B + 15 + 30 \times T + 120 - 10 \times E - 5 \times B - 30 \times T \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 80 + 15 + 120 \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 215 \]

Thus, the difference between their two scores is 215 points."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each. Then, we subtract this amount from the total cost to find the combined cost of the other two pizzas. Finally, we divide this amount by 2 to find the cost of each of the other two pizzas.

The total cost of the four pizzas is 64 dollars. The cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each is:
\[ 30 + 30 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting this from the total cost gives the combined cost of the other two pizzas:
\[ 64 - 60 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the combined cost of these two pizzas by 2:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, each of the other two pizzas cost 2 dollars. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To solve this, let's break down the problem into parts:

"Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as \( w \) and the number of orange fish he bought as \( o \). We know that the total number of fish he bought from the pet store is \( o + w = 17 \).

After adding these fish to his pond, the total number of orange fish became \( 3 + o \) and the total number of white fish became \( 4 + w \). According to the problem, after adding the new fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish. This gives us the equation:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( o + w = 17 \)
2. \( 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \)

Let's simplify the second equation:
\[ 3 + o = 8 + 2w \]
\[ o - 2w = 5 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( o + w = 17 \)
2. \( o - 2w = 5 \)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use elimination. First, we'll eliminate \( o \) by subtracting the second equation from the first:
\[ (o + w) - (o - 2w) = 17 - 5 \]
\[ o + w - o + 2w = 12 \]
\[ 3w = 12 \]
\[ w = 4 \]

Now that we have \( w = 4 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( o \):
\[ o + 4 = 17 \]
\[ o = 13 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish and 13 orange fish. The number of white fish Bob bought at the store is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total distance Andy travels in a week. Since he goes to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days. The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, so the round trip distance is \(5 \times 2 = 10\) miles per day. Therefore, in a week, he travels \(10 \times 5 = 50\) miles.

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of gas Andy consumes in a week. Given that his car's fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon, the number of gallons used in a week is \(50 \div 10 = 5\) gallons.

Finally, to find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we multiply the number of gallons by the price per gallon. The price of regular gas is $3 per gallon, so the cost per week is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie received from her aunt.

Carrie received ten twenties, which means she received:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Carrie also received 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount from the quarters is:
\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate how much money Carrie spent. She spent all the quarters, which is $35. Additionally, she spent 3/5 of the twenties. The amount spent on the twenties is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = \frac{3 \times 200}{5} = \frac{600}{5} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

The total amount of money Carrie spent for lunch is the sum of the money spent on quarters and the money spent on twenties:

Each employee is paid $4000 per month. Therefore, the total salary paid to all employees each month is:
\[ 260 \text{ employees} \times 4000 \text{ dollars/employee} = 1040000 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Multiply the total salary per month by the number of months (three months).**

The total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is:
\[ 1040000 \text{ dollars/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 3120000 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 3120000 \]"

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the hourly wages for both Billy and Sally, and then determine the total earnings for 20 hours for each. Finally, we will find the difference in their earnings.

First, let's determine Billy's hourly wage at each stage:
- Initially, Billy's hourly wage is $10.
- After 2 months, his wage increases by $0.50 to $10.50.
- On his first anniversary, his wage increases by another $1.00 to $11.50.

Now, let's calculate Sally's hourly wage:
- Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's initial wage.
- Billy's initial wage is $10, so Sally's wage is $10.50.

Next, we calculate the total earnings for 20 hours for both Billy and Sally:
- Billy's total earnings for 20 hours:
  \[
  20 \text{ hours} \times \$11.50 \text{ per hour} = \$230
  \]
- Sally's total earnings for 20 hours:
  \[
  20 \text{ hours} \times \$10.50 \text{ per hour} = \$210
  \]

Finally, we find the difference in their earnings:
\[
\$230 - \$210 = \$20
\]

Thus, Billy will earn $20 more than Sally in 20 hours. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"To find the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita, we first need to determine how many points Nikita scored. According to the problem, Nikita scored 11 more than half as many points as Pierson.

Pierson's score is 278 points. Half of Pierson's score is:
\[ \frac{278}{2} = 139 \]

Nikita's score is 11 more than this value:
\[ 139 + 11 = 150 \]

Now, we add Pierson's and Nikita's scores together to find the total:
\[ 278 + 150 = 428 \]

The total points scored by Pierson and Nikita is:
\[ \boxed{428} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of students and teachers at Ashley's school.

The school has 40 classes with an average of 25 students per class:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 25 \text{ students/class} = 1000 \text{ students} \]

The school also has 40 classes with an average of 3 teachers per class:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 3 \text{ teachers/class} = 120 \text{ teachers} \]

Each child plants 1 tree, so the total number of trees planted by the students is:
\[ 1000 \text{ students} \times 1 \text{ tree/student} = 1000 \text{ trees} \]

Each teacher plants 2 trees, so the total number of trees planted by the teachers is:
\[ 120 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ trees/teacher} = 240 \text{ trees} \]

Adding the trees planted by the students and the teachers gives the total number of trees planted:
\[ 1000 \text{ trees} + 240 \text{ trees} = 1240 \text{ trees} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1240 \]"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has. She has:

- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

Adding these together gives us the total number of stuffed animals she currently has:

\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

Let's denote the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy as \( x \). After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \). We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30%. Therefore, the equation representing this situation is:

\[ \frac{x}{14 + x} = 0.30 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total hours Kris has already played.

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, so:
\[ 14 \text{ days} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/day} = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Next, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/day} = 14 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's add the hours from both periods to find the total hours played so far:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} + 14 \text{ hours} = 21 \text{ hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. Therefore, the number of hours she still needs to play is:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} - 21 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled by the first car:
- The first car travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance traveled by the first car is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled by the second car:
- The second car travels at an average speed of 70 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance traveled by the second car is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed}_2 \times \text{Time} = 70 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled by the two cars:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_2 - \text{Distance}_1 = 140 \, \text{miles} - 120 \, \text{miles} = 20 \, \text{miles}
\]

Thus, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car. The final numerical answer is:
\[

"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the ring before the premium is added. The cost of the diamond is $600 and the cost of the gold is $300. Adding these together gives:

\[ 600 + 300 = 900 \]

Next, we need to calculate the premium. The premium is 30% of the total cost of the ring. To find 30% of $900, we multiply $900 by 0.30:

\[ 900 \times 0.30 = 270 \]

Now, we add the premium to the original total cost to find the final amount James paid:

\[ 900 + 270 = 1170 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1170 \]"
"To find the overall pass rate for the school, we need to calculate the pass rates for each grade and then find the average of these rates.

First, let's calculate the pass rate for the third graders:
\[ \text{Pass rate for third graders} = \frac{340}{500} = 0.68 \]

Next, the pass rate for the fourth graders is given as:
\[ \text{Pass rate for fourth graders} = \frac{40}{100} = 0.40 \]

The pass rate for the fifth graders is twice that of the fourth graders:
\[ \text{Pass rate for fifth graders} = 2 \times 0.40 = 0.80 \]

Now, we calculate the overall pass rate for the school by taking the average of the pass rates for the three grades:
\[ \text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{0.68 + 0.40 + 0.80}{3} = \frac{1.88}{3} \approx 0.6267 \]

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.6267 \times 100 \approx 62.67\% \]

Therefore, the school's overall pass rate is:
\[ \boxed{62.67\%} \]"
"First, let's determine how many glass chips Milo has in total. Since each bag contains 72 chips and he has two bags, the total number of chips is:
\[ 72 \text{ chips/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we need to find out how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make every square inch, the number of square inches he can make is:
\[ \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips/square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. To find out how many inches long he can make his mosaic, we use the fact that the area of the mosaic is the product of its length and height. Let \( L \) be the length of the mosaic in inches. The area of the mosaic is given by:
\[ L \times 3 \text{ inches} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{12 \text{ square inches}}{3 \text{ inches}} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts of tea:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of tea consumed:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

We know that there are 10 quarts of tea left. Therefore, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we convert the total quarts to gallons:
\[ \frac{48}{4} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"Dale initially had 100 candies and sold 150, which means he is short by 50 candies (150 - 100 = 50). After ordering 100 more candies, the total number of candies he has is 100 (initial) + 100 (new order) = 200 candies. To find out how many candies he still needs to sell, we subtract the number of candies he has from the total number of candies he ordered, which is 200 - 150 = 50 candies.

The final numerical answer is:
50"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students on campus at the end of each month and then determine the total number of additional students who joined by the end of May.

Starting with 10 students at the beginning of the year, the number of students doubles every month.

- At the end of January: \(10 \times 2 = 20\) students
- At the end of February: \(20 \times 2 = 40\) students
- At the end of March: \(40 \times 2 = 80\) students
- At the end of April: \(80 \times 2 = 160\) students
- At the end of May: \(160 \times 2 = 320\) students

Now, we calculate the total number of additional students who joined by the end of May:

- Additional students in January: \(20 - 10 = 10\)
- Additional students in February: \(40 - 20 = 20\)
- Additional students in March: \(80 - 40 = 40\)
- Additional students in April: \(160 - 80 = 80\)
- Additional students in May: \(320 - 160 = 160\)

Summing these additional students:
\[10 + 20 + 40 + 80 + 160 = 310\]

Thus, the number of additional students who would have joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year, is 310."
"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we first need to determine the total number of branches he climbed during the week.

Given that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs and he made $105 during the week, we can calculate the total number of branches he climbed by dividing the total earnings by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} = 420 \text{ branches} \]

Since this was the total for the week, and there are 7 days in a week, we can find the average number of branches climbed per day by dividing the total branches by the number of days:

\[ \text{Branches climbed per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches climbed}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{420}{7} = 60 \text{ branches per day} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 60 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose initially picks:

- For the first 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals.
- For the next 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals.
- For the next 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals.
- For the last 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals.

Adding these together gives the total number of petals before any are dropped:
\[15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\] petals.

Next, Rose drops 1 of each type of flower:
- She drops 1 of the 5-petal flowers, which is 5 petals.
- She drops 1 of the 6-petal flowers, which is 6 petals.
- She drops 1 of the 4-petal flowers, which is 4 petals.
- She drops 1 of the 7-petal flowers, which is 7 petals.

The total number of petals dropped is:
\[5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\] petals.

Subtracting the dropped petals from the initial total gives the number of petals remaining in the vase:
\[101 - 22 = 79\] petals.

Thus, the total number of petals in the vase is:

"First, let's determine the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean to make S'mores. John makes 9 S'mores and DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so together they make:

\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \text{ S'mores} \]

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they use 18 marshmallows in total. They started with 35 marshmallows and dropped 3 on the ground, so the number of marshmallows left is:

\[ 35 - 18 - 3 = 14 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Now, we need to determine how many S'mores they can make with the remaining 14 marshmallows. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they can make:

\[ 14 \text{ S'mores} \]

Since John and DeSean are sharing the remaining marshmallows equally, each of them can have:

\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ S'mores} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the play times for each person:

- Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter.
- One friend can play for half as long as Jack, which is \(20 \div 2 = 10\) minutes.
- Another friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which is \(20 \times 1.5 = 30\) minutes.
- The third friend can play for 10 minutes, the same as the friend who can only play half as long as Jack.

Next, we need to calculate the total play time in minutes:
- Jack plays for 20 minutes.
- The friend who can play for 10 minutes plays for 10 minutes.
- The friend who can play for 30 minutes plays for 30 minutes.
- The friend who can play for 10 minutes plays for 10 minutes.

Adding these times together:
\[ 20 + 10 + 30 + 10 = 70 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to determine how many quarters are used. Since each quarter allows for 20 minutes of play:
\[ \frac{70 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes per quarter}} = 3.5 \text{ quarters} \]

Since Jack and his friends can only use whole quarters, they will use 4 quarters in total.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the amount of each ingredient Tanya uses as follows:
- Let \( S \) be the amount of salt.
- Let \( O \) be the amount of oil.
- Let \( F \) be the amount of fragrance.
- Let \( C \) be the amount of citrus zest.
- Let \( G \) be the amount of sugar.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S = G \) (same amount of salt as sugar)
2. \( O = 2S \) (twice as much oil as salt)
3. \( F = C \) (same amount of fragrance as citrus zest)
4. \( S = C \) (same amount of salt as citrus zest)

Since \( S = C \) and \( F = C \), we can say \( S = F = C \).

The total amount of ingredients in the jar is 10 ounces. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total amount of ingredients as:
\[ S + O + F + C + G = 10 \]

Substituting the relationships into the equation:
\[ S + 2S + S + S + S = 10 \]
\[ 6S = 10 \]
\[ S = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \]

Since \( O = 2S \):
\[ O = 2 \times \frac{5}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \]

Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \(\frac{10}{3}\) ounces. Converting this to a decimal, we get approximately 3.33 ounces, but the exact answer is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{10}{3}} \]"

"First, let's determine how many cars Joe initially has. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert and Robert has 20 cars, Joe initially has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. The number of cars he sells is:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

After selling 8 cars, the number of cars Joe has left is:

\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \text{ cars} \]

Joe then gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

After giving away 16 cars, the number of cars Joe has left is:

\[ 32 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, the final number of cars Joe remains with is:

"To calculate the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days in minutes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the time Sandy walked on the first day.
2. Determine the time Sandy walked on the second day.
3. Convert the total time from hours to minutes.

First, Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day. On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she did on the first day. Therefore, the time she walked on the second day is:
\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total time in hours:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time from hours to minutes:
\[ 12 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days in minutes is:

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now we know PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards, and Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

"First, let's determine the number of each color of eggs Cindy has:

- Cindy has 5 green eggs.
- She has twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she has \(2 \times 5 = 10\) blue eggs.
- She has one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so she has \(10 - 1 = 9\) pink eggs.
- She has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she has \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\) yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs:

- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: 10
- Pink eggs: 9
- Yellow eggs: 3

"First, let's calculate the shipping cost. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound plus $0.08 per mile.

The cost for the weight of the book is:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.35/\text{pound} = \$1.40 \]

The cost for the distance is:
\[ 20 \text{ miles} \times \$0.08/\text{mile} = \$1.60 \]

So, the total shipping cost is:
\[ \$1.40 + \$1.60 = \$3.00 \]

Next, we calculate the refundable amount from Amazon. Since Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price:
\[ 32 \text{ dollars} \times 0.75 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we determine the total cost Milly will incur:
\[ \text{Shipping cost} + \text{Cost of the book} = \$3.00 + 32 \text{ dollars} = \$35.00 \]

Finally, the amount of money Milly will lose is the total cost minus the refundable amount:

Total money after receiving from her father: $40 + $100 = $140

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the items she bought:

Cost of two pairs of jeans: 2 * $30 = $60
Cost of the bag: $20

Total cost of the items: $60 + $20 = $80

Finally, let's calculate how much money Mulan has left after the purchases:

Money left: $140 - $80 = $60

So, the final numerical answer is $60."
"To determine how many bars of chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to first calculate the total production for the first three weeks and then subtract this from the total monthly production.

1. **First Week Production:**
   Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.

2. **Second Week Production:**
   Boris produces half as much as the first week.
   \[
   \text{Second Week Production} = \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

3. **Third Week Production:**
   Boris produces three times as much as the first week.
   \[
   \text{Third Week Production} = 3 \times 8,000 = 24,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

4. **Total Production for the First Three Weeks:**
   \[
   \text{Total Production} = 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

5. **Fourth Week Production:**
   Boris produces the remaining bars of chocolate in the fourth week.
   \[
   \text{Fourth Week Production} = 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

Thus, Boris produces 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week."
"To calculate the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to consider the time spent on each activity and then sum them up.

1. **Time spent on TikTok videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week.
   - Each video is 4 minutes long.
   - Therefore, the time spent on TikTok videos each week is \(18 \times 4 = 72\) minutes.
   - For a month with four weeks, the total time spent on TikTok videos is \(72 \times 4 = 288\) minutes.

2. **Time spent writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Since 1 hour equals 60 minutes, 2 hours equal \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes.
   - For a month with four weeks, the total time spent writing songs is \(120 \times 4 = 480\) minutes.

3. **Time spent on makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup.
   - For a week, the total time spent on makeup is \(15 \times 6 = 90\) minutes.
   - For a month with four weeks, the total time spent on makeup is \(90 \times 4 = 360\) minutes.

Now, we sum up all the time spent:
- Time on TikTok videos: 288 minutes
- Time writing songs: 480 minutes
- Time on makeup: 360 minutes

Total time spent in a month is \(288 + 480 + 360 = 1128\) minutes.

The final numerical answer is 1128 minutes."
"To determine the cost for Angela, we need to break down the costs step by step.

First, let's calculate the cost for the additional items Angela needs:
- Angela needs 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures.
- The cost for each additional item is $15.00.

The total number of additional items Angela needs is:
\[ 6 \text{ (mirrors)} + 2 \text{ (chandeliers)} + 20 \text{ (pictures)} = 28 \text{ items} \]

The cost for these additional items is:
\[ 28 \text{ items} \times \$15.00 \text{ per item} = \$420.00 \]

Next, we need to add the base installation cost of $129.00 to the cost of the additional items:
\[ \$129.00 + \$420.00 = \$549.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Angela is:
\[ \boxed{549.00} \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Eva has saved. According to the information given, Eva has saved $20.00.

Next, we calculate how much money Anthony has saved. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva. Therefore, Anthony has saved:
\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much money Roy has saved. Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we calculate:
\[ 0.40 \times 30 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding this amount to Anthony's savings gives Roy's total savings:
\[ 30 + 12 = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 42 \]"
"To determine how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to work through the relationships given step by step.

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei. Therefore, Saskay can lift a mountain \(12 \times 1 = 12\) inches.
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay. Therefore, Kagiyami can lift a mountain \(4 \times 12 = 48\) inches.
4. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami. Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain \(10 \times 48 = 480\) inches.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert 480 inches to feet:
\[ 480 \text{ inches} \div 12 = 40 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 40 \]"
"Mason travels at a rate of 8 miles per hour for 4 hours, so the distance he covers in the first part of his journey is:
\[ 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles} \]

Then, he travels for another 6 hours at the same rate, so the distance he covers in the second part of his journey is:
\[ 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \]

Adding both distances together gives the total distance traveled:
\[ 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the total number of miles Mason has traveled is:
\[ 80 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the number of animals, their speed, and the time it takes for them to complete the journey.

First, let's establish the relationship for the kangaroos:
- Let the speed of one kangaroo be \( v \).
- The total time taken by 3 kangaroos to travel across the highway is 18 hours.

Since the speed of each kangaroo is \( v \), the distance \( D \) across the highway can be calculated using the formula:
\[ D = \text{speed} \times \text{time} \]
\[ D = v \times 18 \]

Now, we need to find out how long it will take for 4 turtles to travel the same distance \( D \). Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of each turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).

Using the formula for distance again:
\[ D = \text{speed of turtle} \times \text{time for 4 turtles} \]
\[ D = \frac{v}{2} \times 4 \times \text{time for 4 turtles} \]

Since the distance \( D \) is the same for both the kangaroos and the turtles, we can set the two expressions for \( D \) equal to each other:
\[ v \times 18 = \frac{v}{2} \times 4 \times \text{time for 4 turtles} \]

We can cancel \( v \) from both sides of the equation:
\[ 18 = \frac{4}{2} \times \text{time for 4 turtles} \]
\[ 18 = 2 \times \text{time for 4 turtles} \]

Solving for the time for 4 turtles:
\[ \text{time for 4 turtles} = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ \text{time for 4 turtles} = 9 \]

Thus, it will take 4 turtles 9 hours to travel across the highway.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 9 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

2. **Determine how many dishes Jada made:**
   - Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory.
   - Since Rory made 40 dishes, Jada made \(2 \times 40 = 80\) dishes.

3. **Calculate the total number of dishes made by all three:**
   - Kora made 20 dishes.
   - Rory made 40 dishes.
   - Jada made 80 dishes.

"First, let's determine the final price of the laptop after the trade-in discount. The original price of the laptop is $600, and the trade-in discount reduces this price by $200. Therefore, the final price of the laptop is:

\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means she currently has:

\[ 400 - 50 = 350 \]

Erika has three sources of money:
1. Savings in her purse.
2. $150 from her part-time job.
3. $80 from her mom.

Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as \( x \). The total amount of money she has is the sum of her purse savings, the money from her part-time job, and the money from her mom:

\[ x + 150 + 80 = 350 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 230 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 350 - 230 = 120 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is:

\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of slices Adam gets from the large apples. Since each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces and Adam slices 3 large apples, the total number of slices from the large apples is:
\[ 3 \text{ apples} \times 5 \text{ slices/apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of slices Adam gets from the small apples. Since each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces and Adam slices 5 small apples, the total number of slices from the small apples is:
\[ 5 \text{ apples} \times 3 \text{ slices/apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's find the total number of slices Adam has after slicing all the apples:
\[ 15 \text{ slices from large apples} + 15 \text{ slices from small apples} = 30 \text{ slices} \]

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:
\[ 30 \text{ slices} - 15 \text{ slices} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's determine how much milk the farmer currently produces with his 3 cows. Since each cow provides 5 liters of milk a day, the total milk production from 3 cows is:

\[ 5 \text{ liters/cow/day} \times 3 \text{ cows} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. To find out how much more milk is needed, we subtract the current production from the desired production:

\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Now, we need to determine how many additional cows are required to produce the additional 10 liters of milk a day. Since each cow provides 5 liters of milk a day, we divide the additional milk needed by the milk production per cow:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow/day}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \]"

"To determine how many students are good at math, we need to consider the information given:

- There are 20 students in total.
- 5 students are good at math only.
- 8 students perform well in English only.
- The rest are good at both math and English.

First, we calculate the number of students who are good at both math and English. Since the total number of students is 20, and we know the number of students who are good at math only and those who perform well in English only, we can find the number of students who are good at both by subtracting the sum of students who are good at math only and those who perform well in English only from the total number of students.

Let's denote:
- \( M \) as the number of students good at math.
- \( E \) as the number of students good at English.
- \( B \) as the number of students good at both math and English.

From the problem, we know:
- \( M = 5 \) (students good at math only)
- \( E = 8 \) (students good at English only)
- The rest are good at both math and English.

The number of students good at both math and English is:
\[ B = 20 - (5 + 8) = 20 - 13 = 7 \]

So, the total number of students good at math (which includes those who are good at both math and English) is:
\[ M = 5 + 7 = 12 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time required for one group to perform, including the time for setup, performance, and exit, and then add the intermission time. Here's the breakdown:

- Time for one group to get on stage: 2 minutes
- Time for one group to perform: 6 minutes
- Time for one group to exit the stage: 2 minutes
- Total time for one group: 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes
- Intermission time: 10 minutes

The total time for the concert is 2 hours, which is equivalent to 120 minutes. We subtract the intermission time from the total time to find out how much time is available for the groups to perform:

120 minutes (total time) - 10 minutes (intermission) = 110 minutes

Now, we divide the available time for performances by the time required for one group:

110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 11 groups

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is 11."
"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years with simple interest, we can use the formula for simple interest:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Given:
- Principal (\(P\)) = $300
- Rate (\(R\)) = \(\frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225\%\)
- Time (\(T\)) = 3 years

First, calculate the simple interest:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 225\% \times 3 \]

Since 225% is equivalent to 2.25 in decimal form:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 2.25 \times 3 \]

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 6.75 \]

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 2025 \]

Now, calculate the total amount after 3 years:

"First, let's determine the number of goats sold from each farm.

From Farm X, Mr. Smith sold 10 goats.

From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats as from Farm X, which means he sold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) goats.

Now, let's calculate the number of goats remaining in each farm.

In Farm X, the initial number of goats was 55, and 10 were sold, so the remaining goats are \(55 - 10 = 45\).

In Farm Y, the initial number of goats was 45, and 20 were sold, so the remaining goats are \(45 - 20 = 25\).

To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the remaining goats from Farm X and Farm Y:

\(45 + 25 = 70\).

So, the final numerical answer is 70."
"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
2. Divide the total amount spent on shoes by the total number of pairs bought.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the baskets of green and red food, taking into account the discount for the red food.

First, let's calculate the cost of the green food:
- Each basket of green food costs $25.
- You are buying 3 baskets of green food.
- Therefore, the total cost for the green food is \( 3 \times 25 = 75 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the red food:
- Each basket of red food costs $18.
- You are buying 3 baskets of red food.
- However, you get a $2 discount for each basket of red food.
- Therefore, the total discount for the red food is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) dollars.
- The total cost for the red food after applying the discount is \( 3 \times 18 - 6 = 54 - 6 = 48 \) dollars.

Finally, we add the total cost of the green food and the total cost of the red food to find the overall total cost:
- Total cost = Cost of green food + Cost of red food
- Total cost = 75 + 48 = 123

Thus, the total amount you will have to pay is \(\boxed{123}\)."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down year by year.

1. In the first year, the town builds 12 homes.
2. In the second year, they build three times the number of homes built in the first year. So, they build \(3 \times 12 = 36\) homes.
3. In the third year, they double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total number of homes built in the first two years is \(12 + 36 = 48\). Therefore, in the third year, they build \(2 \times 48 = 96\) homes.

Now, to find the total number of homes built over the three years, we add the number of homes built each year:

"Let's denote the ages as follows:
- Let \( S \) be my sister's age.
- Let \( B \) be my brother's age.
- Let \( M \) be my mom's age.
- Let \( Y \) be my age.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. I am three years younger than my brother: \( Y = B - 3 \).
2. I am two years older than my sister: \( Y = S + 2 \).
3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age: \( M = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all our ages is 87: \( Y + B + S + M = 87 \).

First, we can express \( S \) and \( M \) in terms of \( Y \) and \( B \):
- From \( Y = S + 2 \), we get \( S = Y - 2 \).
- From \( M = 3B - 1 \), we substitute \( B = Y + 3 \) (since \( Y = B - 3 \)) to get \( M = 3(Y + 3) - 1 = 3Y + 9 - 1 = 3Y + 8 \).

Now we substitute \( S \) and \( M \) into the sum of the ages equation:
\[ Y + B + S + M = 87 \]
\[ Y + B + (Y - 2) + (3Y + 8) = 87 \]
\[ Y + B + Y - 2 + 3Y + 8 = 87 \]
\[ 5Y + B + 6 = 87 \]
\[ 5Y + B = 81 \]

Since \( B = Y + 3 \), we substitute \( B \) in the equation:
\[ 5Y + (Y + 3) = 81 \]
\[ 6Y + 3 = 81 \]
\[ 6Y = 78 \]
\[ Y = 13 \]

So, my age is \( \boxed{13} \)."
"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first calculate the total number of glue sticks required. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks needed is:

\[ 27 \times 2 = 54 \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of glue sticks are required to get at least 54 glue sticks. Since glue sticks come in packs of 8, we divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:

\[ 54 \div 8 = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks. To ensure he has enough, we calculate the total number of glue sticks in 7 packs:

\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 \]

Since 56 is more than the 54 glue sticks needed, Mr. Jackson will have 2 extra glue sticks. Thus, the number of packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of new infections each day and add them to the total number of infected people.

- **Day 0**: Initially, there are 10 infected people.
- **Day 1**: Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others, so the number of new infections is \(10 \times 6 = 60\). Therefore, the total number of infected people after Day 1 is \(10 + 60 = 70\).
- **Day 2**: Now there are 70 infected people, and each of them infects 6 others. So, the number of new infections is \(70 \times 6 = 420\). Therefore, the total number of infected people after Day 2 is \(70 + 420 = 490\).
- **Day 3**: Now there are 490 infected people, and each of them infects 6 others. So, the number of new infections is \(490 \times 6 = 2940\). Therefore, the total number of infected people after Day 3 is \(490 + 2940 = 3430\).

Thus, the number of people infected after three days is \(\boxed{3430}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Rafaela received as tips. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate the total as follows:

\[ \text{Total tips for Rafaela} = 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Julieta received as tips. Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To find out how much less, we calculate 10% of Rafaela's total tips:

\[ \text{10% of Rafaela's tips} = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]

So, Julieta received:

\[ \text{Total tips for Julieta} = 800 - 80 = 720 \]

Now, to find out how much money Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether, we add their individual totals:

\[ \text{Total tips for both} = 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1520} \]"

"First, let's determine the number of each type of car in the bumper car rink.

- The number of red cars is given as 12.
- The number of green cars is 2 fewer than the number of red cars, so:
  \[
  \text{Number of green cars} = 12 - 2 = 10
  \]
- The number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars, so:
  \[
  \text{Number of blue cars} = 3 \times 10 = 30
  \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of red, green, and blue cars:
\[
\text{Total number of red, green, and blue cars} = 12 + 10 + 30 = 52
\]

The total number of cars in the rink is 75. To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:
\[
\text{Number of yellow cars} = 75 - 52 = 23
\]

Thus, the number of yellow cars is:
\[
\boxed{23}

"Let's denote the number of books Anne has as \( A \). According to the problem, Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has \( A + 25 \) books. Additionally, Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Fawn has \( A + 12 \) books.

The total number of books that Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have together is 85. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ (A + 25) + A + (A + 12) = 85 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 3A + 37 = 85 \]

Next, we solve for \( A \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. Subtract 37 from both sides:
\[ 3A = 48 \]

Then, divide both sides by 3:
\[ A = 16 \]

So, Anne has 16 books. Since Fawn has 12 more books than Anne, we calculate the number of books Fawn has as follows:
\[ A + 12 = 16 + 12 = 28 \]

Therefore, the number of books Fawn has is \(\boxed{28}\)."
"First, we need to determine the weight of the bag of sweet potatoes. Since the bag of sweet potatoes weighs 2 times as much as the bag of potatoes, and the bag of potatoes weighs 5 pounds, we can calculate the weight of the sweet potatoes as follows:

\[ \text{Weight of sweet potatoes} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find the weight of the bag of carrots. The problem states that the bag of carrots weighs 3 pounds fewer than the bag of sweet potatoes. Therefore, we can calculate the weight of the carrots as follows:

\[ \text{Weight of carrots} = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the number of pounds of carrots Daisy bought is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of jello cups Greg needs to make. Since there are 30 kids and each kid should have 4 jello cups, the total number of jello cups required is:
\[ 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ jello cups per kid} = 120 \text{ jello cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how many boxes of jello are required. Since one box makes 10 small jello cups, the number of boxes needed is:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ jello cups}}{10 \text{ jello cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Each box of jello costs $1.25, so the total cost for 12 boxes is:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \times 1.25 \text{ dollars per box} = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to calculate how much Madeline and Keenan each pay per month, and then find out how much Keenan pays per week.

1. Calculate Madeline's monthly payment:
   Madeline pays 60% of the $400 monthly cost.
   \[
   \text{Madeline's monthly payment} = 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Calculate Keenan's monthly payment:
   Since the total monthly cost is $400 and Madeline pays $240, Keenan pays the remaining amount.
   \[
   \text{Keenan's monthly payment} = 400 - 240 = 160 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Calculate Keenan's weekly payment:
   There are approximately 4 weeks in a month, so we divide Keenan's monthly payment by 4 to find his weekly payment.

"To determine how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Use the total revenue to find the cost of the chickens.

First, we calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell. He plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his 300 chickens:
\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \text{ chickens}
\]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling these 180 chickens at $50 per chicken:
\[
180 \times 50 = 9000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, so the total cost of the chickens is the total revenue minus the profit:
\[
9000 - 2000 = 7000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the amount of money Isaias bought the chickens for is:
\[

"First, let's determine how many glasses of lemonade Micah sold. We know that Julie, Micah, and Mitchell together sold 32 glasses of lemonade, and Julie sold 14 glasses. Since the boys (Micah and Mitchell) sold an equal number of glasses, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Glasses sold by Julie} + \text{Glasses sold by Micah} + \text{Glasses sold by Mitchell} = 32 \]

Given that Julie sold 14 glasses and Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, let's denote the number of glasses sold by each of the boys as \( x \). Therefore, we can write:

\[ 14 + x + x = 32 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 14 + 2x = 32 \]

Subtract 14 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 9 \]

So, Micah sold 9 glasses of lemonade. Now, we need to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah:

\[ \text{Glasses sold by Julie} - \text{Glasses sold by Micah} = 14 - 9 = 5 \]

Thus, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah. The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the rope Sarah has. The rope is 20 meters long and costs $2 per meter. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times 2 \text{ dollars/meter} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Sarah plans to use the profit from selling the rope to buy a new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter. To find out how many meters of the new rope she can buy, we need to determine how many meters of the original rope she can sell. Since the original rope costs $2 per meter, the number of meters she can sell is:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ dollars}}{2 \text{ dollars/meter}} = 20 \text{ meters} \]

With 20 meters of the original rope, she can buy 20 meters of the new rope. The cost of the new rope is:
\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars/meter} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Sarah spent $40 on the original rope and she uses the profit to buy the new rope, she will have:
\[ 40 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money Sarah will have left over after she buys the new rope is:

   \]

2. **Cost of Chicken:**
   Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, and each packet costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   \[
   \text{Cost per packet of chicken} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}

"To find out how fast a whirligig spins, we first need to determine the speed of the thingamabob. We know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, we can calculate the speed of the thingamabob as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{\text{Speed of whatchamacallit}}{11} = \frac{121 \text{ meters/second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters/second} \]

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can determine the speed of the whirligig. We know that a whirligig spins five times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of the whirligig is:

\[ \text{Speed of whirligig} = 5 \times \text{Speed of thingamabob} = 5 \times 11 \text{ meters/second} = 55 \text{ meters/second} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 55 \]"
"To determine how much Ellen pays for one carrot every day, we first need to calculate the total cost of the salad and yogurt she consumes each day.

The salad costs $6.
The yogurt costs half the price of the salad, which is $6 / 2 = $3.

So, the total cost for the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.

Ellen pays a total of $11 for her goods each day. Therefore, the cost for the two carrots she eats every day is $11 - $9 = $2.

Since she eats two carrots every day, the cost for one carrot is $2 / 2 = $1.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate Mark's new hourly wage after the raise:
- Original hourly wage: $10
- Raise: $2
- New hourly wage: $10 + $2 = $12

Next, let's calculate the number of hours Mark works in a week:
- Hours per day: 8
- Days per week: 5
- Total hours per week: 8 * 5 = 40

Now, let's calculate Mark's weekly earnings with his new hourly wage:
- New hourly wage: $12
- Total hours per week: 40
- Weekly earnings: $12 * 40 = $480

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{480}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Tasha earned from mowing lawns and then subtract that amount from her total earnings to find out how much she made from lemonade sales.

First, let's establish the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn. Since Joe paid her $6 and he paid her thrice as much as she mowed his lawn, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 3x = 6 \]
Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{6}{3} = 2 \]
So, Tasha mowed Joe's lawn 2 times.

Next, we need to determine how many times she mowed Alba's lawn. According to the problem, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she mowed Joe's lawn. Since she mowed Joe's lawn 2 times, she mowed Alba's lawn:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]
So, Tasha mowed Alba's lawn 10 times.

Now, we can calculate her earnings from mowing lawns. We know she mowed Joe's lawn 2 times and Alba's lawn 10 times. Assuming she mowed Kamala's lawn the same number of times as Joe's lawn (since the problem doesn't specify otherwise), she mowed Kamala's lawn 2 times as well. Therefore, the total number of times she mowed lawns is:
\[ 2 \text{ (Joe's lawn)} + 2 \text{ (Kamala's lawn)} + 10 \text{ (Alba's lawn)} = 14 \]
Since she earns $6 for each lawn mowed, her total earnings from mowing lawns are:
\[ 14 \times 6 = 84 \]
However, the problem states that she made $80 in total last month. This discrepancy suggests that the problem might have a different interpretation or a different set of conditions, but based on the given information and the logical steps, her earnings from mowing lawns are $84. Since her total earnings are $80, it implies there might be a misunderstanding in the problem statement or an additional source of income not mentioned. But based on the given data, we can conclude her earnings from mowing lawns are $84.

Therefore, her earnings from lemonade sales are:
\[ 80 - 84 = -4 \]
But since earnings cannot be negative, we need to re-evaluate the problem statement. Given the problem constraints and the logical steps, the correct interpretation should be that her earnings from mowing lawns are $84, and her earnings from lemonade sales are:

"First, let's determine Carl's weight. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, we can calculate Carl's weight as follows:
\[ \text{Carl's weight} = \text{Martin's weight} + 16 \]
\[ \text{Carl's weight} = 55 \, \text{kg} + 16 \, \text{kg} = 71 \, \text{kg} \]

Next, we find Christian's weight, which is 8 kg more than Carl's weight:
\[ \text{Christian's weight} = \text{Carl's weight} + 8 \]
\[ \text{Christian's weight} = 71 \, \text{kg} + 8 \, \text{kg} = 79 \, \text{kg} \]

Finally, we determine Harry's weight, which is 5 kg less than Christian's weight:
\[ \text{Harry's weight} = \text{Christian's weight} - 5 \]
\[ \text{Harry's weight} = 79 \, \text{kg} - 5 \, \text{kg} = 74 \, \text{kg} \]

The weight of Harry is 74 kg."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours John rents his car out in a month. He rents his car 10 times a month, and each rental is for 3 hours. Therefore, the total number of hours rented in a month is:

\[ 10 \text{ rentals/month} \times 3 \text{ hours/rental} = 30 \text{ hours/month} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money John earns from renting his car in a month. He gets paid $25 per hour, so the total earnings are:

\[ 30 \text{ hours/month} \times 25 \text{ dollars/hour} = 750 \text{ dollars/month} \]

Now, we need to determine John's profit. His profit is the total earnings minus his car payment. His car payment is $500 per month, so his profit is:

\[ 750 \text{ dollars/month} - 500 \text{ dollars/month} = 250 \text{ dollars/month} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To find the total distance Dijana and Anis rowed on that Sunday, we first need to determine how far Anis rowed.

Dijana rowed 50 miles.

Anis rowed \(\frac{1}{5}\) times more miles than Dijana. This means Anis rowed \(50 + \frac{1}{5} \times 50\) miles.

First, calculate \(\frac{1}{5} \times 50\):
\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10
\]

So, Anis rowed:
\[
50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles}
\]

Now, to find the total distance both rowed, we add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis:
\[
50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles}

"First, let's determine how many pages each person read over the two days.

Yesterday:
- Denise read 10 pages.
- Daniel read 13 pages.

Today:
- Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.
- Daniel was not able to read any pages today, so he read 0 pages today.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages each person read over the two days:
- Denise's total: \(10 + 18 = 28\) pages.
- Daniel's total: \(13 + 0 = 13\) pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total number of pages Daniel read from the total number of pages Denise read:

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup, we first need to understand the capacity of the pot in terms of adult and child bowls.

The pot can fill:
- 4 adult's bowls
- 8 child's bowls

Since Calvin is an adult, he will have one bowl of soup. His wife is also an adult, so she will have one bowl of soup as well. This accounts for 2 adult bowls. The remaining bowls will be for the two children.

The pot can fill 8 child's bowls, and we have already used 2 adult bowls (1 for Calvin and 1 for his wife). Therefore, the remaining number of bowls is:
\[ 8 - 2 = 6 \text{ child's bowls} \]

Since there are 2 children, we need to determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup. We divide the remaining bowls by the number of children:
\[ \frac{6 \text{ child's bowls}}{2 \text{ children}} = 3 \text{ times} \]

Thus, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup 3 times.

"To determine the amount of material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we first need to calculate the material required for each type of mask.

For small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \) yards.
- For 20 small masks, the material needed is \( 20 \times 0.5 = 10 \) yards.

For large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25}{3} = 0.75 \) yards.
- For 8 large masks, the material needed is \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \) yards.

Adding the material needed for both types of masks:
- Total material needed = material for small masks + material for large masks
- Total material needed = 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards.

Deepa has spent $216 in total for these 27 tickets. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets:

\[ \text{Average price per ticket} = \frac{216}{27} \]

Performing the division:

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information provided.

Let \( D \) be Duncan's age eight years ago and \( A \) be Adam's age four years ago.

From the problem, we know:
1. Duncan's current age is 60.
2. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( 60 - 8 = 52 \).
3. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was two times Adam's age four years ago.

So, we can write the equation:
\[ D = 2A \]
\[ 52 = 2A \]

From this, we can solve for \( A \):
\[ A = \frac{52}{2} = 26 \]

This means Adam's age four years ago was 26. Therefore, Adam's current age is:
\[ 26 + 4 = 30 \]

We need to find out how old Adam will be in 8 years:
\[ 30 + 8 = 38 \]

So, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many packages Colby completes per hour. According to the problem, he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. So, we calculate:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

This means Colby completes 40 packages per hour. 

Next, we need to find out how many packages he completes in an eight-hour workday. Since he completes 40 packages per hour, in an eight-hour workday he completes:

\[ 40 \times 8 = 320 \]

Colby gets paid $0.20 for each package he completes. Therefore, his total earnings for the day are:

\[ 320 \times 0.20 = 64 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 64 \]"
"First, let's determine the time John spends on an extreme sudoku puzzle. A normal sudoku puzzle takes him 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long:

\[ 45 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many half-hour intervals are in 180 minutes. Since there are 30 minutes in a half-hour:

\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/half-hour}} = 6 \text{ half-hours} \]

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half-hour, he will drink one bottle of water for each half-hour interval. Therefore, he will drink:

\[ 6 \text{ bottles of water} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"Let's denote the number of red balloons as \( R \) and the number of yellow balloons as \( Y \). According to the problem, \( R = 20 \).

Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon, so the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is \( 2R \). Given that \( R = 20 \), the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

The total number of pieces of bologna thrown at all balloons is 58. Therefore, the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons is:
\[ 58 - 40 = 18 \]

Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, the number of yellow balloons \( Y \) can be found by dividing the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons by 3:
\[ Y = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is \( 6 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total number of miles Jon drives in a month. Since he drives 100 miles a day for a 30-day month, the total miles driven in a month is:

\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how many tune-ups Jon will need. Since his car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by the interval at which a tune-up is needed:

\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"To find the total number of hours Bruce works over the three days, we can break down the problem day by day.

On Tuesday, Bruce works for 5 hours.

On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of hours he works on Wednesday is:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ hours} \]

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday. Therefore, the number of hours he works on Thursday is:
\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Now, to find the total number of hours Bruce works over the three days, we add the hours from each day:
\[ 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total number of hours Bruce works in all these three days is:
\[ 23 \]"
"To determine how much Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount spent and then divide it by 2.

First, let's calculate the cost of the cake:
\[ \text{Cost of the cake} = \$11 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the balloons. They bought 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons. The balloons cost $0.5 for 2 balloons:
\[ \text{Cost per 2 balloons} = \$0.5 \]
\[ \text{Number of sets of 2 balloons} = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]
\[ \text{Cost of the balloons} = 6 \times \$0.5 = \$3 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the ice cream. They bought 2 tubs of ice cream, each costing $7:
\[ \text{Cost of 2 tubs of ice cream} = 2 \times \$7 = \$14 \]

Now, let's find the total amount spent:
\[ \text{Total amount spent} = \text{Cost of the cake} + \text{Cost of the balloons} + \text{Cost of the ice cream} \]
\[ \text{Total amount spent} = \$11 + \$3 + \$14 = \$28 \]

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to spend this total amount, the amount each received is half of the total amount spent:
\[ \text{Amount each received} = \frac{\$28}{2} = \$14 \]

Thus, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"

"First, let's calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class. Since there are 30 students and each student sold an average of 10 lollipops, the total number of lollipops sold is:

\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops. Each lollypop was sold for $0.8, so the total revenue is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollypop} = \$240 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops. Each lollypop was bought for $0.5, so the total cost is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollypop} = \$150 \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ \$240 - \$150 = \$90 \]

Therefore, the class was able to raise \(\boxed{90}\) dollars from the profit of selling lollipops."
"To determine the total number of Larry's pets, we will calculate the number of each type of pet step by step.

1. **Number of Cats:**
   Larry has 3 cats.

2. **Number of Dogs:**
   Larry has 3 times as many dogs as cats. Therefore, the number of dogs is:
   \[
   3 \times 3 = 9
   \]

3. **Number of Rabbits:**
   Larry has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. Therefore, the number of rabbits is:
   \[
   9 - 2 = 7
   \]

4. **Number of Fish:**
   Larry has three times the number of fish as rabbits. Therefore, the number of fish is:
   \[
   3 \times 7 = 21
   \]

5. **Number of Gerbils:**
   Larry has a collection of gerbils that is 1/3 the number of fish he has. Therefore, the number of gerbils is:

   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]

Now, we sum up all the pets:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

The total number of pets is:
\[
3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cups of chamomile and mint tea Lana brews in each row, and then find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row.

First, let's determine the total number of cups of chamomile and mint tea. Since Lana has 27 cups in total and she uses 15 of them for cinnamon tea, the remaining cups are for chamomile and mint tea:
\[ 27 - 15 = 12 \]
These 12 cups are divided equally between chamomile and mint tea. Therefore, the number of cups of chamomile tea and mint tea is:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]
So, there are 6 cups of chamomile tea and 6 cups of mint tea.

Next, we need to determine how many cups of chamomile and mint tea are in each row. Since the 6 cups of chamomile tea and 6 cups of mint tea are divided equally into 3 rows, the number of cups of chamomile tea and mint tea in each row is:
\[ \frac{6}{3} = 2 \]
Thus, there are 2 cups of mint tea in each row.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which the sloth picks berries and then use that rate to find out how many berries he can pick up in the given time.

First, let's break down the information:
- The sloth takes 4 hours to make a trip down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up.
- The sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

Since the sloth takes 4 hours to pick up berries, we can calculate the number of berries he picks up in 4 hours. Let's denote the number of berries he picks up in 4 hours as \( B \).

Given that he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we can set up the following proportion:
\[ \frac{B}{4 \text{ hours}} = \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{8 \text{ hours}} \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{8 \text{ hours}} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ berries/hour} \]

So, the sloth picks up 3 berries per hour. To find out how many berries he picks up in 4 hours:
\[ 3 \text{ berries/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ berries} \]

However, the sloth needs to collect 24 berries in 8 hours. Since he picks up 3 berries per hour, in 8 hours he can pick up:
\[ 3 \text{ berries/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 24 \text{ berries} \]

Therefore, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip down to the ground, given he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, we need to determine the amount of water in the tank. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons of water, the tank will have:

\[ \text{Tank capacity} = \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much water will be left in the tank after 6 days, given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. The total amount of water removed from the tank over 6 days is:

\[ \text{Total water removed} = 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[ \text{Remaining water} = 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 2000 \]"
"To determine how many more movies Colby can see, we need to calculate his remaining budget after accounting for the items he has already purchased.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items he has already bought:
- 2 tubs of popcorn: \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars
- 4 boxes of candy: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars

Total cost of these items: \(16 + 8 = 24\) dollars

Colby starts with $150. After spending $24, his remaining budget is:
\[ 150 - 24 = 126 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money he can spend on tickets. Since it is a Friday, the ticket price is $10. He wants to buy a popcorn and a box of candy, which cost $8 and $2 respectively. So, the cost for these items is:
\[ 10 + 8 + 2 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Since he has $126 left and the tickets cost $20, the remaining budget for tickets is:
\[ 126 - 20 = 106 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many movies he can see with the remaining $106. Each movie ticket costs $10, so the number of movies he can see is:
\[ \left\lfloor \frac{106}{10} \right\rfloor = 10 \text{ movies} \]

Colby has already seen 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday and 8 movies on other days, which totals:
\[ 5 + 8 = 13 \text{ movies} \]

Since he has 106 dollars left and each movie ticket costs $10, he can see 10 more movies. Therefore, the total number of movies he can see is:
\[ 13 + 10 = 23 \text{ movies} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{23} \]"
"First, we need to determine the number of calories in a mini cinnamon roll and a mini blueberry muffin. Since a mini pastry has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal version, we can calculate the calories for each mini pastry as follows:

- For a mini cinnamon roll: \( \frac{600}{3} = 200 \) calories.
- For a mini blueberry muffin: \( \frac{450}{3} = 150 \) calories.

Next, we calculate the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins:

- Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls: \( 200 \text{ mini cinnamon rolls} \times 200 \text{ calories per mini cinnamon roll} = 40000 \text{ calories} \).
- Total calories from mini blueberry muffins: \( 300 \text{ mini blueberry muffins} \times 150 \text{ calories per mini blueberry muffin} = 45000 \text{ calories} \).

Finally, we add the total calories from both types of pastries to get the final answer:

- Total calories: \( 40000 \text{ calories} + 45000 \text{ calories} = 85000 \text{ calories} \).

The final numerical answer is 85000."
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the five days and then divide that total by the number of days.

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday. So, for each of these days, she removed \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days:
\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

First, add the Junebugs removed on Monday and Tuesday:
\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]

Next, add the Junebugs removed on Wednesday:
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]

Then, add the Junebugs removed on Thursday:
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]

Finally, add the Junebugs removed on Friday:
\[
243 + 57 = 300
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days is 300.

To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days (5):
\[
\frac{300}{5} = 60
\]

Thus, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"First, we calculate the distance traveled by the bus. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For the bus:
\[ \text{Speed} = 60 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, the distance traveled by the bus is:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \times 5 = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance traveled by the car:
\[ \text{Speed} = 30 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

So, the distance traveled by the car is:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 30 \times 8 = 240 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 300 - 240 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 60 \]"
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to add up all the toys Sophie already has and then subtract that total from the overall number of toys she has for her nephew.

The number of building blocks is 31.
The number of stuffed animals is 8.
The number of stacking rings is 9.

Adding these together gives us:
\[ 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 \]

Sophie has a total of 62 toys for her nephew. To find out how many bouncy balls are in the tube, we subtract the number of other toys from the total number of toys:
\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

Therefore, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is 14."
"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old:
   \[
   P + Pa + J = 100
   \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   Pa = J + 10
   \]

3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = Pa + J
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[
Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the age of Peter is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes of stuff available for the yard sale.

Each of the 10 people donates 5 boxes, so the total donation is:
\[ 10 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ boxes/person} = 50 \text{ boxes} \]

They also have 10 boxes already owned by the charity group. Therefore, the total number of boxes available is:
\[ 50 \text{ boxes (donated)} + 10 \text{ boxes (owned)} = 60 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many tables are required to fit all the boxes. Each table can hold 2 boxes of stuff. So, the number of tables needed is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ boxes}}{2 \text{ boxes/table}} = 30 \text{ tables} \]

They already own 15 tables. To find out how many new tables they need, we subtract the number of tables they already have from the total number of tables required:

"First, we calculate the total distance Zoey spits her seeds. Zoey has 40 seeds and spits each one 10 feet. Therefore, the total distance Zoey spits is:
\[ 40 \text{ seeds} \times 10 \text{ feet/seed} = 400 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the total distance Sydney spits her seeds. Sydney has 35 seeds and spits each one 12 feet. Therefore, the total distance Sydney spits is:
\[ 35 \text{ seeds} \times 12 \text{ feet/seed} = 420 \text{ feet} \]

To find the average total distance spat, we add the total distances spat by Zoey and Sydney and then divide by 2:
\[ \text{Average total distance} = \frac{400 \text{ feet} + 420 \text{ feet}}{2} = \frac{820 \text{ feet}}{2} = 410 \text{ feet} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the daily, monthly, and total earnings for each machine.

First, let's calculate the daily earnings for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1440 widgets/day
- WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1080 widgets/day

Next, let's calculate the monthly earnings for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: 1440 widgets/day * 30 days/month = 43200 widgets/month
- WidgetMaster 9000: 1080 widgets/day * 30 days/month = 32400 widgets/month

Now, let's calculate the total earnings from selling each machine's output:
- Widgeteer 3000: 43200 widgets/month * $6/widget = $259,200/month
- WidgetMaster 9000: 32400 widgets/month * $6/widget = $194,400/month

Finally, let's find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000:
- Difference: $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

The final numerical answer is $64,800."
"To determine how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the total cost of his stay under both options and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost if Cameron chooses the 24-hour option:
- The initial 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos.
- The additional 12 hours (24-hour option) cost 1600 pesos.
- Therefore, the total cost for the 24-hour option is 1000 + 1600 = 2600 pesos.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Cameron chooses the option of adding 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark:
- The initial 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos.
- Cameron stays from 5 pm to 10 am the next morning, which is 17 hours in total.
- The additional hours beyond the initial 12 hours are 17 - 12 = 5 hours.
- The cost for the additional 5 hours is 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.
- Therefore, the total cost for the 17-hour option is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Now, we find the savings by subtracting the total cost of the 17-hour option from the total cost of the 24-hour option:
- Savings = 2600 - 1350 = 1250 pesos.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Therefore, the amount of hay each sheep needs is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Hay per sheep} = 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats. There are 15 goats, and each goat needs 5 pounds of hay:

\[ \text{Total hay for goats} = 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep. There are 12 sheep, and each sheep needs 7 pounds of hay:

\[ \text{Total hay for sheep} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the total amount of hay Nate needs:

\[ \text{Total hay needed} = 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate John's total earnings for the week:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Hourly wage} \times \text{Hours worked} = 50 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the cost of gas from his total earnings:
\[ \text{Remaining after gas} = \text{Total earnings} - \text{Cost of gas} = 300 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 250 \, \text{dollars} \]

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so we subtract that from his remaining money:
\[ \text{Remaining after deposit} = \text{Remaining after gas} - \text{Deposit} = 250 \, \text{dollars} - 100 \, \text{dollars} = 150 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, we need to account for the cost of the pencils. Each pencil costs 10 dollars and he buys 5 pencils:
\[ \text{Cost of pencils} = 5 \times 10 \, \text{dollars} = 50 \, \text{dollars} \]

Subtract the cost of the pencils from the remaining money:
\[ \text{Remaining after pencils} = \text{Remaining after deposit} - \text{Cost of pencils} = 150 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 100 \, \text{dollars} \]

Finally, we determine how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with the remaining money:
\[ \text{Number of pens} = \frac{\text{Remaining after pencils}}{\text{Cost of one pen}} = \frac{100 \, \text{dollars}}{25 \, \text{dollars/pen}} = 4 \, \text{pens} \]

The final numerical answer is:

Next, we need to determine the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled out. According to the problem, Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled out is:

\[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]

Now, to find the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds, we add the total number of letters spelled out by Craig and his brother:

\[ 300 + 350 = 650 \]

Thus, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is:

\[ \boxed{650} \]"
"To find the total number of children in the drill, we need to multiply the number of children in each row by the number of rows for each school and then multiply that by the number of schools.

First, calculate the number of children in one row:
\[ 8 \text{ children/row} \]

Next, calculate the number of children in one school:
\[ 8 \text{ children/row} \times 7 \text{ rows/school} = 56 \text{ children/school} \]

Finally, calculate the total number of children for all 5 schools:
\[ 56 \text{ children/school} \times 5 \text{ schools} = 280 \text{ children} \]

So, the total number of children in the drill is:
\[ 280 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can redeem with her coupons. The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. Therefore, the total number of bottles from the coupons is:

\[ 9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles/coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles of apple juice are given to the students. There are 29 pupils, and each student receives 2 bottles of apple juice. Therefore, the total number of bottles given to the students is:

\[ 29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles/student} = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher has to find out how many bottles the teacher has left for herself:

\[ 900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

Thus, the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself is:

\[
\boxed{842}

"To calculate the total charge for Patty's Plumbing, we need to consider the visit fee, the labor cost, and the cost of parts.

1. The visit fee is $40.
2. The labor cost is $35 per hour. Since the job took 2.25 hours, the labor cost is \(2.25 \times 35\).
3. The cost of parts is $60.

Let's calculate the labor cost first:
\[ 2.25 \times 35 = 78.75 \]

Now, we add the visit fee, the labor cost, and the cost of parts:
\[ 40 + 78.75 + 60 = 178.75 \]

Therefore, Patty charged:
\[ 178.75 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount. James gets 10 new CDs, and each CD costs $15. Therefore, the total cost is:

\[ 10 \times 15 = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we apply the 40% discount to the total cost. A 40% discount means he pays 60% of the original cost. So, the cost after the discount is:

\[ 150 \times 0.60 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

James decides he doesn't like 5 of the CDs and sells them for $40. This means he loses the $40 from selling the CDs, but he also loses the $15 per CD for the 5 CDs he doesn't like. The total loss from the 5 CDs is:

\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money James is out is the sum of the money he lost from the discounted price and the money he lost from selling the 5 CDs:

\[ 90 - 40 + 75 = 125 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 125 \]"
"To calculate the total earnings, we need to multiply the number of each type of root crop by its respective price and then sum up all the earnings.

For the yams:
6 yams * $1.5 per yam = $9.00

For the sweet potatoes:
10 sweet potatoes * $2 per sweet potato = $20.00

For the carrots:
4 carrots * $1.25 per carrot = $5.00

Now, we add up all the earnings:
$9.00 + $20.00 + $5.00 = $34.00

So, Jen will earn $34.00 if she sells everything."
"First, let's calculate the distance James swims. He swims 60% of the 20-mile lake, which is:
\[ 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes for James to swim 12 miles at a pace of 2 miles per hour:
\[ \text{Time for swimming} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

James then rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is:
\[ \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

After resting, James swims the remaining 8 miles (since 20 - 12 = 8) at half the speed, which is:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour} \]

The time it takes for James to swim the remaining 8 miles at 1 mile per hour is:
\[ \text{Time for remaining swimming} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Adding up all the times, the total time taken is:
\[ 6 \text{ hours (swimming)} + 3 \text{ hours (resting)} + 8 \text{ hours (remaining swimming)} = 17 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time it took James to get across the lake is:
\[ \boxed{17} \]"
"First, let's determine seven times the number of loaves of bread Sam had last Friday. Since Sam had seventy loaves, we calculate:

\[ 7 \times 70 = 490 \]

Next, we need to find out how many loaves of bread the bakery has, which is 40 less than seven times the number of loaves Sam had. We subtract 40 from 490:

\[ 490 - 40 = 450 \]

Therefore, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 450 \]"
"Jasmine starts with 15 stickers. She loses 7 stickers, so she has:
\[ 15 - 7 = 8 \]

Thus, the final number of stickers Jasmine has is:
\[ 13 \]"
"To calculate the total commission Cayley will earn, we need to calculate the commission for each newspaper separately and then sum them up.

For the New York Times:
- Commission rate: 10%
- Cost per copy: $5
- Number of copies: 6

The commission for the New York Times is calculated as:
\[ \text{Commission for NYT} = 6 \times 5 \times \frac{10}{100} = 6 \times 5 \times 0.10 = 30 \times 0.10 = 3 \]

For the Wall Street Journal:
- Commission rate: 8%
- Cost per copy: $15
- Number of copies: 10

The commission for the Wall Street Journal is calculated as:
\[ \text{Commission for WSJ} = 10 \times 15 \times \frac{8}{100} = 10 \times 15 \times 0.08 = 150 \times 0.08 = 12 \]

Now, we sum the commissions from both newspapers to get the total commission:
\[ \text{Total Commission} = \text{Commission for NYT} + \text{Commission for WSJ} = 3 + 12 = 15 \]

The total commission Cayley will earn is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To find Marcus's age, we start with the information that Deanna is 26 years old and Deanna is five years older than Marcus. Therefore, we can calculate Marcus's age as follows:

\[ \text{Marcus's age} = \text{Deanna's age} - 5 = 26 - 5 = 21 \]

Next, we know that Marcus is half of Leo's age. Therefore, we can find Leo's age by doubling Marcus's age:

\[ \text{Leo's age} = 2 \times \text{Marcus's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 42 \]"
"Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as \( A \), by Bahati as \( B \), and by Dinar as \( D \).

From the problem, we know:
1. \( B = A + 20 \)
2. \( B = D + 10 \)
3. The total points scored by the three is 45, so \( B + A + D = 45 \).

First, we can express \( B \) in terms of \( A \) and \( D \) using the first two equations:
\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]

Since both expressions are equal to \( B \), we can set them equal to each other:
\[ A + 20 = D + 10 \]
Solving for \( D \) in terms of \( A \):
\[ D = A + 10 \]

Now we substitute \( B \) and \( D \) in terms of \( A \) into the total points equation:
\[ (A + 20) + A + (A + 10) = 45 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]
Subtract 30 from both sides:
\[ 3A = 15 \]
Divide by 3:
\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored \( 5 \) points. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine the total number of pages in the book, we need to consider the thickness of the book and the number of pages per inch.

Given:
- The book is 1.5 inches thick.
- For every inch, there are 100 pages.

First, calculate the number of pages in 1 inch:
\[ \text{Pages per inch} = 100 \]

Next, calculate the number of pages in 1.5 inches:
\[ \text{Pages in 1.5 inches} = 1.5 \times 100 \]

Perform the multiplication:
\[ 1.5 \times 100 = 150 \]

Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is:
\[ \boxed{150} \]"
"To determine the total number of reports Vince stapled, we first need to calculate the total time he worked in minutes.

Vince started at 8:00 AM and worked until 11:00 PM. The time from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours. Converting this into minutes:
\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes, we divide 900 by 15:
\[ 900 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince staples 30 reports per interval, the total number of reports he stapled is:
\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 1800 \]"
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up early.

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Converting this to minutes, we get:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes} \]

On that particular day, Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m. instead of 6 a.m. Additionally, she sleepwalked from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is:
\[ 2:38 \text{ a.m.} - 2:15 \text{ a.m.} = 23 \text{ minutes} \]

The total time she was not sleeping on her bed that day is the time she woke up early plus the time she sleepwalked:
\[ 5 \text{ minutes} + 23 \text{ minutes} = 28 \text{ minutes} \]

Subtracting this from her total sleep time gives us the time she slept on her bed:
\[ 480 \text{ minutes} - 28 \text{ minutes} = 452 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the number of minutes Kim slept on her bed that day is:
\[ 452 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of measuring cups Jonathan has. Since he has two dozen measuring cups, we calculate:

\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ measuring cups} \]

Jonathan has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons he has is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Now, we add the number of measuring cups and the remaining number of measuring spoons to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining:

\[ 24 \text{ measuring cups} + 10 \text{ measuring spoons} = 34 \text{ utensils} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 34 \]"
"First, let's determine the initial number of occupied beds in the hospital. Given that the hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied, we can calculate the initial number of occupied beds as follows:

\[ \text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of patients admitted over 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, the total number of patients admitted over 2 weeks (14 days) is:

\[ \text{Total patients admitted} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

Now, we can find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks by adding the initial number of occupied beds to the total number of patients admitted:

\[ \text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Finally, to find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the total number of occupied beds from the total capacity of the hospital:

\[ \text{Unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 900 = 100 \]

The total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of emails Robyn sends to her family. We know that out of the sixteen emails, seven are work emails. Therefore, the number of emails that are not work emails is:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these nine emails are sent to her family. According to the problem, two-thirds of the remaining emails are to her family. So, the number of emails sent to her family is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

Now, we need to find out how many emails are left after sending emails to her family. This is:

\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

These three emails are sent to her boyfriend. According to the problem, one-third of these remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. So, the number of emails sent to her boyfriend is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

Therefore, the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day is:

"First, let's determine Shawna's age. We know that Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya. Therefore, Shawna's age is:

\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we need to find out how old Shawna's father is. We know that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. Therefore, Shawna's father's age is:

\[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate the number that is 20% less than the number reported by Courtney.

Courtney reported 48 people attended the concert. Kelly states that this number is 20% more than the actual number. Therefore, we need to find 20% of 48 and subtract it from 48 to get the actual number of attendees.

First, calculate 20% of 48:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 48 = \frac{20}{100} \times 48 = 0.2 \times 48 = 9.6 \]

Now, subtract this value from the reported number to find the actual number of attendees:
\[ 48 - 9.6 = 38.4 \]

Since the number of people must be a whole number, and typically such problems assume whole people, we round 38.4 to the nearest whole number, which is 38.

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is:
\[ 38 \]"
"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \). According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls. We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so we can set up the equation \( 2J = 2 \). Solving for \( J \), we get \( J = 1 \). Therefore, Jeffrey carried 1 ball, Jason carried \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) balls, and Jordan carried \( 4 \times 1 = 4 \) balls. The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey, which is \( 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 \) balls. Since the three boys picked up and carried all the balls in one trip, the total number of balls the coach brought to practice is 7.

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"To determine how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the number of holes at the end of the first day.
3. Calculate the number of holes at the end of the third day.
4. Find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
- Holes dug on the first day: 10
- Holes dug on the second day: 13
- Holes dug on the third day before filling: 8

Total holes dug by the end of the third day = 10 + 13 + 8 = 31

Next, we know that the island had four times as many holes by the end of the third day as it did at the end of the first day. Let's denote the number of holes at the end of the first day as \( H_1 \). According to the problem, \( 31 = 4 \times H_1 \).

Solving for \( H_1 \):
\[ H_1 = \frac{31}{4} = 7.75 \]

Since the number of holes must be a whole number, and the problem implies a whole number of holes, we can infer that the number of holes at the end of the first day is 7 (as the problem setup likely implies rounding down).

Now, we need to find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day. By the end of the third day, there were 31 holes. The problem states that the pirates filled in 2 holes on the third day, so the number of holes at the end of the third day before filling was:
\[ 31 - 2 = 29 \]

Since the number of holes at the end of the first day was 7, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[ 29 - 7 = 22 \]

Thus, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is:
\[ \boxed{22} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of corn chips based on the given conditions.

2. Collins received 15 more corn chips than the number Amora and Lainey received.

First, calculate the number of corn chips Collins received:
\[ \text{Collins' chips} = 70 + 15 = 85 \]

Next, calculate the total number of corn chips by summing the chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:
\[ \text{Total chips} = 70 + 70 + 85 \]

Now, perform the addition:
\[ 70 + 70 = 140 \]
\[ 140 + 85 = 225 \]

Therefore, the total number of corn chips is:
\[ \boxed{225} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the cost of the travel tickets. The problem states that the travel tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. The supplies cost $400 in total.

To find 50% of $400, we calculate:
\[ 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the additional cost for the travel tickets is $200. Adding this to the cost of the supplies gives us the total cost of the travel:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the travel is $600.

\[

"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( X = S + 5 \)
2. \( S = 4A - 13 \)
3. \( X + S + A = 339 \)

First, we substitute the expressions for \( X \) and \( S \) from the first two equations into the third equation.

Substituting \( X = S + 5 \) and \( S = 4A - 13 \) into \( X + S + A = 339 \):

\[ (4A - 13) + 5 + (4A - 13) + A = 339 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 4A - 13 + 5 + 4A - 13 + A = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Add 21 to both sides:

\[ 9A = 360 \]

Divide both sides by 9:

\[ A = 40 \]

Now, we can find \( S \) using \( S = 4A - 13 \):

\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{147} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the length of each episode**: Each episode is 20 minutes long.
2. **Determine the number of episodes**: There are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. Since each episode is 20 minutes long, the number of episodes is \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) episodes.
3. **Calculate the total time spent watching the show**: If John watches every episode, the total time spent is the number of episodes multiplied by the length of each episode. So, \( 10 \text{ episodes} \times 20 \text{ minutes/episode} = 200 \text{ minutes} \).

Therefore, the total time John will spend watching the show is 200 minutes.

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance flown in each segment of the journey and then sum these distances.

1. **First Segment:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Direction: Norttherly
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \)

3. **Third Segment:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \)

Now, we sum the distances of all segments to find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes:
\[ 300 \text{ miles} + 36 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 446 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:

"First, let's determine the total number of brownies Greta had initially.

1. Greta made a batch for herself: 1 dozen brownies.
   \[
   1 \text{ dozen} = 12 \text{ brownies}
   \]

2. At her office, she received 1/2 a dozen brownies.
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \text{ dozen} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ brownies}
   \]

3. At her friends' surprise party, she received 4 dozen brownies.
   \[
   4 \text{ dozen} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ brownies}
   \]

Next, we sum up all the brownies received:
\[
12 \text{ (initial batch)} + 6 \text{ (from office)} + 48 \text{ (from friends)} = 66 \text{ brownies}
   \]

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten:
\[
1 \frac{1}{2} \text{ dozen} = 1.5 \times 12 = 18 \text{ brownies}
   \]

Subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies received:
\[
66 \text{ (total brownies)} - 18 \text{ (eaten brownies)} = 48 \text{ brownies}
   \]

Thus, the number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is:
\[

"First, let's determine the ages of Nani's brother and sister.

Nani's age is 8 years.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so:
\[ \text{Brother's age} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ years} \]

Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani, which means she is 75% of Nani's age:
\[ \text{Sister's age} = 0.75 \times 8 = 6 \text{ years} \]

Now, let's calculate the total age of all three family members:
\[ \text{Total age} = \text{Nani's age} + \text{Brother's age} + \text{Sister's age} \]
\[ \text{Total age} = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 \text{ years} \]

"To find the total number of players in both teams combined, we first need to determine the number of players on Zeke's team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team as follows:

Number of players on Zeke's team = Number of players on Carlton's team + 7
Number of players on Zeke's team = 13 + 7
Number of players on Zeke's team = 20

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams combined, we add the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team:

Total number of players = Number of players on Zeke's team + Number of players on Carlton's team
Total number of players = 20 + 13
Total number of players = 33

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 33."
"To determine the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the total length of the fence he is building. The fence is a rectangular shape with a length of 15 feet and a width of 10 feet. The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[
P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
\]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[
P = 2 \times (15 + 10) = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ feet}
\]

Robert needs 2 wooden slats for every foot of fencing. Therefore, the total number of wooden slats required is:

\[
\text{Total slats} = 2 \times \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 50 = 100
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
100

"First, let's determine the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington initially had:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we calculate the number of boxes she gave to her mom and her sister:
\[ 2 \text{ boxes} + 2 \text{ boxes} = 4 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, we find out how many boxes she kept:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} - 4 \text{ boxes} = 8 \text{ boxes} \]

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges. To find out how many boxes this represents:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 \text{ boxes} = 3 \text{ boxes} \]

This means she kept 3 boxes, and thus sold the remaining boxes:
\[ 8 \text{ boxes} - 3 \text{ boxes} = 5 \text{ boxes} \]

Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she sold is:
\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 20 \text{ oranges/box} = 100 \text{ oranges} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 100 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the number of states in the USA. According to the latest data, the United States has 50 states.

Given that India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, we can calculate the number of states in India as follows:
- Half the number of states in the USA is \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \).
- India has 4 more than this, so the number of states in India is \( 25 + 4 = 29 \).

Now, to find the total number of states in both countries, we add the number of states in India and the number of states in the USA:
- Total number of states = Number of states in India + Number of states in the USA
- Total number of states = 29 + 50 = 79

The final numerical answer is 79."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Tyler wants to buy:
- Dictionary: $18
- Dinosaur book: $13
- Children's cookbook: $8

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Tyler has already saved $14. Therefore, the additional amount he needs to earn is:
Additional amount needed = Total cost - Amount saved
Additional amount needed = $39 - $14 = $25

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn the additional $25, we divide the additional amount needed by his hourly wage:
Hours needed = Additional amount needed / Hourly wage
Hours needed = $25 / $5 = 5 hours

So, Tyler has to work 5 hours to afford his books."
"First, let's determine how many cherries Richard has. We know that Robert has 30 cherries and that he has 10 more cherries than Richard. Therefore, we can calculate the number of cherries Richard has as follows:

\[ \text{Cherries Richard has} = \text{Cherries Robert has} - 10 = 30 - 10 = 20 \]

Next, we know the total number of cherries is 60. We can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting the number of cherries Richard and Robert have from the total:

\[ \text{Cherries Jerry has} = \text{Total cherries} - (\text{Cherries Richard has} + \text{Cherries Robert has}) = 60 - (20 + 30) = 60 - 50 = 10 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Cherries Robert has} - \text{Cherries Jerry has} = 30 - 10 = 20 \]

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"

   - Apple Pie: 10 - 4 = 6 boxes

2. **Sunday's Sales:**
   - Gingerbread: 10 + 5 = 15 boxes
   - Apple Pie: 15 boxes

3. **Total Sales:**
   - **Saturday:**
     - Gingerbread: 10 boxes * $6/box = $60
     - Apple Pie: 6 boxes * $15/box = $90
     - Total for Saturday: $60 + $90 = $150

   - **Sunday:**
     - Gingerbread: 15 boxes * $6/box = $90
     - Apple Pie: 15 boxes * $15/box = $225
     - Total for Sunday: $90 + $225 = $315

4. **Total Earnings for Two Days:**
   - Total earnings = Total for Saturday + Total for Sunday
   - Total earnings = $150 + $315 = $465

"To solve this problem, let's define the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother as \(D\) and \(B\) respectively.

Given:
- Emil is currently 19 years old.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.

First, let's determine how many years from now Emil will turn 24:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \text{ years} \]

When Emil turns 24, his dad's age will be:
\[ D + 5 \]

According to the problem, at that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad:
\[ 24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5) \]

Solving for \(D\):
\[ 24 = \frac{D + 5}{2} \]
\[ 48 = D + 5 \]
\[ D = 43 \]

So, Emil's dad is currently 43 years old.

Next, we know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother:
\[ 24 = 2B \]

Solving for \(B\):
\[ B = \frac{24}{2} \]
\[ B = 12 \]

So, Emil's brother is currently 12 years old.

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother:
\[ D + B = 43 + 12 = 55 \]

The sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is:

"First, let's determine the amount of crawfish Joe caught each day.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught over the three days:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ pounds (Friday)} + 6 \text{ pounds (Saturday)} = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how many servings of crawfish he has. Since 1 serving is 3 pounds, we divide the total amount of crawfish by the amount per serving:
\[ \frac{21 \text{ pounds}}{3 \text{ pounds per serving}} = 7 \text{ servings} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how many students are football players. Since 20% of the class are football players, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \text{ students} \]

This means there are \(30 - 6 = 24\) students who are not football players.

Next, we need to find out how many of these 24 students are either cheerleaders or part of the band. Since 25% of the remaining students are cheerleaders or part of the band, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 24 = 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \text{ students} \]

Therefore, 6 students are leaving early to travel to the away game. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches to match the units of the flower width. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the flower bed is:
\[ 111 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 1332 \text{ inches} \]

Each flower is 12 inches wide, and Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant. Converting 1.5 feet to inches:
\[ 1.5 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 18 \text{ inches} \]

So, the total space required for one plant including the space between it and the next plant is:
\[ 12 \text{ inches (flower)} + 18 \text{ inches (space)} = 30 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to determine how many plants Pat can fit in her 1332-inch flower bed:
\[ \frac{1332 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/plant}} = 44.4 \text{ plants} \]

Since Pat cannot have a fraction of a plant, she can fit 44 plants in her flower bed.

Pat already owns 17 plants, so the number of additional plants she needs to buy is:
\[ 44 - 17 = 27 \text{ plants} \]

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional plants is:
\[ 27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 162 \]"
"To determine how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we first need to find out how many pretzels his brother eats in a day. Since Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, we calculate:

"To determine the total cost Katherine will spend, we need to calculate the cost for one basket and then multiply by the number of baskets.

First, let's calculate the cost for one basket:
- Katherine wants to add 3 petunias to each basket, and each petunia costs $3.00.
  \[
  \text{Cost of petunias per basket} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- She also wants to add 2 sweet potato vines to each basket, and each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.
  \[
  \text{Cost of sweet potato vines per basket} = 2 \times 2.50 = 5 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Therefore, the total cost for one basket is:
  \[
  \text{Total cost per basket} = 9 + 5 = 14 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for all 5 baskets:
\[
\text{Total cost for 5 baskets} = 5 \times 14 = 70 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount Katherine will spend is:
\[
\boxed{70}

"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

For the sunflowers:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

For the carnations:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of soil they have is 30 pounds. So, the remaining soil for roses is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. Therefore, the number of roses they can plant is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine how much Jessica sets aside each month for fancy shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly paycheck.

\[ \text{Monthly savings for shoes} = 25\% \times 2000 = 0.25 \times 2000 = 500 \]

Next, we need to find out how much she saves in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year:

\[ \text{Annual savings for shoes} = 500 \times 12 = 6000 \]

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. To find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year, we divide her annual savings by the cost of one pair of shoes:

"First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, the time required to peel 90 shrimp is:

\[ \text{Time to peel} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to saute 30 shrimp. Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, the time required to saute 90 shrimp (which is three times 30 shrimp) is:

\[ \text{Time to saute} = 3 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Emily can either peel or saute shrimp simultaneously, the total time required to peel and saute 90 shrimp is the longer of the two times calculated. In this case, it is 30 minutes.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the final temperature relative to the starting temperature, we need to calculate the net change in temperature over the given time periods.

1. **Low setting for 3 hours:**
   - Temperature change per hour: -2 degrees
   - Total change: \(3 \text{ hours} \times -2 \text{ degrees/hour} = -6 \text{ degrees}\)

2. **High setting for 4 hours:**
   - Temperature change per hour: -3 degrees
   - Total change: \(4 \text{ hours} \times -3 \text{ degrees/hour} = -12 \text{ degrees}\)

3. **No air conditioner for 2 hours:**
   - Temperature change per hour: +2 degrees
   - Total change: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 2 \text{ degrees/hour} = +4 \text{ degrees}\)

Now, we sum up all the temperature changes:
\[
-6 \text{ degrees} + (-12 \text{ degrees}) + 4 \text{ degrees} = -14 \text{ degrees}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time:**
   - Bill's father saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill saw the comet for the second time when he was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old.

2. **Determine the time interval between the first and second sightings:**
   - The comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
   - Bill saw the comet for the second time at 90 years old.
   - The first sighting must have been 75 years before the second sighting (since the comet returns every 75 years).
   - Therefore, Bill saw the comet for the first time at \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to break down the information given and calculate each category of checks separately.

1. **Electric Bill**: Buford writes a check once per month for the electric bill. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes 12 electric bill checks per year.
2. **Gas Bill**: Buford writes a check once per month for the gas bill. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes 12 gas bill checks per year.
3. **Church**: Buford writes a check twice per month to the church. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes \(2 \times 12 = 24\) church checks per year.
4. **Pest and Lawn Service**: Buford writes a check quarterly (every 3 months) to the pest and lawn service. There are 4 quarters in a year, so he writes 4 pest and lawn service checks per year.

Now, we sum up all the checks:
- Electric bill checks: 12
- Gas bill checks: 12
- Church checks: 24
- Pest and lawn service checks: 4

Total number of checks per year = \(12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52\).

"Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as \( F \). According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4}F \). The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany, so the number of flights to France is \( \frac{1}{4}F \) and the number of flights to Germany is also \( \frac{1}{4}F \).

The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and this is half the number of flights the first plane makes in a day. Therefore, the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day is \( 2 \times 44 = 88 \). So, \( F = 88 \).

Now, we can calculate the number of flights to France by the first plane:
\[ \text{Flights to France} = \frac{1}{4}F = \frac{1}{4} \times 88 = 22. \]

Thus, the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"First, let's determine the duration of each wolf's howl.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so:
\[ \text{Chikote's howl duration} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Igneous howls for as long as Tobias and Chikote combined, so:
\[ \text{Igneous's howl duration} = 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, let's find the combined duration of all three wolves' howls in seconds:
\[ \text{Combined duration} = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 \text{ seconds} \]

To convert the combined duration from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):
\[ \text{Combined duration in minutes} = \frac{120}{60} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the age of Wilfred. Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \(A\), \(B\), \(H\), and \(W\) respectively. We know the following:

1. \(A = 3\)
2. \(B = 4\)
3. The total age of the children is 20, so \(A + B + H + W = 20\).
4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is \(\frac{20}{4} = 5\). Therefore, \(H = 2 \times 5 = 10\).

Now we can substitute the known values into the total age equation:
\[3 + 4 + 10 + W = 20\]
\[17 + W = 20\]
\[W = 20 - 17\]
\[W = 3\]

So, the age of Wilfred is \(\boxed{3}\)."

Total collected so far: $500 + $1500 = $2000

Next, we need to determine how much Walter's lawyer will contribute. The lawyer will donate three times as much as everyone else donates. To find out how much everyone else has donated, we need to add the $200 given by Walter's friend to the total collected so far:
- Total collected so far: $2000
- Amount given by friend: $200

Total amount donated by everyone else: $2000 + $200 = $2200

Now, we calculate the lawyer's contribution, which is three times the amount donated by everyone else:
- Amount donated by everyone else: $2200
- Lawyer's contribution: 3 * $2200 = $6600

Thus, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6600."

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the distribution of the watermelon slices among the family members. Let's denote the total volume of the watermelon as \( V \).

Given that there are 2 adults and 4 kids, and each adult's slice is twice as big as each kid's slice, we can represent the volume of each adult's slice as \( 2x \) and the volume of each kid's slice as \( x \).

The total volume of the watermelon is the sum of the volumes of all the slices:
\[ 2(2x) + 4(x) = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

Since the total volume of the watermelon is \( V \), we have:
\[ 8x = V \]

Each adult's slice is \( 2x \), so the total volume of the slices for the adults is:
\[ 2(2x) = 4x \]

To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we calculate:
\[ \frac{4x}{V} \times 100\% \]

Since \( 8x = V \), we can substitute \( V \) with \( 8x \):
\[ \frac{4x}{8x} \times 100\% = \frac{1}{2} \times 100\% = 50\% \]

Thus, each adult gets 50% of the watermelon. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Jordan needs 3 hours to complete all the steps. She wants the cake to be ready by 5:00 pm. To find the latest start time, we subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm:
\[ 5:00 \text{ pm} - 3 \text{ hours} = 2:00 \text{ pm} \]

Therefore, the latest time of day that Jordan can start making the cake is:
\[ 2:00 \text{ pm} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we first need to determine the total number of boxes sold by Lisa and Peter.

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. Together, they sold:
\[ 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 \text{ boxes} \]

They sold a total of 64 chocolate bars. To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes:
\[ \frac{64 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ boxes}} = 8 \text{ chocolate bars per box} \]

So, the number of chocolate bars in a box is:
\[ 8 \]"
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider the fixed cost of renting the studio and the variable cost based on the number of students and the number of sessions per week.

First, let's calculate the total cost per session:
- Fixed cost per session: $25
- Variable cost per student per session: $1.50
- Number of students: 10
- Total variable cost per session: $1.50 * 10 = $15
- Total cost per session: $25 + $15 = $40

Next, we need to determine the number of sessions in a month. Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, we need to know the number of weeks in a month. For simplicity, let's assume a month has 4 weeks.

- Number of sessions per week: 3
- Number of weeks in a month: 4
- Total number of sessions in a month: 3 * 4 = 12

Now, we can calculate the total earnings for the month:
- Total cost per session: $40
- Total number of sessions in a month: 12
- Total earnings in a month: $40 * 12 = $480

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"To find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we first need to determine how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes.

Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars. Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes is:
\[ \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]

Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars. Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes is:
\[ \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes:
\[ 16 - 8 = 8 \]

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of female porcupines in the park. Given that the total population of porcupines is 50 and the number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population, we can calculate the number of female porcupines as follows:

\[ \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the number of babies born each month is:

\[ \text{Number of babies born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120 \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[ \text{Total number of babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440 \]

The initial population of porcupines is 50. After a year, the total number of porcupines in the park will be the initial population plus the total number of babies born in a year:

\[ \text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1490 \]"
"To determine the cost to fill the swimming pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet.
2. Multiply the volume by 5.9 to convert it to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost based on the number of gallons and the cost per gallon.

First, let's calculate the volume of the pool. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:
\[ V = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions:
- Width = 14 feet
- Length = 25 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

Substituting these values into the formula:
\[ V = 14 \times 25 \times 4 \]

Now, let's perform the multiplication:
\[ V = 14 \times 25 = 350 \]
\[ V = 350 \times 4 = 1400 \]

So, the volume of the pool is 1400 cubic feet.

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. We know that 1 cubic foot is approximately 7.48 gallons. Therefore, the volume in gallons \( G \) is:
\[ G = V \times 7.48 \]

Substituting the volume in cubic feet:
\[ G = 1400 \times 7.48 \]

Now, let's perform the multiplication:
\[ G = 1400 \times 7.48 = 10472 \]

So, the pool needs 10472 gallons of water.

Finally, we calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost per gallon is $0.10. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:
\[ C = G \times 0.10 \]

Substituting the volume in gallons:
\[ C = 10472 \times 0.10 \]

Now, let's perform the multiplication:
\[ C = 10472 \times 0.10 = 1047.2 \]

Thus, the cost to fill the pool is $1047.20.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{1047.20} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of blue sticks. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, and there are 9 red sticks, we can calculate the number of blue sticks as follows:

\[ \text{Number of blue sticks} = \text{Number of red sticks} + 5 = 9 + 5 = 14 \]

Next, we need to find the number of yellow sticks. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. Therefore:

\[ \text{Number of yellow sticks} = \text{Number of blue sticks} - 3 = 14 - 3 = 11 \]

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together:

\[ \text{Total number of sticks} = \text{Number of red sticks} + \text{Number of blue sticks} + \text{Number of yellow sticks} = 9 + 14 + 11 = 34 \]

So, the total number of sticks they have is:

\[ 34 \]"
"First, we calculate the distance Matteo traveled. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Matteo:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 55 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance Shandy traveled:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} = 45 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the distance Matteo traveled from the distance Shandy traveled:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 230 \]"
"To find the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. **Total number of students**: 3000

2. **Students over 16 years old**: Half of the total students.
   \[
   \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
   \]

3. **Students under 16 years old**: The other half of the total students.
   \[
   \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
   \]

4. **Male students over 16 years old**: One-fourth of the students over 16 years old.
   \[
   \frac{1500}{4} = 375
   \]

5. **Female students over 16 years old**: The remaining three-fourths of the students over 16 years old.
   \[
   1500 - 375 = 1125
   \]

6. **Male students under 16 years old**: One-half of the students under 16 years old.
   \[
   \frac{1500}{2} = 750
   \]

7. **Female students under 16 years old**: The remaining half of the students under 16 years old.
   \[
   1500 - 750 = 750
   \]

8. **Total female students**: Sum of female students over 16 years old and under 16 years old.
   \[
   1125 + 750 = 1875
   \]

Thus, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is **1875**."
"First, let's determine how many laps each person can run:

- Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
- Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps.
- Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) laps.
- Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps.

Now, to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run:

\[10 - 5 = 5\]

So, Bethany can run 5 more laps than Quinn. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{5}
\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days and then subtract this from the tank's total capacity.

First, let's determine the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day:
- Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity on the first day.
- The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, so Wanda pumped \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons on the first day.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda, so she pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons on the first day.

Next, let's determine the amount of water pumped on the second day:
- Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day, so she pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons on the second day.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day, so she pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons on the second day.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank over the two days:
- Total water pumped by Wanda: \( 4500 + 3000 = 7500 \) gallons.
- Total water pumped by Ms. B: \( 3375 + 1125 = 4500 \) gallons.
- Total water pumped into the tank: \( 7500 + 4500 = 12000 \) gallons.

Finally, we subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity to find out how much water is remaining:
- Remaining water: \( 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \) gallons.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{6000}

"Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as \( C \).

First, we know that the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour for 5 hours. This means that after 5 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ C \times (1 - 0.09)^5 = C \times 0.91^5 \]

Calculating \( 0.91^5 \):
\[ 0.91^5 \approx 0.652 \]

So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is approximately:
\[ C \times 0.652 \]

Next, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour for 3 hours. This means that after another 3 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ C \times 0.652 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = C \times 0.652 \times 0.93^3 \]

Calculating \( 0.93^3 \):
\[ 0.93^3 \approx 0.812 \]

So, after 8 hours, the charge remaining is approximately:
\[ C \times 0.652 \times 0.812 \approx C \times 0.528 \]

We know that after 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%, or 0.28. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ C \times 0.528 = 0.28 \]

Solving for \( C \):
\[ C = \frac{0.28}{0.528} \approx 0.531 \]

So, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 53.1%."
"First, let's calculate Janet's total weekly earnings. She earns $10 per hour from wages and $15 per hour from tips, so her total weekly earnings are:

\[ 10 + 15 = 25 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are:

\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ dollars per week} \]

Next, we need to determine how much she needs to save to buy the car. The down payment for the car is $10,000. She wants to save 20% of this amount:

\[ 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to save $2000 at a rate of $1000 per week. We do this by dividing the total amount she needs to save by her weekly savings:

\[ \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

So, the number of weeks Janet will need to work to save the down payment is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased:

- Peaches: 3 peaches * $0.50/peach = $1.50
- Pears: 4 pears * $0.50/pear = $2.00
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00/kiwi = $2.00
- Apples: 5 apples * $0.75/apple = $3.75

Now, let's sum these amounts to find the total cost of the fruits he has already bought:

Total cost of purchased fruits = $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar has $10 to spend, so the remaining amount he can spend on plums is:

Remaining amount = $10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Finally, we need to determine how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75. Since each plum costs $0.25, the number of plums he can buy is:

Number of plums = $0.75 / $0.25/plum = 3 plums

So, the final numerical answer is 3."
"First, we need to determine the total number of pieces of sweets Anne purchased. Since she bought a box containing 15 packs and each pack has 60 pieces, we calculate the total number of pieces as follows:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs Anne gave to her friends. Since she kept 2 packs, the number of packs she gave away is:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} - 2 \text{ packs} = 13 \text{ packs} \]

These 13 packs are given to her 10 friends equally. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide the number of packs given away by the number of friends:

\[ \frac{13 \text{ packs}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 1.3 \text{ packs per friend} \]

Since each pack contains 60 pieces, the number of pieces each friend received is:

\[ 1.3 \text{ packs per friend} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 78 \text{ pieces per friend} \]

Thus, each of her friends received \(\boxed{78}\) pieces of sweets."
"To calculate the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating compounded price increases:

\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (1 + \text{Rate})^{\text{Number of Years}} \]

Given:
- Initial Price = $120
- Rate = 5% = 0.05
- Number of Years = 3

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 139 \]

So, the price of carrots after three years would be $139."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many selfies and portraits Olivia uploaded to her albums. We know that she uploaded a total of 72 pictures into 8 albums, with 3 albums dedicated to selfies and 2 albums to portraits. This means the remaining albums are for other types of pictures, but we don't need to know the exact number of those for this calculation.

First, let's find out how many pictures were placed in the albums that are not selfies or portraits. Since there are 8 albums in total and 3 are for selfies and 2 are for portraits, the number of albums for other types of pictures is:
\[ 8 - 3 - 2 = 3 \]

This means the 3 albums for other types of pictures contain:
\[ 72 - (3 \times \text{selfies} + 2 \times \text{portraits}) \]
Since the total number of pictures is 72, and the pictures in the selfies and portraits albums are part of this total, we can set up the equation:
\[ 3 \times \text{selfies} + 2 \times \text{portraits} = 72 - (\text{selfies} + \text{portraits}) \]

However, we can simplify by recognizing that the total number of pictures in the selfies and portraits albums is part of the total 72. Let's denote the number of selfies as \( S \) and the number of portraits as \( P \). We know:
\[ S + P = 72 - (3 + 2) = 67 \]

Since the problem does not provide additional information to distinguish between selfies and portraits, we can assume that the distribution of selfies and portraits is such that the total number of selfies and portraits is 67. Given the problem's constraints and the need to find a specific numerical answer, we can infer that the distribution is such that the number of selfies and portraits is evenly distributed or follows a specific pattern, but without loss of generality and based on the problem's setup, we can assume the simplest case where the number of selfies and portraits are equal (since no other information is given).

Thus, we can solve:
\[ S + P = 67 \]
\[ S = P \]
\[ 2S = 67 \]
\[ S = 33.5 \]
\[ P = 33.5 \]

However, since the number of pictures must be a whole number, we need to re-evaluate the problem constraints. Given the problem's setup and the need for a whole number solution, we can assume the simplest case where the number of selfies and portraits are as close as possible to each other. Therefore, we can assume:
\[ S = 33 \]
\[ P = 34 \]

Thus, the number of selfies and portraits Olivia uploaded is:
\[ \boxed{33 \text{ selfies and } 34 \text{ portraits}} \]"
"To determine how long James spends reading, we first need to find out how many minutes it takes him to read one page. Since it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can calculate the time it takes to read one page by dividing 10 minutes by 3 pages:

\[ \text{Time per page} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} \approx 3.33 \text{ minutes per page} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages. We do this by multiplying the time it takes to read one page by 18:

\[ \text{Time to read 18 pages} = 18 \text{ pages} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, James spends 60 minutes reading. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the current number of guests in the hotel, we need to follow the sequence of events and perform the necessary calculations step by step.

1. **Initial number of guests**: The hotel was completely booked with 100 guests.
2. **Guests who checked out early**: 24 guests checked out early.
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76
   \]
   So, after the early checkouts, there are 76 guests remaining.
3. **Guests who checked out late**: 15 guests checked out late.
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61
   \]
   So, after the late checkouts, there are 61 guests remaining.
4. **Guests who checked in in the afternoon**: Twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout.
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30
   \]
   So, 30 new guests checked in.
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91
   \]
   So, after the new guests checked in, there are 91 guests.
5. **Guests who checked in after dinner**: 7 more people checked in.
   \[
   91 + 7 = 98

"First, let's determine the number of easy, average, and difficult questions in the quiz.

- Total number of questions: 60
- Percentage of easy questions: 40%
- Number of easy questions: \( 60 \times 0.40 = 24 \)

Since the rest of the questions are equally divided into average and difficult questions, we can calculate the number of average and difficult questions as follows:
- Number of average questions: \( \frac{60 - 24}{2} = \frac{36}{2} = 18 \)
- Number of difficult questions: \( 18 \)

Next, we calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:
- Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct: \( 24 \times 0.75 = 18 \)
- Aries is sure to get half of the average questions correct: \( 18 \times 0.50 = 9 \)
- Aries is sure to get half of the difficult questions correct: \( 18 \times 0.50 = 9 \)

Now, we sum up the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:
- Total correct questions: \( 18 + 9 + 9 = 36 \)

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[

"First, let's determine the price of a large stuffed animal. Since each small stuffed animal costs $4 and large stuffed animals cost three times as much, the price of a large stuffed animal is:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( L \). According to the problem, the number of small stuffed animals sold is twice the number of large stuffed animals sold, so the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2L \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as the sum of the earnings from the large stuffed animals and the small stuffed animals. The earnings from the large stuffed animals are \( 12L \) dollars, and the earnings from the small stuffed animals are \( 4 \times 2L = 8L \) dollars. The total earnings are given as $120, so we can set up the following equation:
\[ 12L + 8L = 120 \]
\[ 20L = 120 \]
\[ L = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

Since the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2L \), we have:
\[ 2L = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine the total number of sandwiches eaten by the family in one week, we first need to calculate the daily total and then multiply by the number of days in a week.

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, the wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and the son eats 2 sandwiches per day. Therefore, the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by the family is:
\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \text{ sandwiches per day} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of sandwiches eaten in one week is:
\[ 11 \times 7 = 77 \text{ sandwiches} \]

"First, let's calculate Suzanne's earnings from selling cookies and cupcakes.

She sold 80 cookies at $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are:
\[ 80 \text{ cookies} \times \$1/\text{cookie} = \$80 \]

She sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are:
\[ 60 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$4/\text{cupcake} = \$240 \]

Now, let's add her earnings from cookies and cupcakes to find her total earnings:
\[ \$80 + \$240 = \$320 \]

Next, we need to account for the money she gave to her two sisters. She gave each sister $10, so the total amount given to her sisters is:
\[ 2 \times \$10 = \$20 \]

Finally, to find out how much money Suzanne has left, we subtract the amount given to her sisters from her total earnings:
\[ \$320 - \$20 = \$300 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$300 \]"
"The Smith twins found a total of 30 + 30 = 60 eggs. Since all the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends, the number of eggs found by the friends is 100 - 60 - 10 = 30 eggs. 

The final numerical answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the daily ore mining capacity of a dwarf with a steel pickaxe and then scale it up to 40 dwarves working for 30 days.

1. A dwarf with a bare hands can mine 12 pounds of ore per day.
2. A dwarf with an iron pickaxe can mine twice as much as a bare hands dwarf, which is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) pounds per day.
3. A dwarf with a steel pickaxe can mine 50% more than a dwarf with an iron pickaxe. Therefore, the daily mining capacity of a dwarf with a steel pickaxe is \(24 + (24 \times 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36\) pounds per day.

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in 30 days.

The total ore mined by one dwarf with a steel pickaxe in 30 days is:
\[36 \text{ pounds/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 1080 \text{ pounds}.\]

Therefore, the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in 30 days is:

Since the prices are proportional, the cost per sandwich for the third package (8 sandwiches) should also be $1.5. Therefore, we can set up the following proportion to find \( x \):
\[
\frac{x}{8} = 1.5
\]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 8:
\[
x = 1.5 \times 8 = 12
\]

Thus, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost \(\boxed{12}\) dollars."
"First, we need to determine the net cost of the bedroom set after Tom sells his old one. Tom buys a bedroom set for $3000 and sells his old bedroom for $1000. Therefore, the net cost of the new bedroom set is:

\[ 3000 - 1000 = 2000 \]

Next, Tom has to pay 10% of this net cost per month. To find out how much he has to pay per month, we calculate 10% of $2000:

\[ 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

So, the amount Tom has to pay per month is:

\[ \boxed{200} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst. Sally initially had 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst.

\[ 40\% \text{ of } 25 = 0.40 \times 25 = 10 \text{ red balloons burst} \]

So, the number of red balloons remaining is:

\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \text{ red balloons} \]

Next, Sally accidentally released half of the yellow balloons. She initially had 12 yellow balloons.

\[ \frac{1}{2} \text{ of } 12 = 6 \text{ yellow balloons released} \]

So, the number of yellow balloons remaining is:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \text{ yellow balloons} \]

Now, Sally found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her remaining balloons.

\[ 75\% \text{ of } 8 = 0.75 \times 8 = 6 \text{ blue balloons added} \]

So, the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school is the sum of the remaining red, yellow, and the added blue balloons:

\[ 15 \text{ (red)} + 6 \text{ (yellow)} + 6 \text{ (blue)} = 27 \text{ balloons} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider all the scenarios and their probabilities.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of the substitute teacher collecting the homework: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of having to turn in homework in this scenario: 50% or 0.50

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having the normal teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of getting an extension from the normal teacher: 40% or 0.40
   - Probability of not getting an extension from the normal teacher: 60% or 0.60
   - Probability of Marcus convincing the teacher his dog ate the assignment: 20% or 0.20
   - Probability of not convincing the teacher: 80% or 0.80

Now, let's calculate the overall probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework:

- **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
  - Probability of having to turn in homework: 50% or 0.50

- **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
  - Probability of not getting an extension: 60% or 0.60
  - Probability of having to turn in homework: 100% - 20% = 80% or 0.80

Now, we combine these probabilities:

- Probability of having to turn in homework in the substitute teacher scenario: 50% or 0.50
- Probability of having to turn in homework in the normal teacher scenario: 80% or 0.80

Total probability of having to turn in homework:
\[ 0.50 + 0.80 = 1.30 \]

However, this total probability exceeds 100%, which indicates an overlap or misinterpretation. We need to consider the scenarios more carefully:

- The probability of having to turn in homework in the substitute teacher scenario is 50%.
- The probability of having to turn in homework in the normal teacher scenario, given an extension is not granted, is 20% (since 80% of the time, the extension is granted, and 20% of the time the extension is not granted).

Thus, the correct calculation is:
\[ 0.50 + 0.20 = 0.70 \]

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:
\[ 70\% \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of seats that are not occupied by graduates and faculty. The Fine Arts Center has a capacity of 6000 seats. After accounting for the 950 seats for graduates and 300 seats for faculty, the number of available seats is calculated as follows:

\[ 6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750 \]

These 4750 seats are to be split equally among the graduates. To find out how many tickets each graduate will receive, we divide the number of available seats by the number of graduates:

\[ \frac{4750}{950} = 5 \]

Therefore, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 5 \]"

"First, let's calculate the total number of hours Melissa spends on jury duty:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's calculate her total earnings from the jury duty:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate her total expenses for parking:
\[ 3 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the total expenses from the total earnings to find the net earnings:
\[ 45 \text{ dollars} - 9 \text{ dollars} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find out how much she makes per hour after expenses, we divide her net earnings by the total number of hours:

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we first need to calculate the number of soda bottles he will place along the driveway.

The width of the driveway is 24 feet, and he wants to place a bottle every 3 feet. Therefore, the number of bottles is calculated as follows:
\[
\frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet per bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles}
\]

Richard will need to go from one bottle to the next to drop the candy in. Since he starts at the first bottle and goes to the next 7 times, he will need to make 7 trips.

Each trip takes 5 seconds. Therefore, the total time for all the trips is:
\[
7 \text{ trips} \times 5 \text{ seconds per trip} = 35 \text{ seconds}
\]

Thus, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the Parmesan cheese:
- The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound.
- Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese.
- Therefore, the cost of the Parmesan cheese is \( 11 \times 2 = 22 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mozzarella cheese:
- The price of mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound.
- Amor buys 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese.
- Therefore, the cost of the mozzarella cheese is \( 6 \times 3 = 18 \) dollars.

Now, let's find the total cost of the cheese Amor bought:
- The total cost is the sum of the cost of Parmesan cheese and the cost of mozzarella cheese.
- Therefore, the total cost is \( 22 + 18 = 40 \) dollars.

Amor starts with $50. To find out how much money she has left after buying the cheese, we subtract the total cost from her initial amount:
- The amount of money left is \( 50 - 40 = 10 \) dollars.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Jim borrowed and the total income he would have earned if he had not gone to college.

First, let's calculate the total amount of loans Jim took out:
- Jim took out $50,000 per year for 4 years.
- Total loan amount = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000.

Next, let's calculate the total income Jim would have earned if he had not gone to college:
- Before college, Jim had a $25,000 annual income.
- If he had not gone to college, he would have earned $25,000 per year for 4 years.
- Total income if he had not gone to college = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000.

Now, let's calculate the total income Jim would have earned during his college years:
- During college, Jim's income is tripled, so he earns $75,000 per year.
- Total income during college = $75,000 * 4 = $300,000.

Now, let's calculate the total income Jim would have earned if he had not gone to college minus the income he earned during college:
- Income lost = Total income if he had not gone to college - Total income during college.
- Income lost = $100,000 - $300,000 = -$200,000.

Since the income lost is negative, it means Jim actually gained $200,000 in terms of income by going to college. Now, we need to calculate how long it would take for Jim to earn back the $200,000 in loans and the $200,000 in income he lost.

The total amount Jim needs to earn back is:
- Total amount to earn back = $200,000 (loan amount) + $200,000 (income lost) = $400,000.

If Jim earns $75,000 per year during college, we need to find out how many years it will take to earn $400,000:
- Number of years = Total amount to earn back / Annual income during college.
- Number of years = $400,000 / $75,000 = 5.3333 years.

Since Jim cannot work a fraction of a year, we round up to the next whole number:
- Number of years = 6 years.

Therefore, it would take Jim 6 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the income lost from not working while in school.

The final numerical answer is: 6 years."
"To determine the total square feet of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of each piece of fabric he requires. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide.

Each piece of fabric is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. Therefore, the dimensions of each piece of fabric are:
- Length: \(6 + 2 = 8\) feet
- Width: \(8 + 2 = 10\) feet

Next, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
\[
\text{Area of one piece} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 8 \, \text{feet} \times 10 \, \text{feet} = 80 \, \text{square feet}
\]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[
\text{Total area} = 2 \times 80 \, \text{square feet} = 160 \, \text{square feet}
\]

Thus, the total square feet of fabric Jim needs to buy is:
\[
\boxed{160}

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered on Tuesday and Wednesday based on the information given for Monday, and then sum the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday.

First, let's determine the number of letters delivered on Tuesday. According to the problem, Tuesday's delivery is 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery. Monday's delivery was 425 letters.

Calculate one-fifth of Monday's delivery:
\[
\frac{425}{5} = 85
\]

Then, add 17 to this amount to find Tuesday's delivery:
\[
85 + 17 = 102
\]

Next, we need to find the number of letters delivered on Wednesday. The problem states that Wednesday's delivery is 5 more than twice Tuesday's delivery. We already know Tuesday's delivery was 102 letters.

Calculate twice Tuesday's delivery:
\[
2 \times 102 = 204
\]

Then, add 5 to this amount to find Wednesday's delivery:
\[
204 + 5 = 209
\]

Now, we sum the number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:
\[
425 \text{ (Monday)} + 102 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 209 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 736
\]

Thus, the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is:
\[

"To find out how much Johnny's dad lost on average that day, we need to calculate the total amount lost and then divide by the number of races.

1. **First Race:**
   - Johnny's dad lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost.
   - Amount lost in the first race = $5.
   - Twice the amount lost = $5 * 2 = $10.
   - Amount won in the second race = $10 + $1 = $11.
   - Since he won, this is a positive amount, but for the purpose of calculating loss, we consider the negative of this amount.
   - Amount lost in the second race = -$11.

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Amount won in the second race = $11.
   - Amount lost in the third race = 1.5 * $11 = $16.50.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost:
- Total amount lost = Amount lost in the first race + Amount lost in the second race + Amount lost in the third race.
- Total amount lost = $5 + (-$11) + $16.50 = $5 - $11 + $16.50 = $10.50.

Finally, to find the average amount lost per race, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races:
- Number of races = 3.
- Average amount lost per race = Total amount lost / Number of races = $10.50 / 3 = $3.50.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{3.50}

Total population = 26 × 5 × 1000 = 130,000

The final numerical answer is 130,000."
"First, we need to convert all measurements to the same unit for easier comparison. Let's use inches.

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, Xavier's height in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Xavier grew 3 inches, so his current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole's initial height was 50 inches. Cole grew 2 inches, so his current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:

"Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

"To determine the number of hours each painter worked, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of days the painters worked:**
   - There are 3 weeks of work.
   - Each week has 7 days.
   - Therefore, the total number of days is \(3 \times 7 = 21\) days.

2. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by the team:**
   - Each day, the team worked \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day.
   - Therefore, the total number of hours worked by the team is \( 21 \times \frac{3}{8} \).

3. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by the team:**
   \[
   21 \times \frac{3}{8} = \frac{21 \times 3}{8} = \frac{63}{8} = 7.875 \text{ hours}

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, Rory retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2}) = 2 \cdot 19 \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now that we know \( x = 6 \), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

So, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation year by year from 2007 to 2010.

The formula for depreciation is:
\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^{\text{Number of Years}} \]

Given:
- Initial Price = $20000
- Depreciation Rate = 21% = 0.21
- Number of Years from 2007 to 2010 = 3

Now, we can plug these values into the formula:
\[ \text{Final Price} = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 20000 \times 0.493039 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 9860.78 \]

So, the price of the car in the year 2010 is approximately $9860.78."
"First, let's determine the number of English books. Since half of the 50 books are written in English, we calculate:

\[

"To determine how much James pays for insurance a year after his accident, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the increased monthly cost due to the accident.
2. Determine the annual cost based on the increased monthly cost.

First, let's calculate the increased monthly cost:
- The normal monthly cost is $120.
- The increase is 60% of $120.

To find 60% of $120:
\[ 0.60 \times 120 = 72 \]

So, the increased monthly cost is:
\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Next, we calculate the annual cost:
- The increased monthly cost is $192.
- There are 12 months in a year.

To find the annual cost:
\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, the amount James pays a year is:

"To determine how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the number of loads required for the twin beds and the king size bed separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of loads for the twin beds:
- Greg has 4 twin beds.
- Each load can wash 2 twin sets of sheets.
- Therefore, the number of loads needed for the twin beds is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) loads.

Next, let's calculate the number of loads for the king size bed:
- Greg has 1 king size bed.
- Each load can wash 1 king set of sheets.
- Therefore, the number of loads needed for the king size bed is \( \frac{1}{1} = 1 \) load.

Now, we sum the loads for the twin beds and the king size bed:
- Total loads per week = 2 (twin beds) + 1 (king size bed) = 3 loads.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total number of loads in a year is:
- Total loads per year = 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads.

On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) movies.

So, in one weekend, they watch \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) movies.

Since they watch movies every weekend, in 4 weeks, they will have 4 weekends. Therefore, the total number of movies they can watch in 4 weeks is \( 4 \times 6 = 24 \).

The final numerical answer is:
24"
"To determine the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection, we need to calculate the number of stickers he collected each year and add them to the number he had two years ago.

1. Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.
2. Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers.
3. This year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year (last year). Since he collected 50 stickers last year, this year he collected \(2 \times 50 = 100\) stickers.

Now, we sum up the stickers from each year:
- Two years ago: 100 stickers
- Last year: 50 stickers
- This year: 100 stickers

Adding these together:
\[ 100 + 50 + 100 = 250 \]

Therefore, the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection is 250."
"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we first need to calculate the total amount of cat food Imma's cats consume per day.

Imma has 3 cats, and each cat is fed 60 grams of cat food twice a day. Therefore, the total amount of cat food consumed per day is:
\[ 3 \text{ cats} \times 60 \text{ grams/cat} \times 2 \text{ feedings/day} = 360 \text{ grams/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:
\[ \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams/day}} = 2 \text{ days} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's determine how many slices Jake ate. We know that Becky ate 10 slices and that she ate 3 more slices than Jake. Therefore, Jake ate:

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we know that Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake. Therefore, Silvia ate:

\[ 2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by adding the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:

\[ 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 \text{ slices} \]

So, the total number of slices they ate is:

\[
\boxed{31}

"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time for the meal is the sum of the times for both parts, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Next, we isolate \( D \) by subtracting 18 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Then, we solve for \( D \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's part as follows:

\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{58} \]"
"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to consider the following:

1. The cost of the cast: $200
2. The cost of the visit: $300/hour for 30 minutes. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the cost is $300 / 2 = $150
3. The cost of the painkillers: $4/pill for 30 pills. So, the cost is $4 * 30 = $120
4. The cost of parking: $6/hour for a minimum of 2 hours. So, the cost is $6 * 2 = $12

Now, we sum these costs:
$200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"First, we need to determine how many emails James does not respond to in a day. Since 20% of the 80 emails do not require any response, we calculate 20% of 80:

\[ 0.20 \times 80 = 16 \]

This means that James does not respond to 16 emails each day. Therefore, the number of emails he does respond to each day is:

\[ 80 - 16 = 64 \]

Next, we need to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week. We multiply the number of emails he responds to each day by 5:

\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 320 \]"
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to calculate the number of classes for each day and then sum them up.

- On Monday, 32 classes visited.
- On Tuesday, twice as many visited as on Monday, so \(2 \times 32 = 64\) classes.
- On Wednesday, three times as many visited as on Monday, so \(3 \times 32 = 96\) classes.
- On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
- On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, we sum the number of classes for each day:

\[
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25
\]

First, add the numbers step by step:

\[
32 + 64 = 96
\]
\[
96 + 96 = 192
\]
\[
192 + 30 = 222
\]
\[
222 + 25 = 247

"To find John's average score across the 4 tests, we first need to add up all his scores and then divide by the number of tests.

John's scores are: 100, 100, 100, and 80.

First, we sum these scores:
\[ 100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380 \]

Next, we divide the total sum by the number of tests, which is 4:
\[ \frac{380}{4} = 95 \]

So, John's average score across the 4 tests is 95."
"First, let's calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club. They ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them.

\[ \text{Pizzas eaten by glee club} = 20 \times \frac{70}{100} = 20 \times 0.7 = 14 \]

So, the glee club has:

\[ \text{Pizzas left with glee club} = 20 - 14 = 6 \]

Next, let's calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the football team. They ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

The football team ate 80% of these pizzas.

\[ \text{Pizzas eaten by football team} = 40 \times \frac{80}{100} = 40 \times 0.8 = 32 \]

So, the football team has:

\[ \text{Pizzas left with football team} = 40 - 32 = 8 \]

Now, let's find the total number of pizzas left:

\[ \text{Total pizzas left} = \text{Pizzas left with glee club} + \text{Pizzas left with football team} = 6 + 8 = 14 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 14 \]"
"To determine the total cost of mailing the coupons, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of big coupons Anthony is sending.
2. Calculate the total cost for the small coupons.
3. Calculate the total cost for the big coupons.
4. Sum the costs from steps 2 and 3 to get the total cost.

First, we know Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons. Therefore, the number of big coupons is:
\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost for the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents, so the total cost for 700 small coupons is:
\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Then, we calculate the cost for the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents, so the total cost for 1400 big coupons is:
\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

Finally, we sum the costs of the small and big coupons to find the total cost:
\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:
\[ 24500 \text{ cents} = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:
\[ \boxed{245} \]"
"First, let's determine how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney ordered. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which means she ordered \(10 - 3 = 7\) meatball sub sandwiches.

Next, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. This leaves Sidney with \(7 - 4 = 3\) meatball sub sandwiches.

Then, Sidney ordered another three meatball sub sandwiches. So, the total number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney has now is \(3 + 3 = 6\).

Since each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is \(6 \times 4 = 24\).

The final numerical answer is:

"Initially, Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks, each carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. Therefore, the total amount of fertiliser dispatched was:

\[ 20 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 400 \text{ tons} \]

Two hours after departure, a quarter of the trucks experienced mechanical failures. The number of trucks that failed is:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks} \]

This means that the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks} \]

The total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:

\[ 15 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 300 \text{ tons} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 300 \]"
"To determine the cost Dennis will incur for purchasing 6 pounds of butter under the given promotion, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of butter needed:**
   Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
   \[
   \text{Total butter needed} = 6 \text{ dozen} \times 1 \text{ pound per dozen} = 6 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Understand the promotion:**
   The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter get one half off."" This means for every 2 pounds of butter purchased, Dennis only pays for 1 pound.

3. **Determine the number of sets of 2 pounds needed:**
   Since Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter, we divide by 2 to find the number of sets:
   \[
   \text{Number of sets} = \frac{6 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds per set}} = 3 \text{ sets}
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost for each set:**
   Each set of 2 pounds of butter costs $4.00 (since the first pound is full price and the second pound is half off).

5. **Calculate the total cost for 3 sets:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 3 \text{ sets} \times 4 \text{ dollars per set} = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the total cost Dennis will incur to purchase 6 pounds of butter under the promotion is:
\[

"First, let's calculate the total number of guests Kayla invited:

- Kayla's classmates: 25
- Girls in her dance class: 7
- Family members: 13
- Total invited guests: 25 + 7 + 13 = 45

Next, we need to account for the 4 people who could not come:

- Total guests who will attend: 45 - 4 = 41

Now, we need to calculate the cost based on the given pricing structure:

- The base fee for renting the theater for 20 people is $125.
- The additional fee is $6 for each guest beyond the initial 20.

The number of additional guests beyond the initial 20 is:

- Additional guests: 41 - 20 = 21

The cost for the additional guests is:

- Additional cost: 21 * $6 = $126

Finally, we add the base fee to the additional cost to get the total cost:

- Total cost: $125 + $126 = $251

The final numerical answer is $251."
"Let's denote the amount of money Maggie had as \( M \) and the amount of money Riza had as \( R \). According to the problem, both Maggie and Riza had $60 initially. So, we have:
\[ M = 60 \]
\[ R = 60 \]

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she spent:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \]
So, the amount of money Maggie has left is:
\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \]

Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she spent:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \]
So, the amount of money Riza has left is:
\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \]

The total amount of money that Maggie and Riza have left together is:
\[ 45 + 40 = 85 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 85 \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats:
\[ 10 + 4 = 14 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Together, the first and second monkeys eat:
\[ 10 + 14 = 24 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Mr. Robles has 315 bananas in total, which is enough to feed the three monkeys for a week. Therefore, the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day is:
\[ \frac{315}{7} = 45 \text{ bananas each day} \]

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we subtract the number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day:
\[ 45 - 24 = 21 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Thus, the third monkey eats:
\[ \boxed{21} \text{ bananas each day} \]"
"Teddy finished half of the first 500-piece puzzle, which means Teddy placed 500 / 2 = 250 pieces of the first puzzle.

"First, let's calculate the cost of the roses Jenny bought. Since roses cost $2 each and she bought 15 roses, the total cost is:
\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2/\text{rose} = \$30 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jenny has initially. She arrived with five 5 dollar bills, so:
\[ 5 \times \$5 = \$25 \]

Since the total cost of the roses is $30 and Jenny only has $25, she needs an additional $5 to pay for the roses. However, the question asks how many quarters she leaves with, which implies we need to find out how many quarters she receives in change.

The change she receives is:
\[ \$30 - \$25 = \$5 \]

Since quarters are worth $0.25 each, the number of quarters she receives is:
\[ \frac{\$5}{\$0.25/\text{quarter}} = 20 \text{ quarters} \]

Therefore, the number of quarters Jenny leaves with is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"

"To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the arrival and departure times of each train and then find out when Paul's train arrives.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays in the station for 20 minutes.
   - Departure time: 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves (30 minutes after 30 minutes = 60 minutes).
   - Stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed (20 minutes / 4 = 5 minutes).
   - Departure time: 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives 60 minutes after the second train leaves (65 minutes).
   - Leaves the station immediately after it arrives (65 minutes).
   - Departure time: 65 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves (65 + 20 = 85 minutes).
   - Stays in the station for the same amount of time as the first train (20 minutes).
   - Departure time: 85 + 20 = 105 minutes.

Paul's train is the fourth train, which arrives at 85 minutes. Since Paul arrives at the station at 0 minutes, he will wait for 85 minutes.

"First, let's calculate how many toothpicks Melanie has already saved. She saves 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks:

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie needs a total of 200 toothpicks. She has already saved 120 toothpicks, so the number of additional toothpicks she needs is:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks, we divide the number of toothpicks she still needs by the number of toothpicks she saves each week:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks."
"First, let's determine the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch. The original price of the watch is $2000, and he bought it at 75% of its original price.

\[
\text{Price Mr. Rogers paid} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500
\]

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.

\[
\text{Price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800
\]

Now, we need to find the percentage discount Mr. Rogers's friend obtained from the original price. The original price was $2000, and the friend paid $1800 for the watch.

\[
\text{Discount amount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs over a period of 4 hours. Given that each spring creates one jellyfish per second, we can break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.

1. **Determine the number of jellyfish created by one spring in one hour:**
   - There are 60 seconds in one minute and 60 minutes in one hour.
   - Therefore, there are \(60 \times 60 = 3600\) seconds in one hour.
   - Since one spring creates one jellyfish per second, in one hour, one spring will create \(3600\) jellyfish.

2. **Determine the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - Since one spring creates 3600 jellyfish in one hour, in 4 hours, one spring will create \(3600 \times 4 = 14400\) jellyfish.

3. **Determine the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates 14400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create \(14400 \times 5 = 72000\) jellyfish in 4 hours.

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs working at the same rate in 4 hours is \(\boxed{72000}\)."
"To find Frankie's score, we start with the information given:

- Binkie's score is 90.
- Frankie's score is 15 more than twice Binkie's score.

First, we calculate twice Binkie's score:
\[ 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

\[ 2 \text{ miles} + 2 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour. To find out how long it took him to walk 4 miles, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

"First, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually. Jenny buys 10 bunches, and each bunch has an average of 4 bananas. Therefore, the total number of bananas she buys is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Since each banana costs $0.80, the total cost if she bought the bananas individually would be:

\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Jenny buys 10 bunches, and each bunch costs $3.00, so the total cost is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

Now, to find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we subtract the total cost of buying the bananas in bunches from the total cost of buying them individually:

\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

So, the amount of money Jenny saved is:

\[

"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) and the amount of fence Harry gets as \( H \). According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so we can write:

\[ H = S + 60 \]

Since the total amount of fence is 100 feet, we also have:

\[ S + H = 100 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"

"To determine how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply by their respective prices.

First, let's find out how many of each type of bike were sold:
- Total bikes sold = 300
- Trekking bikes sold = 50% of 300 = \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \)
- BMX bikes sold = 15% of 300 = \( 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \)
- MTB bikes sold = Total bikes sold - Trekking bikes sold - BMX bikes sold = \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 65 \)

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike:
- Price of one MTB = $500
- Price of one BMX = \( \frac{500}{2} = $250 \)
- Price of one Trekking bike = $450

Now, we calculate the total earnings:
- Earnings from MTB = \( 65 \times 500 = $32,500 \)
- Earnings from BMX = \( 45 \times 250 = $11,250 \)
- Earnings from Trekking bikes = \( 150 \times 450 = $67,500 \)

Finally, we sum up the earnings from all types of bikes:
- Total earnings = \( 32,500 + 11,250 + 67,500 = $111,250 \)

Thus, Marcel earned \(\boxed{111250}\) dollars from selling bicycles during that month."

"First, we need to determine the initial height from which Nathan drops the ball. Since the ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony and each story is 24 feet high, the height from which the ball is dropped is:

\[ 3 \text{ stories} \times 24 \text{ feet/story} = 72 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how high the ball bounces on its first bounce. The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height. Therefore, the height after the first bounce is:

\[ 72 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we need to find out how high the ball bounces on its second bounce. The ball again bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its height after the first bounce. Therefore, the height after the second bounce is:

\[ 48 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height the ball goes on its second bounce is:

\[ 32 \text{ feet} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 32 \]"
"First, let's convert all heights to inches for easier calculation. The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child is:
\[ 6 \times 12 = 72 \text{ inches} \]

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so:
\[ 72 + 2 = 74 \text{ inches} \]

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so:
\[ 74 - 5 = 69 \text{ inches} \]

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so:
\[ 69 + 3 = 72 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height of the fourth child is:
\[ 72 \text{ inches} \]"
"To determine the earnings from selling 2000 apples at a rate of $5 per bag, we first need to find out how many bags were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can calculate the number of bags sold as follows:

\[ \text{Number of bags sold} = \frac{\text{Total number of apples sold}}{\text{Number of apples per bag}} = \frac{2000}{10} = 200 \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags sold by the price per bag:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of bags sold} \times \text{Price per bag} = 200 \times 5 = 1000 \]

Thus, the orchard earned \(\boxed{1000}\) dollars for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag."
"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of the meat, so it left \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
3. The Allosaurus then ate the remaining meat, which is \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms. According to the problem, this amount is 270 kilograms.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{x}{4} = 270
\]

To find \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 4:
\[
x = 270 \times 4 = 1080
\]

Therefore, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 kilograms.

\[
\boxed{1080}
\]"
"First, we need to calculate the total area of the walls that Tony needs to paint. The north and south walls are each 10 feet by 8 feet, so the area of each is:

\[ 10 \times 8 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is:

\[ 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, the east and west walls are each 5 feet by 8 feet, so the area of each is:

\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ square feet} \]

Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is:

\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Adding the areas of all four walls together gives the total area to be painted:

\[ 160 + 80 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Now, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:

\[ \frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Each gallon of paint costs $12, so the total cost to paint the room is:

\[ 12 \times 12 = 144 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to track the distribution of sodas and their shaking status.

Initially, Ellen has:
- 12 sodas in total.
- 3 of these sodas are shaken.
- 9 of these sodas are unshaken.

Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving:
- 11 sodas in total.
- 3 of these sodas are shaken.
- 8 of these sodas are unshaken.

Ellen's brother then takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving:
- 10 sodas in total.
- 2 of these sodas are shaken.
- 8 of these sodas are unshaken.

Now, Ellen's friend comes along. The friend can get sprayed with soda from a shaken can if they receive at least 1 of the 2 remaining unshaken sodas. The probability that the friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is the probability that they receive at least 1 of the 2 unshaken sodas.

The total number of sodas left is 10, and the number of unshaken sodas left is 8. The number of ways to choose 2 sodas out of 10 is given by the combination formula \( \binom{10}{2} = \frac{10!}{2!(10-2)!} = 45 \).

The number of ways to choose 2 sodas out of the 8 unshaken sodas is \( \binom{8}{2} = \frac{8!}{2!(8-2)!} = 28 \).

The number of ways to choose 2 sodas out of the 10 sodas such that at least 1 is unshaken is the total number of ways to choose 2 sodas minus the number of ways to choose 2 sodas that are both shaken. Since there are 2 shaken sodas left, the number of ways to choose 2 shaken sodas out of 2 is \( \binom{2}{2} = 1 \).

Thus, the number of ways to choose 2 sodas such that at least 1 is unshaken is \( 45 - 1 = 44 \).

The probability that the friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes, which is \( \frac{44}{45} \).

To express this probability as a percentage, we calculate \( \frac{44}{45} \times 100 \approx 97.78\% \).

Therefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is \( 97.78\% \)."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours and then sum these distances since the trains are traveling in opposite directions.

The first train travels at 60 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will travel:
\[ 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \]

The second train travels at half the speed of the first train, which is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]
In 3 hours, it will travel:
\[ 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles} \]

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each train has traveled:
\[ 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 270 \]"
"To determine how many people Billy helps with their taxes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.
2. Determine the number of days Billy works.
3. Calculate the total number of hours Billy works.
4. Determine the total number of people he helps.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.**

- March has 31 days.
- April 19th is included in the count.

Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days

**Step 2: Determine the number of days Billy works.**

Billy takes 20% of the days off.

Days off = 20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days

Days Billy works = Total days - Days off = 50 - 10 = 40 days

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of hours Billy works.**

Billy works 3 hours a day.

Total hours worked = 40 days * 3 hours/day = 120 hours

**Step 4: Determine the total number of people he helps.**

Billy can help 2 people per hour.

Total people helped = 120 hours * 2 people/hour = 240 people

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes for each slide and then find the difference.

For the biggest slide:
- Length: 300 feet
- Speed: 60 feet/minute

Time to slide down the biggest slide = Length / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
- Length: 240 feet
- Speed: 80 feet/minute

Time to slide down the second biggest slide = Length / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

Now, we find the difference in time:
Time difference = Time for biggest slide - Time for second biggest slide = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

The final numerical answer is 2 minutes."
"To calculate the total time Bobby spends on his lunches and breaks over 5 days, we first need to determine the daily total and then multiply by 5.

Bobby's daily break time is 2 breaks of 15 minutes each, which totals:
\[ 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding his 30-minute lunch break, his total daily break time is:
\[ 30 + 30 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

To find the total time over 5 days, we multiply the daily total by 5:
\[ 60 \times 5 = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ \frac{300}{60} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"First, let's determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate the distance Micah ran as follows:

\[ \text{Distance Micah ran} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know the total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles. We can find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

\[ \text{Distance Ahito ran} = 52 - (8 + 28) = 52 - 36 = 16 \text{ miles} \]

So, Ahito ran 16 miles. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the initial charge and the return:

Initial charge: $85.00
Returned item: $15.00

After the return, the charge on the credit card is:
\[ 85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the items she bought after the discounts:

1. Frying pan on sale for 20% off $20.00:
\[ 20.00 - (0.20 \times 20.00) = 20.00 - 4.00 = 16.00 \]

2. Set of towels on sale for 10% off $30.00:
\[ 30.00 - (0.10 \times 30.00) = 30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00 \]

Now, let's add the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels to the remaining balance on the credit card:

\[ 70.00 + 16.00 + 27.00 = 113.00 \]

Therefore, the new balance on her credit card is:

"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( T \).

Given:
- A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{T}{5} \).
- A third of the large jellyfish change color under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{T}{5} = \frac{T}{15} \).
- When the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color.

Since the only jellyfish that change color are the large ones, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{T}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
\[ T = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ T = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is \( 90 \).

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Lauren saves each year and then figure out how many years she needs to work to save enough for her retirement plan.

1. **Calculate Lauren's annual savings:**
   Lauren saves 20% of her annual salary.
   \[
   \text{Annual savings} = 0.20 \times \$100,000 = \$20,000
   \]

2. **Determine the total amount Lauren needs for retirement:**
   Lauren plans to live with 40% of her current annual salary after retirement.
   \[
   \text{Annual living cost after retirement} = 0.40 \times \$100,000 = \$40,000
   \]
   Since she plans to save for 20 years, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to save.
   \[
   \text{Total amount needed} = \$40,000 \times 20 = \$800,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of years Lauren needs to work:**
   We know Lauren saves $20,000 each year. To find out how many years she needs to work to save $800,000, we divide the total amount needed by her annual savings.
   \[
   \text{Number of years needed} = \frac{\$800,000}{\$20,000} = 40 \text{ years}
   \]

Since Lauren is already planning to save for 20 years, we need to find out how many more years she needs to work beyond the initial 20 years to reach her goal of 40 years.

\[
\text{Additional years needed} = 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ years}
\]

Thus, Lauren needs to work an additional 20 years to save enough for her retirement plan. The final numerical answer is:

"To find out the length of each final cut, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, Marty cuts the 100 centimeters of ribbon into 4 equal parts. To find the length of each part, we divide 100 centimeters by 4:
   \[
   \frac{100 \text{ cm}}{4} = 25 \text{ cm}
   \]
   So, each of the 4 parts is 25 centimeters long.

2. Next, each of these 25 centimeter parts is divided into 5 equal parts. To find the length of each of these smaller parts, we divide 25 centimeters by 5:
   \[
   \frac{25 \text{ cm}}{5} = 5 \text{ cm}
   \]
   Therefore, each of the final cuts will be 5 centimeters long.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total number of students in the school, we start by noting that 40% of the school population consists of boys, and this percentage is equal to 240 boys. Let's denote the total number of students in the school by \( T \).

Given that 40% of \( T \) is 240 boys, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.40 \times T = 240 \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 600 \]

So, the total number of students in the school is 600. Since 40% of the students are boys, the remaining 60% are girls. To find the number of girls, we calculate 60% of 600:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times 600 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

Thus, the number of girls in the school is 360."

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time, we first need to calculate the total number of miles she plans to hike and then find out how many miles she needs to hike per day to meet her goal.

Soledad plans to hike 9,300 miles in June. She intends to walk twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. Therefore, the total number of miles she plans to hike per day is:
\[ 125 \text{ miles/time} \times 2 \text{ times/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days are in June. June has 30 days. Soledad plans to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days. The number of miles she needs to hike per day to complete her journey on time is:
\[ \frac{9300 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 310 \text{ miles/day} \]

To find out how many more miles per day Soledad must hike, we subtract the number of miles she plans to hike per day from the number of miles she needs to hike per day:
\[ 310 \text{ miles/day} - 250 \text{ miles/day} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad must hike \(\boxed{60}\) more miles per day to complete her journey on time."

"First, let's calculate the total number of male and female guppies and goldfishes Tate has after his purchase.

Initially, Tate has:
- 4 male guppies
- 7 female guppies
- 3 male goldfishes
- 5 female goldfishes

After buying more fish, Tate has:
- 4 (initial male guppies) + 2 (additional male guppies) = 6 male guppies
- 7 (initial female guppies) + 1 (additional female guppy) = 8 female guppies
- 3 (initial male goldfishes) + 2 (additional male goldfishes) = 5 male goldfishes
- 5 (initial female goldfishes) + 3 (additional female goldfishes) = 8 female goldfishes

Now, let's calculate the total number of male and female fishes:
- Total male fishes = 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfishes) = 11 male fishes
- Total female fishes = 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfishes) = 16 female fishes

To find out how many more female fishes than male fishes Tate has, we subtract the total number of male fishes from the total number of female fishes:

"First, let's determine the time each person took to complete their chores:

1. Amalia mowed the lawn, which took her 4 hours.
2. Megan walked the dog, which took her 2 hours longer than Amalia. Therefore, Megan's chore took her \(4 + 2 = 6\) hours.
3. Dior did the laundry, which took her well over 4 hours longer than Amalia. Since Amalia's chore took 4 hours, Dior's chore took her at least \(4 + 5 = 9\) hours (assuming ""well over 4 hours longer"" means more than 5 hours).

Now, we sum the time each person took to complete their chores:
\[ 4 \text{ (Amalia)} + 6 \text{ (Megan)} + 9 \text{ (Dior)} = 19 \text{ hours} \]

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is \(\boxed{19}\)."

"To determine how many miles Brian will walk in seven days, we start by understanding the relationship between the distances walked by Sofie and Brian.

Given:
- Sofie walks 10 miles every day.
- In 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian will in 7 days.

First, calculate the total distance Sofie will walk in 7 days:
\[ \text{Sofie's total distance} = 10 \, \text{miles/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 70 \, \text{miles} \]

According to the problem, this distance is twice the distance Brian will walk in 7 days:
\[ \text{Sofie's total distance} = 2 \times \text{Brian's total distance} \]

Let \( B \) represent the total distance Brian will walk in 7 days. Then:
\[ 70 \, \text{miles} = 2B \]

To find \( B \), solve for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{70 \, \text{miles}}{2} = 35 \, \text{miles} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers and then determine how many toys the fifth worker needs to produce per hour to meet the order requirements.

First, let's calculate the production rate of the first two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 6 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(6 \times 2 = 12\) toys per hour.

Next, let's calculate the production rate of the next two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 4 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(4 \times 2 = 8\) toys per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by all four workers in a 10-hour shift:
- The first two workers produce \(12 \times 10 = 120\) toys.
- The next two workers produce \(8 \times 10 = 80\) toys.
- Therefore, the total number of toys produced by all four workers in 10 hours is \(120 + 80 = 200\) toys.

The toy manufacturer received an order for 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, they still need 20 toys to ship the order. This means that the number of toys produced by the four workers is:
\[ 400 - 20 = 380 \text{ toys} \]

Since the four workers produced 200 toys in 10 hours, the fifth worker must have produced:
\[ 380 - 200 = 180 \text{ toys} \]

To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours in the shift:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys per hour} \]

Thus, the fifth worker produces \(\boxed{18}\) toys per hour."
"First, let's determine the weight of Elijah's dogs based on the information given.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah's dog that is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog weighs:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's dog that is half the weight of Kory's dog weighs:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add the weights of Elijah's dogs to find the total weight of Elijah's dogs:
\[ 15 + 30 = 45 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs to find the combined weight:
\[ 45 + 60 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Elijah and Kory’s dogs altogether is:
\[ \boxed{105} \]"
"Let's denote the number of stickers Seth originally had as \( S \).

1. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
2. Luis used half of his stickers and gave the rest to Kris. Therefore, Luis gave \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers to Kris.
3. Kris received \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers and kept 9 of them, which means Kris received 17 stickers in total (since \( 9 + 7 = 17 \)). Therefore, \( \frac{S}{4} = 17 \).
4. Solving for \( S \), we get \( S = 17 \times 4 = 68 \).

So, Seth originally had 68 stickers. The final numerical answer is:

68"
"First, we need to determine the total weight of the M&M in ounces. John buys 3 large bags, each weighing 10 ounces. Therefore, the total weight is:

\[ 3 \text{ bags} \times 10 \text{ ounces per bag} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many M&M's are in these 30 ounces. We know that 1 ounce of M&M contains 30 M&M's. Therefore, the total number of M&M's is:

\[ 30 \text{ ounces} \times 30 \text{ M&M's per ounce} = 900 \text{ M&M's} \]

Now, John wants to make small bags with 10 M&M's in each bag. To find out how many small bags he can make, we divide the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's per small bag:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ M&M's}}{10 \text{ M&M's per small bag}} = 90 \text{ small bags} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 90 \]"
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we first need to calculate half of the earth's circumference.

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of this distance is:
\[ \frac{40,000}{2} = 20,000 \text{ kilometers} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:
\[ \frac{20,000}{400} = 50 \text{ days} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 50 \]"
"To find the speed of the faster car, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car.
2. Use the speed of the 2nd fastest car to find the speed of the faster car.

First, we know the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. Therefore, the speed of the 2nd fastest car is:
\[ 120 \times 5 = 600 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. Therefore, the speed of the faster car is:
\[ 600 \times 1.25 = 750 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 750 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's start by determining Liam's age two years ago. Since Liam is currently 16 years old, two years ago he was:

\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \text{ years old} \]

According to the problem, two years ago Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. Let's denote Vince's age two years ago as \( V - 2 \), where \( V \) is Vince's current age. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 14 = 2(V - 2) \]

Now, let's solve for \( V \):

\[ 14 = 2(V - 2) \]
\[ 14 = 2V - 4 \]
\[ 14 + 4 = 2V \]
\[ 18 = 2V \]
\[ V = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ V = 9 \]

So, Vince is currently 9 years old. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline as \( A \). Since they painted the same number of eggs, we have \( A = A \).

Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Sarah as \( S \). Then, the number of eggs painted by Camden is \( S + 12 \) because Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah.

We know from the problem that the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ A + A + S + (S + 12) = 56 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2A + 2S + 12 = 56 \]
Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get:
\[ 2A + 2S = 44 \]
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
\[ A + S = 22 \]

We also know that Camden and Sarah together painted 30 eggs, so:
\[ S + (S + 12) = 30 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get:
\[ 2S = 18 \]
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, substituting \( S = 9 \) back into the equation \( A + S = 22 \), we get:
\[ A + 9 = 22 \]
Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get:
\[ A = 13 \]

So, Arnold painted 13 eggs, Madeline painted 13 eggs, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

To find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold, we calculate:
\[ 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons. This can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups} \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the total weight of the crayons is:

\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Each box weighs 8 ounces, and since there are 25 groups of crayons, there will be 25 boxes. The total weight of the boxes is:

\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes gives us the combined weight:

\[ \text{Total combined weight} = 200 \text{ ounces} + 200 \text{ ounces} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

To convert the total combined weight from ounces to pounds, we use the conversion factor that 16 ounces equals 1 pound:

\[ \text{Total combined weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 25 \]"
"First, we need to determine how many 4-foot logs John can make from the 80-foot tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, the length of the logs he can make is:

\[ 80 \text{ feet} \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 4-foot logs he can cut from 64 feet of wood:

\[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

Now, we need to determine how many planks John can get from these 16 logs. Since he cuts 5 planks from each log:

\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

Finally, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling these planks. Since each plank is sold for $1.2:

\[ 80 \text{ planks} \times 1.2 \text{ dollars/plank} = 96 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 96 \]"
"First, let's determine how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns half of what her brother earns, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Valerie's salary} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

Given that Valerie earns $5000 per month, we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[ 5000 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

To find the brother's salary, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ \text{Brother's salary} = 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Next, we calculate their mother's salary. The mother earns twice the combined salary of Valerie and her brother. First, we find the combined salary of Valerie and her brother:

\[ \text{Combined salary} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} = 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Now, we calculate the mother's salary:

\[ \text{Mother's salary} = 2 \times \text{Combined salary} = 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \]

Finally, we find the total amount of money they all have together by adding their individual salaries:

\[ \text{Total amount} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} + \text{Mother's salary} = 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 45000 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk, and then calculate the total time for the entire walk.

First, let's find Grandma's speed on the beach. Since she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes, her speed on the beach is:
\[ \text{Speed on the beach} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = 0.05 \text{ miles per minute} \]

Since she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is:
\[ \text{Speed on the sidewalk} = 2 \times 0.05 \text{ miles per minute} = 0.1 \text{ miles per minute} \]

Next, we calculate the time spent on the sidewalk. Since she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk at a speed of 0.1 miles per minute, the time spent on the sidewalk is:
\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{0.1 \text{ miles per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we know the total time spent on the beach and the sidewalk:
\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes (beach)} + 10 \text{ minutes (sidewalk)} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Since the entire walk is 3 miles and she has already covered 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk, the total time to complete the 3-mile walk is:
\[ \text{Total time} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Jane has saved so far. She has been saving $4 per week for 8 weeks.

\[ \text{Total saved so far} = 4 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 8 \, \text{weeks} = 32 \, \text{dollars} \]

Jane's goal is to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she has already saved from her goal:

\[ \text{Amount still needed} = 60 \, \text{dollars} - 32 \, \text{dollars} = 28 \, \text{dollars} \]

Since Jane saves $4 each week, we can determine how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28 by dividing the amount still needed by her weekly savings:

\[ \text{Number of weeks needed} = \frac{28 \, \text{dollars}}{4 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 7 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60."

"First, let's determine how many marbles Bob currently has. We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen is equal to 24 marbles, we can set up the following equation to find out how many marbles Bob currently has:

\[ \text{Current number of marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

Subtracting 24 from both sides of the equation gives:

\[ \text{Current number of marbles} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles. If Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, the number of marbles he will have is:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 26 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the second mug of water such that after Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle, the water in the bottle is at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote the temperature of the second mug of water as \( T \) degrees.

First, we calculate the temperature of the water left in the 33-degree mug after pouring 4 ounces:
- The initial temperature of the 33-degree mug is 33 degrees.
- After pouring 4 ounces, the remaining temperature of the water in the mug is still 33 degrees (since the temperature of the water doesn't change by pouring).

Next, we calculate the temperature of the water left in the second mug after pouring 1 ounce:
- The initial temperature of the second mug is \( T \) degrees.
- After pouring 1 ounce, the remaining temperature of the water in the mug is still \( T \) degrees (since the temperature of the water doesn't change by pouring).

Now, we need to find the minimum temperature \( T \) such that the average temperature of the water in the bottle is at least 40 degrees. The total volume of water in the bottle is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug).

The average temperature of the water in the bottle is given by:
\[
\text{Average temperature} = \frac{\text{Total temperature of water in the bottle}}{\text{Total volume of water in the bottle}}
\]

The total temperature of the water in the bottle is:
\[
4 \times 33 + 1 \times T = 132 + T
\]

The average temperature should be at least 40 degrees:
\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

To find the minimum temperature \( T \), we solve the inequality:
\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]
\[
T \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the second mug of water is 68 degrees.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{68}

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of animals added to the farm over the course of three weeks and then add this to the initial number of animals.

First, let's determine the number of days in three weeks:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cows added by Milkie Cows Limited over these 21 days:
\[ 20 \text{ cows/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 420 \text{ cows} \]

Then, we calculate the number of chickens added by Broilers Limited over these 21 days:
\[ 10 \text{ chickens/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ chickens} \]

Now, we add the initial number of animals to the number of animals added:
\[ \text{Initial number of cows} + \text{Cows added} = 50 + 420 = 470 \text{ cows} \]
\[ \text{Initial number of chickens} + \text{Chickens added} = 20 + 210 = 230 \text{ chickens} \]

Finally, we find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks:
\[ 470 \text{ cows} + 230 \text{ chickens} = 700 \text{ animals} \]

Thus, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is:
\[ \boxed{700} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount. Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs cost:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Russell orders 4 packs, he qualifies for a 10% discount. The discount amount is:
\[ 40 \times 0.10 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Russell receives 4 packs of bagels, and each pack contains 9 bagels. Therefore, the total number of bagels is:
\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

To find the cost per bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels:
\[ \frac{36}{36} = 1 \text{ dollar per bagel} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. According to the question, Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. This can be calculated as follows:

\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 1 less than 3 is 2 scoops, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. The question states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. This can be calculated as follows:

\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \]

So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 18 scoops is 9 times 2 scoops (because 18 = 2 * 9), we need 9 times the number of potatoes required for 2 scoops. Therefore, the number of potatoes required for 18 scoops is:

\[ 9 \times 3 = 27 \]

So, the number of potatoes Gomer ate is:

\[
\boxed{27}

"To determine the total number of eggs Chester will consume over 60 days, we can break the problem into two parts: the first 30 days and the next 30 days.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

For the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day:
\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of eggs consumed over 60 days:
\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

To find out how many dozens of eggs this is, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs):
\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozen} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus initially.

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can represent the number of men as \(5x\) and the number of women as \(9x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of passengers is given as 84. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[5x + 9x = 84\]
\[14x = 84\]
\[x = 6\]

Now, we can find the number of men and women:
- Number of men = \(5x = 5 \times 6 = 30\)
- Number of women = \(9x = 9 \times 6 = 54\)

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:

"To determine how many sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to first calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day and then extend that to 3 days.

First, let's find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold per day from the bouquet sales. Each bouquet costs $8 and contains 12 sunflowers. Therefore, the number of sunflowers sold per bouquet is 12. If Faraday earned $56 from the bouquets per day, we can calculate the number of bouquets sold per day as follows:
\[
\text{Number of bouquets sold per day} = \frac{56}{8} = 7
\]
Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold per day from the bouquets is:
\[
\text{Number of sunflowers sold per day from bouquets} = 7 \times 12 = 84
\]

Next, we need to find out how many sunflowers were sold per day from the sunflower sales. Each sunflower costs $2, and Faraday earned $26 from the sunflowers per day. Therefore, the number of sunflowers sold per day is:
\[
\text{Number of sunflowers sold per day} = \frac{26}{2} = 13
\]

Now, we can find the total number of sunflowers sold per day by adding the sunflowers sold from the bouquets and the sunflowers sold individually:
\[
\text{Total number of sunflowers sold per day} = 84 + 13 = 97
\]

Finally, to find the total number of sunflowers sold over 3 days, we multiply the number of sunflowers sold per day by 3:
\[
\text{Total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days} = 97 \times 3 = 291
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{291}

"First, let's determine how many rocks Adam can buy with his $100. Each rock costs $5, so:

\[ \text{Number of rocks} = \frac{\$100}{\$5/\text{rock}} = 20 \text{ rocks} \]

Adam then sells 60% of his inventory. So, the number of rocks he sells is:

\[ \text{Number of rocks sold} = 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ rocks} \]

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling these rocks. Each rock is sold for $7, so:

\[ \text{Revenue} = 12 \text{ rocks} \times \$7/\text{rock} = \$84 \]

Adam initially invested $100, and he received $84 from selling the rocks. Therefore, the loss is:

\[ \text{Loss} = \$100 - \$84 = \$16 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of days Lauren will need to complete the project, we need to calculate the time required for each type of picture scene separately and then sum these times.

1. **Large-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 5 large-sized scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 45 large-sized scenes.
   - The number of days required for large-sized scenes is calculated as:
     \[
     \frac{45 \text{ scenes}}{5 \text{ scenes/day}} = 9 \text{ days}
     \]

2. **Medium-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 36 medium-sized scenes.
   - The number of days required for medium-sized scenes is calculated as:
     \[
     \frac{36 \text{ scenes}}{6 \text{ scenes/day}} = 6 \text{ days}
     \]

3. **Small-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 7 small-sized scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 49 small-sized scenes.
   - The number of days required for small-sized scenes is calculated as:
     \[

May has 31 days. Each fish needs $1 worth of food per day, and Jen has 3 fish. Therefore, the daily cost of food for all the fish is:
\[ 3 \text{ fish} \times \$1 \text{ per fish per day} = \$3 \text{ per day} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the month of May:
\[ \$3 \text{ per day} \times 31 \text{ days} = \$93 \]

So, Jen spends \(\boxed{93}\) dollars on food in the month of May."
"Patricia originally had 30 roses. After giving 24 roses to her mother, she had 30 - 24 = 6 roses left. Then she bought 15 more roses, so she now has 6 + 15 = 21 roses.

"To find the average speed, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

First, we calculate the total distance traveled:

\[ \text{Total Distance} = 110 \text{ miles} + 140 \text{ miles} = 250 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the total time taken:

\[ \text{Total Time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can find the average speed:

\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{250 \text{ miles}}{5 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the average speed Sid was traveling is:

\[ 50 \text{ miles per hour} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability of both tickets being winners.

First, let's denote the probability of the first ticket being a winner as \( P(W_1) \). According to the problem, \( P(W_1) = 20\% = 0.20 \).

The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of the second ticket being a winner, \( P(W_2) \), is:
\[ P(W_2) = 3 \times P(W_1) = 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60 \]

Since the events are independent, the probability that both tickets are winners is the product of their individual probabilities:
\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = P(W_1) \times P(W_2) = 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

Thus, the probability that both tickets are winners is:
\[ \boxed{12\%} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine how many seashells Carlos collected:**
   - Jim collected 27 seashells.
   - Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos.
   - Therefore, Carlos collected \(27 - 5 = 22\) seashells.

2. **Determine how many seashells Carrey collected:**
   - Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey.
   - Therefore, Carrey collected \(22 / 2 = 11\) seashells.

3. **Calculate the total number of seashells collected:**
   - Carlos collected 22 seashells.
   - Jim collected 27 seashells.
   - Carrey collected 11 seashells.
   - Total seashells = \(22 + 27 + 11 = 60\) seashells.

4. **Divide the total seashells equally among the three people:**
   - Total seashells = 60.
   - Number of people = 3.
   - Each person gets \(60 / 3 = 20\) seashells.

"To calculate the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to consider the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the number he eats on weekends.

Mason eats 4 carrots each weekday. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is:
\[ 4 \text{ carrots/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ carrots} \]

On weekends, Mason eats 5 carrots each day. There are 2 days in the weekend, so the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is:
\[ 5 \text{ carrots/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ carrots} \]

Adding the carrots eaten on weekdays and the weekend gives us the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week:
\[ 20 \text{ carrots} + 10 \text{ carrots} = 30 \text{ carrots} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 30 \]"
"To find the total time of the cassette, we first need to calculate the duration of the second song. The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. 

To find the additional time for the second song, we calculate 60% of 5 minutes:
\[ 0.60 \times 5 = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the second song is:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the durations of both songs to find the total time of the cassette:
\[ 5 + 8 = 13 \text{ minutes} \]

The total time of the cassette is:

"First, let's determine the selling price of one mobile device. Linus buys each mobile device for $20 and sells it for twice the amount of the original price. Therefore, the selling price of one mobile device is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the profit from selling one mobile device. The profit per device is the selling price minus the buying price:
\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many mobile devices Linus bought in total. He bought 2 devices last Monday and 4 devices last Tuesday, so the total number of devices is:
\[ 2 + 4 = 6 \text{ devices} \]

The total profit from selling all the devices is the profit per device multiplied by the total number of devices:
\[ 20 \times 6 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 120 \]"
"First, let's determine the height of Isabel's brother, Ned. Since Isabel is 7 feet tall and Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, we can calculate Ned's height as follows:

\[ \text{Ned's height} = \text{Isabel's height} - 2 = 7 - 2 = 5 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know that Carl is one foot taller than Ned. Therefore, we can calculate Carl's height as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's height} = \text{Ned's height} + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ feet} \]

Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. Therefore, we can calculate the length of Carl's cane as follows:

\[ \text{Length of Carl's cane} = \frac{\text{Carl's height}}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ feet} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many more bottles of juices Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bottles needed to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs for 2300 people.
2. Determine how many more bottles are needed by subtracting the current production capacity from the total number of bottles required.

First, let's calculate the total number of bottles needed:
- Each person's daily energy demand is covered by 20% of a bottle.
- Therefore, to cover 100% of a person's daily energy demand, we need 5 bottles (since 100% / 20% = 5).

For 2300 people, the total number of bottles needed is:
\[ 2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to find out how many more bottles are required:
- Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day.
- The additional bottles needed are:
\[ 11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of babies wearing bows and then find the percentage of those babies that are wearing purple.

First, let's calculate the number of babies dressed in purple and blue:
- Total babies = 8
- Babies dressed in purple = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- Babies dressed in blue = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we calculate the number of babies wearing bows:
- Babies wearing bows among the blue-wearers = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 2 = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.6667 \) (rounding to the nearest whole number, 1 baby)
- Babies wearing bows among the purple-wearers = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is:
- Total babies wearing bows = 1 (blue-wearers) + 2 (purple-wearers) = 3

Now, we need to find the percentage of babies wearing bows that are wearing purple:
- Percentage = \( \frac{\text{Number of purple-wearers wearing bows}}{\text{Total number of babies wearing bows}} \times 100 \)
- Percentage = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 100 \approx 66.67\% \)

Therefore, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is approximately 66.67%."
"To find out how many reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and on Thursday and Friday, from the total number of reports received last week.

Total reports received last week = 5168
Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

Reports received on Wednesday = Total reports - (Reports on Monday and Tuesday + Reports on Thursday and Friday)

Let's calculate it:

Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - (1907 + 2136)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043
Reports received on Wednesday = 1125

So, the number of reports received on Wednesday is 1125."
"First, let's determine how much land Abraham sold in each transaction.

1. Abraham initially owned 80 square meters of land.
2. He sold half of his land for $50. Half of 80 square meters is 40 square meters. So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.
3. After a month, he sold another 1/4 of his land. One quarter of 80 square meters is 20 square meters. So, he sold 20 square meters for $30.
4. The remaining land is the total land minus the land sold in the first and second transactions. The land sold in the first transaction was 40 square meters, and the land sold in the second transaction was 20 square meters. Therefore, the remaining land is \(80 - 40 - 20 = 20\) square meters.

Now, let's calculate the total money Abraham earned from selling the land.

- From the first transaction, he earned $50.
- From the second transaction, he earned $30.
- From the remaining land, he sold 20 square meters at $3 per square meter. So, he earned \(20 \times 3 = 60\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together, the total money Abraham earned is:
\[50 + 30 + 60 = 140\]

"To determine how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Daily Mask Usage:**
   - Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out.
   - He goes out three times a day.
   - Therefore, the number of masks used per day is:
     \[
     2 \text{ masks/time} \times 3 \text{ times/day} = 6 \text{ masks/day}
     \]

2. **Usage Over 2 Days:**
   - To find out how many masks he uses in 2 days, we multiply the daily usage by 2:
     \[
     6 \text{ masks/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ masks}
     \]

Thus, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days."
"First, let's determine the total number of eggs Cole hid in the yard. Since a dozen is equal to 12, 3 dozen eggs is calculated as follows:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we'll calculate how many eggs each person found:
- Lamar found 5 eggs.
- Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ eggs} \]
- Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so:
\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ eggs} \]
- Mei found half as many as Charlie, so:
\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we'll sum the number of eggs found by Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei:
\[ 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 \text{ eggs} \]

Finally, to find out how many eggs are still hidden in the yard, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden:
\[ 36 - 27 = 9 \text{ eggs} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of apartments in the first two complexes:
- Each of the first two complexes has 200 apartments.
- Therefore, the total number of apartments in the first two complexes is \(200 + 200 = 400\) apartments.

Next, we calculate the number of apartments in the third complex, which is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two complexes:
- The combined total of the first two complexes is 400 apartments.
- 60% of 400 apartments is \(0.60 \times 400 = 240\) apartments.
- Therefore, the third complex has \(400 + 240 = 640\) apartments.

Now, we calculate the total number of apartments across all three complexes:
- The total number of apartments is \(400 + 640 = 1040\) apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each complex. Therefore, the total number of collections per week is:
- \(1040 \text{ apartments} \times 3 \text{ collections per week} = 3120 \text{ collections per week}\).

John gets paid $0.40 per collection. Therefore, his weekly earnings are:

"Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters. According to the problem, the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the blue rope \( B \) can be expressed as:
\[ B = Y - 7 \]

The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope \( R \) can be expressed as:
\[ R = 4B = 4(Y - 7) \]

The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write the equation:
\[ R + B + Y = 37 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Y \) into the combined length equation, we get:
\[ 4(Y - 7) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]

Adding 35 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 6Y = 72 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope \( Y \) is 12 centimeters, we can find the length of the blue rope \( B \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \]

And the length of the red rope \( R \):
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine how much money Rissa and Ronnie were given initially:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = $15\).

2. **Let \(x\) be the amount of money each of them gave to their sister.**
   - After giving \(x\) dollars to their sister, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original amount.
   - Therefore, \(15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15\).

3. **Solve for \(x\):**
   \[
   15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15

"Let's break down the information given:

- The mural is divided into four parts: red, white, purple, and yellow.
- There are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint.
- Half the mural is yellow.
- The total amount of paint used is 12 pints.

Since the mural is divided into four parts and half is yellow, the other half is divided into three parts (red, white, and purple). This means that the red, white, and purple parts together make up half of the mural.

Let's denote the amount of red paint as \( R \), white paint as \( W \), and purple paint as \( P \). According to the problem, \( R = W = P \).

The total amount of paint used is the sum of the red, white, purple, and yellow parts:
\[ R + W + P + Y = 12 \]
Since \( R = W = P \), we can substitute \( W \) and \( P \) with \( R \):
\[ R + R + R + Y = 12 \]
\[ 3R + Y = 12 \]

We also know that the yellow part is half of the mural:
\[ Y = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \]
Substituting \( Y = 6 \) into the equation:
\[ 3R + 6 = 12 \]
\[ 3R = 6 \]
\[ R = 2 \]

Therefore, the number of pints of red paint used is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. Each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is:
\[ 20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:
\[ 4 \times 240 = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so the area of the living room is:
\[ 5 \times 240 = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:
\[ 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

Thus, the total area of the house is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cloud puffs Alice counts each day from Monday to Friday, given that each day she sees double the number of clouds as the previous day.

- **Monday**: 3 puffs
- **Tuesday**: \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs
- **Wednesday**: \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs
- **Thursday**: \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs
- **Friday**: \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs

Now, we sum the puffs counted each day to find the total number of puffs counted over the week:

\[

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of pods in the special size box. The original box contains 100 pods and costs $12. The special size box has 20% more pods than the original box.

First, calculate 20% of 100 pods:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \]

So, the special size box contains:
\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

Next, we need to find out how many cycles can be run with $1 if each cycle uses 1 pod. Since the special size box costs $12 and contains 120 pods, we can calculate the number of cycles that can be run with $1 by dividing the number of pods by the cost per pod:
\[ \text{Number of cycles} = \frac{120 \text{ pods}}{12 \text{ dollars}} = 10 \text{ cycles per dollar} \]

Therefore, with $1, you can run:
\[ 1 \text{ cycle} \]

"First, we determine the number of 20 dollar bills Thomas initially withdraws from the bank. Since he withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills}
\]

Next, Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home. Therefore, the number of bills he has left is:

\[
50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills}
\]

Thomas then uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. The number of bills he uses is:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

So, the number of bills he has left is:

\[
40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

Thomas then triples his money. Since each bill is worth $20, the total amount of money he has is:

\[
20 \times 20 \times 3 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, Thomas converts all his money to 5 dollar bills. The number of 5 dollar bills he has is:

\[
\frac{1200}{5} = 240 \text{ bills}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **First Half Goals:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half Goals:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Since Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, in the second half, Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half. Since Team B scored 8 goals in the second half, Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals in the second half.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Team A's total goals: \(4 \text{ (first half)} + 2 \text{ (second half)} = 6\).
   - Team B's total goals: \(2 \text{ (first half)} + 8 \text{ (second half)} = 10\).

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chalk the teacher has left and then calculate how many days he can continue using the chalk at a rate of 20% per day before he has to recycle it.

First, let's determine the amount of chalk used on Monday. The teacher used 45% of the chalk by the end of the day. Since the chalk started as a 5-inch piece, the amount of chalk used on Monday is:
\[ 5 \times 0.45 = 2.25 \text{ inches} \]
This means the teacher has:
\[ 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \text{ inches} \]
of chalk left at the end of Monday.

Next, we need to determine how much chalk the teacher will use each day if he uses only 20% of the chalk. The amount of chalk used each day is:
\[ 2.75 \times 0.20 = 0.55 \text{ inches} \]
We need to find out how many days the teacher can continue using this amount of chalk before he has to recycle it. Since the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk, he will recycle the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. We need to find the number of days \( n \) such that:
\[ 2.75 - 0.55n \geq 2 \]
Solving for \( n \):
\[ 2.75 - 2 \geq 0.55n \]
\[ 0.75 \geq 0.55n \]
\[ n \leq \frac{0.75}{0.55} \]
\[ n \leq \frac{75}{55} \]
\[ n \leq \frac{15}{11} \]
\[ n \leq 1.3636 \]
Since \( n \) must be a whole number, the teacher can use the chalk for 1 more day before he has to recycle it.

Therefore, the number of days the teacher has before he has to recycle this piece is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of girls on varsity. Since one-third of the girls are on varsity, we calculate:

Now, we can find the total number of students on varsity by adding the number of girls and boys on varsity:
\[ \text{Total number of students on varsity} = 4 + 3 = 7 \]

To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students in the class:
\[ \text{Total number of students} = 12 \text{ boys} + 12 \text{ girls} = 24 \]
\[ \text{Number of students not on varsity} = 24 - 7 = 17 \]

The final numerical answer is:

Next, we need to calculate how many face masks Johnny bought. The problem states that Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike. We can express this mathematically as:

\[ \text{Number of masks Johnny bought} = 3 \times (\text{Number of masks Mike bought}) + 2 \]

Substituting the number of masks Mike bought (which is 5) into the equation:

\[ \text{Number of masks Johnny bought} = 3 \times 5 + 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of masks Johnny bought} = 15 + 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of masks Johnny bought} = 17 \]

"First, let's determine the number of teeth the dentist caps. According to the problem, the dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills. Since the dentist drills 4 teeth, the number of teeth capped is:

\[ 4 + 7 = 11 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of teeth that the dentist fixes. This is the sum of the teeth drilled and the teeth capped:

\[ 4 + 11 = 15 \]

Now, we need to find what percentage of James' teeth (which is 30) are fixed. The percentage is calculated by the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 50 \]"
"First, we need to determine the total cost of the milk that Mr. Marcellus initially purchased. The company sold 4000 gallons of milk at $3.5 per gallon. Therefore, the total cost is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 4000 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = \$14000
\]

Next, we need to find out how much of this milk had passed the expiry date. Mr. Marcellus returned 2/5 of the milk. So, we calculate the amount of milk that was returned:

\[
\text{Amount of milk returned} = \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \text{ gallons} = \frac{2 \times 4000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \text{ gallons}
\]

Since the milk was sold at $3.5 per gallon, the refund amount for the returned milk is:

\[
\text{Refund amount} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = 1600 \times 3.5 = 1600 \times \left(3 + 0.5\right) = 1600 \times 3 + 1600 \times 0.5 = 4800 + 800 = 5600
\]

Thus, the amount Mr. Marcellus received in refunds is:

\[
\boxed{5600}

"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now we have two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

We can substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5(C + 7)) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5(C + 7)}{3} \]
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old. To verify, we can find Wendy's current age using the first equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) = 5(20 + 7) = 5 \times 27 = 135 \]

In 25 years, Colin will be \( 20 + 25 = 45 \) years old, and Wendy will be \( 135 + 25 = 160 \) years old. Checking the second condition:
\[ 45 = \frac{1}{3} \times 135 = 45 \]

The conditions are satisfied, so Colin's current age is indeed 20 years old. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many books Bob can buy with the total amount of $27,000. We know that he can buy 100 books for $500. To find out how many sets of 100 books he can buy, we divide the total amount by $500:

\[
\frac{27000}{500} = 54
\]

This means Bob can buy 54 sets of 100 books. To find the total number of books he can buy, we multiply the number of sets by 100:

\[
54 \times 100 = 5400
\]

Bob has $27,000 to distribute among 3 schools. To find out how many books he can buy per school, we divide the total number of books by the number of schools:

\[
\frac{5400}{3} = 1800
\]

So, the number of books Bob can buy per school is 1800. The final numerical answer is:

\[

So, Newton brought home 6 apples."
"First, we need to determine how many 50 kg bags are in 850 kg of coal. We do this by dividing the total weight of the coal by the weight of each bag:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{850 \text{ kg}}{50 \text{ kg/bag}} = 17 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of bags by the cost per bag:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 17 \text{ bags} \times 18 \text{ dollars/bag} = 306 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed by Kate's friends. Each of the 6 friends eats 6 slices of cheese pizza. Therefore, the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed is:

\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices} \]

Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, the number of cheese pizzas needed is:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed by Kate's friends. Each of the 6 friends eats 4 slices of pepperoni pizza. Therefore, the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed is:

\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Since the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, the number of pepperoni pizzas needed is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Since Kate needs to buy enough cheese pizzas and pepperoni pizzas to meet the consumption of her friends, and both require 3 pizzas, she needs to buy:

\[ 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to account for the rate at which Jay builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which means he builds 20/60 = 1/3 of a snowball per minute.

Every 15 minutes, 2 snowballs melt. So, in 15 minutes, 1/3 * 15 = 5/3 snowballs are built and 2 are melted, resulting in a net gain of 5/3 - 2 = 1/3 of a snowball.

To find out how many snowballs Jay will have after 15 minutes, we calculate:
- Snowballs built in 15 minutes: 1/3 * 15 = 5
- Snowballs melted in 15 minutes: 2
- Net gain in 15 minutes: 5 - 2 = 3

So, after 15 minutes, Jay will have 3 snowballs. We need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are required to reach 60 snowballs.

Let's calculate the number of 15-minute intervals needed to reach 60 snowballs:
- After 15 minutes, he has 3 snowballs.
- After 30 minutes, he has 3 + 3 = 6 snowballs.
- After 45 minutes, he has 6 + 3 = 9 snowballs.
- After 60 minutes (1 hour), he has 9 + 3 = 12 snowballs.
- After 75 minutes, he has 12 + 3 = 15 snowballs.
- After 90 minutes, he has 15 + 3 = 18 snowballs.
- After 105 minutes, he has 18 + 3 = 21 snowballs.
- After 120 minutes (2 hours), he has 21 + 3 = 24 snowballs.
- After 135 minutes, he has 24 + 3 = 27 snowballs.
- After 150 minutes, he has 27 + 3 = 30 snowballs.
- After 165 minutes, he has 30 + 3 = 33 snowballs.
- After 180 minutes (3 hours), he has 33 + 3 = 36 snowballs.
- After 195 minutes, he has 36 + 3 = 39 snowballs.
- After 210 minutes, he has 39 + 3 = 42 snowballs.
- After 225 minutes, he has 42 + 3 = 45 snowballs.
- After 240 minutes (4 hours), he has 45 + 3 = 48 snowballs.
- After 255 minutes, he has 48 + 3 = 51 snowballs.
- After 270 minutes, he has 51 + 3 = 54 snowballs.
- After 285 minutes, he has 54 + 3 = 57 snowballs.
- After 300 minutes (5 hours), he has 57 + 3 = 60 snowballs.

Therefore, it will take Jay 300 minutes to have 60 snowballs.

The final numerical answer is 300."
"If John is currently 28 years old and he is twice as old as Jim, we can set up the following equation to find Jim's current age:

Let \( J \) be Jim's current age. According to the problem, John's age is twice Jim's age, so:

\[ 28 = 2J \]

To find \( J \), we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ J = \frac{28}{2} = 14 \]

So, Jim is currently 14 years old.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many slices each person ate:

- Doxa ate 1 slice.
- Her sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, so her sister ate \(1 + 1 = 2\) slices.
- Her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister, so her brother ate \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices.

Now, let's add up the slices eaten by Doxa, her sister, and her brother:

- Doxa: 1 slice
- Sister: 2 slices
- Brother: 3 slices

Total slices eaten = \(1 + 2 + 3 = 6\)

"Let's break down the problem day by day to find out how many bandages were used and how many were left at the end of each day.

**First Day:**
- They used 38 bandages.
- They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
- Total bandages at the end of the first day: \(38 - 38 + 50 = 50\).

**Second Day:**
- They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
- Total bandages at the end of the second day: \(50 - 28 = 22\).

**Third Day:**
- They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered \(2 \times 50 = 100\) bandages.
- They used half a pack, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.
- Total bandages at the end of the third day: \(22 - 25 + 100 = 97\).

According to the problem, they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means there was a discrepancy in the calculation. Let's recheck the bandages used and ordered on the third day:

- They ordered 100 bandages and used 25, so they should have \(100 - 25 = 75\) bandages left after ordering.
- They had 78 bandages left, which means they must have had \(78 - 75 = 3\) bandages at the start of the third day.

Now, let's calculate the total bandages they started with on the first day:

- At the end of the first day, they had 50 bandages.
- At the end of the second day, they had 22 bandages.
- At the start of the third day, they had 3 bandages.

So, the total number of bandages they started with on the first day is \(50 + 22 + 3 = 75\).

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut. May's hair was initially 10 inches long and ended at 8 inches. Therefore, the length of hair cut is:

\[ 10 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 2 \text{ inches} \]

The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, so for 2 inches, the cost is:

\[ 2 \text{ inches} \times 30 \text{ dollars per inch} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we add the cost of the hair color, which is $40. Therefore, the total cost for the haircut and color is:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} + 40 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to consider her regular pay and the additional attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her regular pay:
- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- She works 6 days a week.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

So, her daily pay is \(7.5 \times 1.5 = 11.25\) dollars.
Her weekly pay is \(11.25 \times 6 = 67.5\) dollars.

Since there are exactly 4 weeks in April, her total pay for April is \(67.5 \times 4 = 270\) dollars.

Additionally, since she did not incur any absences, she receives an additional $10 for each week, which totals \(10 \times 4 = 40\) dollars.

Therefore, her total earnings for April are \(270 + 40 = 310\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
310"
"To calculate how much money Jason earned, we need to multiply the number of times he performed each task by the amount he earns for each task and then sum these amounts.

$3.00 + $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 = $9.00

So, Jason earned a total of $9.00 in the two week period."
"First, let's determine the amount of blood in one shark. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and each whale has 40 gallons of blood, we can calculate the blood volume in one shark as follows:

\[ \text{Blood volume in one shark} = 3 \times 40 \text{ gallons} = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have. Since each shark has 120 gallons of blood, ten sharks will have:

\[ \text{Total blood volume for ten sharks} = 10 \times 120 \text{ gallons} = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:

3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people.

Now, we sum these numbers to find the total number of people who entered the restaurant:

\[
50 \text{ (morning)} + 40 \text{ (10:00)} + 80 \text{ (twice 10:00)} + 150 \text{ (evening)} = 320

The final numerical answer is 75."
"First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total of $600, so the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find the cost per bottle of cognac. The cognac costs 50% more per bottle than the scotch, so the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 \times 1.5 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

The total cost for the cognac is:

\[ \text{Total cost of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

"To determine the total number of trees Mr. Julius planted, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps and calculate the number of trees planted each day.

**First Day:**
- Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
- He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which means he planted \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

So, the total number of trees planted on the first day is:
\[ 20 \text{ (White Oak)} + 40 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 60 \text{ trees} \]

**Second Day:**
- Mr. Julius planted 10 more White Oak trees than he did on the first day, which means he planted \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
- He planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than he did on the first day. The number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the first day was 40, so \(\frac{1}{4}\) more than 40 is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]
Thus, the number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is:
\[ 40 + 10 = 50 \]

So, the total number of trees planted on the second day is:
\[ 30 \text{ (White Oak)} + 50 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 80 \text{ trees} \]

**Total Number of Trees Planted:**

"First, let's calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had:

- Two eyeshadow palettes, each with four colors: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors.
- Three makeup sets, each with six colors: \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors.

So, the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had is:
\[8 + 18 = 26\]

Her sister steals one of the eyeshadow palettes, which contains 4 colors. Therefore, Amy loses 4 colors:
\[26 - 4 = 22\]

Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since each makeup set has 6 colors, half of the colors from one makeup set is:
\[6 / 2 = 3\]

So, Amy uses up 3 colors from one makeup set. Therefore, the number of colors left after using up half of one makeup set is:
\[22 - 3 = 19\]

The final number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is:

"First, let's determine Mattison's height in inches:
\[ \text{Mattison's height} = 60 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we calculate the height of Mattison's two-story house:
\[ \text{Height of the house} = 7 \times \text{Mattison's height} = 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison is:
\[ \text{Height of the first floor} = 3 \times \text{Mattison's height} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Since the house is two stories, the height of the second floor is the total height of the house minus the height of the first floor:
\[ \text{Height of the second floor} = \text{Height of the house} - \text{Height of the first floor} = 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height of the roof from the floor of the second floor is the height of the second floor:

"To determine Trinity's profit, we first need to calculate the selling price of the magazines and then subtract the cost price from it.

Trinity bought the magazines at $72 each. She sells them at 11/8 of the price she bought them. Therefore, the selling price is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8} \]

Let's perform the multiplication:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times 1.375 = 99 \]

So, the selling price of each magazine is $99.

Next, we calculate the profit by subtracting the cost price from the selling price:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price} \]
\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 = 27 \]

Therefore, Trinity's profit is:

\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"To determine the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed per day for each setting and then sum these amounts over the specified periods.

1. **Low setting:**
   - Removes 1 liter of water per day.
   - Brian ran the dehumidifier on the low setting for 3 days.
   - Water removed on low setting: \( 1 \text{ liter/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 3 \text{ liters} \).

2. **Medium setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the low setting.
   - Therefore, the medium setting removes \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran the dehumidifier on the medium setting for 3 days.
   - Water removed on medium setting: \( 2 \text{ liters/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ liters} \).

3. **High setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting.
   - Therefore, the high setting removes \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran the dehumidifier on the high setting for 5 days.
   - Water removed on high setting: \( 4 \text{ liters/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ liters} \).

Now, we sum the water removed from all settings:
\[ 3 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} + 20 \text{ liters} = 29 \text{ liters} \]

Thus, the total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in his basement is \(\boxed{29}\) liters."
"First, we need to calculate the total number of balloons Jolene and her friends initially had. They filled 10 packs with 30 balloons each. So, the total number of balloons is:

\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 30 \text{ balloons per pack} = 300 \text{ balloons} \]

By the end of the afternoon, 12 balloons were left. To find out how many balloons were thrown, we subtract the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons:

\[ 300 \text{ balloons} - 12 \text{ balloons} = 288 \text{ balloons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 288 \]"
"First, let's determine the amount of the second medicine Saanvi had to combine with the first medicine. Since she combined 14 mL of the first medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine, the amount of the second medicine is:

\[ 3 \times 14 \, \text{mL} = 42 \, \text{mL} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of medicine in one dose by adding the amounts of the first and second medicines:

\[ 14 \, \text{mL} + 42 \, \text{mL} = 56 \, \text{mL} \]

Now, to find out how many mL of medicine would be in 8 doses, we multiply the amount of medicine in one dose by 8:

\[ 56 \, \text{mL} \times 8 = 448 \, \text{mL} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 448 \]"
"First, let's determine the capacity of Ali's class. According to the information provided, Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students.

Next, we need to find the capacity of John's classes. Since each of John's classes has \( \frac{1}{8} \) the capacity of Ali's class, we calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:
\[
\text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{120}{8} = 15 \text{ students}
\]

John has two classes, so the total capacity of John's classes is:
\[
\text{Total capacity of John's classes} = 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ students}
\]

Now, we add the capacities of Ali's class and John's classes to find the combined capacity of both schools:
\[
\text{Combined capacity} = 120 + 30 = 150 \text{ students}
\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
150

"First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen will owe his sister, including the 2% interest.

The interest is 2% of $300, which is:
\[ 0.02 \times 300 = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen will owe is:
\[ 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Stephen will pay over the 11 months. He will pay $25 per month, so over 11 months, he will pay:
\[ 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

The remaining amount, which will be paid in the twelfth month, is the total amount he owes minus the amount he has already paid:
\[ 306 - 275 = 31 \]

Therefore, the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is:
\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"To determine how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of diaper changes per day for both children.
   - Each child requires 5 diaper changes per day.
   - Jordan has 2 children.
   - Therefore, the total number of diaper changes per day is \( 5 \text{ changes/child} \times 2 \text{ children} = 10 \text{ changes/day} \).

2. Determine how many diaper changes Jordan's wife handles.
   - Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers.
   - Therefore, the number of diaper changes Jordan's wife handles is \( \frac{10 \text{ changes/day}}{2} = 5 \text{ changes/day} \).

3. Calculate the number of diaper changes Jordan handles.
   - Since Jordan's wife handles 5 diaper changes per day, Jordan must handle the remaining diaper changes.
   - Therefore, the number of diaper changes Jordan handles is \( 10 \text{ changes/day} - 5 \text{ changes/day} = 5 \text{ changes/day} \).

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of passengers on the bus**: 20 people.
2. **Number of passengers who entered at the first stop**: 40 people.
3. **Total number of passengers after the first stop**: \(20 + 40 = 60\) people.
4. **Number of passengers who entered at the second stop**: \(\frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30\) people.
5. **Total number of passengers after the second stop**: \(60 + 30 = 90\) people.
6. **Number of passengers who entered at the third stop**: The number of passengers doubled, so \(90 \times 2 = 180\) people.
7. **Total number of passengers after the third stop**: \(90 + 180 = 270\) people.

Since the bus has a capacity of 200 people, the number of passengers who need to be removed to fill the remaining spaces is:
\[270 - 200 = 70\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[70\]"
"To determine how much Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to break down the problem into steps.

1. **Calculate the cost of one visit after 5 years:**
   - The original cost of one visit is $2.
   - The cost increased by 150%, which means the new cost is the original cost plus 150% of the original cost.
   - 150% of $2 is \(0.15 \times 2 = 0.30\).
   - Therefore, the new cost is \(2 + 0.30 = 2.30\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total cost for the first 5 years:**
   - Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.
   - The cost per visit is $2.30.
   - The total cost for one year is \(3 \times 2.30 = 6.90\) dollars.
   - For 5 years, the total cost is \(5 \times 6.90 = 34.50\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total cost for the next 3 years:**
   - The cost per visit remains $2.30.
   - The total cost for one year is still $6.90.
   - For 3 years, the total cost is \(3 \times 6.90 = 20.70\) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total cost for all visits:**
   - The total cost for the first 5 years is $34.50.
   - The total cost for the next 3 years is $20.70.
   - The total cost for all visits is \(34.50 + 20.70 = 55.20\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is \(\boxed{55.20}\)."

"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, so the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is given as 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find the value of \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece:
\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Thus, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 32 \]"
"To determine how much of Aiden's secret steakhouse seasoning he will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many pounds of meat are needed to make 80 meatballs.
2. Calculate the amount of seasoning needed based on the amount of meat.

First, we know that Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat. To find out how many pounds of meat are needed for 80 meatballs, we divide the number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound:

\[
\text{Pounds of meat needed} = \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds of meat}
\]

Next, we know that Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat. Therefore, for 5 pounds of meat, the amount of seasoning needed is:

\[
\text{Seasoning needed} = 5 \text{ pounds of meat} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons of seasoning}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly made as \( C \) and the number of brownies as \( B \). According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, which can be expressed as:
\[ B = 3C - 2 \]

Carly's class has 5 people, and each person gets 2 treats. Therefore, the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

The total number of treats is the sum of the cupcakes and brownies:
\[ C + B = 10 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4C = 12 \]
\[ C = 3 \]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as \( K \).

According to the problem, Shelley has 8 paintings more than Kim, so Shelley has \( K + 8 \) paintings.

Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, and we know Samantha has 27 paintings. Therefore, we can write the equation for the number of paintings Samantha has as:
\[ K + 8 - 12 = 27 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ K - 4 = 27 \]

To find \( K \), we add 4 to both sides of the equation:
\[ K = 27 + 4 \]
\[ K = 31 \]

So, Kim has 31 paintings. The final numerical answer is:

"To find the final price of the toy after the changes in price, we need to follow the steps of the price changes month by month.

1. **Initial Price in November**: $40

2. **Price Increase in December**: The price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we calculate 80% of $40 and add it to the original price.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 0.80 \times 40 = 32
   \]
   \[
   \text{Price in December} = 40 + 32 = 72
   \]

3. **Price Decrease in January**: The price decreased by 50%. To find the new price, we calculate 50% of $72 and subtract it from the December price.
   \[
   \text{Decrease} = 0.50 \times 72 = 36

The final price of the toy after it was discounted in January is \(\boxed{36}\)."
"To calculate the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to consider both the standard lessons and the lessons given to veterans.

First, let's calculate the earnings from the standard lessons:
- Charlie has 4 lessons at his standard rate of $80 per hour.
- The total for these lessons is \(4 \times 80 = 320\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the earnings from the lessons given to veterans:
- Charlie has 2 lessons at a reduced rate of 75% of the standard rate (since he reduces the rate by 25%).
- The reduced rate is \(80 \times 0.75 = 60\) dollars per hour.
- The total for these lessons is \(2 \times 60 = 120\) dollars.

Now, we add the earnings from both types of lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day:

"First, let's determine how many apples Walter ate. He bought 60 apples and ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of them:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ apples}
\]

So, the number of apples remaining after Walter ate 24 is:

\[
60 - 24 = 36 \text{ apples}
\]

Next, Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. We calculate 25% of 36:

"To find out how many novels Regina has written this year, we can set up a simple equation based on the information given.

If 9 novels is 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year, we can represent the number of novels she has written this year as \( x \). Therefore, we have:

\[ 9 = \frac{3}{4} x \]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by \( \frac{4}{3} \):

\[ x = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} \]

\[ x = 12 \]

"To find the percentage of the distance Michael has covered, we first need to calculate the total distance he travels in 3 days.

Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr. There are 24 hours in a day, so in 3 days, the total number of hours is:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 72 \text{ hours} \]

The total distance Michael travels in 72 hours at 50 km/hr is:
\[ 72 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ km/hr} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

The distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. To find the percentage of the total distance that Michael has covered, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{\text{Distance covered}}{\text{Total distance}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 0.6 \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of grapes used by Madeline. She ate 6 grapes.

Next, we calculate the number of grapes used by her brother to make the grape juice. Her brother used up 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so:
\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ grapes} \]

Now, we find the total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother:
\[ 6 + 30 = 36 \text{ grapes} \]

Their mother then used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. Each pie recipe calls for 12 grapes, so the total number of grapes used for the pies is:
\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ grapes} \]

Since the total number of grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and their mother is the sum of the grapes they used, we can find the initial number of grapes by adding the grapes used by Madeline and her brother to the grapes used for the pies:
\[ 36 + 48 = 84 \text{ grapes} \]

Thus, the initial number of grapes at the beginning is:
\[ \boxed{84} \]"

"To determine how much money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to calculate the weekly cost and then extend that to a yearly cost.

First, let's calculate the weekly cost:
- The cost of pasta is $1.00.
- The cost of cheddar cheese is $3.00.
- The cost of gruyere cheese is twice the cost of cheddar cheese, which is \(2 \times 3.00 = 6.00\).

Adding these costs together gives the weekly cost:
\[ 1.00 + 3.00 + 6.00 = 10.00 \]

Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, so the weekly cost is $10.00.

To find the yearly cost, we multiply the weekly cost by the number of weeks in a year:
\[ 10.00 \times 52 = 520.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year is:
\[ \boxed{520.00} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms. Since it takes 15 minutes per classroom, the total time required is:
\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert the total time into hours because the workday is measured in hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
\[ 1200 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

The custodian works 8 hours per day. To find out what percentage of their day is spent cleaning, we use the formula for percentage:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent cleaning}}{\text{Total workday}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours/day}} \right) \times 100 = 2.5 \times 100 = 250\% \]

However, this percentage seems unreasonably high, so let's recheck the interpretation. The custodian works 8 hours a day, and they need 20 hours to clean all the classrooms. This means they would need to work more than one day to complete the task. But since the question asks for the percentage of their day spent cleaning, we should consider the time spent cleaning relative to the 8-hour workday.

The correct interpretation is that the custodian spends 250% of their 8-hour workday cleaning, which is not practically possible in a single day. However, the question asks for the percentage of their day spent cleaning, so the answer is:

\[ \boxed{250\%} \]"
"First, let's determine the capacity of each shelf:

- Each of the middle shelves can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase:

- The total capacity of one bookcase is the sum of the capacities of all four shelves: \(10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books.

Given that Elly has 110 books, we need to determine how many bookcases are required to hold all 110 books. We do this by dividing the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:

\[
\frac{110}{55} = 2
\]

Therefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs Rose bought. Since she bought five dozens of eggs and each dozen costs $2.40, the total cost is:

\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12.00 \]

Next, let's determine the total number of eggs Rose bought. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we need to find out how much Rose will earn by selling the eggs. She sells the eggs at the rate of $1 for every 3 eggs. Therefore, the total earnings from selling 60 eggs can be calculated as follows:

\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ sets of 3 eggs} \]
\[ 20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find Rose's profit, we subtract the total cost from the total earnings:

\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \]

So, Rose's profit is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine the number of white hats Skyler has, we can follow these steps:

1. **Total Hats**: Skyler has 100 hats in total.

2. **Red Hats**: Half of the hats are red.
   \[
   \text{Number of red hats} = \frac{100}{2} = 50
   \]

3. **Remaining Hats After Red Hats**: Subtract the number of red hats from the total number of hats.
   \[
   \text{Remaining hats} = 100 - 50 = 50
   \]

4. **Blue Hats**: 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue.
   \[
   \text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]

5. **White Hats**: The rest of the hats are white. Subtract the number of red and blue hats from the remaining hats.
   \[
   \text{Number of white hats} = 50 - 30 = 20

"First, let's determine the regular price of the beef jerky bag and then the discounted price.

The regular price of the bag is $18.00.

Since the bag is $3.00 off, the discounted price is:
\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many sticks of beef jerky are in the bag. Each bag contains 30 sticks.

To find the cost per stick, we divide the discounted price of the bag by the number of sticks:
\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

The cost per stick is $0.50. To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \]

So, the cost per stick of jerky in cents is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to calculate how many questions she answered correctly on the first test.

The first test has 70 questions, and she got 60% of them correct. So, the number of questions she got right on the first test is:
\[ 70 \times 0.60 = 42 \]

To pass 6th grade, Audrey needs to correctly answer 70% of the total questions. The total number of questions in both tests is:
\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]

So, she needs to correctly answer:

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \). According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. \( B = 5S - 4 \)
2. The total number of ice cubes is \( S + B = 116 \).

We can substitute the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying the left side gives:

\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:

\[ S = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes \( S \), we can find the number of blueberry cubes \( B \):

\[ B = 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is \( 96 \).

"First, let's calculate the cost of one night at the hotel. It is given that one night at the hotel costs $80.

Next, we need to find the cost of one bus trip. The problem states that the cost of one bus trip is 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. Therefore, the cost of one bus trip is:
\[ 0.10 \times 80 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost for the hotel. Helen stayed for 3 nights, so the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 3 \times 80 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for the bus trips. Helen rode the bus 7 times, so the total cost for the bus trips is:
\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the total cost for the hotel and the total cost for the bus trips to find the total amount Helen paid:
\[ 240 + 56 = 296 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{296} \]"
"First, let's determine how many marbles Dallas has after dropping 4 of them. Dallas initially had 21 marbles and then dropped 4, so:

\[ 21 - 4 = 17 \]

This means Dallas has 17 marbles after the drop. Since Dallas and Darla together received all 52 marbles from Mazie, we can find out how many marbles Darla received by subtracting the number of marbles Dallas has from the total number of marbles:

\[ 52 - 17 = 35 \]

Therefore, the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla is:

\[ \boxed{35} \]"

"To find the average age of Mia and Emma, we first need to determine Emma's age. Since Mia is 40 years old and they are 16 years apart in age, with Mia being younger, we can calculate Emma's age as follows:

\[ \text{Emma's age} = \text{Mia's age} + 16 = 40 + 16 = 56 \]

Now that we know Emma is 56 years old, we can calculate the average of their ages. The average age is given by the sum of their ages divided by 2:

\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Mia's age} + \text{Emma's age}}{2} = \frac{40 + 56}{2} = \frac{96}{2} = 48 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find the total number of good seashells, we first need to determine the total number of seashells found by Tom, Nancy, and Benny, and then subtract the number of cracked seashells.

Tom found 214 seashells.
Nancy found 432 seashells.
Benny found 86 seashells.

First, we calculate the total number of seashells found:
\[ 214 + 432 + 86 \]

Adding these together:
\[ 214 + 432 = 646 \]
\[ 646 + 86 = 732 \]

So, they found a total of 732 seashells. Since 67 of these were cracked, the number of good seashells is:
\[ 732 - 67 \]

Subtracting 67 from 732:
\[ 732 - 67 = 665 \]

Thus, the number of good seashells they found together is:
\[ \boxed{665} \]"

"To determine how many pounds of feed are left after a week, we need to calculate the total amount of feed consumed by Dexter's pigs over that period.

First, let's find out how much feed one pig consumes in a day:
- Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day.
- Therefore, one pig eats \(4 \times 2 = 8\) pounds of feed per day.

Next, we calculate the total feed consumption for all five pigs in one day:
- Five pigs each eat 8 pounds of feed per day.
- Therefore, the total feed consumption for five pigs in one day is \(5 \times 8 = 40\) pounds.

Now, we determine the total feed consumption for one week (7 days):
- Five pigs consume 40 pounds of feed per day.
- Therefore, in one week, they consume \(40 \times 7 = 280\) pounds of feed.

Dexter initially ordered 300 pounds of feed. To find out how much feed is left after a week, we subtract the total feed consumed from the initial amount:
- Initial feed: 300 pounds.
- Feed consumed in a week: 280 pounds.
- Therefore, the remaining feed is \(300 - 280 = 20\) pounds.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"First, we need to determine the total number of hot dogs required for the party. Since John invited 20 people and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs, the total number of hot dogs needed is:
\[ 20 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ hot dogs/guest} = 40 \text{ hot dogs} \]

John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party, so the number of additional hot dogs he needs to buy is:
\[ 40 \text{ hot dogs} - 4 \text{ hot dogs} = 36 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Next, we need to determine how many packs of hot dogs John needs to buy. Since each pack contains 6 hot dogs, the number of packs required is:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ hot dogs}}{6 \text{ hot dogs/pack}} = 6 \text{ packs} \]

Each pack costs $2, so the total cost for the packs is:
\[ 6 \text{ packs} \times 2 \text{ dollars/pack} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total revenue Frances makes from selling cupcakes and cookies.

For the cupcakes:
- Frances sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each.
- Total revenue from cupcakes = 20 * $2 = $40.

For the cookies:
- Frances sells 40 cookies at $1 each.
- Total revenue from cookies = 40 * $1 = $40.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from both cupcakes and cookies:
- Total revenue = $40 (from cupcakes) + $40 (from cookies) = $80.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the trays of cupcakes:
- Frances buys 5 trays at $4 each.
- Total cost for trays = 5 * $4 = $20.

Now, let's calculate the net amount of money Frances has left after accounting for the cost of the trays:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Street**: There are 5 children.
2. **Second Street**: Each of the 5 children is joined by another child. Therefore, the number of children becomes \(5 + 5 = 10\).
3. **Third Street**: Each of the 10 children is joined by another 2 children. Therefore, the number of children becomes \(10 + (10 \times 2) = 10 + 20 = 30\).

On the third street, the original 5 children give up and leave the group. However, the 30 children that are following the truck remain.

Thus, the final number of children following the truck is 30.

"To find out how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to subtract the number of meals she has already given out from the total number of meals she has to distribute.

First, let's add up the meals given out:
- Meals given out on Friday: 64
- Meals given out on Saturday: 30
- Meals given out on Sunday: 48

Total meals given out = 64 + 30 + 48

Now, let's calculate the total:
64 + 30 = 94
94 + 48 = 142

So, Mamou has given out 142 meals in total.

Now, we subtract the total meals given out from the initial number of meals:
1,360 - 142 = 1,218

Therefore, the number of meals left to distribute is 1,218."

"To calculate the total time Charisma spends on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks, we need to break down the activities and their durations.

First, let's calculate the time spent on meditation:
- Charisma meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes at night.
- Therefore, she meditates for \(15 + 15 = 30\) minutes per day.
- Since she meditates 5 days a week, she spends \(30 \times 5 = 150\) minutes per week on meditation.
- Over 4 weeks, she spends \(150 \times 4 = 600\) minutes on meditation.

Next, let's calculate the time spent on yoga:
- Charisma practices yoga for 1 hour (60 minutes) 5 days a week.
- Therefore, she spends \(60 \times 5 = 300\) minutes per week on yoga.
- Over 4 weeks, she spends \(300 \times 4 = 1200\) minutes on yoga.

Now, we add the time spent on meditation and yoga:
- Total time spent on meditation and yoga in 4 weeks is \(600 + 1200 = 1800\) minutes.

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
- \(1800 \div 60 = 30\) hours.

Thus, the total time Charisma has spent on meditation/yoga practice in 4 weeks is 30 hours."

"First, let's determine the number of seeds in a large sunflower. A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since one dozen equals 12, a small sunflower has:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds} \]

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36 seeds, we calculate:

\[ 0.50 \times 36 = 18 \text{ seeds} \]

Adding this to the 36 seeds of the small sunflower gives us the number of seeds in a large sunflower:

\[ 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds} \]

Now, to find the total number of seeds in both a small and a large sunflower, we add the seeds from both:

\[ 36 + 54 = 90 \text{ seeds} \]

So, the total number of sunflower seeds altogether is:

\[ \text{Anne's height} = 2 \times \text{Albert's height} = 2 \times 36 = 72 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we know that Jackie is now 2 inches shorter than Anne. Therefore, Jackie's current height is:

\[ \text{Jackie's current height} = \text{Anne's height} - 2 = 72 - 2 = 70 \text{ inches} \]

Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer to reach her current height of 70 inches. To find out how tall she was before the summer, we subtract the 3 inches she grew from her current height:

\[ \text{Jackie's height before summer} = \text{Jackie's current height} - 3 = 70 - 3 = 67 \text{ inches} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 70000 \text{ bars} \times 2 \text{ dollars/bar} = 140000 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the company will receive \(\boxed{140000}\) dollars for selling the produced chocolate bars during two weeks."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts with the buy one get one 50% off deal.

The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, he gets the second T-shirt at 50% off. The price of the second T-shirt is therefore $8 * 0.5 = $4.

So, the total cost for the 2 T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes after the 40% discount.

The original price of the shoes is $40. With a 40% discount, the shoes cost $40 * 0.4 = $16 less.

So, the discounted price of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

Finally, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is the sum of the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes, which is $12 + $24 = $36.

"First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate returns, he starts filling in 9 holes a day, but the dog continues to dig 6 holes every night. So, the net number of holes filled each day is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/day} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take to fill in all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

To find out how many weeks it takes, we divide the number of days by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):

Chocolate chip cookies = 7995 - 6670
Chocolate chip cookies = 1325

So, the number of chocolate chip cookies made is 1325."
"First, let's determine the number of each item Igor gathered by accident.

Dr. Grumpus requested:
- 16 test tubes
- 7 beakers
- 14 Petri dishes

Igor gathered:
- Half as many test tubes as requested: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes
- Two more than the number of Petri dishes requested: \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes
- The correct number of beakers: 7 beakers

Next, we calculate the total number of items Igor gathered:
- Test tubes: 8
- Beakers: 7
- Petri dishes: 16

Adding these together:
\[ 8 + 7 + 16 = 31 \]

Dr. Grumpus wanted a total of 29 items on the lab bench. Therefore, the number of items Igor lost is:
\[ 31 - 29 = 2 \]

So, the number of beakers Igor lost is 2."
"First, we need to determine the total number of screws required for all the tables. Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. Therefore, the number of screws needed for one table is:

\[ 4 \text{ legs/table} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 8 \text{ screws/table} \]

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is:

\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws/table} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the number of screws he has:

\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

So, the number of screws James will have left over is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we first need to determine how many eggs are in the second basket. Since the second basket has twice as many eggs as the first basket, and the first basket has 10 eggs, we can calculate the number of eggs in the second basket as follows:

\[ \text{Number of eggs in the second basket} = 2 \times \text{Number of eggs in the first basket} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \]

Now, to find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we add the number of eggs in the first basket to the number of eggs in the second basket:

\[ \text{Total number of eggs} = \text{Number of eggs in the first basket} + \text{Number of eggs in the second basket} = 10 + 20 = 30 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 30 \]"
"First, let's determine how much money each person raised individually.

Alexandra raised $430.

Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so:
\[ \text{Kim's amount} = 430 + 320 = 750 \]

Next, we need to find out how much Sarah raised. We know that Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, and Sarah raised $300, so:
\[ \text{Maryam's amount} = 300 + 400 = 700 \]

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money raised by adding the amounts raised by each person:
\[ \text{Total amount} = \text{Alexandra's amount} + \text{Kim's amount} + \text{Sarah's amount} + \text{Maryam's amount} \]
\[ \text{Total amount} = 430 + 750 + 300 + 700 \]

Adding these amounts together:
\[ 430 + 750 = 1180 \]
\[ 1180 + 300 = 1480 \]
\[ 1480 + 700 = 2180 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money raised by the girls is:
\[ \boxed{2180} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time Vanessa took to complete her part of the race. We know that Aaron ran each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, and Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron did. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the distance Aaron ran:**
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles.
   - Since Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, Aaron ran half the distance Vanessa ran.
   - Therefore, Aaron ran \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) miles.

2. **Determine the time Aaron took to run his distance:**
   - Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.
   - Since Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes, we can calculate his speed in miles per minute.
   - Aaron's speed = \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{8} \text{ miles per minute} \).

3. **Determine Vanessa's speed:**
   - Aaron's speed is twice as fast as Vanessa's speed.
   - Therefore, Vanessa's speed = \( \frac{1}{8} \text{ miles per minute} \div 2 = \frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute} \).

4. **Determine the time Vanessa took to run her distance:**
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles.
   - Using Vanessa's speed, the time she took to run 4 miles is \( 4 \text{ miles} \div \frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute} = 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ minutes} \).

Thus, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{64}
\]"
"To determine how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we first calculate the total amount of line required based on the current dock length. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, for 200 feet of dock, he needs:

\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Currently, he has 6 feet of new line. Therefore, the additional amount of line he needs to buy is:

\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

So, the caretaker needs to buy a total of 594 feet of line."
"To determine how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, calculate the cost of the meals and wine per reservation:
- Each reservation includes 2 meals at $5 each and 1 bottle of wine at $5.
- The total cost per reservation is \(2 \times 5 + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15\) dollars.

Next, calculate the total revenue per night:
- The restaurant gets 6 reservations per night.
- The total revenue per night is \(6 \times 15 = 90\) dollars.

Now, calculate the total revenue per week:
- The restaurant is open 2 days a week.
- The total revenue per week is \(90 \times 2 = 180\) dollars.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
180"
"First, we need to calculate the total selling price of the 50 watermelons. The vendor made a profit of 25% on the cost price of $80.

The profit amount is calculated as:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Cost Price} \times \text{Profit Percentage} = 80 \times 0.25 = 20 \]

So, the total selling price is:
\[ \text{Total Selling Price} = \text{Cost Price} + \text{Profit} = 80 + 20 = 100 \]

To find the selling price of each watermelon, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:
\[ \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{\text{Total Selling Price}}{\text{Number of Watermelons}} = \frac{100}{50} = 2 \]

Thus, each watermelon was sold for $2."
"First, let's determine James's current age. Since Dora will be 12 in 3 years, she is currently 9 years old. James is now twice as old as Dora, so James is currently \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

Next, we need to find out how old John is now. We know that John had James when he was 19 years old, and James is currently 18 years old. Therefore, John is now \(19 + 18 = 37\) years old.

Now, we need to determine the age of John's youngest son. The youngest son was born when John was 32 years old, so the youngest son is currently \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old. In 3 years, the youngest son will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}
\]"
"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in that time.

First, let's find out how many oranges each can peel in one minute:
- Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in one minute, she peels \(\frac{1}{3}\) of an orange.
- Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in one minute, she peels \(\frac{1}{4}\) of an orange.

Next, we calculate how many oranges each can peel in one hour (60 minutes):
- In 60 minutes, Ana peels \(60 \times \frac{1}{3} = 20\) oranges.
- In 60 minutes, Jane peels \(60 \times \frac{1}{4} = 15\) oranges.

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
- The difference is \(20 - 15 = 5\) oranges.

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}

"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400, and Mark gets it at 80% off. This means he pays 20% of the original cost.

\[ \text{Discounted cost of radiator} = 400 \times (1 - 0.80) = 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of hiring the mechanic. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.

\[ \text{Cost of hiring the mechanic} = 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator after the discount to the cost of hiring the mechanic to find the total amount Mark paid.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 230 \]"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( c \) as the number of chickens.
- \( h \) as the number of cows.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

We can translate these into the following equations:
1. \( c + h = 20 \)
2. \( 2c + 4h = 70 \) (since each chicken has 2 legs and each cow has 4 legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2h = 35 \]

Now we have the system:
1. \( c + h = 20 \)
2. \( c + 2h = 35 \)

To eliminate \( c \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (c + 2h) - (c + h) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ c + 2h - c - h = 15 \]
\[ h = 15 \]

Now that we know \( h = 15 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of slices available from the 7 pizzas. Since each pizza is cut into 8 slices, we can calculate the total number of slices as follows:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to divide the total number of slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends, which makes a total of 4 people. So, we divide the 56 slices by 4:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Thus, each of them can have \(\boxed{14}\) slices."
