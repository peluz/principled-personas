"First, let's find out how many eggs Janet has left after eating and baking.

She starts with 16 eggs per day.
She eats 3 eggs for breakfast.
She uses 4 eggs to make muffins.

So, the number of eggs left is:
16 - 3 - 4 = 9 eggs

Janet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg.

So, the total amount she makes every day is:
9 eggs * $2/egg = $18

The final numerical answer is $18."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.
2. It takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. So, half of 2 bolts is 1 bolt of white fiber.

Now, to find the total number of bolts, we add the blue fiber and the white fiber together:

2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts

So, the total number of bolts needed is 3."
"First, let's find out how much the house increased in value. The house's value increased by 150% of its original price. The original price of the house was $80,000.

To find 150% of $80,000, we calculate:
\[ 150\% \times 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

So, the house increased in value by $120,000. Now, we add this increase to the original price of the house to find the new value:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Josh bought the house for $80,000 and then spent $50,000 on repairs. So, the total amount he spent is:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total amount spent from the new value of the house:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

So, Josh made a profit of $70,000."
"To find out how many total meters James runs a week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how many meters James runs in one sprint. According to the question, he runs 60 meters in each sprint.

2. Next, we need to find out how many meters he runs in one week for one sprint. Since he runs 3 sprints each time, we multiply the meters per sprint by the number of sprints:
   \[
   60 \text{ meters/sprint} \times 3 \text{ sprints} = 180 \text{ meters/week}
   \]

3. Finally, we need to find out how many meters he runs in a week. Since he runs 180 meters each week for one sprint, and he does this 3 times a week, we multiply the meters per week by the number of times he runs:
   \[
   180 \text{ meters/week} \times 3 \text{ times/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week}
   \]

So, the total meters James runs a week is 540 meters."
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she gives in the morning and afternoon.

In the morning, she gives 15 cups of feed.
In the afternoon, she gives 25 cups of feed.

So, the total feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
15 cups + 25 cups = 40 cups

Since she has 20 chickens and she feeds each chicken 3 cups of feed per day, the total feed needed for all chickens in a day is:
20 chickens * 3 cups/chicken = 60 cups

Now, to find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total feed needed for the day:
60 cups - 40 cups = 20 cups

So, Wendi needs to give 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Glass:** The first glass costs $5.
2. **Second Glass:** The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = $3\).
3. **Third Glass:** The third glass costs $5 again.
4. **Fourth Glass:** The fourth glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3 again.

We can see a pattern here. Every second glass costs $3, and the rest cost $5.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for 16 glasses:

- There are 8 glasses that cost $5 each.
- There are 8 glasses that cost $3 each.

So, the total cost is:
\[ 8 \times 5 + 8 \times 3 = 40 + 24 = 64 \]

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses."
"First, let's find out how many sheep Charleston has. Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, and Seattle has 20 sheep, we can calculate the number of sheep in Charleston as follows:

Number of sheep in Charleston = 4 * Number of sheep in Seattle
Number of sheep in Charleston = 4 * 20
Number of sheep in Charleston = 80

Now, let's find out how many sheep Toulouse has. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so:

Number of sheep in Toulouse = 2 * Number of sheep in Charleston
Number of sheep in Toulouse = 2 * 80
Number of sheep in Toulouse = 160

Now, we can find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together:

Total number of sheep = Number of sheep in Toulouse + Number of sheep in Charleston + Number of sheep in Seattle
Total number of sheep = 160 + 80 + 20
Total number of sheep = 260

So, the final numerical answer is 260."
"First, let's calculate how much of the file Carla has downloaded before the restart. Since the file is 200 GB and she has downloaded 40% of it before the restart, we can calculate that as follows:

\[ 200 \text{ GB} \times 0.40 = 80 \text{ GB} \]

This means that 80 GB of the file is already downloaded, and she has 120 GB left to download. Normally, she can download 2 GB per minute. To find out how long it would take her to download the remaining 120 GB at this rate, we divide the remaining file size by her download speed:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Since she had to restart the download after the 20-minute Windows update, we add this 20 minutes to the 60 minutes she needs to download the rest of the file:

\[ 20 \text{ minutes} + 60 \text{ minutes} = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it takes to download the file is 80 minutes."
"First, let's calculate the distance John covers in the first 3 hours. He drives at a speed of 60 mph for 3 hours.

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

So, John is 180 miles away from home after the first 3 hours.

Next, he spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic. This doesn't add to his distance from home, so we can ignore this part for now.

Then, he drives for 0.5 hours at a speed of 30 mph.

\[ \text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]

So, after the first 3.5 hours, he is 180 - 15 = 165 miles away from home.

Finally, he drives for the remaining 2.5 hours at a speed of 80 mph.

\[ \text{Distance} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 2.5 \, \text{hours} = 200 \, \text{miles} \]

So, after the 4 hours, he is 165 + 200 = 365 miles away from home.

The final numerical answer is 365 miles."
"To solve this, let's break it down into parts:

1. Eliza's regular pay for the first 40 hours:
   - Her regular rate is $10 per hour.
   - So, for 40 hours, her pay is 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

2. Eliza's overtime pay for the remaining 5 hours (since she worked 45 hours total):
   - Overtime pay is 1.2 times her regular rate.
   - Her overtime rate is $10/hour * 1.2 = $12/hour.
   - For 5 hours of overtime, her pay is 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.

3. Total earnings for the week:
   - Regular pay + Overtime pay = $400 + $60 = $460.

So, Eliza's total earnings for this week are $460."
"First, let's calculate the number of downloads in the second month. If the first month had 60 downloads and the second month had three times as many, then:

\[ \text{Downloads in second month} = 60 \times 3 = 180 \]

Next, we need to find out how many downloads there were in the third month. The number of downloads in the third month was reduced by 30% from the second month. So, we calculate 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180:

\[ \text{Reduction} = 180 \times 0.30 = 54 \]
\[ \text{Downloads in third month} = 180 - 54 = 126 \]

Now, to find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month:

\[ \text{Total downloads} = 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

So, the total number of downloads over the three months is 366."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of pastry Toula bought.

For the donuts:
- She bought 3 dozen donuts.
- Each dozen costs $68.
- So, the cost for the donuts is 3 * $68 = $204.

For the mini cupcakes:
- She bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
- Each dozen costs $80.
- So, the cost for the mini cupcakes is 2 * $80 = $160.

For the mini cheesecakes:
- She bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
- Each dozen costs $55.
- So, the cost for the mini cheesecakes is 6 * $55 = $330.

Now, let's add up the total cost:
- Total cost = cost of donuts + cost of mini cupcakes + cost of mini cheesecakes
- Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

So, the total cost is $694."
"To figure out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from the lemon tree, we need to calculate when the total money he earns from selling lemons will cover the initial cost of planting the tree and the yearly costs of watering and feeding it.

First, let's calculate the yearly earnings from selling lemons:
- Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons.
- Each lemon is sold for $1.5.

So, the yearly earnings from lemons are:
\[ 7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5 \text{ per lemon} = \$10.5 \text{ per year} \]

Next, let's calculate the yearly costs:
- The cost to plant the tree is $90.
- The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.

So, the yearly costs are:
\[ \$90 \text{ (initial cost)} + \$3 \text{ (watering and feeding)} = \$93 \text{ per year} \]

To find out when Carlos starts earning money, we need to find the point where his yearly earnings cover the yearly costs. This means we need to find the number of years \( y \) such that:
\[ 10.5y = 93 \]

Now, let's solve for \( y \):
\[ y = \frac{93}{10.5} \]

Let's calculate this value.
\[ y = 8.8571 \]

Since Carlos can't have a fraction of a year, we round up to the next whole number. Therefore, it will take 9 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 9 \]"
"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Let's say Melanie started with \( x \) vacuum cleaners.
2. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners. This means she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) left.
3. Then she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So now she has \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) left.
4. At the orange house, she sold half of what was left. So she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners. This means she has \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) left.
5. According to the problem, after all this, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:

First, simplify the equation:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2x}{3} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{x}{3} + 1 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{2x - x}{3} - 1 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{x}{3} = 6 \]
\[ x = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners. Let's check if this is correct:

1. She sold \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) vacuum cleaners at the green house, leaving her with \( 18 - 6 = 12 \) vacuum cleaners.
2. She sold 2 more at the red house, leaving her with \( 12 - 2 = 10 \) vacuum cleaners.
3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) vacuum cleaners, leaving her with \( 10 - 5 = 5 \) vacuum cleaners.

This matches the problem statement, so the answer is correct.

The final numerical answer is:
18"
"First, let's find out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 20 = \frac{20}{100} \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

So, 4 students are in contemporary dance. This leaves us with:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Next, we find out how many of these remaining students enrolled in jazz dance. Since 25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 16 = \frac{25}{100} \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

So, 4 students are in jazz dance. This leaves us with:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

The rest of the students, which is 12 students, enrolled in hip-hop dance. To find out what percentage of the entire class this represents, we calculate:

\[ \frac{12}{20} \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, 60% of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 60 \]"
"To solve this, we need to calculate the increase in value for each item and then find the difference between the two increases.

For the jewelry:
- Original value = $5,000
- Increase = 2.5% of $5,000 = 0.025 * $5,000 = $125

For the electronic gadgets:
- Original value = $8,000
- Increase = 1.2% of $8,000 = 0.012 * $8,000 = $96

Now, we find the difference in profit:
- Difference = Increase in jewelry - Increase in electronic gadgets
- Difference = $125 - $96 = $29

So, the merchant would make a profit of $29 by choosing the jewelry over the electronic gadgets."
"To solve this, we need to add the distances covered by each train in both directions.

First, the trains travel westward for 80 miles each.
Then, they travel northwards for 150 miles each.

So, the total distance covered by each train is the sum of these two distances:
80 miles (westward) + 150 miles (northward) = 230 miles

The final numerical answer is 230 miles."
"First, let's calculate how much Jill earns as a teacher in a year. She works 35 hours a week and gets paid $20 per hour. So, her weekly earnings as a teacher are:
\[ 35 \text{ hours/week} \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$700/\text{week} \]

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings as a teacher are:
\[ \$700/\text{week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = \$35,000/\text{year} \]

Next, let's calculate how much Jill earns as a cheerleading coach in a year. She works 15 hours a week and gets paid $30 per hour. So, her weekly earnings as a coach are:
\[ 15 \text{ hours/week} \times \$30/\text{hour} = \$450/\text{week} \]

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings as a coach are:
\[ \$450/\text{week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = \$22,500/\text{year} \]

Now, to find her total annual salary, we add her annual earnings as a teacher and as a coach:
\[ \$35,000/\text{year} + \$22,500/\text{year} = \$57,500/\text{year} \]

So, Jill's annual salary is:
\[ \$57,500 \]"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many eggs Claire uses in one day. She makes a 3 egg omelet every morning, so she uses 3 eggs per day.

2. Next, we need to find out how many eggs she uses in one week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of eggs she uses per day by 7:
   \[
   3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week}
   \]

3. Now, we need to find out how many eggs she uses in 4 weeks. We multiply the number of eggs she uses per week by 4:
   \[
   21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs}
   \]

4. Finally, we need to convert the total number of eggs into dozens. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:
   \[
   84 \text{ eggs} \div 12 = 7 \text{ dozens}
   \]

So, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks."
"First, let's calculate the total time Marissa has already spent hiking. She spent 1 hour on the first 4 miles and another 1 hour on the next 2 miles. So, she has already spent 1 + 1 = 2 hours.

Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour. To find out how much time she has left to complete the hike, we need to consider the total distance and the desired average speed.

The total distance of the trail is 12 miles. If she wants an average speed of 4 miles per hour, the total time she should take to complete the trail is:

\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Since she has already spent 2 hours, the remaining time she needs to complete the hike is:

\[ \text{Remaining time} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Now, we need to find out the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance. The remaining distance is:

\[ \text{Remaining distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - (4 \text{ miles} + 2 \text{ miles}) = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the required speed, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles at a speed of 6 miles per hour. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"First, let's find out how much water is in the 10 liters of orange drink. Since two-thirds of the orange drink is water, we can calculate the amount of water in the orange drink as follows:

\[ \text{Water in orange drink} = \frac{2}{3} \times 10 \text{ liters} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ liters} \]

Next, let's find out how much water is in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since three-fifths of the pineapple drink is water, we can calculate the amount of water in the pineapple drink as follows:

\[ \text{Water in pineapple drink} = \frac{3}{5} \times 15 \text{ liters} = \frac{45}{5} \text{ liters} = 9 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we add the water from both drinks before any spillage:

\[ \text{Total water before spillage} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ liters} + 9 \text{ liters} = \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3} \text{ liters} \]

Since we spill one liter of the orange drink, we need to subtract one liter from the total volume of the mixture:

\[ \text{New total volume} = 10 \text{ liters} - 1 \text{ liter} + 15 \text{ liters} = 24 \text{ liters} \]

The amount of water remains the same because we only spilled orange drink, not water. So, the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:

\[ \text{Total water in 24 liters} = \frac{47}{3} \text{ liters} \]

To get the final numerical answer, we convert \(\frac{47}{3}\) to a decimal:

\[ \frac{47}{3} \approx 15.67 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 15.67 \]"
"First, let's find out Samantha's age when Raymond had his son. Since Raymond had his son at the age of 23 and Samantha is now 31, we can calculate the number of years that have passed since Raymond was 23.

\[ 31 - 23 = 8 \]

So, 8 years have passed since Raymond was 23. Since Raymond was 23 when he had his son, his son was born 8 years ago.

The final numerical answer is:
8"
"Let's break it down:

- The first 3 customers buy 1 DVD each, so that's 3 DVDs.
- The next 2 customers buy 2 DVDs each, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 DVDs.
- The last 3 customers don't buy any DVDs.

Now, let's add them up:
3 (from the first 3 customers) + 4 (from the next 2 customers) = 7 DVDs.

So, the final numerical answer is:
7"
"To solve this, let's first determine how long the candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

From 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is 4 hours.

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we can calculate the total melting over 4 hours by multiplying the melting rate by the number of hours:

\[ 2 \, \text{cm/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 8 \, \text{cm} \]

So, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

The final numerical answer is:
8"
"To find the original price of the book, we need to understand that Kyle paid 75% of the original price because he got a 25% discount. Let's denote the original price by \( P \).

Given that Kyle paid $19.50, which is 75% of the original price, we can write the equation as:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's calculate the value of \( P \).
```python
# Calculation
original_price = 19.50 / 0.75
original_price
```
```output
python
26.0

The original price of the book was $26.00.

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{26.00} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the chicken meal and the milk packs.

The chicken meal costs $12.
The 5 packs of milk cost $3 each, so the total cost for the milk is 5 * $3 = $15.

Now, let's add the cost of the chicken meal and the milk packs together:
$12 (chicken meal) + $15 (milk) = $27.

Marie paid a total of $50. To find out how much she spent on the apples and the boxes of pizza, we subtract the cost of the chicken meal and milk from the total amount paid:
$50 - $27 = $23.

Now, we know that each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we divide the remaining amount by the cost of one box of pizza:
$23 ÷ $8.50 = 2.6818181818181817.

Since Marie can't order a fraction of a box of pizza, we round down to the nearest whole number. So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

The final numerical answer is 2."
"First, let's calculate the total cost for each type of clothing:

- Shorts: 3 pairs * $16.50 per pair = $59.50
- Pants: 3 pairs * $22.50 per pair = $67.50
- Shoes: 3 pairs * $42 per pair = $126.00

Now, let's add up the total cost for all the clothing items:

Total cost = Cost of shorts + Cost of pants + Cost of shoes
Total cost = $59.50 + $67.50 + $126.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost.
```markdown
Total cost = $59.50 + $67.50 + $126.00 = $253.00
```
So, Mishka spent $253.00 on all the clothing items."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine how many servings Cynthia eats in 60 days:**
   - Cynthia eats 1 serving of ice cream every night.
   - There are 60 days in the period.
   - So, she eats \( 1 \text{ serving/day} \times 60 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ servings} \).

2. **Calculate how many cartons of ice cream she needs:**
   - Each carton contains 15 servings.
   - To find out how many cartons she needs, we divide the total servings by the servings per carton: \( \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \).

3. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Each carton costs $4.00.
   - She needs 4 cartons.
   - So, the total cost is \( 4 \text{ cartons} \times $4.00/\text{carton} = $16.00 \).

Therefore, after 60 days, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream."
"Henry traveled 35 miles between his first and second stops.

Here's how to calculate it:
- First stop: 20 miles
- Second stop was 15 miles before the end, so it was at 60 - 15 = 45 miles
- Miles traveled between first and second stops: 45 - 20 = 25 miles

So, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops."
"First, let's find out how much the two pairs of high heels cost together. We know that one pair costs $33 and the other costs twice as much, which means the other pair costs $33 * 2 = $66. So, the two pairs together cost $33 + $66 = $99.

We are told that the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. So, if the two pairs of high heels cost $99, then the boots cost $99 + $5 = $104.

So, the final numerical answer is 104."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Understand the ratio**: Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11. This means if Darrell's age is 7 parts, Allen's age is 11 parts.

2. **Total parts**: The total number of parts in the ratio is \(7 + 11 = 18\).

3. **Total age**: The total age of Darrell and Allen is 162 years.

4. **Age per part**: To find out how much one part of the ratio represents in terms of age, we divide the total age by the total number of parts:
   \[
   \text{Age per part} = \frac{162}{18} = 9 \text{ years}
   \]

5. **Darrell's age**: Since Darrell's age is 7 parts, we multiply the age per part by 7:
   \[
   \text{Darrell's age} = 7 \times 9 = 63 \text{ years}
   \]

6. **Allen's age**: Since Allen's age is 11 parts, we multiply the age per part by 11:
   \[
   \text{Allen's age} = 11 \times 9 = 99 \text{ years}
   \]

7. **Allen's age 10 years from now**: To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 years to his current age:
   \[
   \text{Allen's age 10 years from now} = 99 + 10 = 109 \text{ years}
   \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
109

"First, let's find out how many jelly beans each friend guessed.

The first friend guessed 80 jelly beans.

The second friend guessed 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60. So, the second friend guessed 60 jelly beans.

The third friend guessed 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, and adding that to 80 gives us 100. So, the third friend guessed 100 jelly beans.

Now, let's find the average of these guesses. To do this, we add up all the guesses and then divide by the number of guesses.

The total number of guesses is 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

The number of guesses is 3.

So, the average guess is 240 / 3 = 80.

The final numerical answer is 80."
"Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of. Since John takes care of 10 dogs, we multiply the time for one dog by the number of dogs:

0.5 hours/dog/day * 10 dogs = 5 hours/day

To find out how many hours he spends in a week, we multiply the daily hours by the number of days in a week:

5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 35 hours/week

So, the final numerical answer is 35 hours."
"Let's break this down step by step.

1. Let's say the number of silver coins Gretchen has is \( S \).
2. According to the problem, the number of gold coins is 30 more than the number of silver coins. So, the number of gold coins can be represented as \( S + 30 \).
3. The total number of coins is the sum of the silver coins and the gold coins, which is \( S + (S + 30) = 110 \).
4. Simplifying the equation, we get \( 2S + 30 = 110 \).
5. To find \( S \), we need to solve the equation. First, subtract 30 from both sides: \( 2S = 80 \).
6. Then, divide both sides by 2: \( S = 40 \).
7. So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins.
8. Since the number of gold coins is 30 more than the number of silver coins, the number of gold coins is \( 40 + 30 = 70 \).

Therefore, the number of gold coins Gretchen has is 70."
"First, let's find out how many jewels Aaron has. We know that Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Since Raymond has 40 jewels, half of Raymond's jewels is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, Aaron has:

\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \]

jewels.

Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Since Aaron has 25 jewels, Siobhan has:

\[ 25 - 2 = 23 \]

So, Siobhan has 23 jewels."
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.
In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points he scores in the second 20 minutes, we calculate 25% of 4 points and add it to the 4 points.

25% of 4 points is calculated as:
\[ 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Now, to find the total points he scored, we add the points from both parts:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

So, the total points Mike scored are 9."
"First, let's find out how much one yogurt costs. Since 4 yogurts cost $5.00, one yogurt costs $5.00 / 4 = $1.25.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in one day, he spends $1.25 * 2 = $2.50 on yogurt.

Over 30 days, he will spend $2.50 * 30 = $75.00 on yogurt.

So, the final numerical answer is $75.00."
"First, let's calculate how much money John makes from selling his lego sets. He has 13 lego sets and sells each for $15.

So, the total money he gets from selling the lego sets is:
\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's find out how much money John spends on the video games. He buys 8 video games for $20 each.

So, the total money he spends on the video games is:
\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we know that after buying the video games, John has $5 left. So, the total money he had initially is the sum of the money he got from selling the lego sets and the money he has left after buying the video games.

So, the total money John had initially is:
\[ 195 + 5 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Since he spent $160 on the video games, the money he has left after buying the video games is:
\[ 200 - 160 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

But we know he has $5 left, so the calculation is consistent. Now, we need to find out how many lego sets he still has. Since he sold all 13 lego sets, he still has:
\[ 13 - 13 = 0 \text{ lego sets} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 0 \]"
"To find out how fast John runs, we need to figure out the total distance he covers in those 3 hours and then calculate his speed.

First, let's find out how long he runs each day:
- The first day he runs for 3 hours.
- The other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, so he runs for 3/2 = 1.5 hours each of those days.

Now, let's calculate the total running time in a week:
- First day: 3 hours
- Second day: 1.5 hours
- Third day: 1.5 hours

Total running time in a week = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours

John runs 60 miles in 6 hours. To find his speed, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

So,
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"First, let's find out how fast Dana can walk. We know that Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, and this is half as fast as she can run. So, if skipping is 3 miles per hour, running must be twice that speed:

\[ \text{Running speed} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how fast Dana can walk. We know that running is four times faster than walking, so:

\[ \text{Walking speed} = \frac{\text{Running speed}}{4} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now, we need to figure out how much time Dana spends running and walking in six hours. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. So, in six hours:

\[ \text{Time spent running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Time spent walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate how far she can run in 2 hours and how far she can walk in 4 hours:

\[ \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time running} = 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time walking} = 1.5 \times 4 = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, we add the distances she can run and walk to find the total distance she can travel in six hours:

\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance walking} = 12 + 6 = 18 \text{ miles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 18 miles."
"First, let's find out how old Ben's iPhone is. Since Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone and Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, we can calculate Ben's iPhone's age as follows:

\[ \text{Ben's iPhone age} = 2 \times \text{Suzy's iPhone age} = 2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ years old} \]

Now, we know that Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. So, we can calculate Brandon's iPhone's age as follows:

\[ \text{Brandon's iPhone age} = 4 \times \text{Ben's iPhone age} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ years old} \]

So, Brandon’s iPhone is 8 years old."
"First, let's find out how far Polly can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone. We know that without the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet. When holding the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther.

So, we calculate:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's flames reach up to 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the gemstone.

So, we calculate:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 200 \]"
"Grandma Jones had 5 apple pies, each cut into 8 pieces. So, the total number of pieces of pie is:

5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the remaining pieces from the total pieces:

40 pieces - 14 pieces = 26 pieces

So, the number of pieces taken by the guests is 26."
"First, let's find out how many calories are in one serving of the bag of chips. We know that a 300g bag has 5 servings and contains 250 calories per serving. So, the total calories in the 300g bag is:

\[ 250 \text{ calories/serving} \times 5 \text{ servings} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to find out how many calories are left for the day. Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories. So, the remaining calories you can consume are:

\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Since each serving of chips has 250 calories, we need to find out how many servings of chips you can have with the remaining 200 calories. We do this by dividing the remaining calories by the calories per serving:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories/serving}} = 0.8 \text{ servings} \]

Since each serving is 300g, we can find out how many grams you can eat by multiplying the number of servings by the grams per serving:

\[ 0.8 \text{ servings} \times 300 \text{ grams/serving} = 240 \text{ grams} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 240 \]"
"First, let's find out how much it costs to make one pound of beeswax candles. We know that one pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00 in supplies.

Next, let's determine how many pounds of beeswax Charlie needs to make 20 candles. Since he can make 10 candles from one pound of beeswax, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles.

Now, let's calculate the total cost to make 2 pounds of beeswax candles. Since it costs $10.00 to make one pound, for two pounds it would cost $20.00.

Charlie sells each candle for $2.00. So, if he sells 20 candles, he would make $2.00 * 20 = $40.00.

To find the net profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue. The total revenue is $40.00 and the total cost is $20.00.

So, the net profit is $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

The final numerical answer is $20.00."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of articles Meredith wrote on each day:**
   - On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.
   - On Tuesday, she wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. So, the number of articles on Tuesday is:
     \[
     5 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 5 \right) = 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ articles}
     \]
   - On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, the number of articles on Wednesday is:
     \[
     2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ articles}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of articles written over the three days:**
   \[
   5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of hours spent writing articles:**
   - Each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write about.
   - Therefore, the total number of hours spent writing 26 articles is:
     \[
     26 \times 4 = 104 \text{ hours}
     \]

So, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days is 104 hours."
"Candice started with 80 post-it notes and ended up with 23 post-it notes after placing one on each of 220 different cups of coffee. This means she used 220 post-it notes for the coffee cups. 

To find out how many post-it notes she had before purchasing the new package, we add the post-it notes she used to the post-it notes she had left:

220 (used for coffee cups) + 23 (remaining) = 243 post-it notes.

Since she started with 80 post-it notes and had 243 post-it notes in total after purchasing the new package, we can find out how many she bought by subtracting the initial amount from the total amount she had:

243 (total post-it notes) - 80 (initial post-it notes) = 163 post-it notes.

So, the package she purchased contained 163 post-it notes."
"First, let's find out how many blue ties John bought. If each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, so:

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, each red tie costs:

\[ \text{Cost of red tie} = \text{Cost of blue tie} + 0.5 \times \text{Cost of blue tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60 \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost of red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

Finally, to find out how much John spent on ties in total, we add the cost of the blue ties and the cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total spent on ties} = \text{Total cost of blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800 \]

So, John spent $800 on ties."
"First, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches because the pieces are measured in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot.

So, 4 feet of wire is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 6-inch pieces can be cut from 48 inches of wire. We do this by dividing the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:

\[ 48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"First, let's find out the total number of units in the building.

The building has 15 floors, and each floor has 8 units. So, the total number of units is:
\[ 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units/floor} = 120 \text{ units} \]

Next, we need to find out how many units are occupied. We know that 3/4 of the building is occupied. So, the number of occupied units is:
\[ 120 \text{ units} \times \frac{3}{4} = 90 \text{ units} \]

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:
\[ 120 \text{ units} - 90 \text{ units} = 30 \text{ units} \]

So, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"First, we need to find out how many dozens of eggs Lloyd gets from his chickens each day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

\[ \text{Dozens of eggs per day} = \frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 21 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we calculate how much money Lloyd makes from selling these eggs each day. Since he sells each dozen for $2:

\[ \text{Money per day} = 21 \text{ dozen} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in a week (7 days):

\[ \text{Money per week} = 42 \text{ dollars/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 294 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, Lloyd makes $294 on eggs per week."
"First, let's figure out how far Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM. He travels for 3 hours at a speed of 10 miles per hour. 

To find the distance, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

So, the distance he travels is:
\[ \text{Distance} = 10 \text{ mph} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles} \]

Now, Tom travels back at a speed of 6 miles per hour. To find out how long it takes him to travel back 30 miles, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time it takes for him to get back is:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{30 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, and he removes 30 comic books.

\[ \text{Total weight of comic books} = 30 \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pounds} \]

\[ \text{Total weight of comic books} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we know that Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. So, the remaining weight that needs to be removed is:

\[ \text{Remaining weight to be removed} = 15 - 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

\[ \text{Remaining weight to be removed} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[ \text{Number of toys to be removed} = \frac{7.5 \text{ pounds}}{\frac{1}{2} \text{ pound per toy}} \]

\[ \text{Number of toys to be removed} = 7.5 \times 2 \]

\[ \text{Number of toys to be removed} = 15 \]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys."
"First, let's calculate the revenue for Thursday.

For each truck tire, the mechanic charges $60. On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires.
\[ 6 \text{ truck tires} \times \$60 \text{ per truck tire} = \$360 \]

For each car tire, the mechanic charges $40. On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 4 car tires.
\[ 4 \text{ car tires} \times \$40 \text{ per car tire} = \$160 \]

So, the total revenue on Thursday is:
\[ \$360 + \$160 = \$520 \]

Next, let's calculate the revenue for Friday.

For each car tire, the mechanic charges $40. On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires.
\[ 12 \text{ car tires} \times \$40 \text{ per car tire} = \$480 \]

Since the mechanic didn't repair any truck tires on Friday, the revenue for Friday is:
\[ \$480 \]

Now, we compare the revenues from Thursday and Friday to find out which day had higher revenue and by how much.
\[ \$520 - \$480 = \$40 \]

The mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday than on Friday. So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$40 \]"
"First, we need to find out how many kittens Patchy had. The problem states that Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens. Since the adopted kittens are 7, we can calculate the number of Patchy's kittens as follows:

\[ \text{Patchy's kittens} = 3 \times \text{adopted kittens} = 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Next, we know that Trixie had 12 kittens. Now, we add up all the kittens:

\[ \text{Total kittens} = \text{Patchy's kittens} + \text{Trixie's kittens} + \text{adopted kittens} \]
\[ \text{Total kittens} = 21 + 12 + 7 \]
\[ \text{Total kittens} = 40 \]

So, the Doubtfire family now has 40 kittens."
"Jean starts with 30 lollipops and eats 2, so she has:
30 - 2 = 28 lollipops left.

She wants to package 2 lollipops in one bag, so the number of bags she can fill is:

So, the final numerical answer is 14."
"To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we first need to calculate the total cost for one visit. Peter spends $7 on a ticket and $7 on popcorn, so the total cost for one visit is:

\[ 7 + 7 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many times he can spend $14 with the $42 he has. We do this by dividing the total amount of money he has by the cost of one visit:

\[ 42 \div 14 = 3 \]

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times with his $42."
"First, let's find out how much weight the boxes can add to the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit. The bridge can carry no more than 5000 pounds, and the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. So, the maximum weight the boxes can add is:

\[ 5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds} \]

Each box weighs 15 pounds, so to find out how many boxes can be loaded, we divide the maximum weight the boxes can add by the weight of one box:

\[ \frac{1245}{15} = 83 \]

So, the maximum number of boxes which can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83."
"First, let's find out how much the delivery fee was added to the original bill. The original bill was $40.00 and the delivery vendor added a 25% fee to this amount.

To calculate the 25% fee:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 40.00 = \frac{25}{100} \times 40.00 = 0.25 \times 40.00 = 10.00 \]

So, the delivery fee added was $10.00.

Now, let's add the delivery fee to the original bill:
\[ 40.00 + 10.00 = 50.00 \]

Next, Stephen added a $4.00 tip to the total:
\[ 50.00 + 4.00 = 54.00 \]

So, the final price of Stephen's groceries after all the extra fees was:
\[ 54.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of raspberries in the clusters. There are 6 clusters and each cluster has 20 raspberries. So, we multiply the number of clusters by the number of raspberries per cluster:

\[ 6 \text{ clusters} \times 20 \text{ raspberries/cluster} = 120 \text{ raspberries} \]

Next, we add the 67 individual raspberries to the total from the clusters:

\[ 120 \text{ raspberries} + 67 \text{ raspberries} = 187 \text{ raspberries} \]

So, the total number of raspberries is 187."
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Total oranges in the basket: 25
- One orange is bad.
- 20% of the oranges are unripe.
- 2 oranges are sour.

To find out how many oranges are unripe, we calculate 20% of 25:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 25 = \frac{20}{100} \times 25 = 5 \text{ oranges} \]

So, there are 5 unripe oranges. Now, let's add the bad, unripe, and sour oranges together:
\[ 1 \text{ (bad)} + 5 \text{ (unripe)} + 2 \text{ (sour)} = 8 \text{ oranges} \]

To find out how many oranges are good, we subtract the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges from the total number of oranges:
\[ 25 \text{ (total)} - 8 \text{ (bad, unripe, sour)} = 17 \text{ good oranges} \]

So, the number of good oranges is 17."
"First, let's add up the cost of the material and the jeweler's work:
$500 (material) + $800 (jeweler) = $1300

Next, we need to calculate the cost of insurance, which is 10% of the total cost of $1300:
10% of $1300 = 0.10 * $1300 = $130

Now, we add the cost of insurance to the total cost:
$1300 (total cost) + $130 (insurance) = $1430

So, Janet paid a total of $1430."
"First, let's break down the pension calculation for Marcy:

1. For the first 20 years, Marcy gets a fixed annual pension of $50,000.
2. After 20 years, she starts getting 5% of the value of her pension each year.

Let's calculate the value of her pension after 20 years:

- Initial pension value = $50,000/year
- After 20 years, the pension value remains $50,000/year because it's a fixed amount.

Now, we need to calculate the pension for the next 10 years (from year 21 to year 30):

- Starting from year 21, she gets 5% of $50,000 each year.
- So, the annual pension for the next 10 years = 5% of $50,000 = 0.05 * $50,000 = $2,500/year.

Now, let's add the fixed pension for the first 20 years and the 5% pension for the next 10 years:

- Fixed pension for first 20 years = $50,000/year * 20 years = $1,000,000
- Pension for next 10 years = $2,500/year * 10 years = $25,000

Total annual pension after 30 years = $1,000,000 + $25,000 = $1,025,000

So, the annual pension Marcy will get after 30 years is $1,025,000."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the monthly cost for the first half of the year:**
   - The monthly cost is $140.
   - There are 6 months in a half-year.
   - So, the total cost for the first half of the year is \( 140 \times 6 = 840 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the monthly cost for the second half of the year:**
   - The cost for the second half is 10% less than the monthly cost.
   - 10% of $140 is \( 140 \times 0.10 = 14 \) dollars.
   - So, the cost for the second half is \( 140 - 14 = 126 \) dollars per month.
   - There are also 6 months in the second half of the year.
   - So, the total cost for the second half of the year is \( 126 \times 6 = 756 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total cost for the whole year:**
   - Add the cost of the first half to the cost of the second half.
   - Total cost for the year is \( 840 + 756 = 1596 \) dollars.

So, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is **1596 dollars**."
"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to determine how much gas she uses per mile. We know she used 4 gallons of gas to travel 100 miles. So, we can calculate the miles per gallon (mpg) as follows:

\[ \text{Miles per gallon} = \frac{\text{Miles traveled}}{\text{Gallons used}} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

Now that we know her car gets 25 miles per gallon, we can calculate how many miles she can drive on a full tank of 12 gallons:

\[ \text{Miles per full tank} = \text{Miles per gallon} \times \text{Gallons in tank} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas."
"First, let's find out how long Jim spends on TV and reading in one session.

He spends 2 hours watching TV.
He reads for half as long as he watches TV, so he reads for 2 / 2 = 1 hour.

So in one session, he spends 2 hours (TV) + 1 hour (reading) = 3 hours.

He does this 3 times a week, so in one week, he spends 3 hours/session * 3 sessions/week = 9 hours.

Now, we need to find out how many hours he spends in 4 weeks.

So, 9 hours/week * 4 weeks = 36 hours.

The final numerical answer is 36 hours."
"Each school has sent:
- 5 players for the girls' team
- 5 players for the boys' team
- 1 coach for the girls' team
- 1 coach for the boys' team

So, each school has sent a total of 5 + 5 + 1 + 1 = 12 people.

Since there are 4 schools, the total number of people sent by all the schools is 4 * 12 = 48.

The final numerical answer is 48."
"First, let's find out how many rubies there are. If there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, and there are 175 diamonds, then:

\[ \text{Number of rubies} = 175 - 35 = 140 \]

Next, we need to find out how many emeralds there are. The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies, so:

\[ \text{Number of emeralds} = 2 \times 140 = 280 \]

Now, to find the total number of gems, we add the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds together:

\[ \text{Total number of gems} = 175 + 140 + 280 = 595 \]

So, the total number of gems in the chest is 595."
"If there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls, then the number of boys is:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

So, the total number of students is:
\[ 60 \text{ girls} + 120 \text{ boys} = 180 \text{ students} \]

If there are 5 students to every teacher, then the number of teachers is:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ students}}{5 \text{ students/teacher}} = 36 \text{ teachers} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 36 \]"
"To find out how much money Bailey started with, we need to calculate how much she received from her allowance and then subtract that from the total amount she has at the end.

Bailey gets $5 each week for 8 weeks, so the total allowance is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

Bailey has a total of $100 at the end of 8 weeks. So, the amount she started with is:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

So, Bailey started with $60."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the number of classes Judy teaches on weekdays:**
   - Judy teaches 5 classes each weekday.
   - There are 5 weekdays in a week.
   - So, the total number of classes on weekdays is \(5 \text{ classes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 25 \text{ classes}\).

2. **Calculate the number of classes Judy teaches on Saturday:**
   - Judy teaches 8 classes on Saturday.
   - So, the total number of classes on Saturday is \(8 \text{ classes}\).

3. **Calculate the total number of classes Judy teaches in a week:**
   - Total classes in a week = Classes on weekdays + Classes on Saturday
   - Total classes in a week = \(25 \text{ classes} + 8 \text{ classes} = 33 \text{ classes}\).

4. **Calculate the total number of students Judy teaches in a week:**
   - Each class has 15 students.
   - Total students in a week = Total classes in a week \(\times\) Students per class
   - Total students in a week = \(33 \text{ classes} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 495 \text{ students}\).

5. **Calculate the total amount of money Judy makes in a week:**
   - Judy charges $15.00 per student.
   - Total money made in a week = Total students \(\times\) Charge per student
   - Total money made in a week = \(495 \text{ students} \times 15 \text{ dollars/student} = 7425 \text{ dollars}\).

So, the total amount of money Judy makes in one week is $7425."
"The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one, so it has 20 * 2 = 40 instructions.

To prepare both dishes, Kelian has to read 20 + 40 = 60 instructions.

"To find out how much money Tommy raises, we need to calculate the total money from selling brownies and cheesecakes separately and then add them together.

For the brownies:
- Tommy sells 43 brownies.
- Each brownie is sold for $3.
- So, the total money from brownies is 43 brownies * $3/brownie = $129.

For the cheesecakes:
- Tommy sells 23 slices of cheesecake.
- Each cheesecake slice is sold for $4.
- So, the total money from cheesecakes is 23 cheesecake slices * $4/cheesecake slice = $92.

Now, we add the money from brownies and cheesecakes to find the total money Tommy raises:
- Total money = money from brownies + money from cheesecakes
- Total money = $129 + $92 = $221.

So, the final numerical answer is $221."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the five cell phones before interest. Each cell phone costs $150, so for five cell phones, the cost is:

\[ 150 \times 5 = 750 \]

Next, we need to calculate the interest. The interest rate is 2% for each cell phone. So, for five cell phones, the total interest is:

\[ 750 \times 0.02 = 15 \]

Now, we add the interest to the original cost to get the total amount Shiela needs to pay:

\[ 750 + 15 = 765 \]

Shiela will pay this total amount over 3 months. To find out how much she will pay each month, we divide the total amount by 3:

\[ \frac{765}{3} = 255 \]

So, Shiela will pay $255 each month for 3 months. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 255 \]"

- Marigolds: $2.74 rounds to $3.00
- Petunias: $1.87 rounds to $2.00
- Begonias: $2.12 rounds to $2.00

Now, let's calculate how much Artie will make from each type of flower:

- Marigolds: 12 pots * $3.00 per pot = $36.00
- Petunias: 9 pots * $2.00 per pot = $18.00
- Begonias: 17 pots * $2.00 per pot = $34.00

Finally, let's add up the total amount Artie will make:

$36.00 + $18.00 + $34.00 = $88.00

So, the final numerical answer is $88.00."
"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4 leveled sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level.

We know the top level (level 4) has a square footage of 16. Since each level below has half the square footage of the level above it, we can calculate the square footage of the other levels as follows:

- Level 4 (top level): 16 square feet
- Level 3: \(16 \div 2 = 8\) square feet
- Level 2: \(8 \div 2 = 4\) square feet
- Level 1: \(4 \div 2 = 2\) square feet

Now, we add up the square footage of all levels to find the total square footage:
\[ 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 \]

To find the average square footage of a level, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \]

So, the average square footage of a level is 7.5."
"To solve this, let's break it down into parts:

1. For the first 180 days, the puppy eats 1 cup of dog food every day. So, for 180 days, the puppy will eat:
   1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups

2. After the first 180 days, the puppy will eat 2 cups of dog food every day for the rest of its life. Since we are only asked about the first year, we need to consider the first 365 days.

3. The total dog food needed for the first year is the sum of the first 180 days and the next 365 days:
   180 cups (first 180 days) + 2 cups/day * 365 days = 180 cups + 730 cups = 910 cups

4. Now, we need to find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use. Each bag contains 110 cups. So, we divide the total cups needed by the number of cups per bag:
   910 cups / 110 cups/bag = 8.2727...

Since Cecilia can't use a fraction of a bag, she will need to buy 9 bags of dog food to have enough for the first year.

The final numerical answer is 9 bags."
"First, let's find out how much laundry Sarah does. According to the question, Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.

Next, we know that Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. So, to find out how much laundry David does, we divide the amount Sarah does by 4:
\[ \text{David's laundry} = \frac{400 \text{ pounds}}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we know that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. So, to find out how much laundry Raymond does, we divide the amount Sarah does by 2:
\[ \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{400 \text{ pounds}}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we subtract the amount David does from the amount Raymond does:
\[ \text{Difference} = 200 \text{ pounds} - 100 \text{ pounds} = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 100 pounds."
"To solve this, let's first figure out the cost per flower for each package option.

For the package of 3 flowers for $2.50:
- Cost per flower = $2.50 / 3 = $0.8333 (repeating)

For the package of 2 flowers for $1:
- Cost per flower = $1 / 2 = $0.50

The cheaper option is to buy the flowers in packages of 2 for $1 each.

Now, let's calculate how many packages of 2 flowers Vincent needs to buy to get 18 flowers:
- Number of packages = 18 flowers / 2 flowers per package = 9 packages

The total cost for 18 flowers at the cheaper price is:
- Total cost = 9 packages * $1 per package = $9

Since the question asks how much money he saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to know the cost if he bought them at the more expensive price. Let's calculate that first.

For the package of 3 flowers for $2.50:
- Number of packages needed = 18 flowers / 3 flowers per package = 6 packages
- Total cost = 6 packages * $2.50 per package = $15

Now, we can find out how much money he saves:
- Savings = Cost at more expensive price - Cost at cheaper price
- Savings = $15 - $9 = $6

So, Vincent saves $6 by buying 18 flowers at the better price."
"First, we need to calculate the discount amount. The discount is 30% of $100.

To find 30% of $100, we multiply $100 by 0.30 (since 30% is the same as 0.30 in decimal form).

So, the discount amount is $100 * 0.30 = $30.

Now, we subtract the discount from the original cost to find out how much John has to pay.

So, the cost after the discount is $100 - $30 = $70.

The final cost of the grooming is $70."
"First, let's find out how much water each girl got. Since each girl got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water, we can calculate this as:

\[ \text{Water per girl} = \frac{1}{6} \times 24 \text{ liters} \]

\[ \text{Water per girl} = 4 \text{ liters} \]

Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they got together is:

\[ \text{Total water for girls} = 4 \text{ liters} \times 2 \]

\[ \text{Total water for girls} = 8 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we add the water the boy got to the total water the girls got:

\[ \text{Total water} = 8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} \]

\[ \text{Total water} = 14 \text{ liters} \]

The original amount of water was 24 liters, so to find out how much water was left, we subtract the total water they used:

\[ \text{Water left} = 24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} \]

\[ \text{Water left} = 10 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 10 \]"
"First, let's add up all the stickers Charlie had initially and then add the ones he bought and got for his birthday.

Charlie started with 10 stickers.
He bought 21 stickers.
He got 23 stickers for his birthday.

So, the total number of stickers Charlie had before giving any away or using any is:
10 + 21 + 23 = 54 stickers.

Next, Charlie gave 9 stickers to his sister and used 28 to decorate a greeting card.

So, the total number of stickers Charlie used or gave away is:
9 + 28 = 37 stickers.

Now, to find out how many stickers Charlie has left, we subtract the number of stickers he used or gave away from the total number of stickers he had:
54 - 37 = 17 stickers.

So, the final numerical answer is 17."
"First, let's find out how much Alex weighs. We know that Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. Grace weighs 125 pounds.

So, we calculate 4 times Grace's weight:
\[ 4 \times 125 = 500 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we subtract 2 pounds from this amount to find Alex's weight:
\[ 500 - 2 = 498 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, to find their combined weights, we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight together:
\[ 125 + 498 = 623 \text{ pounds} \]

So, their combined weights are 623 pounds."
"First, we need to find out how many roses there are in total. Dan has 3 rose bushes and each bush has 25 roses. So, we multiply the number of bushes by the number of roses per bush:

\[ 3 \text{ bushes} \times 25 \text{ roses per bush} = 75 \text{ roses} \]

Next, we need to find out how many thorns there are in total. Each rose has 8 thorns, so we multiply the total number of roses by the number of thorns per rose:

\[ 75 \text{ roses} \times 8 \text{ thorns per rose} = 600 \text{ thorns} \]

"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Let's say the number of games they lost is \( L \).
2. According to the problem, they won 8 more games than they lost, so the number of games they won is \( L + 8 \).
3. The total number of games played is the sum of the games they won and the games they lost, which is \( L + (L + 8) = 22 \).
4. Simplifying the equation, we get \( 2L + 8 = 22 \).
5. Subtract 8 from both sides to get \( 2L = 14 \).
6. Divide both sides by 2 to find \( L \), so \( L = 7 \).
7. Now, to find out how many games they won, we add 8 to the number of games they lost, so \( L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15 \).

Therefore, the number of games they won is 15."
"Gene is 34 years old now and he started vacationing when he was 23. So, the number of vacations he has been on is:

Therefore, the total number of quilt blocks he has is 11."
"To solve this, let's break down the information given:

1. The first time the alarm went off, it rang 4 times.
2. The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time. So, it rang \(4 \times 3 = 12\) times.
3. The third time it went off, it rang for half as long as the second time. So, it rang \(12 \div 2 = 6\) times.

Now, let's add up all the times the alarm rang:

- First time: 4 times
- Second time: 12 times
- Third time: 6 times

Total times the alarm rang = \(4 + 12 + 6 = 22\)

"First, let's calculate Sylvie's salary after the first year of the 10% increase. Her initial salary is $600.

The increase is 10% of $600, which is:
\[ 0.10 \times 600 = 60 \]

So, her salary after the first year will be:
\[ 600 + 60 = 660 \]

Next, we calculate her salary after the second year of the 10% increase. Her salary at the end of the first year is $660.

The increase is 10% of $660, which is:
\[ 0.10 \times 660 = 66 \]

So, her salary after the second year will be:
\[ 660 + 66 = 726 \]

Now, we calculate her salary after the third year of the 10% increase. Her salary at the end of the second year is $726.

The increase is 10% of $726, which is:
\[ 0.10 \times 726 = 72.6 \]

So, her salary after the third year will be:
\[ 726 + 72.6 = 798.6 \]

Therefore, after three more years of service, Sylvie's annual salary will be $798.60."
"Let's break this down step by step.

1. Let's say Harald sold \( H \) copies.
2. Marilyn sold 10 times as many copies as Harald, so Marilyn sold \( 10H \) copies.
3. Together, they sold 88,000 copies, so we can write the equation: \( H + 10H = 88,000 \).
4. Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get \( 11H = 88,000 \).
5. To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11: \( H = \frac{88,000}{11} \).

Now, let's calculate \( H \).
```python
# Calculation
H = 88000 / 11
H

The calculation gives us \( H = 8000 \).

So, Harald sold 8000 copies. 

The final numerical answer is \(\boxed{8000}\)."
"First, let's find out how many guests will actually attend the party. If 1/4 of the invited friends don't show up, then 3/4 of the invited friends will attend.

Christina invited 16 friends, so the number of guests attending will be:
\[ \text{Number of guests attending} = 16 \times \frac{3}{4} = 12 \]

Now, Christina needs .75 gift bags per guest. So, the total number of gift bags needed is:
\[ \text{Total gift bags needed} = 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \]

Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost will be:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

So, Christina will spend $18 on gift bags."
"First, let's find out how much potato salad the adults will eat. Since each adult eats 10 lbs and there are 20 adults, we multiply 10 lbs by 20:

\[ 10 \, \text{lbs/adult} \times 20 \, \text{adults} = 200 \, \text{lbs} \]

Next, let's find out how much potato salad the children will eat. Since each child eats half as much as an adult, each child eats:

\[ \frac{10 \, \text{lbs}}{2} = 5 \, \text{lbs/child} \]

With 5 children, the total potato salad needed for the children is:

\[ 5 \, \text{lbs/child} \times 5 \, \text{children} = 25 \, \text{lbs} \]

Now, we add the potato salad needed for the adults and the children to find the total amount of potato salad Ted needs to bring:

\[ 200 \, \text{lbs} + 25 \, \text{lbs} = 225 \, \text{lbs} \]

So, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic."
"First, let's find out how many pets Marcia has. Since Marcia has two more pets than Cindy and Cindy has four pets, we can calculate Marcia's pets as follows:

Marcia's pets = Cindy's pets + 2
Marcia's pets = 4 + 2
Marcia's pets = 6

Now, we know Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia. So, we can calculate Jan's pets as follows:

Jan's pets = 3 * Marcia's pets
Jan's pets = 3 * 6
Jan's pets = 18

Now, to find the total number of pets the three have, we add up the pets each of them has:

Total pets = Jan's pets + Marcia's pets + Cindy's pets
Total pets = 18 + 6 + 4
Total pets = 28

So, the final numerical answer is 28."

"First, we need to find out how fast Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles. According to the information, Lee runs it in 38 seconds.

Lee used to be able to run it two seconds faster than Gerald. So, if Lee runs it in 38 seconds, Gerald used to run it in:
\[ 38 + 2 = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, Gerald improved his speed by 10%. To find out how fast he can now run, we need to calculate 10% of his old time and subtract it from his old time.

10% of 40 seconds is:
\[ 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ seconds} \]

So, Gerald's new time after improving his speed is:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds."
"First, let's find out how many cats there are. Since there are two cats for every dog and there are 60 dogs, we can calculate the number of cats as follows:

Number of cats = Number of dogs / 2
Number of cats = 60 / 2
Number of cats = 30

Now, we know there are 60 dogs and 30 cats, so the total number of dogs and cats is:

Total number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
Total number of dogs and cats = 60 + 30
Total number of dogs and cats = 90

The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. So, we subtract 12 from the total number of dogs and cats to find the number of rabbits:

Number of rabbits = Total number of dogs and cats - 12
Number of rabbits = 90 - 12
Number of rabbits = 78

Now, to find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
Total number of pets = 60 + 30 + 78
Total number of pets = 168

So, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 168."
"First, let's find out how many boys and girls there are in Grade 5.

Total students = 200

Number of boys = 2/5 of 200
Number of boys = 2/5 * 200

Since the rest are girls, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students.
Number of girls = Total students - Number of boys
Number of girls = 200 - 80
Number of girls = 120

Now, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. So, we need to find out how many girls are in the girl scout and then subtract that number from the total number of girls to find out how many are not in the girl scout.

Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 of 120
Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120
Number of girls in the girl scout = 80

Now, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls to find out how many are not in the girl scout.
Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout
Number of girls not in the girl scout = 120 - 80
Number of girls not in the girl scout = 40

So, the final numerical answer is 40."
"First, we need to find out how many hours James slept. Since James slept only 2/3 of what Harry slept, we can calculate this by multiplying 9 hours by 2/3.

\[ \text{Hours James slept} = 9 \times \frac{2}{3} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we subtract the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept.

\[ \text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James. The final numerical answer is:

Next, we need to find out how many 16-ounce cans of tomatoes make up 64 ounces. We do this by dividing the total ounces of tomatoes by the ounces per can:

\[ 64 \div 16 = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Since each can contains three tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes used is:

\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ tomatoes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the information given:

- There were originally 30 cars on the motorway.
- 5 cars took an exit, so the number of cars left on the motorway is 30 - 5 = 25 cars.
- In the remaining 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through the traffic jam.
- We need to find out how many cars drove through in the first 15 minutes.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

So, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes plus the 20 cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes should equal the 25 cars left on the motorway after the 5 cars took an exit.

This can be written as:
\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

Mary received 18 new potted plants from her nursery. So, we add these to the 80 potted plants she already has:

\[ 80 + 18 = 98 \]

Mary plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family. So, she will give away:

\[ 1 \times 40 = 40 \]

Now, we subtract the 40 potted plants she will give away from the 98 potted plants she has:

\[ 98 - 40 = 58 \]

So, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is 58."
"First, let's find out how many times the second friend pressed the doorbell. The second friend pressed it 1/4 times more than the first friend. The first friend pressed it 20 times.

To find 1/4 of 20:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \]

So, the second friend pressed it 5 more times than the first friend:
\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \]

Next, we know the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend:
\[ 60 + 10 = 70 \]

Now, let's add up all the doorbell presses:
- First friend: 20 times
- Second friend: 25 times
- Third friend: 70 times
- Fourth friend: 60 times

Adding these together:
\[ 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175 \]

So, the total number of doorbell rings is:
\[ 175 \]"
"First, let's find out the total number of pages Solo needs to read. 

He needs to read:
- 4 pages from Science
- 20 pages from Social Studies
- 7 pages from History
- 8 pages from Geography

So, the total number of pages is:
4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday. So, the remaining pages he needs to read are:
39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read, on average, in one day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days left:
24 pages ÷ 4 days = 6 pages per day

So, the final numerical answer is 6 pages."
"Let's break this down step by step:

1. John drinks water with his breakfast, lunch, and dinner every weekday. There are 5 weekdays in a week.
   - So, he drinks 3 glasses of water each weekday.
   - For 5 weekdays, he drinks 3 * 5 = 15 glasses of water.

2. On weekends, he drinks a soda with dinner instead of water. There are 2 days in the weekend.
   - So, he drinks 0 glasses of water on each weekend day.
   - For 2 weekend days, he drinks 0 * 2 = 0 glasses of water.

3. Now, let's add the glasses of water he drinks during the weekdays and the weekend.
   - Total glasses of water he drinks in a week = 15 (weekdays) + 0 (weekend) = 15 glasses.

So, the final numerical answer is 15."
"To solve this, we first need to find out how many 3-mile segments are in the 42-mile city.

We do this by dividing the total length of the city by the length of each segment:
\[ \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/segment}} = 14 \text{ segments} \]

Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each 3-mile segment, we multiply the number of segments by the time it takes to cover one segment:
\[ 14 \text{ segments} \times 10 \text{ minutes/segment} = 140 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Poppy places a quarter of the pieces on the board. Since the puzzle has 1000 pieces, a quarter of 1000 is:
   \[
   \frac{1000}{4} = 250
   \]
   So, 250 pieces are placed by Poppy.

2. After Poppy places 250 pieces, the number of pieces left is:
   \[
   1000 - 250 = 750
   \]

3. Poppy's mom then places a third of the remaining pieces. A third of 750 is:
   \[
   \frac{750}{3} = 250
   \]
   So, 250 pieces are placed by Poppy's mom.

4. After Poppy's mom places 250 pieces, the number of pieces left is:
   \[
   750 - 250 = 500
   \]

So, the number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed is 500."
"If Amir eats 5 cookies, and Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir, then Cody eats:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ cookies} \]

Together, they eat:
\[ 5 + 15 = 20 \text{ cookies} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"
"First, let's find the inner dimensions of one box. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side) to get the inner dimensions.

So, the inner dimensions of one box are:
- Length: 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - 1 inch = 3 inches

Now, we can calculate the inner volume of one box:
\[ \text{Volume of one box} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} = 3 \times 4 \times 3 = 36 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the volume of one box by 3 to get the total inner volume:
\[ \text{Total inner volume} = 36 \times 3 = 108 \text{ cubic inches} \]

So, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 108 cubic inches."
"Let's break down the time Frankie spent watching TV each day:

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Wednesday: 30 minutes
- Thursday: 1 hour + 30 minutes
- Friday: 2 hours

Now, let's add up the hours he watched TV from Monday to Friday:

1 hour (Monday) + 1 hour (Tuesday) + 0.5 hour (Wednesday) + 1.5 hours (Thursday) + 2 hours (Friday) = 6 hours

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. So, the difference between the total hours he watched and the hours we've calculated is the time he watched on Wednesday:

7 hours (total) - 6 hours (calculated) = 1 hour

Since he watched 30 minutes on Wednesday, the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is:

1 hour = 2 * 30 minutes

So, Frankie watched 2 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

The final numerical answer is 2."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's say Henry meant to bake \( x \) cookies.
2. He actually baked twice as many as he meant to, so he baked \( 2x \) cookies.
3. He baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so \( 2x = x + 15 \).
4. From the equation \( 2x = x + 15 \), we can solve for \( x \):
   \[
   2x - x = 15
   \]
   \[
   x = 15
   \]
   So, Henry meant to bake 15 cookies.
5. But he actually baked \( 2x = 2 \times 15 = 30 \) cookies.
6. He then drops 5 cookies, so he has \( 30 - 5 = 25 \) cookies left.
7. Now, he has a total of 110 cookies, which means he must have added 85 more cookies to the 25 he had left (since \( 110 - 25 = 85 \)).

So, Henry baked 15 cookies last year, but this year he baked 30 cookies. The question asks for the number of cookies he baked last year, which is 15.

The final numerical answer is:
15"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas without any cashback. The price of gas is $3.00 per gallon.

So, the cost for 10 gallons is:
\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.00 \text{ per gallon} = \$30.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cashback. The cashback is $0.20 per gallon.

So, the total cashback for 10 gallons is:
\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.20 \text{ per gallon} = \$2.00 \]

Now, to find the final cost after applying the cashback, we subtract the total cashback from the total cost of the gas:

\[ \$30.00 - \$2.00 = \$28.00 \]

So, the final cost after the cashback rewards is:
\[ \$28.00 \]"
"To find out how many fruit roll-ups each of them ate, we need to calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups for each of them.

For Marcell:
- He has a fruit roll-up that is 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- So, the total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell has is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

For Beatrice:
- She has a fruit roll-up that is 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- So, the total number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice has is \(2 \times 24 = 48\).

Now, to find out how many fruit roll-ups they ate on average, we add the total number of fruit roll-ups they both have and then divide by 2 (since there are two people).

So, the total number of fruit roll-ups they ate together is \(42 + 48 = 90\).

The average number of fruit roll-ups they ate is \(\frac{90}{2} = 45\).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 45."
"First, let's find out how many seconds it took Julia to row 10 feet. Since it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, it would take her 8 seconds to row 10 feet.

Now, let's find out how many 10-foot segments are in the 64 seconds it took her to row to the shore. We do this by dividing 64 by 10:

\[ 64 \div 10 = 6.4 \]

This means Julia rowed 6 full 10-foot segments and a bit more. Since she takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, we need to calculate the total water taken on for 6 full segments and the partial segment.

For 6 full segments:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ liters} \]

For the partial segment, we need to calculate how much water she takes on in the remaining 4 feet. Since she takes on 2 liters for every 10 feet, we can find out how much she takes on per foot and then for 4 feet:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = 0.2 \text{ liters per foot} \]
\[ 0.2 \text{ liters per foot} \times 4 \text{ feet} = 0.8 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we add the water taken on for the full segments and the partial segment:

\[ 12 \text{ liters} + 0.8 \text{ liters} = 12.8 \text{ liters} \]

So, the boat had taken on 12.8 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore."
"Each teacher uses the whiteboard 2 times a day (once for each of their lessons). Since there are 4 teachers, the total number of times the whiteboard is used in a day is:

\[ 2 \text{ times/teacher/day} \times 4 \text{ teachers} = 8 \text{ times/day} \]

Each time the whiteboard is used, it is cleaned 3 times. So, the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day is:

\[ 8 \text{ times/day} \times 3 \text{ cleanings/time} = 24 \text{ cleanings/day} \]

The final numerical answer is 24."
"Ryan plants 2 flowers a day for 15 days, so the total number of flowers he plants is:
\[ 2 \text{ flowers/day} \times 15 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ flowers} \]

Since 5 of these flowers did not grow, the number of flowers he has in his garden is:
\[ 30 \text{ flowers} - 5 \text{ flowers} = 25 \text{ flowers} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 25 \]"
"First, let's find out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold. Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Jamal's phone capacity} = 6 \times \text{Brittany's phone capacity} \]

Given that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[ 1800 = 6 \times \text{Brittany's phone capacity} \]

To find Brittany's phone capacity, we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ \text{Brittany's phone capacity} = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \]

So, Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs.

Next, we know that Brittany's phone capacity is 50 times the number of birds in Jamal's photograph. Let's denote the number of birds in Jamal's photograph as \( B \). We can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Brittany's phone capacity} = 50 \times B \]

We already know Brittany's phone capacity is 300, so we substitute this value into the equation:

\[ 300 = 50 \times B \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 50:

\[ B = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \]

So, the number of ducks (or birds) in Jamal's photograph is 6.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the leftover lumber Sasha has.

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 10 boards.
- Each board cost her $10.
- So, the total cost for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is \(10 \times 10 = $100\).

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 5 boards.
- Each board cost her $16.
- So, the total cost for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is \(5 \times 16 = $80\).

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the leftover lumber:
- Total cost = cost of 2 x 4 x 10 boards + cost of 4 x 4 x 10 boards
- Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180

Next, let's calculate the total selling price of all the leftover lumber:
- She sells all 10 of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards.
- She sells all 5 of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards.
- So, the total number of boards she sells is \(10 + 5 = 15\) boards.
- If she sells each board for the same price as she bought them, each board is sold for $16 (since the 4 x 4 x 10 boards cost $16 each).
- So, the total selling price is \(15 \times 16 = $240\).

Now, let's calculate the profit:
- Profit = total selling price - total cost
- Profit = $240 - $180 = $60

So, Sasha makes a profit of $60."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the ratio and how it applies to the total amount of sugar and water used.

The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total number of parts is 7 + 13 = 20 parts.

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water. To find out how many teaspoons of sugar she used, we need to divide the total amount by the total number of parts and then multiply by the number of parts for sugar.

First, we find out how many parts each part represents:
\[ \text{Each part} = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

Since the sugar part is 7, we calculate the amount of sugar as follows:
\[ \text{Teaspoons of sugar} = 7 \times 6 = 42 \]

So, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used is 42.

The final numerical answer is:
42"
"John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children, so he buys a total of 2 * 3 = 6 pairs of shoes. Each pair costs $60, so he pays 6 * $60 = $360 in total. 

The final numerical answer is $360."
"First, let's find out how many vehicles were initially at the port. Since there were 2 containers and each container had 5 vehicles, the initial number of vehicles is:

\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles/container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

On the second day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. To find out how many vehicles were added on the second day, we subtract the initial number of vehicles from the total number of vehicles after the second day:

\[ 30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles} \]

Since each container has 5 vehicles, we can find out how many containers were added by dividing the number of vehicles added by the number of vehicles per container:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ vehicles}}{5 \text{ vehicles/container}} = 4 \text{ containers} \]

So, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is 4."
"First, let's find out Lylah's salary four years ago. We know that Adrien's salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. If Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000, we can set up the following equation to find Lylah's salary:

\[ \text{Adrien's salary} = \text{Lylah's salary} + 0.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]
\[ 40000 = \text{Lylah's salary} \times (1 + 0.30) \]
\[ 40000 = \text{Lylah's salary} \times 1.30 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = \frac{40000}{1.30} \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = 30769.23 \]

Now, we know that four years later, Adrien's salary had increased by 40 percent. So, we can calculate Adrien's new salary:

\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = \text{Adrien's salary four years ago} \times (1 + 0.40) \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 \times 1.40 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 56000 \]

Since Adrien and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously, Lylah's new salary is:

\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = \text{Lylah's salary four years ago} \times (1 + 0.40) \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 \times 1.40 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 43076.92 \]

Finally, to find the total salary the two were receiving four years later, we add Adrien's and Lylah's new salaries:

\[ \text{Total salary} = \text{Adrien's new salary} + \text{Lylah's new salary} \]
\[ \text{Total salary} = 56000 + 43076.92 \]
\[ \text{Total salary} = 99076.92 \]

So, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is $99076.92."
"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, find out how many sheets of paper he uses in a week. Since he uses 2 pads of paper a week and each pad has 30 sheets, we multiply:
   \[
   2 \text{ pads/week} \times 30 \text{ sheets/pad} = 60 \text{ sheets/week}
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how many sheets he uses in a month. Assuming a month has about 4 weeks, we multiply the number of sheets he uses in a week by 4:
   \[
   60 \text{ sheets/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 240 \text{ sheets/month}
   \]

So, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month."
"First, let's find out how many fruits Kael brought.

Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. So, Kael brought:
- Twice the amount of apples Morisette brought: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) apples.
- Half the number of oranges Morisette brought: \(8 \div 2 = 4\) oranges.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits each brought:
- Morisette brought \(5 + 8 = 13\) fruits.
- Kael brought \(10 + 4 = 14\) fruits.

To find the total number of fruits they brought together, we add Morisette's and Kael's fruits:
- Total fruits = \(13 + 14 = 27\).

So, the final numerical answer is 27."
"To solve this, let's break it down day by day:

- On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours.
- On Tuesday, she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours.
- On Wednesday, she also slept 2 hours less than Tuesday, so she slept 6 - 2 = 4 hours.

For the rest of the week (Thursday, Friday, and Saturday), she slept 1 hour more than she did on Tuesday and Wednesday combined. So, let's find out how many hours she slept on Tuesday and Wednesday together:
- Tuesday and Wednesday combined: 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

For Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, she slept 1 hour more than 10 hours, so she slept 10 + 1 = 11 hours each day.

Now, let's add up the total hours she slept throughout the week:
- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday: 6 hours
- Wednesday: 4 hours
- Thursday: 11 hours
- Friday: 11 hours
- Saturday: 11 hours

Total hours = 8 + 6 + 4 + 11 + 11 + 11 = 41 hours

So, the total number of hours Sadie slept in the week is 41 hours."
"First, let's calculate how far Rosie can run at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time

For the first part:
Distance = 10 mph * 3 hours = 30 miles

Now, we need to calculate how much time Rosie has left after running for 3 hours.

Total time available = 7 hours
Time already used = 3 hours
Time left = 7 hours - 3 hours = 4 hours

Now, we calculate how far Rosie can run at 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours.

Distance = Speed * Time

For the second part:
Distance = 5 mph * 4 hours = 20 miles

Now, we add the distances from both parts to find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours.

Total distance = Distance from first part + Distance from second part
Total distance = 30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles

So, the final numerical answer is 50 miles."
"First, let's find out how many letters Jennie put stamps on. She has 60 letters needing stamps, and she puts stamps on one-third of them. So, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
\]

This means Jennie put stamps on 20 letters. Now, we know that after putting stamps on 20 letters, there are 30 letters in the pile that are already stamped. This means that before Jennie put stamps on the 20 letters, there were:

\[
30 - 20 = 10
\]

So, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began. The final numerical answer is:

\[
10

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Julia originally had some spoons, but they were plastic and she was out of them.
2. She bought a new package of spoons.
3. Her husband bought a package of 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia.
4. Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew.
5. After using 3 spoons, she had a total of 12 spoons.

To find out how many spoons were in the package Julia bought, we need to figure out how many spoons she had before using the 3 for sampling. If she had 12 spoons after using 3, then before using them, she had 12 + 3 = 15 spoons.

Now, we know that her husband gave her 5 spoons, and that these 5 spoons, plus the package she bought, made a total of 15 spoons. So, if we let \( x \) be the number of spoons in the package Julia bought, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 5 = 15 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 15 - 5 \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of spoons in the package Julia bought is 10."
"Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. He bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, so he bought 38 + 6 = 44 fish sausages. To find the total number of sausages, we add the chicken sausages and the fish sausages together: 38 + 44 = 82 sausages.

The final numerical answer is 82."
"If Lily made 50 friends, and Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, then Amy made 50 + 20 = 70 friends.

To find out how many friends Lily and Amy have together, we add the number of friends each of them has: 50 (Lily's friends) + 70 (Amy's friends) = 120 friends.

So, the final numerical answer is 120."
"First, let's find out how much each watermelon costs. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, and each pepper costs 15$, then each watermelon costs 3 * 15$ = 45$.

Next, we find out how much each orange costs. Since an orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs, and a watermelon costs 45$, then each orange costs 45$ - 5$ = 40$.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the items Dillon is buying.

For the watermelons: 4 watermelons * 45$ each = 180$
For the peppers: 20 peppers * 15$ each = 300$
For the oranges: 10 oranges * 40$ each = 400$

Adding these up, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is 180$ + 300$ + 400$ = 880$.

So, the final numerical answer is 880$."
"First, let's find out how many hours the hospital sees patients in a day. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can divide the total minutes in a day by 60 to find the number of hours.

Total minutes in a day = 24 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour = 1440 minutes/day

Number of hours the hospital sees patients = 1440 minutes/day / 60 minutes/hour = 24 hours/day

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from the patients. Each patient is seen for 24 minutes, so the number of patients seen in one hour is:

Number of patients seen in one hour = 60 minutes/hour / 24 minutes/patient = 2.5 patients/hour

Since the hospital sees 24 hours a day, the total number of patients seen in a day is:

Total patients seen in a day = 2.5 patients/hour * 24 hours/day = 60 patients/day

The hospital charges $200 an hour to the patients, so the total revenue from the patients in a day is:

Total revenue from patients = 60 patients/day * $200/patient = $12000/day

The doctors charge $150 an hour to the hospital, so the total cost for the doctors in a day is:

Total cost for doctors = 24 hours/day * $150/hour = $3600/day

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

Profit = Total revenue from patients - Total cost for doctors
Profit = $12000/day - $3600/day = $8400/day

So, the hospital makes a profit of $8400 from these visits each day."
"First, let's find out how many elves quit after children vomit on them. Since a third of the elves quit, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
\]

So, 20 elves quit after children vomit on them. Now, we subtract these 20 elves from the total number of elves to find out how many are left:

\[
60 - 20 = 40
\]

Next, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. We subtract these 10 elves from the 40 elves that are left:

\[
40 - 10 = 30
\]

So, the number of elves left is 30."
"In June, Joseph's expenditure was $500 - $60 = $440.

"First, let's calculate the number of tickets Pam used. Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and then the luge 2 times. So, she rode a total of 2 + 2 = 4 times. Since each ride costs 6 tickets, the total tickets Pam used is 4 times 6, which is 24 tickets.

Next, let's calculate the number of tickets Fred used. Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and then the luge 2 times. So, he rode a total of 4 + 2 = 6 times. Since each ride costs 6 tickets, the total tickets Fred used is 6 times 6, which is 36 tickets.

Now, to find the total number of tickets they used together, we add the tickets Pam used to the tickets Fred used: 24 + 36 = 60 tickets.

So, the final numerical answer is 60."
"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, let's break down the information given:

1. On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.
2. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he did on Monday. So, on Tuesday, he walked \(6 \times 4 = 24\) miles.
3. The total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles.

To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we can subtract the miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total miles walked from Monday through Wednesday.

So, the calculation is:
\[ \text{Miles on Wednesday} = \text{Total miles from Monday through Wednesday} - (\text{Miles on Monday} + \text{Miles on Tuesday}) \]
\[ \text{Miles on Wednesday} = 41 - (4 + 24) \]
\[ \text{Miles on Wednesday} = 41 - 28 \]
\[ \text{Miles on Wednesday} = 13 \]

So, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday."
"To find out how much Tom pays in a year for car washes, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, find out how many car washes Tom gets in a year. Since he gets 4 car washes a month, we multiply 4 by 12 (the number of months in a year):
   \[
   4 \text{ car washes/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 48 \text{ car washes/year}
   \]

2. Next, we need to calculate the total cost for 48 car washes. Each car wash costs $15, so we multiply 48 by $15:
   \[
   48 \text{ car washes} \times \$15/\text{car wash} = \$720
   \]

So, Tom pays $720 in a year for car washes."
"First, let's find out how many video games Brian has after losing 5 of them. Brian originally had 20 video games, but he lost 5, so:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Now, we know that Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian has. Since Brian now has 15 video games, we calculate 3 times that number:

\[ 3 \times 15 = 45 \]

Then, we subtract 5 from that number to find out how many video games Bobby has:

\[ 45 - 5 = 40 \]

So, Bobby has 40 video games."
"First, we need to find out how many unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands. We know that one third of the 27 unicorns are there. So we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 27 = 9 \]

So, there are 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.

Next, we need to find out how many of these 9 unicorns are female. We know that two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female. So we calculate:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

Therefore, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the subs:
2 subs * $7.50/sub = $15.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of the chips:
2 bags * $1.50/bag = $3.00

Then, let's calculate the cost of the cookies:
2 cookies * $1.00/cookie = $2.00

Now, let's add up the cost of the subs, chips, and cookies:
$15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

The delivery fee is 20% of the total cost before the fee:
20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00

Now, let's add the delivery fee to the total cost:
$20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Finally, let's add the tip:
$24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

So, the total cost of Rory's delivery order is $29.00."
"First, let's calculate how many questions Mark could complete in the given time for each test.

For the first test:
- Mark had 8 hours to complete the test.
- He completes 5 questions per hour.
- So, the total number of questions he could complete in 8 hours is \(8 \times 5 = 40\) questions.

For the second test:
- Mark had 6 hours to complete the test.
- He completes 5 questions per hour.
- So, the total number of questions he could complete in 6 hours is \(6 \times 5 = 30\) questions.

Now, let's find out how many questions he left incomplete for each test.

For the first test:
- The test had 75 questions.
- He completed 40 questions.
- So, the number of questions left incomplete is \(75 - 40 = 35\) questions.

For the second test:
- The test had 100 questions.
- He completed 30 questions.
- So, the number of questions left incomplete is \(100 - 30 = 70\) questions.

Now, let's find the total number of questions left incomplete for both tests combined:
- From the first test: 35 questions.
- From the second test: 70 questions.
- So, the total number of questions left incomplete is \(35 + 70 = 105\) questions.

The final numerical answer is:
105"
"First, let's find out how many blue gumballs there are. According to the question, there are 12 blue gumballs.

Now, we need to find out how many pink gumballs there are. The question states that there are 22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs as there are blue gumballs.

Let's denote the number of blue gumballs as B and the number of pink gumballs as P.

From the information given:
B = 12

The relationship between pink and blue gumballs is:
P = 4 * B + 22

Now, we substitute the value of B into the equation:
P = 4 * 12 + 22
P = 48 + 22
P = 70

So, there are 70 pink gumballs.

The final numerical answer is 70."
"First, let's find out how many semi-automatic cars there are. We know there are 20 cars in total. Out of these, 12 are automatic and 4 are manual. So, the number of semi-automatic cars is:

20 (total cars) - 12 (automatic cars) - 4 (manual cars) = 4 (semi-automatic cars)

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:

\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of the cars that are semi-automatic is 20%."
"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are 700 bees in total.
2. Let's say the number of queens is Q.
3. Since there are twice as many baby bees as queens, the number of baby bees is 2Q.
4. And there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so the number of worker bees is 2 * 2Q = 4Q.

Now, we know that the total number of bees is the sum of queens, baby bees, and worker bees:
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

So, there are 100 queens. Now we can find the number of worker bees:
\[ 4Q = 4 * 100 = 400 \]

Therefore, the number of worker bees is 400."
"First, we need to find out how many hours Jordan spends playing video games in a week. Since he plays for 2 hours every day, we multiply 2 hours by 7 days:

\[ 2 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much money Jordan would earn in a week if he worked those 14 hours at his part-time job. He earns $10 an hour, so we multiply 14 hours by $10 per hour:

\[ 14 \text{ hours/week} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 140 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 140 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the nonfood items before tax. The nonfood items are milk, eggs, light bulbs, cups, and roach traps. The costs are as follows:

- Milk: 2 dollars
- Eggs: 3 dollars
- Light bulbs: 3 dollars
- Cups: 3 dollars
- Roach traps: 4 dollars

Adding these up:
2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 15 dollars

Now, we need to calculate the tax on these nonfood items. The tax rate is 10%, so we calculate 10% of 15 dollars:
10% of 15 = 0.10 * 15 = 1.5 dollars

Adding the tax to the total cost of the nonfood items:
15 + 1.5 = 16.5 dollars

So, the total cost including tax for the nonfood items is 16.5 dollars. There is no mention of food items, so we don't need to add any cost for food items. Therefore, the total cost is 16.5 dollars."
"First, let's calculate the total number of clients Kim will have. He already has 3 clients and is talking to 5 more, so that's a total of 3 + 5 = 8 clients.

Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths. So, for 8 clients, the total number of bottles of bleach needed is 8 * 2 = 16 bottles. Each bottle of bleach costs $2, so the total cost for the bleach is 16 * $2 = $32.

The total cost for the packs of cloths is 8 * $5 = $40.

So, the total expenses for 8 clients are $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72.

Kim's total income each week is $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:

Profit = Total Income - Total Expenses
Profit = $92 - $72
Profit = $20

So, the final numerical answer is $20."
"First, let's find out how many pineapples John gets from his field in one harvest. Since he has 10 hectares and there are 100 pineapples per hectare, we can calculate the total number of pineapples per harvest as follows:

\[ 10 \text{ hectares} \times 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} = 1000 \text{ pineapples} \]

John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months. There are 12 months in a year, so we need to find out how many 3-month periods are in a year:

\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests/year} \]

Now, to find out how many pineapples John can harvest in a year, we multiply the number of pineapples per harvest by the number of harvests in a year:

\[ 1000 \text{ pineapples/harvest} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 4000 \]"
"First, let's find out how many pieces were in the second lego set. Since it had 3 times more pieces than the 500 piece one, we multiply 500 by 3:

\[ 500 \times 3 = 1500 \]

Next, let's find out how many pieces were in the third lego set. Since it had 1/4 the number of pieces as the first set, we divide 500 by 4:

\[ 500 \div 4 = 125 \]

Now, let's add up all the pieces Johnny has to pick up. We add the pieces from all three sets:

\[ 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125 \]

So, Johnny picks up a total of 2125 lego pieces."
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, half as many bees as left in the first 6 hours return. So, \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees return.
3. In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as left in the first 6 hours leave. So, \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees leave.
4. In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left before this time return to the hive.

Now, let's calculate the number of bees that return in the last 6 hours. Since 60 bees left in the third 6-hour period, all of these bees return in the last 6 hours.

So, the number of bees that Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours is 60.

The final numerical answer is:
60"
"To solve this, let's add the cost of one adult ticket and one child ticket together.

The cost of one adult ticket is $12.
The cost of one child ticket is $10.

So, the total cost for one adult and one child ticket is $12 + $10 = $22.

Brittany's mom received $8 in change, which means the amount she gave the cashier was the total cost plus the change she received.

Therefore, the amount she gave the cashier is $22 + $8 = $30.

The final numerical answer is 30."
"First, we need to find out how many friends Dorothy has. We know that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy. If Charlie has 12 friends, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Charlie's friends} = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

Given that Charlie has 12 friends:

\[ 12 = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

To find Dorothy's friends, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ \text{Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find out how many friends James has. We know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. So we set up the equation:

\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

Since Dorothy has 4 friends:

\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

So, James has 16 Facebook friends. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 16 \]"
"First, we need to convert the distance Steve lives from the school into feet because his speed is given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance in feet:
\[ 3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we calculate how long it takes Steve to bike home. His speed is 440 feet per minute.

Time for Steve to bike home:
\[ \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we convert the distance Tim lives from the school into feet.

Tim's distance in feet:
\[ 2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we calculate how long it takes Tim to skate home. His speed is 264 feet per minute.

Time for Tim to skate home:
\[ \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

The winner is Tim, who takes 40 minutes to get home. The loser is Steve, who takes 36 minutes to get home. The difference in their times is:

\[ 40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the winner (Tim) will be waiting at their house 4 minutes before the loser (Steve) finishes the race."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Bicycles:** Each bicycle has 2 tires. If 5 people came with bicycles, that's 5 bicycles * 2 tires/bicycle = 10 tires. Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, for 10 tires, the cost is 10 tires * 25 cents/tire = 250 cents. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, 250 cents is equal to 2.5 dollars.

2. **Tricycles:** Each tricycle has 3 tires. If 3 people came with tricycles, that's 3 tricycles * 3 tires/tricycle = 9 tires. The cost for inflating 9 tires is 9 tires * 25 cents/tire = 225 cents. Converting this to dollars, 225 cents is equal to 2.25 dollars.

3. **Unicycle:** A unicycle has 1 tire. If 1 person came with a unicycle, the cost for inflating 1 tire is 1 tire * 25 cents/tire = 25 cents, which is equal to 0.25 dollars.

Now, let's add up all the money she made:
- From bicycles: 2.5 dollars
- From tricycles: 2.25 dollars
- From unicycle: 0.25 dollars

Total money made = 2.5 + 2.25 + 0.25 = 5 dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is 5 dollars."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Carl buys. He buys ten packs, and each pack has six cookies.

Total cookies = Number of packs × Cookies per pack
Total cookies = 10 × 6
Total cookies = 60

Next, we need to find out the total cost of these cookies. Each cookie costs $0.10.

Total cost = Total cookies × Cost per cookie
Total cost = 60 × $0.10
Total cost = $6.00

Now, we need to find out how much change Carl receives if he pays with a $10 bill.

Change = Amount paid - Total cost
Change = $10.00 - $6.00
Change = $4.00

So, the final numerical answer is $4.00."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many french fries were in the pack when Dave bought it.

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
4. After the pigeons, the number of fries left is \( 14 + 7 - 9 = 12 \) fries.
5. A raccoon ate two thirds of the remaining fries, so it ate \( \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \) fries.
6. After the raccoon, the number of fries left is \( 12 - 8 = 4 \) fries.
7. Ants carried off a final french fry, leaving 5 fries.

So, the number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it was 16.

"To solve this, let's break it down day by day and then sum it up for the entire semester.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes each day. Each class is 1 hour long. So, for each of these days, he spends:
\[ 3 \text{ classes/day} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} = 3 \text{ hours/day} \]

Since there are 3 such days in a week (Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays), the total hours spent on these days in one week is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week} \]

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes each day. Each class is 2 hours long. So, for each of these days, he spends:
\[ 2 \text{ classes/day} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 4 \text{ hours/day} \]

Since there are 2 such days in a week (Tuesdays and Thursdays), the total hours spent on these days in one week is:
\[ 4 \text{ hours/day} \times 2 \text{ days/week} = 8 \text{ hours/week} \]

Now, let's add the hours spent on all days in one week:
\[ 9 \text{ hours/week} + 8 \text{ hours/week} = 17 \text{ hours/week} \]

Since there are 16 weeks in the semester, the total hours spent attending classes in one semester is:
\[ 17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is 272 hours."
"First, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good in inches.

For the rolls:
Bill bakes 300 rolls, and each roll is 4 inches long.
So, the total length of the rolls is \(300 \times 4 = 1200\) inches.

For the chocolate croissants:
Bill bakes 120 croissants, and each croissant is 6 inches long.
So, the total length of the croissants is \(120 \times 6 = 720\) inches.

For the baguettes:
Bill bakes 60 baguettes, and each baguette is 2 feet long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) inches long.
So, the total length of the baguettes is \(60 \times 24 = 1440\) inches.

Now, let's add up the total length of all the baked goods in inches:
Total length = length of rolls + length of croissants + length of baguettes
Total length = \(1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360\) inches.

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
Total length in feet = \(3360 \div 12 = 280\) feet.

So, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is 280 feet."
"First, let's calculate the total number of bananas each type of ape needs in one month:

- Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
- Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
- Baboons need 100 bananas per month.

Now, let's add up the total number of bananas needed by all the apes in one month:

\[ 200 \text{ (monkeys)} + 400 \text{ (gorillas)} + 100 \text{ (baboons)} = 700 \text{ bananas per month} \]

Since the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months, we need to find out how many bananas are needed for 2 months:

\[ 700 \text{ bananas per month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 1400 \text{ bananas} \]

So, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"First, let's calculate how far Blake runs. Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. So, for each round trip, he runs 100 yards to the end and 100 yards back, which is 200 yards. Since he does this 15 times, the total distance Blake runs is:
\[ 200 \text{ yards/round trip} \times 15 \text{ round trips} = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate how far Kelly runs. Kelly runs back and forth once to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards for each round trip. She does this 34 times, so the total distance Kelly runs is:
\[ 80 \text{ yards/round trip} \times 34 \text{ round trips} = 2720 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we need to find out how much farther Blake runs than Kelly. We subtract the total distance Kelly runs from the total distance Blake runs:
\[ 3000 \text{ yards} - 2720 \text{ yards} = 280 \text{ yards} \]

So, the winner runs 280 yards farther than the loser. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 280 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the pens. Raphael bought 4 pens and each pen costs $1.5. So, the total cost for the pens is:

"First, let's find out how many starfish Locsin caught. Anakin caught 10 starfish, and Locsin caught 5 fewer, so:
\[ 10 - 5 = 5 \text{ starfish} \]

Next, let's find out how many sea horses Locsin caught. Anakin caught 6 sea horses, and Locsin caught 3 fewer, so:
\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \text{ sea horses} \]

Now, let's find out how many clownfish Locsin caught. Anakin caught 3 clownfish, and Locsin caught 2 more, so:
\[ 3 + 2 = 5 \text{ clownfish} \]

Now we can calculate the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin together. Anakin caught:
\[ 10 \text{ starfish} + 6 \text{ sea horses} + 3 \text{ clownfish} = 19 \text{ fish} \]

Locsin caught:
\[ 5 \text{ starfish} + 3 \text{ sea horses} + 5 \text{ clownfish} = 13 \text{ fish} \]

So, the total number of fish they caught together is:
\[ 19 + 13 = 32 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out what 20% of the original price is. The original price is $20.

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 20 = \frac{20}{100} \times 20 = 0.2 \times 20 = 4 \]

So, the price increases by $4 every two months. Now, let's calculate how many times the price will increase in 36 months. Since the price increases every two months, we divide 36 by 2:

\[ \frac{36}{2} = 18 \]

This means the price will increase 18 times. Each time the price increases by $4, we can calculate the new price by adding $4 to the previous price. However, we can also use a formula to find the final price after 18 increases. The formula for the final price after a series of percentage increases is:

\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} \times (1 + \text{Increase Rate})^{\text{Number of Increases}} \]

Here, the increase rate is 20%, or 0.2, and the number of increases is 18. So, we have:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 20 \times (1 + 0.2)^{18} = 20 \times (1.2)^{18} \]

Now, let's calculate \( (1.2)^{18} \):

\[ (1.2)^{18} \approx 10.488 \]

So, the final price is:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 20 \times 10.488 = 209.76 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the final price is $209.76. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{209.76} \]"
"First, let's find out how much one red car costs. According to the problem, one red car costs $4.

Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and we know that one action figure costs $5, then 3 action figures would cost:

So, the doll costs $15.

Now, we know that one red car costs $4 and the doll costs $15. We need to find the total cost of all the toys:
\[ 5 \text{ red cars} + 3 \text{ action figures} + 1 \text{ doll} \]
\[ = 5 \times 4 + 3 \times 5 + 15 \]
\[ = 20 + 15 + 15 \]
\[ = 50 \]

So, the total value of all the toys is $50."
"First, let's figure out how much money Jackie would lose if she does her taxes herself. She would lose 3 hours of freelance work, and she earns $35 per hour from freelance work. So, the total loss would be:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105 \]

Now, if Jackie hires an accountant, she has to pay $90 for the service. To find out how much more money she would have if she hires the accountant, we need to compare the loss from doing her own taxes to the cost of hiring an accountant.

Since the loss from doing her own taxes is $105 and the cost of hiring an accountant is $90, the difference is:

\[ \$105 - \$90 = \$15 \]

So, Jackie will have $15 less if she hires the accountant. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ -\$15 \]"

"To make 1 Spanish flan, Sandra needs 3 eggs. For 15 Spanish flans, she would need:

\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Her neighbor gives her 9 eggs each time she babysits. To find out how many times she needs to babysit to get 45 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets from babysitting:

\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysittings} \]

So, Sandra has to babysit 5 times to make 15 Spanish flans."
"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Let's say Brooke's current age is \( B \).
2. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's current age is \( 2B \).
3. In 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \).
4. In 2 years, Seth's age will be \( 2B + 2 \).
5. According to the problem, the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28. So we can write the equation:
   \[
   (B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28
   \]
6. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   B + 2 + 2B + 2 = 28
   \]
   \[
   3B + 4 = 28
   \]
7. Subtract 4 from both sides:
   \[
   3B = 24
   \]
8. Divide both sides by 3:
   \[
   B = 8
   \]
9. Now that we know Brooke's current age is 8, we can find Seth's current age:
   \[
   \text{Seth's age} = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16
   \]

So, Seth is 16 years old."
"First, we need to find out how much money twice the amount Ethel has is. Since Ethel has $8, twice that amount is:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Now, Jimmy has $2 more than this amount. So, we add $2 to $16:

\[ 16 + 2 = 18 \]

Therefore, Jimmy has $18."
"To solve this, let's break it down:

- From Monday to Friday, Pancho walks 20 miles each day. So, for 5 days, he walks \(20 \times 5 = 100\) miles.
- On Saturday and Sunday, he walks 10 miles each day. So, for 2 days, he walks \(10 \times 2 = 20\) miles.

Now, let's add the miles he walks from Monday to Friday to the miles he walks on Saturday and Sunday:
- Total miles = miles from Monday to Friday + miles from Saturday and Sunday
- Total miles = 100 + 20 = 120 miles

So, the final numerical answer is 120 miles."
"First, let's find out how much the jacket costs. The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, and the hat costs $25. So, the jacket costs:
\[ 3 \times 25 = 75 \]

Next, we need to find out how much the pants cost. The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket. The average of $25 and $75 is:
\[ \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \]

Now, to find the total cost of one uniform, we add the cost of the hat, the jacket, and the pants:
\[ 25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \]

So, the total cost of each uniform is $150."
"First, let's calculate the total number of legs for the spiders. There are 80 spiders, and each spider has 8 legs. So, the total number of legs for the spiders is:
\[ 80 \times 8 = 640 \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of legs for the insects. There are 90 insects, and each insect has 6 legs. So, the total number of legs for the insects is:
\[ 90 \times 6 = 540 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs for the rare mutant invertebrates. There are 3 invertebrates, and each invertebrate has 10 legs. So, the total number of legs for the invertebrates is:
\[ 3 \times 10 = 30 \]

To find the total number of legs Jake sees, we add the legs from the spiders, insects, and invertebrates together:
\[ 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 \]

So, the total number of legs Jake sees is:
\[ 1210 \]"
"First, let's figure out the ages of the birds based on the information given.

1. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, we add up the ages of all four birds:
\[ 8 + 8 + 16 + 19 = 51 \]

So, the total age of the four birds is 51."
"First, let's find out the total minimum monthly payment for all her debts:
- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. To find out how much that is, we calculate 50% of $1000 and add it to the minimum:
- 50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500
- Total payment per month = $1000 + $500 = $1500/month

Now, to find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12 (months in a year):
- Total payment per year = $1500 * 12 = $18000

So, the final numerical answer is $18000."
"First, let's find out how long it takes Billy to peel one potato and one potato after cutting. It takes 1.5 minutes to peel a potato and 5 seconds to cut it. Since 1 minute is equal to 60 seconds, 1.5 minutes is equal to 90 seconds. So, it takes 90 seconds to peel a potato and 5 seconds to cut it, which totals 95 seconds for one potato.

Billy has 60 potatoes to prepare. So, we multiply the time it takes to prepare one potato by the number of potatoes:

95 seconds/potato * 60 potatoes = 5700 seconds.

To convert 5700 seconds into minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):

5700 seconds ÷ 60 = 95 minutes.

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes."
"First, let's calculate the total cost for each gallon of lemonade. The cost for lemons is $3 and the cost for sugar is $2, so the total cost per gallon is:
\[ 3 + 2 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much they make from selling 20 glasses of lemonade. Since each glass is sold for $0.50, the total revenue from 20 glasses is:
\[ 20 \times 0.50 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. They made a profit of $25, so we can set up the following equation to find the total cost:
\[ \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = \text{Profit} \]
\[ 10 - \text{Total Cost} = 25 \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 10 - 25 = -15 \text{ dollars} \]

This negative value indicates an error in the interpretation of the problem. Let's recheck the profit calculation. The profit is $25, and the revenue is $10, so the cost must be:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 10 - 25 = -15 \text{ dollars} \]
This is incorrect because the cost cannot be negative. Let's re-evaluate the problem with the correct interpretation that the total cost is $15 (since the profit is $25 and the revenue is $10, the cost must be $15).

Now, we need to find out how many gallons they made to spend $15 on lemons. Since the cost per gallon is $5, the number of gallons they made is:
\[ \text{Number of Gallons} = \frac{15}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons} \]

The cost for lemons for 3 gallons is:
\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount they spent on lemons is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"First, let's find out how many Chinese people were in the race. We know there were 240 Asians in total, and 80 of them were Japanese. So, the number of Chinese people is:

240 Asians - 80 Japanese = 160 Chinese

We are told that there were 60 boys on the Chinese team. To find out how many girls were on the team, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese people:

160 Chinese - 60 boys = 100 girls

So, the number of girls on the Chinese team is 100."
"First, let's find out how much Zaid spends on rent, car fuel, and the rest of his expenses.

Zaid's salary is 6000$ per month.

He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent:
\[ \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \]

He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel:
\[ \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \]

Now, let's find out how much money is left after rent and car fuel:
\[ \text{Remaining after rent and car fuel} = 6000 - (1500 + 2000) = 6000 - 3500 = 2500 \]

Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity:
\[ \text{Donation to charity} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \]

Now, let's find out how much money Zaid has left after the donation:
\[ \text{Remaining after donation} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \]

Zaid gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$:
\[ \text{Total given to daughter and wife} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Finally, let's find out how much money Zaid has left after giving money to his daughter and wife:
\[ \text{Remaining after giving to daughter and wife} = 1250 - 900 = 350 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 350$."
"First, let's find out how many crabs Monic has. Since Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, and Bo has 40 crabs, we can calculate Monic's crabs as follows:

\[ \text{Monic's crabs} = \text{Bo's crabs} - 4 = 40 - 4 = 36 \]

Next, we know that Rani has ten more crabs than Monic. So, we can calculate Rani's crabs as follows:

\[ \text{Rani's crabs} = \text{Monic's crabs} + 10 = 36 + 10 = 46 \]

Now, to find the total number of crabs the three have together, we add the number of crabs each one has:

\[ \text{Total crabs} = \text{Bo's crabs} + \text{Monic's crabs} + \text{Rani's crabs} = 40 + 36 + 46 \]

Let's add these numbers:

\[ 40 + 36 = 76 \]
\[ 76 + 46 = 122 \]

So, the total number of crabs the three have together is:

\[ 122 \]"
"To find out how much Lloyd earned, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then add them together.

For the first week:
- He tutored for 5 hours.
- He earns $10 an hour.
- So, his earnings for the first week = 5 hours * $10/hour = $50.

For the second week:
- He tutored for 8 hours.
- He earns $10 an hour.
- So, his earnings for the second week = 8 hours * $10/hour = $80.

Now, we add the earnings from both weeks:
- Total earnings = $50 (first week) + $80 (second week) = $130.

So, Lloyd earned $130 for the first two weeks."
"First, let's find out how many votes the winner got. If the winner got 3/4 of the votes and there were 80 students who voted, we can calculate the number of votes the winner got by multiplying 80 by 3/4.

\[ \text{Votes for winner} = 80 \times \frac{3}{4} \]

Let's do the multiplication:

\[ 80 \times \frac{3}{4} = 80 \times 0.75 = 60 \]

So, the winner got 60 votes. Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser got would be the total votes minus the votes the winner got.

\[ \text{Votes for loser} = 80 - 60 = 20 \]

So, the number of votes the loser got is 20."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say the number of white carnations Sandra ordered is \( x \).
2. According to the problem, Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. So, the number of red roses is \( 4x \).
3. Sandra also ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which are five times the number of white carnations. So, \( 5x = 200 \).

First, we need to find the value of \( x \) from the equation \( 5x = 200 \).

\[ x = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Now that we know \( x = 40 \), we can find the number of red roses.

\[ \text{Number of red roses} = 4x = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

So, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

The final numerical answer is:
160"
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.
3. Jan is 30 years old.

We need to find out how old Jean is.

From point 3, we know Jan's current age is 30. So, two years ago, Jan's age was 30 - 2 = 28 years.

From point 2, we know that two years ago, Mark's age was 5 years older than half of Jan's age two years ago. So, Mark's age two years ago was 28 / 2 + 5 = 14 + 5 = 19 years.

Since two years ago Mark was 19 years old, his current age is 19 + 2 = 21 years.

From point 1, we know Jean is two years older than Mark. So, Jean's current age is 21 + 2 = 23 years.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 23."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes for the faster team to complete the race.

Each member of the faster team runs their leg in 55 seconds. Since there are four members, the total time for the faster team is:
\[ 55 \text{ seconds/member} \times 4 \text{ members} = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for the slower team to complete the race.

The first runner takes 60 seconds. The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they take 57 seconds. The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they take 54 seconds. The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they take 51 seconds.

Now, let's add up the times for the slower team:
\[ 60 \text{ seconds} + 57 \text{ seconds} + 54 \text{ seconds} + 51 \text{ seconds} = 222 \text{ seconds} \]

Now we need to find out how many seconds the faster team wins by. We subtract the total time of the faster team from the total time of the slower team:
\[ 222 \text{ seconds} - 220 \text{ seconds} = 2 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the faster team will win by:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, let's determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers on a six-sided die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Next, let's determine the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:
\[ \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also:
\[ \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25 \]

Now, we need to find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by finding the difference in probabilities and then converting that difference to a percentage.

The difference in probabilities is:
\[ 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 \]

To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.25 \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ 25\% \]"
"Jenna's mom picked 20 apples. Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, Jenna picked 20 / 2 = 10 apples. Together, they picked 20 + 10 = 30 apples.

The final numerical answer is 30."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
2. There are 3 cages of rats, and the total number of rats is not given, but we can use the total straw given to find out.
3. Each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
4. There are 10 cages of hamsters, and the total number of hamsters is not given, but we can use the total straw given to find out.
5. There are 20 pieces of straw given to the rabbits.
6. The total straw distributed among the small rodents is 160 pieces.

First, let's calculate the total straw given to the hamsters:
- Each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
- There are 10 cages of hamsters, so there are 10 hamsters.
- Total straw for hamsters = 10 hamsters * 5 pieces/hamster = 50 pieces.

Now, let's calculate the total straw given to the rabbits:
- There are 20 pieces of straw given to the rabbits.

Now, let's calculate the total straw given to the rats:
- The total straw distributed among the small rodents is 160 pieces.
- Straw given to hamsters = 50 pieces.
- Straw given to rabbits = 20 pieces.
- Straw given to rats = 160 total pieces - 50 hamster pieces - 20 rabbit pieces = 90 pieces.

Now, we know that each rat gets 6 pieces of straw and the total straw given to the rats is 90 pieces. To find out how many rats there are, we divide the total straw for rats by the number of pieces each rat gets:
- Number of rats = 90 pieces / 6 pieces/rat = 15 rats.

Since there are 3 cages of rats, we can find out how many rats are in each cage by dividing the total number of rats by the number of cages:
- Number of rats in each cage = 15 rats / 3 cages = 5 rats/cage.

So, the final numerical answer is:
5"
"To solve this, we need to calculate the interest for 3 months and add it to the original amount Mandy owes.

The monthly interest is 2%, so for 3 months, the interest would be:
\[ 2\% \times 3 = 6\% \]

The original amount Mandy owes is $100. To find the total amount Mandy should give after 3 months, we calculate the interest and add it to the original amount:
\[ \text{Total amount} = \text{Original amount} + (\text{Original amount} \times \text{Interest rate}) \]
\[ \text{Total amount} = 100 + (100 \times 0.06) \]
\[ \text{Total amount} = 100 + 6 \]
\[ \text{Total amount} = 106 \]

So, Mandy should give Benedict $106."
"First, let's calculate the total cost for the trader. The trader buys each bag of wheat for $20 and it costs $2 to transport each bag. So, the total cost per bag is $20 + $2 = $22.

The trader made a total profit of $400 after selling all the bags at a rate of $30 each. To find out the total revenue from selling all the bags, we add the profit to the total cost. So, the total revenue is $400 + $22 per bag * number of bags.

Let's denote the number of bags as \( n \). The total revenue can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 30n \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 22n \]
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = \text{Total Cost} + \text{Profit} \]
\[ 30n = 22n + 400 \]

Now, we solve for \( n \):
\[ 30n - 22n = 400 \]
\[ 8n = 400 \]
\[ n = \frac{400}{8} \]
\[ n = 50 \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food.

The cost of the tickets is $20.25.

The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, so:
\[ \text{Cost of food} = \$20.25 - \$4.50 = \$15.75 \]

Now, let's add the cost of the tickets and the cost of the food to find the total cost of the tickets and food:
\[ \text{Total cost of tickets and food} = \$20.25 + \$15.75 = \$36.00 \]

Next, we need to add the cost of the rides. They went on 2 rides, each costing $33:
\[ \text{Total cost of rides} = 2 \times \$33 = \$66.00 \]

Now, let's find the total cost by adding the cost of the tickets and food to the cost of the rides:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$36.00 + \$66.00 = \$102.00 \]

Since they agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:
\[ \text{Cost per person} = \frac{\$102.00}{3} = \$34.00 \]

So, each of them paid:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"To solve this, we need to find out how many peaches John collects in 3 hours.

First, we need to know how many minutes are in 3 hours. There are 60 minutes in one hour, so in 3 hours there are:
\[ 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

John collects 2 peaches every minute. So, in 180 minutes, he will collect:
\[ 180 \times 2 = 360 \text{ peaches} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 360 peaches."
"To find out how many pounds of insects the ducks need per day, we first need to calculate the total amount of insects needed for the week and then divide that by the number of days in a week.

The total amount of insects needed for the week is 3.5 pounds.

There are 7 days in a week.

So, to find out how many pounds of insects they need per day, we divide 3.5 pounds by 7 days.

\[ \text{Pounds of insects per day} = \frac{3.5 \text{ pounds}}{7 \text{ days}} \]

\[ \text{Pounds of insects per day} = 0.5 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 0.5 pounds."
"First, let's calculate how many trees Tom adds and subtracts each year. He plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees, so the net increase in trees each year is:

\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees after 10 years, considering the net increase of 8 trees per year:

\[ 50 + 8 \times 10 = 50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees} \]

After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. To find out how many trees die, we calculate 30% of 130:

\[ 0.30 \times 130 = 39 \text{ trees} \]

So, the number of trees left after 30% die is:

\[ 130 - 39 = 91 \text{ trees} \]

"First, let's find out how many flamingos were taken back on Saturday. The neighbors took back one third of the 18 pink flamingos, which is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6 \]

So, 6 pink flamingos were taken back and painted white. Now, let's see how many pink flamingos are left after the neighbors took back 6:

\[ 18 - 6 = 12 \]

On Sunday, they added another 18 pink flamingos to the collection. So, the total number of pink flamingos on Sunday is:

\[ 12 + 18 = 30 \]

On Sunday, they also put back the 6 white flamingos that were painted. So, the total number of white flamingos on Sunday is:

\[ 6 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more pink flamingos there are than white flamingos:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

So, at noon on Sunday, there are 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 24 \]"
"Violetta needs crayons in 5 different colors, and each crayon costs $2. So, the total cost for 5 crayons is:

\[ 5 \text{ crayons} \times \$2 \text{ per crayon} = \$10 \]

Violetta prepared $20 for this purchase. To find out how much change she will get, we subtract the total cost of the crayons from the amount she prepared:

\[ \$20 - \$10 = \$10 \]

So, the change Violetta will get is:

\[ \$10 \]"
"First, let's find out how much a pen costs. We know that a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined. So, we add the cost of a pencil and an eraser:

Cost of a pencil = $1.20
Cost of an eraser = $0.30

Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser
Cost of a pen = $1.20 + $0.30
Cost of a pen = $1.50

Now, we need to find out how much 8 pens will cost. We multiply the cost of one pen by 8:

Cost of 8 pens = Cost of one pen × 8
Cost of 8 pens = $1.50 × 8
Cost of 8 pens = $12.00

So, the final numerical answer is $12.00."
"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we first need to calculate the total amount of carrots that will be distributed to the restaurants.

Each restaurant gets 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. So, the total amount of carrots distributed is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds/restaurant} \times 40 \text{ restaurants} = 80 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we subtract the total amount of carrots distributed from the initial amount of carrots to find out how many pounds will not be used:
\[ 200 \text{ pounds} - 80 \text{ pounds} = 120 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used is:

"To find out how many children there are in Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

Total population = 23786
Number of men = 8417
Number of women = 9092

Number of children = Total population - (Number of men + Number of women)

Let's calculate the number of children:
Number of children = 23786 - (8417 + 9092)

First, add the number of men and women:
8417 + 9092 = 17509

Now, subtract this sum from the total population:
23786 - 17509 = 6277

So, the number of children in Soda is 6277."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.
2. After a month, she collected three times that number. So, she collected \(3 \times 20 = 60\) cards.
3. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month. So, she collected \(60 - 20 = 40\) cards.
4. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number of cards from the first and second months is \(20 + 60 = 80\). So, she collected \(2 \times 80 = 160\) cards.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards Elaine has now:

- Initial cards: 20
- Cards collected in the first month: 60
- Cards collected in the second month: 40
- Cards collected in the third month: 160

Total cards = Initial cards + Cards from the first month + Cards from the second month + Cards from the third month

"First, let's find out how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher. Since he edits an equal number of sentences each week for both publishers and he edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits 1000 / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher.

Now, let's calculate how much Publisher A pays Mark. Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence, and he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A. So, the total amount Publisher A pays Mark is 500 * 5 = 2500 cents.

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays Mark 5 * 2 = 10 cents per sentence. Since Mark edits 500 sentences for Publisher B, the total amount Publisher B pays Mark is 500 * 10 = 5000 cents.

To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we add the amounts from both publishers: 2500 cents (from Publisher A) + 5000 cents (from Publisher B) = 7500 cents.

So, the final numerical answer is 7500 cents."
"To find out how many liters of water Baldur gets every day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pails of water Baldur gets in a day.
2. Multiply the total number of pails by the number of liters each pail contains.

First, let's find out how many pails he gets in a day:
- In the morning, he gets 5 pails.
- In the afternoon, he gets 6 pails.
- So, in total, he gets \(5 + 6 = 11\) pails of water every day.

Next, we know that each pail contains 5 liters of water. So, to find out the total liters of water he gets in a day, we multiply the total number of pails by the number of liters each pail contains:
- \(11 \text{ pails} \times 5 \text{ liters/pail} = 55 \text{ liters}\).

So, Baldur gets 55 liters of water every day."
"First, let's calculate John's new salary after the 5% raise. His original salary is $2000 a week. A 5% raise means he gets an additional 5% of $2000.

\[ \text{Raise amount} = 2000 \times \frac{5}{100} = 2000 \times 0.05 = 100 \]

So, his new salary after the raise is:

\[ \text{New salary} = 2000 + 100 = 2100 \]

Now, we need to calculate how much he makes in a year. Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we multiply his new weekly salary by 52.

\[ \text{Total yearly salary} = 2100 \times 52 = 109200 \]

John also gets a one-time monetary reward of $5000. To find out his total earnings for the year, we add the one-time reward to his total yearly salary.

\[ \text{Total yearly earnings} = 109200 + 5000 = 114200 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 114200 \]"
"First, we need to find out how many tons of grapes Josie's farm produces in a year. Since each acre produces 5 tons of grapes and she has 10 acres, we multiply the number of acres by the tons per acre:

\[ 10 \text{ acres} \times 5 \text{ tons/acre} = 50 \text{ tons} \]

Next, we need to find out how many barrels of wine can be made from these tons of grapes. Since each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine, we multiply the total tons of grapes by the barrels per ton:

\[ 50 \text{ tons} \times 2 \text{ barrels/ton} = 100 \text{ barrels} \]

So, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year."
"First, let's calculate the number of slices of cheese Carl used for the sandwiches. He ate a sandwich every day for 5 days, and each sandwich used 2 slices of cheese. So, the total slices of cheese for sandwiches is:
\[ 5 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 10 \text{ slices} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of slices of cheese Carl used for the omelets. He used 1 more slice per omelet than per sandwich, so each omelet used:
\[ 2 \text{ slices} + 1 \text{ slice} = 3 \text{ slices} \]
He made omelets for 3 days, so the total slices of cheese for omelets is:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices} \]

Carl also made a big dish of macaroni and cheese using 8 slices of cheese. So, the total slices of cheese used for the macaroni and cheese is:
\[ 8 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we add up all the slices of cheese used:
\[ 10 \text{ slices} + 9 \text{ slices} + 8 \text{ slices} = 27 \text{ slices} \]

So, the total number of slices of cheese Carl used is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of blue pens Janet bought. She bought 6 bags of blue pens, and each bag contains 9 pens. So, the total number of blue pens is:
\[ 6 \text{ bags} \times 9 \text{ pens per bag} = 54 \text{ blue pens} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of red pens Janet bought. She bought 2 bags of red pens, and each bag contains 6 pens. So, the total number of red pens is:
\[ 2 \text{ bags} \times 6 \text{ pens per bag} = 12 \text{ red pens} \]

Now, let's find out the total number of pens Janet has now. She originally had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens. Adding the blue and red pens she bought, the total number of pens is:
\[ 22 \text{ green pens} + 10 \text{ yellow pens} + 54 \text{ blue pens} + 12 \text{ red pens} = 98 \text{ pens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this, we need to find out what score Brinley needs on her sixth test to have an average of 93. Here's how we can do it step by step:

1. First, we need to calculate the sum of the first five test scores:
   89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 440

2. Let's say Brinley needs to score \( x \) on her sixth test. After removing the lowest score, she will have the sum of the four highest scores plus her sixth test score. The lowest score among the first five is 71, so we will subtract 71 from the sum of the first five scores.

3. The sum of the four highest scores is:
   89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367

4. After removing the lowest score, the sum of the four highest scores plus the sixth test score will be:
   367 + x

5. To get an average of 93 over six tests, the total sum of the six test scores should be:
   93 * 6 = 558

6. So, we set up the equation:
   367 + x = 558

7. Solving for \( x \):
   x = 558 - 367
   x = 191

So, Brinley needs to score 191 on her sixth test to get an average of 93.

The final numerical answer is 191."
"First, let's calculate the distance Micheal rode in the first four weeks. He rode at least 5 times a week and each time he rode 25 kilometers.

So, in one week, he rode:
\[ 5 \text{ rides/week} \times 25 \text{ km/ride} = 125 \text{ km/week} \]

For four weeks, the total distance he rode is:
\[ 125 \text{ km/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 500 \text{ km} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance he rode in the next three weeks. Now he rides 2 times a week and each time he rides 60 kilometers.

So, in one week, he rode:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/week} \times 60 \text{ km/ride} = 120 \text{ km/week} \]

For three weeks, the total distance he rode is:
\[ 120 \text{ km/week} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ km} \]

Now, let's add the distances from both periods to find the total distance Micheal rode:
\[ 500 \text{ km} + 360 \text{ km} = 860 \text{ km} \]

So, the total distance Micheal rode is:
\[ \boxed{860} \]"
"First, we need to find out how much each candied apple weighs. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple and each chocolate bar weighs 40g, each candied apple weighs:

\[ \text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{40g}{2} = 20g \]

Now, we can calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then add them together.

The total weight of the chocolate bars is:

\[ \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40g = 1000g \]

The total weight of the candied apples is:

\[ \text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20g = 1600g \]

Adding these together gives the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:

\[ \text{Total weight of Joe's bag of candy} = 1000g + 1600g = 2600g \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2600 \]"
"First, let's find out how many cakes Rose bought on Tuesday. She bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. Since she bought 4 cakes on Monday, on Tuesday she bought:

\[ 12 \times 5 = 60 \text{ cakes} \]

Now, to find out the total number of cakes she bought after all three days, we add the number of cakes she bought on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday:

\[ 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 \text{ cakes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's break down the question into smaller parts to understand it better.

1. Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
2. Each plate costs $6000.

We need to find the total cost of buying each cup.

Let's start by calculating the total cost of half a dozen plates:
- Half a dozen plates mean 6 plates.
- Each plate costs $6000.
- So, the total cost for 6 plates is \(6 \times 6000 = 36000\).

According to the question, the cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than this total cost:
- The cost of twenty dozen cups is \(36000 - 1200 = 34800\).

Now, we need to find out how many cups are in twenty dozen:
- Twenty dozen means \(20 \times 12 = 240\) cups.

To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of the cups by the number of cups:
- The cost of each cup is \(34800 \div 240\).

Let's calculate this division:
- \(34800 \div 240 = 145\).

So, the total cost of buying each cup is:
\[
\boxed{145}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes.

The jacket costs $30.
Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the shoes cost $20 * 2 = $40.

The total cost for the jacket and shoes is $30 + $40 = $70.

Now, let's calculate how much money Sara earns from babysitting. She babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so she earns $5 * 4 = $20 from babysitting.

She also earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. We need to find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining money after babysitting.

The total money Sara needs is $70, and she already has $10 saved. So, she needs $70 - $10 = $60 more.

If she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we need to find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn $60. We can calculate this by dividing the remaining money by the amount she earns per mowing.

So, the number of times she needs to mow the lawn is $60 / $4 = 15.

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 15 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes."
"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Let's say Jerry has \( r \) red chickens.
2. Since he has two more white chickens than red chickens, he has \( r + 2 \) white chickens.
3. Red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, so \( r \) red chickens produce \( 3r \) eggs a day.
4. White chickens produce 5 eggs a day, so \( r + 2 \) white chickens produce \( 5(r + 2) \) eggs a day.
5. The total number of eggs collected each day is the sum of the eggs from the red and white chickens, which is \( 3r + 5(r + 2) \).
6. We know that the total number of eggs collected each day is 42. So we can set up the equation:
   \[
   3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
   \]
7. Now, let's solve the equation:
   \[
   3r + 5r + 10 = 42
   \]
   \[
   8r + 10 = 42
   \]
   \[
   8r = 32
   \]
   \[
   r = 4
   \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

The final numerical answer is:
4"
"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the total distance he walks. Since the park is a rectangle, the distance around it (the perimeter) is calculated by adding up all the sides. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the length is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles, we can plug these values into the formula:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we divide the total distance by his speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park."
"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, let's break down the information given:

- On the first day, she counted 100 customers.
- On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so that's 100 + 50 = 150 customers.
- By the end of the third day, the total number of customers counted was 500.

To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we can subtract the number of customers counted on the first and second days from the total number of customers counted by the end of the third day.

So, the calculation is:
\[ \text{Customers on the third day} = \text{Total customers by the third day} - (\text{Customers on the first day} + \text{Customers on the second day}) \]
\[ \text{Customers on the third day} = 500 - (100 + 150) \]
\[ \text{Customers on the third day} = 500 - 250 \]
\[ \text{Customers on the third day} = 250 \]

So, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is 250."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say the small pool has \( S \) gallons of water now.
2. Since 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, the big pool had \( 2S \) gallons of water 4 minutes ago.
3. Both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. So, in 4 minutes, the big pool would have lost \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) gallons of water.
4. Therefore, the big pool now has \( 2S - 16 \) gallons of water.
5. According to the problem, now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So, \( 2S - 16 = 4S \).

Now, let's solve the equation \( 2S - 16 = 4S \):

"First, let's find out the total cost of the pair of shoes and the belt.

The shoes cost $320.00 and the belt costs $32.00. So, the total cost is:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Lori earns $8.00 per hour at her part-time job. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44.00 \]

So, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase."
"First, let's find out how much Janeth promised to return. She promised to return the original $2000 plus 10% of that amount. So, we calculate 10% of $2000:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$2000 = \frac{10}{100} \times 2000 = \$200 \]

So, the total amount she promised to return is:

\[ \$2000 + \$200 = \$2200 \]

Janeth is paying $165 a month for 12 months. So, the total amount she will pay over 12 months is:

\[ \$165 \times 12 = \$1980 \]

Now, to find out the remaining balance, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she promised to return:

\[ \$2200 - \$1980 = \$220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance by the end of 12 months will be \$220."
"There are 4 roses in the vase.
There are 7 more dahlias than roses, so there are 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias.
To find the total number of flowers, we add the roses and dahlias together: 4 + 11 = 15.

The total number of flowers in the vase is 15."
"First, let's find out the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack.

We know Harriet is 21 years old now. Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, we can calculate Zack's age as follows:
\[ \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years old} \]

Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so:
\[ \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years old} \]

Now, let's find their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years: \(21 + 3 = 24\)
- Adrian's age in three years: \(63 + 3 = 66\)
- Zack's age in three years: \(42 + 3 = 45\)

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages together and divide by 3:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 66 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 45 \]"
"First, let's find out how many points Yuri scored. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Since Naomi scored 68 points, half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. So, Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Next, let's find out how many points Brianna scored. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. Since Naomi scored 68 points, Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, let's add up all the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna: 68 (Naomi) + 44 (Yuri) + 85 (Brianna) = 197 points.

The total points scored by all four students is 251. So, to find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points: 251 - 197 = 54 points.

So, Jojo scored 54 points."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the total time spent on crossword puzzles and sudoku puzzles separately and then add them together.

For crossword puzzles:
Carmen solved 3 crossword puzzles and it takes her 10 minutes to finish one.
So, the total time spent on crossword puzzles is \(3 \times 10 = 30\) minutes.

For sudoku puzzles:
Carmen solved 8 sudoku puzzles and it takes her 5 minutes to finish one.
So, the total time spent on sudoku puzzles is \(8 \times 5 = 40\) minutes.

Now, we add the time spent on crossword puzzles and sudoku puzzles:
\(30 + 40 = 70\) minutes.

So, the total time Carmen spent playing these games is 70 minutes."
"First, let's find out how much water is left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters.

The tank originally had 120 liters.
Celine used 90 liters, so:
120 liters - 90 liters = 30 liters left.

Now, Celine collected rainwater that is twice the amount left in the tank. Since there are 30 liters left, the amount of rainwater collected is:
2 * 30 liters = 60 liters.

To find out the total amount of water in the tank now, we add the rainwater collected to the water left in the tank:
30 liters + 60 liters = 90 liters.

So, the final amount of water in the tank is 90 liters."
"First, let's find out how many petunias Andy plants. Since he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, and he plants 90 geraniums, we can calculate the number of petunias as follows:

Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
Number of petunias = 90 - 40
Number of petunias = 50

Now, to find the total number of flowers Andy plants, we add the number of geraniums and petunias together:

Total number of flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
Total number of flowers = 90 + 50
Total number of flowers = 140

So, the total number of flowers Andy plants is 140."
"First, we need to find out how much the company spent on advertising for the second year. Since they spent a third of the first year's amount on the second year, we calculate:

\[ \text{Second year's spending} = \frac{1}{3} \times 15000 = 5000 \]

Now, to find the total amount spent over the two years, we add the spending from both years:

\[ \text{Total spending} = 15000 + 5000 = 20000 \]

So, the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20000."
"First, let's calculate how much Carlos pays for renting the canoe. He rents it for $30 an hour and uses it for 3 hours, so:
\[ 30 \times 3 = 90 \]
Carlos pays $90 for renting the canoe.

Next, let's calculate how much Benji pays for renting the banana boat raft. He rents it for $18 an hour and uses it for 5 hours, so:
\[ 18 \times 5 = 90 \]
Benji pays $90 for renting the banana boat raft.

Now, to find out how much they pay altogether, we add the amounts Carlos and Benji pay:
\[ 90 + 90 = 180 \]

So, the total amount they pay for their rentals is $180."
"First, let's find out how many days it takes to travel by car from New Jersey to Rochester. We know it takes 6 days by bus and half as many days by car. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Days by car} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ days} \]

Now, if Andrew plans to go to Rochester by bus and return from Rochester by car, we need to add the days for the trip to Rochester and the return trip from Rochester:

\[ \text{Total days} = 6 \text{ days (to Rochester by bus)} + 3 \text{ days (return by car)} = 9 \text{ days} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 9 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of cards James has after the changes.

He originally has:
- 30 fire type cards
- 20 grass type cards
- 40 water type cards

He loses 8 water type cards, so the number of water type cards left is:
\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \]

He buys 14 more grass type cards, so the number of grass type cards becomes:
\[ 20 + 14 = 34 \]

Now, let's find the total number of cards he has after these changes:
\[ 30 \text{ (fire)} + 34 \text{ (grass)} + 32 \text{ (water)} = 96 \text{ cards} \]

To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplifying the fraction:
\[ \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \]

So:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \times 100 \approx 33.33\% \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is:
\[ 33\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 33 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the burrito with all the additions:

- Base burrito: $6.50
- Extra meat: $2.00
- Extra cheese: $1.00
- Avocado: $1.00
- 2 sauces: $0.25 each, so 2 * $0.25 = $0.50

Now, let's add all these costs together:

$6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $11.00

Next, Chad adds an extra $3.00 for chips and a drink:

$11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00

Chad has a gift card worth $5.00, which he uses at checkout. So, we subtract the value of the gift card from the total:

$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

So, Chad still owes $9.00."
"First, let's find out how many pieces Kalinda and her mom can add together in one minute.

Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute.
Her mom can add half as many pieces as Kalinda, so her mom can add \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

Together, they can add \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces per minute.

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the 360-piece puzzle.

To do this, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can add together in one minute:

\( \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \).

To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\( \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \).

So, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle."
"First, let's find out how many watermelons were ready for harvest after the first two months. Since 30% of the 120 watermelons were ready, we calculate:

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 120 = \frac{30}{100} \times 120 = 0.30 \times 120 = 36 \]

So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest and Ashlyn took them home. This means the number of watermelons left after she took the ready ones is:

\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]

Next, two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \text{ of } 84 = \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63 \]

This means 63 watermelons were ready for harvest and Ashlyn took them home. The number of watermelons left after she took the ready ones is:

\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

So, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:

\[ 21 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 21 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the cars before tax and registration. Each car costs $20,000 and he buys 12 cars, so:

\[ 20,000 \times 12 = 240,000 \]

Next, he has to pay 10% tax on the total cost of the cars. So, the tax amount is:

\[ 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000 \]

Now, we add the tax to the original cost of the cars to get the total cost before registration:

\[ 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000 \]

Then, he has to pay $1000 for registration on each of the 12 cars. So, the total registration cost is:

\[ 1000 \times 12 = 12,000 \]

Finally, we add the registration cost to the total cost of the cars including tax to get the final amount Mark pays:

\[ 264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 276,000 \]"
"On Monday, Robert collects 20 shells. Since Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, Kylie collects 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. So, Kylie collects 25 * 2 = 50 shells on Tuesday.

The final numerical answer is 50."
"If there were 50 ants and Dax found half as many bugs as ants, then the number of bugs is half of 50, which is 25.

To find the total number of insects, we add the number of ants and the number of bugs together:

50 ants + 25 bugs = 75 insects

So, the total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"First, let's find out how many penguins jump in the ocean. Since one-third of the 36 penguins jump in, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12 \]

So, 12 penguins jump in the ocean.

Next, let's find out how many penguins go inside the cave. Since another one-third of the 36 penguins go inside the cave, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12 \]

So, 12 penguins go inside the cave.

Now, let's find out how many penguins are left for sunbathing. We start with 36 penguins and subtract the 12 that went to the ocean and the 12 that went to the cave:

\[ 36 - 12 - 12 = 12 \]

So, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is 12."
"First, let's find out how many tomatoes Steve's girlfriend eats per day. Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, we can divide Steve's daily intake by 2 to find out how much his girlfriend eats.

Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, so his girlfriend eats:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ tomatoes per day} \]

Now, let's find out how many tomatoes Steve eats in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply his daily intake by 7:
\[ 6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ tomatoes per week} \]

Since Steve eats 42 tomatoes in a week, we need to find out how many weeks' worth of tomatoes one vine can produce. We know that one vine produces 3 tomatoes per week. So, we divide the total tomatoes Steve eats in a week by the number of tomatoes one vine produces in a week to find out how many vines he needs:
\[ \frac{42}{3} = 14 \]

So, Steve needs 14 vines to produce enough tomatoes for his weekly consumption. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 14 \]"
"First, we need to find out how many slices of pizza John needs in total. Since there are 20 friends and each friend should have 4 slices, we multiply the number of friends by the number of slices each friend should have:

\[ 20 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas John needs to order. Each pizza is sliced into 8 portions. To find out how many pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 10 \text{ pizzas} \]

So, John needs to order 10 pizzas."
"Ram starts with 25 pens. For every 5 empty pens he mixes, he gets 1 new full pen. So, we need to find out how many groups of 5 pens he can make from his 25 pens.

Number of groups of 5 pens = 25 pens / 5 pens/group = 5 groups

For each group of 5 pens, he gets 1 new pen. So, from these 5 groups, he gets 5 new pens.

Adding the original 25 pens to the 5 new pens he made, he gets a total of:

25 original pens + 5 new pens = 30 pens

So, the total number of pens Ram gets is 30."
"Johnny started with $20 and added $10 more, so he had $20 + $10 = $30. When he invested this sum and it tripled, he had $30 * 3 = $90 after a year.

The final numerical answer is $90."
"First, let's find out how old Joan is. Since Joan is five years older than Jessa, and Jessa is 20 years old, we can calculate Joan's age as follows:

Joan's age = Jessa's age + 5 years
Joan's age = 20 years + 5 years
Joan's age = 25 years

Now, let's find out how old Mary is. Mary is two years younger than Joan, so:

Mary's age = Joan's age - 2 years
Mary's age = 25 years - 2 years
Mary's age = 23 years

Now we have the ages of all three girls:
- Jessa is 20 years old.
- Joan is 25 years old.
- Mary is 23 years old.

To find the sum of their ages, we add them together:

Sum of their ages = Jessa's age + Joan's age + Mary's age
Sum of their ages = 20 years + 25 years + 23 years
Sum of their ages = 68 years

So, the final numerical answer is 68."
"First, let's find out how many students went out through exit A. Since 30% of the students went out through exit A, we calculate:

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 1000 = \frac{30}{100} \times 1000 = 300 \]

So, 300 students went out through exit A. Now, we need to find out how many students are left after exit A:

\[ 1000 - 300 = 700 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining students went out through exit B. Since 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B, we calculate:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \text{ of } 700 = \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420 \]

So, 420 students went out through exit B. Now, we need to find out how many students are left after exit B:

\[ 700 - 420 = 280 \]

The rest of the students went out through exit C. So, the number of students who went out through exit C is:

\[ 280 \]

The final numerical answer is 280."
"First, let's find out how many candies Robert has. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert and John has 54 candies, we can divide 54 by 2 to find out how many candies Robert has.

\[ \text{Robert's candies} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Now, we know that James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, we can find out how many candies James has by adding 6 to the number of candies Robert has.

\[ \text{James's candies} = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

To find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has.

\[ \text{Difference} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

So, John has 21 more candies than James. The final numerical answer is:

"Dolly has 2 books and Pandora has 1 book. If they read each other's books as well as their own, Dolly will read 3 books (her 2 plus Pandora's 1) and Pandora will read 3 books (her 1 plus Dolly's 2). So, together they will read 3 + 3 = 6 books.

The final numerical answer is 6."
"First, let's figure out how many pen pals Mike has left. He started with 5 pen pals and stopped being pen pals with 2 of them, so he has:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals left} \]

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. So, each pen pal sends:

\[ 2 \text{ letters/week} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 10 \text{ pages/week} \]

Since there are 3 pen pals, the total number of pages sent by all pen pals in a week is:

\[ 3 \text{ pen pals} \times 10 \text{ pages/pen pal/week} = 30 \text{ pages/week} \]

Mike responds to each of these 30 pages, so he writes 30 pages a week. He can write a page every 6 minutes, so the total time he spends writing in minutes is:

\[ 30 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of minutes Jason has used this month.

He has a phone plan of 1000 minutes per month. 

Every day he has a 15-minute call with his boss. Since there are 30 days in the month, the total minutes used for his boss's calls is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Additionally, he has used 300 extra minutes for other people.

So, the total minutes used this month is:
\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from his phone plan to find out how many minutes he has left:
\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Jason has 250 minutes left."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries, so Griffin now has 24 - 5 = 19 fries.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, so Billy takes 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries.
4. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took, so Colby takes 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Now Griffin has 9 - 2 = 7 fries.
5. After receiving fries from Ginger, Griffin ends up with 27 fries. So, Ginger must have given Griffin 27 - 7 = 20 fries.

The final numerical answer is 20."
"First, let's find the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums.

The number of snails in the first aquarium is 4.
The number of snails in the second aquarium is 32.

The difference in the number of snails is:
32 - 4 = 28

According to the problem, this difference (28) is twice the number of fish in both aquariums. Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( F \). Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2F \).

So, we have:
28 = 2 * 2F
28 = 4F

Now, we solve for \( F \):
F = 28 / 4
F = 7

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final numerical answer is:
7"
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist works for the movie.

She needs the makeup done 4 times a week and it takes 6 hours each time. So, in one week, she works:
\[ 4 \text{ times/week} \times 6 \text{ hours/time} = 24 \text{ hours/week} \]

The movie takes 5 weeks to finish, so the total number of hours she works for the movie is:
\[ 24 \text{ hours/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ hours} \]

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 120 \text{ hours} \times \$250/\text{hour} = \$30000 \]

After the movie is done, she gives Jean a 10% discount. So, the discount amount is:
\[ 10\% \times \$30000 = 0.10 \times \$30000 = \$3000 \]

Therefore, the final amount Jean pays after the discount is:
\[ \$30000 - \$3000 = \$27000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

- Goodie bags: $22

Now, let's add these amounts together:

$12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96

Isabelle spent a total of $96 on the party supplies. She split this cost evenly with her two parents, which means the cost was divided among three people (Isabelle and her two parents).

To find out how much each person paid, we divide the total cost by 3:

$96 ÷ 3 = $32

So, each person paid $32."
"First, we need to find out the total weight of the onions the chef bought. The chef bought 4 bags and each bag weighs 50 pounds. So, we multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag:

\[ 4 \text{ bags} \times 50 \text{ pounds per bag} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out how much the chef spent on these onions. We know that a pound of onions costs $1.50. So, we multiply the total weight of the onions by the cost per pound:

\[ 200 \text{ pounds} \times 1.50 \text{ dollars per pound} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the chef spent $300."
"First, let's find out how many cookies Sue's sister ate on each day.

On Monday, her sister ate 5 cookies.
On Tuesday, her sister ate 13 cookies.

Now, let's find out how many cookies Sue ate on each day.

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. So, Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies on Monday.
On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. So, Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies on Tuesday.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate.

Sue's total cookies = cookies on Monday + cookies on Tuesday = \(20 + 26 = 46\).
Her sister's total cookies = cookies on Monday + cookies on Tuesday = \(5 + 13 = 18\).

Each cookie has 200 calories. So, let's calculate the total calories each of them consumed.

Sue's total calories = \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories.
Her sister's total calories = \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories.

Now, let's find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister.

Difference in calories = Sue's total calories - Her sister's total calories = \(9200 - 3600 = 5600\) calories.

So, the final numerical answer is 5600 calories."
"First, let's find out how many students are in the school in total. Since each class has 20 students and there are 3 classes, the total number of students in the school is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the number of boys and girls in the school is:
\[ \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ boys} \]
\[ \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ girls} \]

Now, let's find out how many girls are in the first and second classes. The first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first and second classes is:
\[ 15 + 12 = 27 \]

Since the total number of girls in the school is 30, the number of girls in the third class is:
\[ 30 - 27 = 3 \]

Since the total number of students in the third class is 20, and there are 3 girls, the number of boys in the third class is:
\[ 20 - 3 = 17 \]

So, the number of boys in the third class is 17."
"Travis started with 61 apps. He deleted 9 apps, so we subtract 9 from 61:
\[ 61 - 9 = 52 \]
Then he downloaded 18 more apps, so we add 18 to 52:
\[ 52 + 18 = 70 \]
So, the total number of apps on his tablet now is 70."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that last night Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. So, the total number of animals killed last night is:
\[ 10 \text{ wolves} + 15 \text{ cougars} = 25 \text{ animals} \]

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's say he killed \( x \) cougars today. Then he killed \( 3x \) wolves. We also know that he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, so:
\[ x = 15 - 3 = 12 \]
So, today Rick killed 12 cougars and \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \) wolves.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals killed today:
\[ 36 \text{ wolves} + 12 \text{ cougars} = 48 \text{ animals} \]

To find the total number of animals killed over the two days, we add the totals from last night and today:
\[ 25 \text{ animals} + 48 \text{ animals} = 73 \text{ animals} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 73 \]"
"Bill starts on the 3rd floor. To find out which floor he ends up on, we need to calculate 4 times his starting floor (which is 3) and then add 6.

So, 4 times 3 is 12.
Then, we add 6 to 12, which gives us 18.

Therefore, Bill is on the 18th floor now.

The final numerical answer is 18."
"First, let's find out how many times Anne went down the water slide. If Mitchel went down the slide 30 times and Anne went down 30% less than Mitchel, we can calculate Anne's total as follows:

30% of 30 is calculated as:
\[ 30 \times \frac{30}{100} = 9 \]

So, Anne went down the slide 9 times less than Mitchel. Therefore, Anne went down the slide:
\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \text{ times} \]

Now, we know that Robert went down the water slide 4 times as much as Anne. So, we can calculate the number of times Robert went down the slide as:
\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

So, Robert went down the water slide 84 times."
"First, let's find out how many cows are in each of the original stalls. Since there are 20 cows in each of the 10 stalls, we can calculate the total number of cows as follows:

\[ 20 \text{ cows/stall} \times 10 \text{ stalls} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. So, we need to find out how many cows go into each stall with the new cows:

\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows/stall} \]

Now, each stall originally had 20 cows and now has an additional 2 cows, so each stall has:

\[ 20 \text{ cows} + 2 \text{ cows} = 22 \text{ cows} \]

We need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. Since each stall now has 22 cows, the total number of cows in 8 stalls is:

\[ 22 \text{ cows/stall} \times 8 \text{ stalls} = 176 \text{ cows} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 176 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Brady has in each type of coin and dollar bill.

Pennies are worth $0.01 each. So, 100 pennies are worth:
\[ 100 \times 0.01 = 1.00 \text{ dollar} \]

Nickels are worth $0.05 each. So, 40 nickels are worth:
\[ 40 \times 0.05 = 2.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Dimes are worth $0.10 each. So, 20 dimes are worth:
\[ 20 \times 0.10 = 2.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Dollar bills are worth $1.00 each. So, 40 dollar bills are worth:
\[ 40 \times 1.00 = 40.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add up all the amounts:
\[ 1.00 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 40.00 = 45.00 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Brady has a total of $45.00 in his piggy bank."
"First, we need to find out how many sections the redwood tree has. Since each section is 10 feet and the tree is 200 feet tall, we divide the total height by the length of each section:

\[ \text{Number of sections} = \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections} \]

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate is:

\[ \text{Total weight before termites} = 20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \]

Termites ate 30% of the redwood's wood, so 70% of the wood remains. To find the weight of the remaining wood, we calculate 70% of the total weight:

\[ \text{Weight after termites} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70 = 5600 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 5600 \text{ pounds} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost for the overdue books. Nancy has 8 books overdue, and each book costs $0.50. So, the cost for the books is:
\[ 8 \times 0.50 = 4.00 \]

Next, we add the flat fee for having at least one book over a week overdue, which is $2.00. So, the total cost is:
\[ 4.00 + 2.00 = 6.00 \]

Therefore, Nancy has to pay a total of $6.00."
"First, let's find out how many apples Jamal has. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal and Andrea has 52 apples, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Andrea's apples} = \text{Jamal's apples} + 8 \]

Given Andrea's apples are 52, we can substitute that in:

\[ 52 = \text{Jamal's apples} + 8 \]

Now, let's solve for Jamal's apples:

\[ \text{Jamal's apples} = 52 - 8 = 44 \]

Next, we need to find out how many bananas Jamal has. We know Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. So:

\[ \text{Jamal's bananas} = \text{Jamal's apples} + 4 \]

Substituting Jamal's apples:

\[ \text{Jamal's bananas} = 44 + 4 = 48 \]

Now, we need to find out how many bananas Andrea has. According to the problem, Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal:

\[ \text{Andrea's bananas} = \frac{\text{Jamal's bananas}}{2} \]

Substituting Jamal's bananas:

\[ \text{Andrea's bananas} = \frac{48}{2} = 24 \]

Now, let's find out the total number of fruits Andrea and Jamal have together. We know Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas, and Jamal has 44 apples and 48 bananas. So the total number of fruits is:

\[ \text{Total fruits} = (\text{Andrea's apples} + \text{Andrea's bananas}) + (\text{Jamal's apples} + \text{Jamal's bananas}) \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Total fruits} = (52 + 24) + (44 + 48) \]

\[ \text{Total fruits} = 76 + 92 \]

\[ \text{Total fruits} = 168 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 168."
"To solve this, we first need to find out how many cups of flour are needed for one cookie. Since two cups of flour make a dozen (12) cookies, we can find out how much flour is needed for one cookie by dividing 2 cups by 12 cookies.

\[ \text{Flour per cookie} = \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ cup per cookie} \]

Now, Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, which totals to:

\[ 36 + 30 = 66 \text{ cookies} \]

To find out how many cups of flour are needed for 66 cookies, we multiply the number of cookies by the amount of flour needed per cookie:

\[ \text{Total flour needed} = 66 \text{ cookies} \times \frac{1}{6} \text{ cup per cookie} = 11 \text{ cups} \]

So, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow."
"First, we need to find out how many pennies are in two thirds of the cup. Since there are 9,300 pennies in the cup, we calculate two thirds of 9,300.

\[ \text{Pennies in two thirds} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9,300 \]

Let's do the multiplication:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9,300 = 2 \times \frac{9,300}{3} = 2 \times 3,100 = 6,200 \]

So, there are 6,200 pennies in the stack.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we can find the total dollar amount by multiplying the number of pennies by $0.01.

\[ \text{Total dollar amount} = 6,200 \times 0.01 = 62 \]

So, the total dollar amount in the stack is $62."
"Maddison originally has 5 boxes with 50 marbles in each, so she has a total of 5 * 50 = 250 marbles. Then she gets 20 more marbles from her friend. So now she has 250 + 20 = 270 marbles.

The final numerical answer is 270."
"First, let's find out how many trees Ferdinand has. Since Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, and Chris has 6 trees, we can calculate the number of trees Ferdinand has as follows:

\[ \text{Number of trees Ferdinand has} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we need to find out how many trees Harry has. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. So, we calculate twice the number of trees Ferdinand has and then add 5:

\[ \text{Twice the number of trees Ferdinand has} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \]
\[ \text{Number of trees Harry has} = 6 + 5 = 11 \]

Now, to find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand, we subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has:

\[ \text{Difference} = 11 - 3 = 8 \]

So, Harry has 8 more trees than Ferdinand. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 8 \]"
"First, let's find out how much money Samantha has. Since Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, and Carmen has $100, we can calculate Samantha's money as follows:

Samantha's money = Carmen's money + $25
Samantha's money = $100 + $25
Samantha's money = $125

Next, we need to find out how much money Daisy has. Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so we can calculate Daisy's money as follows:

Daisy's money = Samantha's money + $50
Daisy's money = $125 + $50
Daisy's money = $175

Now, to find out how much all three girls have combined, we add up the money each of them has:

Total money = Carmen's money + Samantha's money + Daisy's money
Total money = $100 + $125 + $175
Total money = $400

So, the final numerical answer is $400."
"First, let's calculate the brokerage fee. The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price. The selling price is $350,000.

Brokerage fee = 5% of $350,000
Brokerage fee = 0.05 * $350,000
Brokerage fee = $17,500

Next, let's calculate the transfer fee. The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price.

Transfer fee = 12% of $350,000
Transfer fee = 0.12 * $350,000
Transfer fee = $42,000

Now, let's find the total price of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

Total price = Selling price + Brokerage fee + Transfer fee
Total price = $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000
Total price = $409,500

Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. To find out how much more the total price of the house is than her budget, we subtract her budget from the total price.

Excess amount = Total price - Budget
Excess amount = $409,500 - $400,000
Excess amount = $9,500

So, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget."
"First, let's calculate the transfer fees. The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Transfer fees} = 400,000 \times \frac{3}{100} = 400,000 \times 0.03 = 12,000 \]

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee. The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Brokerage fee} = 400,000 \times \frac{5}{100} = 400,000 \times 0.05 = 20,000 \]

Now, let's add the transfer fees and the brokerage fee to find the total fees Mr. Tan paid.

\[ \text{Total fees} = 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000 \]

Mr. Tan also paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount of the house. To find the net proceeds, we subtract the total fees and the loan amount from the selling price.

\[ \text{Net proceeds} = 400,000 - 32,000 - 250,000 = 400,000 - 282,000 = 118,000 \]

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is $118,000."
"First, let's find out how long it takes to heat the oil to 400 degrees. We know it takes 20 minutes to heat the oil to 300 degrees. It then takes 40% longer to heat it to 400 degrees.

To find 40% of 20 minutes:
\[ 40\% \text{ of } 20 = 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it takes an additional 8 minutes to heat the oil to 400 degrees:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes} + 8 \text{ minutes} = 28 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we know it takes 28 minutes to heat the oil to 400 degrees.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes to cook the chicken. It takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees:
\[ 28 \text{ minutes} - 5 \text{ minutes} = 23 \text{ minutes} \]

To find the total time from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken, we add the time to heat the oil to 400 degrees and the time to cook the chicken:
\[ 28 \text{ minutes} + 23 \text{ minutes} = 51 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken is 51 minutes."
"First, let's calculate the total cost for the newspaper ads. The real estate agent spent $5 on each newspaper ad and bought 50 newspaper ads. So, the total cost for the newspaper ads is:
\[ 5 \times 50 = 250 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the television ads. The real estate agent spent $75 on each television ad and bought 15 television ads. So, the total cost for the television ads is:
\[ 75 \times 15 = 1125 \]

Now, to find the total amount spent on all the ads, we add the cost of the newspaper ads and the cost of the television ads:
\[ 250 + 1125 = 1375 \]

So, the real estate agent spent a total of $1375 on buying all the ads."
"Half of the 16 balls are golf balls, so we divide 16 by 2 to find out how many golf balls there are:

\[ \frac{16}{2} = 8 \]

Out of these 8 golf balls, half are blue, so we divide 8 by 2 to find out how many blue golf balls there are:

\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \]

So, the number of blue golf balls is 4."
"First, let's find out how many M&Ms are in the second bag. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, which has 300 M&Ms. So, the second bag has:
\[ 300 + 12 = 312 \text{ M&Ms} \]

The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag. The first bag has 300 M&Ms, so the third bag has:
\[ \frac{300}{2} = 150 \text{ M&Ms} \]

Now, to find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we add the M&Ms from all three bags:
\[ 300 + 312 + 150 = 762 \text{ M&Ms} \]

So, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"First, let's calculate the number of windows in one house.

Each house has 3 bedrooms, and each bedroom has 2 windows. So, for one house:
\[ 3 \text{ bedrooms/house} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows from bedrooms/house} \]

Additionally, each house has 4 windows that are not connected to bedrooms. So, for one house:
\[ 6 \text{ windows from bedrooms} + 4 \text{ windows not connected to bedrooms} = 10 \text{ windows/house} \]

Since John has 2 houses, we need to multiply the number of windows in one house by 2:
\[ 10 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 20 \text{ windows} \]

So, the total number of windows between the houses is:
\[ 20 \]"
"First, let's add up the total cost of the items the mother bought:
- Cocoa: $4.20
- Laundry: $9.45
- Pasta: $1.35

Total cost = $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35

Now, let's calculate the total cost:
Total cost = $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35 = $14.95

The mother pays $20. To find out the change, we subtract the total cost from $20:
Change = $20 - $14.95

Now, let's calculate the change:
Change = $20 - $14.95 = $5.05

So, the cashier gives back $5.05 in change."
"First, let's find out how many stitches the collar takes. The collar takes a tenth of the stitches for the body of the sweater. Since the body takes 900 stitches, the collar takes:

\[ \text{Stitches for collar} = \frac{900}{10} = 90 \text{ stitches} \]

Next, let's find out how many stitches the rosette takes. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar. Since the collar takes 90 stitches, the rosette takes:

\[ \text{Stitches for rosette} = 2 \times 90 = 180 \text{ stitches} \]

Now, let's add up the stitches for the collar and the rosette:

\[ \text{Total stitches for collar and rosette} = 90 + 180 = 270 \text{ stitches} \]

The whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project. So, the stitches used for the body and the sleeves together are:

\[ \text{Stitches for body and sleeves} = 1800 - 270 = 1530 \text{ stitches} \]

Since there are two sleeves, we need to find out how many stitches each sleeve takes. Let's assume each sleeve takes \( x \) stitches. Therefore, the total stitches for the two sleeves is \( 2x \). We know that:

\[ 2x = 1530 \]

To find \( x \), we divide 1530 by 2:

\[ x = \frac{1530}{2} = 765 \]

So, each sleeve takes 765 stitches. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 765 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost for the tomato seeds. Mrs. Rylan bought 20 packets of tomato seeds, and each packet costs $40. So, the total cost for tomato seeds is:
20 packets * $40/packet = $800

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the celery seeds. She bought 80 packets of celery seeds, and each packet costs $30. So, the total cost for celery seeds is:
80 packets * $30/packet = $2400

Now, to find out the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we add the cost of the tomato seeds and the cost of the celery seeds:
$800 (tomato seeds) + $2400 (celery seeds) = $3200

So, the final numerical answer is $3200."
"First, let's calculate the number of lines Sean has to memorize for each part of his role.

For the solo song, Sean has to memorize all 54 lines.

For the first scene, the number of lines is twice the number of lines in the solo song. So, the first scene has:
\[ 2 \times 54 = 108 \text{ lines} \]

Sean's lines in the first scene are a third of the total lines in the scene. So, the number of lines Sean has to memorize for the first scene is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36 \text{ lines} \]

For the second scene, the number of lines is six more than the number of lines in the solo song. So, the second scene has:
\[ 54 + 6 = 60 \text{ lines} \]

Sean's lines in the second scene are four-fifths of the total lines in the scene. So, the number of lines Sean has to memorize for the second scene is:
\[ \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48 \text{ lines} \]

Now, let's add up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
\[ 54 \text{ (solo song)} + 36 \text{ (first scene)} + 48 \text{ (second scene)} = 138 \text{ lines} \]

So, the total number of lines Sean has to memorize is:
\[ \boxed{138} \]"
"First, let's find out how many cards had the letter A on them. Since 2/5 of the cards had the letter A, we calculate:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \]

So, 32 cards had the letter A on them. This means the remaining cards are:

\[ 80 - 32 = 48 \]

Next, we find out how many of these remaining cards had the letter B on them. Since 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]

So, 24 cards had the letter B on them. This leaves us with:

\[ 48 - 24 = 24 \]

Now, we find out how many of these remaining cards had the letter C on them. Since 5/8 of the remaining cards had the letter C, we calculate:

\[ \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \]

So, 15 cards had the letter C on them. This leaves us with:

\[ 24 - 15 = 9 \]

Therefore, the number of cards that had the letter D on them is 9."
"First, let's calculate the total time Matthew will spend digging the small holes. He takes 3 minutes for each small hole, and he needs to dig 30 small holes.

Total time for small holes = 3 minutes/hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes

Next, let's calculate the total time for the large holes. He takes 10 minutes for each large hole, and he needs to dig 15 large holes.

Total time for large holes = 10 minutes/hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes

Now, let's add the total time for both small and large holes.

Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to convert the total time from minutes to hours.

Total time in hours = 240 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours

So, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes."
"If the sum of Mico's and Marco's current ages is 20, then in 10 years, their ages will still add up to 20 because the number of years doesn't change the total sum of their ages.

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 20."
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. So, \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]
Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 3S = 18 \]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old. To find Ruby's current age, we use the first equation:
\[ R = 6S = 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

To verify, in 9 years:
- Ruby will be \( 36 + 9 = 45 \) years old.
- Sam will be \( 6 + 9 = 15 \) years old.
And indeed, \( 45 = 3 \times 15 \).

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the popsicles. Peter bought 20 popsicles at $0.25 each. So, the total cost for the popsicles is:
\[ 20 \times 0.25 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the ice cream bars. Peter bought 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each. So, the total cost for the ice cream bars is:
\[ 4 \times 0.50 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars to find the total amount Peter paid:
\[ 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Peter paid is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, let's find out how many spots a mamba has. Since a cobra has 70 spots and a mamba has half as many spots as a cobra, we can calculate the number of spots a mamba has as follows:

\[ \text{Spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and all the mambas. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, so the total spots for the cobras are:

\[ \text{Total spots for cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots, so the total spots for the mambas are:

\[ \text{Total spots for mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Now, we add the total spots for the cobras and the mambas to get the combined total number of spots:

\[ \text{Total spots combined} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of the total number of spots:

\[ \text{Half the total spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2450 \]"
"First, let's find out how many people are coming to the soccer game.

- There are 12 team members.
- There are 3 coaches.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so 12 team members * 2 guests = 24 guests.

Now, let's add everyone together:
12 team members + 3 coaches + 24 guests = 39 people in total.

Each pizza serves 3 people, so we need to find out how many pizzas are needed:
39 people ÷ 3 people per pizza = 13 pizzas.

Each pizza costs $15, so the total cost will be:
13 pizzas * $15 per pizza = $195.

So, Maddy will spend $195 on pizzas."
"First, let's calculate the total length of the topaz gemstones used in one necklace.

Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones, and each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long. So, the total length of the topaz gemstones is:
\[ 8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to find out how much space is left for the sterling silver beads after placing the topaz gemstones. The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. So, the length left for the sterling silver beads is:
\[ 25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches} \]

Each sterling silver bead is 0.25 inches long. To find out how many beads are needed to fill the 17 inches, we divide the remaining length by the length of one bead:
\[ \frac{17 \text{ inches}}{0.25 \text{ inches/bead}} = 68 \text{ beads} \]

So, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace."
"First, let's calculate the number of stories each person wrote in the second week. 

Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week. In the second week, she doubled that number:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ stories} \]

Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week. In the second week, he doubled that number:
\[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ stories} \]

Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week. In the second week, she doubled that number:
\[ 60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ stories} \]

Now, let's add up all the stories they wrote in the first week and the second week.

Alani's total:
\[ 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ stories} \]

Braylen's total:
\[ 40 + 80 = 120 \text{ stories} \]

Margot's total:
\[ 60 + 120 = 180 \text{ stories} \]

Finally, we add up all the stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot:
\[ 60 + 120 + 180 = 360 \text{ stories} \]

So, the total number of stories they wrote altogether is:
\[ 360 \]"
"First, we need to find out how old Ann's brother is. Since Ann is 9 years old and her brother is twice her age, we can calculate her brother's age as follows:

\[ \text{Brother's age} = 2 \times \text{Ann's age} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

So, Ann's brother is currently 18 years old. To find out how old her brother will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

\[ \text{Brother's age in 3 years} = 18 + 3 = 21 \]

Therefore, Ann's brother will be 21 years old in 3 years."
"First, let's calculate how many cents Kelly has in her quarters and dimes.

A quarter is worth 25 cents, so 5 quarters are worth:
5 quarters * 25 cents/quarter = 125 cents

A dime is worth 10 cents, so 2 dimes are worth:
2 dimes * 10 cents/dime = 20 cents

Now, let's add the value of the quarters and dimes together:
125 cents (from quarters) + 20 cents (from dimes) = 145 cents

Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents, so we subtract that from the total amount she has:
145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents

So, Kelly will have 90 cents left."
"To solve this, let's first calculate the total number of stars in the rows with 8 and 6 stars.

There are three rows of 8 stars, so that's 3 * 8 = 24 stars.
There are two rows of 6 stars, so that's 2 * 6 = 12 stars.

Now, let's add these up to find out how many stars are in the rows with 8 and 6 stars combined:
24 stars + 12 stars = 36 stars.

The flag has a total of 76 stars. So, to find out how many stars are in the rows of 5 stars, we subtract the stars in the 8 and 6 star rows from the total number of stars:
76 stars - 36 stars = 40 stars.

Since each of these remaining rows has 5 stars, we divide the number of 5-star rows by 5:
40 stars ÷ 5 stars/row = 8 rows.

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars altogether on the flag."
"First, we need to find out the total weight of 80 flagstones. Since each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, we multiply 75 by 80:

\[ 75 \times 80 = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how many trucks are required to carry 6000 pounds, given that each truck can carry 2000 pounds. We divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:

\[ \frac{6000}{2000} = 3 \]

So, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"First, let's find out the speed of the car in the slow lane. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed. So, the speed of the car in the slow lane is:

\[ \text{Speed of slow lane car} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Now, we know the car in the fast lane traveled 480 miles. To find out how long it took, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the fast lane:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{fast lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Since the car in the slow lane traveled the same distance (480 miles) but at a slower speed (30 miles/hour), we can find the time it took for the slow lane car to cover the same distance using the same formula:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{slow lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

So, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"First, let's find out how many medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, we can calculate the number of medals Izzy has as follows:

\[ \text{Medals Izzy has} = \text{Medals Ali has} - 5 = 22 - 5 = 17 \]

Now, let's find out the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:

\[ \text{Total medals Ali and Izzy have} = \text{Medals Ali has} + \text{Medals Izzy has} = 22 + 17 = 39 \]

According to the question, the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have:

\[ \text{Total medals given out} = 10 \times \text{Total medals Ali and Izzy have} = 10 \times 39 = 390 \]

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 390."
"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available.

Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, and there are 8 packets.
So, the total number of chocolate bars is:
\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars/packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Next, we need to find out how many chocolate bars the adults get in total.

Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, and there are 4 adults.
So, the total number of chocolate bars for the adults is:
\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars/adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults get from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children.

The number of chocolate bars left for the children is:
\[ 40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

There are 8 children, and we need to share the remaining 16 chocolate bars equally among them.

So, each child will get:
\[ \frac{16 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars/child} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time Susan works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the total minutes she works as follows:

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

She takes a 30-minute break, so we subtract that from the total time:

180 minutes - 30 minutes = 150 minutes

Now, we know Susan earns $5 for every 10 minutes of work. To find out how much she earns for 150 minutes, we can set up a proportion:

10 minutes earn $5
150 minutes earn x dollars

We can solve for x by setting up the proportion:

\[
\frac{10}{5} = \frac{150}{x}
\]

Cross-multiplying gives us:

\[
10x = 5 \times 150
\]

\[
10x = 750
\]

Dividing both sides by 10:

\[
x = 75
\]

So, Susan earns $75 for the online task."
"First, let's find out how many points each player has after the first three rounds.

Mike has 21 points.

Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so:
\[ \text{Jim's points} = 21 - 3 = 18 \]

Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so:
\[ \text{Tony's points} = 21 \times 2 = 42 \]

Now, let's see if any of them get an extra point in the fourth round. The extra point is given to players who have over 20 points.

Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point.
Jim has 18 points, so he does not get an extra point.
Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point.

After the extra points are distributed:
- Mike now has \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
- Jim still has 18 points.
- Tony now has \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

Now, let's find the total points for all three players after the extra points had been distributed:
\[ \text{Total points} = 22 + 18 + 43 = 83 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 83 \]"
"First, let's find out how old the youngest son is. The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest son is half as old as the oldest, so the youngest son is 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

Now, we know that Will asks his sons to wash as many oranges as they are years old. So, the oldest son will wash 8 oranges, and the youngest son will wash 4 oranges.

Together, they will wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Will initially bought 15 oranges. After his sons wash 12 oranges, the number of oranges left unwashed is 15 - 12 = 3 oranges.

So, the final numerical answer is 3."
"First, let's calculate the number of each activity Darren does on the second day.

On the first day, he does:
- 100 pushups
- 50 squats
- 20 dumbbell presses

On the second day, he does:
- 20 more pushups than on the first day, so \(100 + 20 = 120\) pushups
- 10 fewer squats than on the first day, so \(50 - 10 = 40\) squats
- Doubles the number of dumbbell presses, so \(20 \times 2 = 40\) dumbbell presses

Now, let's calculate the total number of each activity he does in two days.

For pushups:
- First day: 100
- Second day: 120
- Total pushups: \(100 + 120 = 220\)

For squats:
- First day: 50
- Second day: 40
- Total squats: \(50 + 40 = 90\)

For dumbbell presses:
- First day: 20
- Second day: 40
- Total dumbbell presses: \(20 + 40 = 60\)

Now, let's add up all the activities he did in the two days:
- Total pushups: 220
- Total squats: 90
- Total dumbbell presses: 60

So, the total count of the activities he's done in the two days is:
\[ 220 + 90 + 60 = 370 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 370 \]"
"First, let's find out how much rice the family eats in one meal. Since each person eats 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 5 people in the family, the total rice consumed per meal is:

\[ 0.2 \, \text{kg/person} \times 5 \, \text{people} = 1 \, \text{kg} \]

Since they eat rice at lunch and dinner, they eat 1 kg of rice twice a day. So, the total rice consumed per day is:

\[ 1 \, \text{kg/day} \times 2 = 2 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of rice by the amount consumed per day:

\[ \frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{2 \, \text{kg/day}} = 21 \, \text{days} \]

To find out how many weeks the rice will last, we divide the total number of days by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):

\[ \frac{21 \, \text{days}}{7 \, \text{days/week}} = 3 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, the 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks."
"First, let's calculate how many days Sam actually worked in the week. He was closed on Monday and Friday, so that's 2 days. That leaves us with 7 days in the week minus 2 days, which is 5 days he worked.

Now, let's add up the crates he sold during the days he worked:
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates
- Over the weekend: 20 crates

Adding these up: 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 crates

Sam's target was to sell 120 crates in the week. To find out how many crates he was off by, we subtract the crates he sold from his target:
120 - 65 = 55 crates

So, Sam was 55 crates off from his target for the week."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Bid**: Carmen starts with an opening bid of $200.
2. **Increase in Bids**: Each subsequent bid increases by $50.
3. **Number of Bidders**: There are 4 people bidding in total, including Carmen.
4. **Carmen's Bids**: Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people.

Let's calculate the bids:

- **First Bid**: $200 (Carmen's first bid)
- **Second Bid**: $200 + $50 = $250 (Second person's bid)
- **Third Bid**: $250 + $50 = $300 (Carmen's second bid)
- **Fourth Bid**: $300 + $50 = $350 (Third person's bid)
- **Fifth Bid**: $350 + $50 = $400 (Carmen's third bid)
- **Sixth Bid**: $400 + $50 = $450 (Fourth person's bid)
- **Seventh Bid**: $450 + $50 = $500 (Carmen's fourth bid)

Carmen wins the auction with her fourth bid, which is $500.

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{500}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total distance John drives in a year.

John drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back home each day. So, he drives 60 miles each day.

He goes to work 5 days a week, so in a week, he drives:
\[ 60 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 300 \text{ miles/week} \]

There are 50 weeks in a year, so in a year, he drives:
\[ 300 \text{ miles/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = 15000 \text{ miles/year} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the miles driven. He is charged $2 per mile, so the cost for the miles driven in a year is:
\[ 15000 \text{ miles/year} \times $2/\text{mile} = $30000 \]

Now, let's calculate the total bonus he gives his driver in a year. He gives a $150 bonus per month, and there are 12 months in a year, so the total bonus is:
\[ $150/\text{month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = $1800 \]

Finally, to find out how much John pays in a year for driving, we add the cost of the miles driven to the total bonus:
\[ $30000 + $1800 = $31800 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{31800} \]"
"First, let's find out how much time Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.

On Sunday, he exercised for 23 minutes.
On Monday, he exercised for 16 minutes.

So, the total time he exercised on Monday and Sunday is:
16 minutes + 23 minutes = 39 minutes

Peter wants to exercise for twice this amount on Tuesday. So, we need to multiply the total time from Monday and Sunday by 2.

Twice the amount of time is:
39 minutes * 2 = 78 minutes

Therefore, Peter has to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.

The final numerical answer is 78."
"To solve this, let's think about how the paper is folded and how many pages are printed on each side.

1. When you fold a piece of paper vertically, you get two sides: the left side and the right side.
2. Each page is printed on both the left and right sides, but only one side is visible at a time when the paper is unfolded.
3. For a 32-page tabloid, you would have 32 pages in total.
4. Since the paper is folded vertically, each page will be printed on both the left and right sides, but only one side is visible at a time.
5. So, for 32 pages, you would need 16 pieces of paper. Each piece of paper will be used to print 2 pages (one on the left and one on the right).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 16 pieces of paper."
"First, let's find out how much Annika spent on food and snacks. She spent half of her $50 on food and snacks, so:

\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

So, she spent $25 on food and snacks. Now, let's add the $10 she spent on rides:

\[ 25 + 10 = 35 \]

Now, to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount she brought:

\[ 50 - 35 = 15 \]

So, Annika has $15 left."
"First, let's find out how many books Elise sold this year. We know she sold 45 books this year.

Next, we need to find out how many books she sold in the first year. Since she sold twice as many books in the first year as she did this year, we calculate:
\[ 2 \times 45 = 90 \text{ books} \]

Now, let's find out how many books she sold in the second year. We know the total number of books is 250, and we have the number of books sold in the first and second years, and the number of unsold books. So, the number of books sold in the second year is:
\[ 250 - 90 - 45 - 50 = 75 \text{ books} \]

Each book sells for $20, so the total amount of money she earned in the second year is:
\[ 75 \times 20 = 1500 \]

So, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is $1500."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, calculate how many hours Watson works in a week:
   - He works 10 hours a day.
   - He works 5 days a week.
   - So, in a week, he works \(10 \times 5 = 50\) hours.

2. Next, calculate how much he earns in a week:
   - He earns $10 per hour.
   - So, in a week, he earns \(50 \times 10 = 500\) dollars.

3. Since the company performed very well, he gets a $300 bonus each week.

4. Now, calculate his total earnings for a week:
   - His weekly earnings are $500.
   - Plus the $300 bonus.
   - So, his total weekly earnings are \(500 + 300 = 800\) dollars.

5. Finally, calculate his total earnings for the month of April:
   - April has 30 days.
   - He works 4 weeks in April (since \(30 \div 7 \approx 4.28\), we consider 4 full weeks).
   - So, his total earnings for April are \(800 \times 4 = 3200\) dollars.

Therefore, Watson made $3200 in April if the company performed very well for the whole month."
"First, we need to find out how many people John beat. If he beats 80% of the people he arm wrestles, we calculate 80% of 20.

\[ 80\% \text{ of } 20 = \frac{80}{100} \times 20 = 0.8 \times 20 = 16 \]

So, John beat 16 people. Since he arm wrestled 20 people in total, the number of people he lost to is the total number of people minus the number of people he beat.

\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, John lost to 4 people."
"First, let's find out how many loaves of bread are sold in the morning. The bakery produces 60 loaves each day, and two-thirds of these are sold in the morning.

\[
\text{Morning sales} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
\]

Now, we subtract the morning sales from the total production to find out how many loaves are left:

\[
\text{Loaves left} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
\]

Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. So, we need to find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon:

\[
\text{Afternoon sales} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
\]

So, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is 10."
"First, let's find out how much weight Joey loses in one week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so we divide 8 pounds by 4 weeks:

\[ \text{Weight Joey loses per week} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Now, we know that Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in 1 week, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds.

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds (the same amount Joey loses in 4 weeks), we can set up a proportion:

\[ \text{Weight Sandy loses per week} = \frac{2 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Now, to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds:

\[ \text{Weeks for Sandy to lose 8 pounds} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{0.5 \text{ pounds per week}} = 16 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks."
"First, let's find out how much you save on one tub of ice cream. The original price of one tub of ice cream is $13, and it is now sold at $11. So, the discount on one tub of ice cream is:

\[ 13 - 11 = 2 \]

This means you save $2 on one tub of ice cream. If you buy 2 tubs of ice cream, the total savings would be:

\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \]

Next, let's find out how much you save on one packet of milk. The packet of milk was originally sold at a price that is not given, but we know it was sold at a discount of $0.5. So, the discount on one packet of milk is $0.5. If you buy 4 packets of milk, the total savings would be:

\[ 4 \times 0.5 = 2 \]

Now, to find the total savings for buying 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk, we add the savings from the ice cream and the milk:

\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \]

So, the total amount you will save is:

\[ 6 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 6 \]"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Extra Arm Growth:**
   - The serum makes a person grow an extra arm every 3 days.
   - In 15 days, we need to find out how many times 3 days fit into 15 days.
   - \( 15 \div 3 = 5 \)
   - So, the person will grow 5 extra arms.

2. **Extra Leg Growth:**
   - The serum makes a person grow an extra leg every 5 days.
   - In 15 days, we need to find out how many times 5 days fit into 15 days.
   - \( 15 \div 5 = 3 \)
   - So, the person will grow 3 extra legs.

3. **Total New Limbs:**
   - The total number of new limbs is the sum of the extra arms and extra legs.
   - \( 5 \text{ (extra arms)} + 3 \text{ (extra legs)} = 8 \text{ new limbs} \)

So, after 15 days, Helena’s serum will cause a person to grow 8 new limbs."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the business suits:
- Theo buys 6 business suits at $100 each.
- So, the total cost for the business suits is \(6 \times 100 = $600\).

Next, let's calculate the cost of the suitcases:
- Theo buys 3 suitcases at $50 each.
- So, the total cost for the suitcases is \(3 \times 50 = $150\).

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket:
- The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit.
- The cost of one business suit is $100, so 5 times the cost of a business suit is \(5 \times 100 = $500\).
- Therefore, the cost of the flight ticket is \(500 + 700 = $1200\).

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Cost of business suits: $600
- Cost of suitcases: $150
- Cost of flight ticket: $1200
- Total cost so far: \(600 + 150 + 1200 = $1950\).

Theo has $6000 to spend and wants to save $2000 for the trip. So, the amount he can spend on the trip is:
- Total money - money to save = \(6000 - 2000 = $4000\).

Now, let's find out how much he can spend on gifts:
- Money to spend on gifts = Total money to spend - total cost so far.
- Money to spend on gifts = \(4000 - 1950 = $2050\).

So, Theo has to spend $2050 on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa."
"First, let's find out how many eggs the three people who eat three eggs each day consume in a week.

Each of these three people eats 3 eggs per day, so together they eat:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 3 \text{ people} = 9 \text{ eggs/day} \]

In a week (7 days), they will eat:
\[ 9 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 63 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, let's find out how many eggs the two people who eat two eggs each day consume in a week.

Each of these two people eats 2 eggs per day, so together they eat:
\[ 2 \text{ eggs/day} \times 2 \text{ people} = 4 \text{ eggs/day} \]

In a week (7 days), they will eat:
\[ 4 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, let's add the total number of eggs consumed by all the family members in a week.

The total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week is:
\[ 63 \text{ eggs} + 28 \text{ eggs} = 91 \text{ eggs} \]

So, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week."
"First, let's find out how old Jane is. Since Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn and Quinn is 30 years old, we can calculate Jane's age as follows:

Jane's age = Quinn's age - 3 years
Jane's age = 30 - 3
Jane's age = 27

Now, we know that Trent is 5 years older than Jane. So, we can find Trent's age by adding 5 years to Jane's age:

Trent's age = Jane's age + 5 years
Trent's age = 27 + 5
Trent's age = 32

So, Trent is 32 years old."
"First, let's find out Noah's age six years ago. If Cera was 46 years old six years ago, then Noah was half that age, which is 23 years old.

Six years ago, Noah was 23 years old, so now he is 23 + 6 = 29 years old.

Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age, which was 23. So, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 * 23 = 69000.

Since the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now, the current population of Chile is 69000 * 2 = 138000.

So, the population of Chile now is 138000."
"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Let's say the number of players on the defense is \( D \).
2. Then, the number of players on the offense is \( 2D \) (twice as many as on the defense).
3. The number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \) (half the number of players on the defense).

The total number of players is the sum of the players on the defense, offense, and special teams. So we can write the equation:

\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve this, we need to get a common denominator for the terms involving \( D \):

\[ \frac{6D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

Now, to find \( D \), we multiply both sides by 2:

\[ 7D = 210 \]

And then divide both sides by 7:

\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is 30.

The final numerical answer is 30."
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- She invited 2 families with 6 people each, so that's 2 * 6 = 12 people.
- She also invited 3 families with 4 people each, so that's 3 * 4 = 12 people.
- Adding these together, she invited 12 + 12 = 24 people.

Next, we need to account for the people who couldn't come due to illness and those with previous commitments:

- 8 people couldn't come due to illness.
- 1/4 of the 8 people with illness had previous commitments, so that's 8 / 4 = 2 people.

Now, let's calculate the total number of people who couldn't come:

- Total who couldn't come = 8 (illness) + 2 (previous commitments) = 10 people.

Finally, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited:

- Number of people who show up = 24 (total invited) - 10 (couldn't come) = 14 people.

So, the final numerical answer is 14."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna.
2. The store already had 50 marbles.
3. Solomon's father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. So, Solomon's father gave him \( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \) marbles.
4. Now, let's calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has:
   - Marbles from Johanna: 20
   - Marbles from his father: 8
   - Marbles already in the store: 50
   - Total marbles: \( 20 + 8 + 50 = 78 \)

Each marble weighs 2 kgs, so to find the total weight of the marbles, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble:
\[ 78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kgs} \]

So, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is 156 kgs."
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The volume of a rectangular prism (which is what the pool is) is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and depth.

The length of the pool is 6 feet, the width is 4 feet, and the depth is 5 feet.

So, the volume is:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} \times 4 \text{ feet} \times 5 \text{ feet} = 120 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Now, we know that it costs $0.1 per cubic foot to fill the pool. To find the total cost, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot:
\[ 120 \text{ cubic feet} \times 0.1 \text{ dollars per cubic foot} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final cost to fill the pool is:
\[ 12 \text{ dollars} \]"
"First, let's find out how many girls are in the classroom. Since there are 3 times as many girls as boys, and there are 30 boys, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

Number of girls = 3 * Number of boys
Number of girls = 3 * 30
Number of girls = 90

Next, we need to find out how many nongendered children there are. The problem states that there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as there are boys. So, we can calculate the number of nongendered children as follows:

Number of nongendered children = 1/10 * Number of boys
Number of nongendered children = 1/10 * 30
Number of nongendered children = 3

Now, to find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children together:

Total number of children = Number of boys + Number of girls + Number of nongendered children
Total number of children = 30 + 90 + 3
Total number of children = 123

So, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the ratio given, which is 1:3 for electric poles to electric wires. This means for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires.

We are given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45. According to the ratio, if the number of wires is 3 parts, then the number of poles will be 1 part.

First, we need to find out how many parts each part represents. Since 3 parts (wires) equal 45 wires, we can find the value of one part by dividing 45 by 3:

\[ \text{Value of one part} = \frac{45}{3} = 15 \]

Now, since the number of poles is 1 part, we can find the total number of poles by multiplying the value of one part by 1:

\[ \text{Total number of poles} = 15 \times 1 = 15 \]

So, the total number of electric poles required is 15."
"First, let's find out the total number of people at the beginning of the party. There were 25 men and 15 women, so the total number of people was:

25 men + 15 women = 40 people

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. So, the number of people who left is:

1/4 * 40 = 10 people

This means that 10 people left the party. Since 22 men stayed at the party, we can find out how many men left by subtracting the number of men who stayed from the total number of men:

25 men - 22 men = 3 men left

Since 10 people in total left and 3 of them were men, the remaining 7 people must have been women. Now, we need to find out how many women are left at the party. Initially, there were 15 women, and 7 of them left:

15 women - 7 women = 8 women

So, the number of women left at the party is 8."
"First, we need to find out how much the magazine costs. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book and the book costs $4, we can calculate the cost of the magazine as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of magazine} = \frac{\text{Cost of book}}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

So, the magazine costs $2.

Next, we need to find out how much the pen costs. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so:

\[ \text{Cost of pen} = \text{Cost of magazine} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 \]

Therefore, the pen costs $1.

The final numerical answer is:
1"
"First, let's find out how many pencils Jam has in total. We know that Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which add up to 26 pencils.

So, if we let the number of pencils in each box be \( x \), then:
\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation:
\[ 3x = 26 - 2 \]
\[ 3x = 24 \]
\[ x = \frac{24}{3} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, each box contains 8 pencils. Now, we can find out how many boxes Jam has:
\[ \text{Number of boxes Jam has} = \frac{26 - 2}{8} = \frac{24}{8} = 3 \]

Now, we know Jam has 3 boxes and Meg has 46 pencils. To find out how many boxes they need to store all their pencils, we need to consider that each box can hold 8 pencils.

First, let's see how many boxes Meg needs:
\[ \text{Number of boxes Meg needs} = \frac{46}{8} = 5.75 \]

Since they can't have a fraction of a box, we round up to the next whole number, which means Meg needs 6 boxes.

Now, we add the number of boxes Jam and Meg need:
\[ \text{Total number of boxes} = 3 + 6 = 9 \]

So, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 9 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cooling the Coffee:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - Shannon wants to cool the coffee by 65 degrees.
   - To find out how many ice cubes she needs, we divide the total cooling needed by the cooling effect of one ice cube:
     \[
     \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
     \]

2. **Weakening the Coffee:**
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - With 5 ice cubes, the total weakening due to ice cubes is:
     \[
     5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters weaker per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
     \]

3. **Adding Cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream.
   - Adding cream does not weaken the coffee, but it does add liquid, which weakens the coffee by 1 milliliter for every milliliter of liquid added.
   - Therefore, adding 15 milliliters of cream weakens the coffee by:
     \[
     15 \text{ milliliters of cream} \times 1 \text{ milliliter weaker per milliliter of cream} = 15 \text{ milliliters weaker}
     \]

4. **Total Weakening:**
   - The total weakening of the coffee is the sum of the weakening due to ice cubes and the weakening due to the cream:
     \[
     60 \text{ milliliters weaker} + 15 \text{ milliliters weaker} = 75 \text{ milliliters weaker}
     \]

So, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream."
"If 5 people leave with 7 new records, and each person can get 1 new record for every 2 old records they bring, then we can calculate the total number of old records brought in by dividing the number of new records by 1 (since each new record is traded for 1 old record) and then by 2 (since 2 old records are needed for 1 new record).

So, the calculation is:
\[ \text{Total old records brought in} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \]

The final numerical answer is:
14"
"First, let's find out how many junior programmers there are. We know that the total number of employees is 100 and the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees.

\[ \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

Next, we know that each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. So, the total amount paid to junior programmers per month is:

\[ \text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

Now, we need to find out how many senior programmers there are. Since the total number of employees is 100 and there are 40 junior programmers, the number of senior programmers is:

\[ \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

We are also given that senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers. So, the payment to each senior programmer is:

\[ \text{Payment to each senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400 \]

Now, we can calculate the total amount paid to senior programmers per month:

\[ \text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

Finally, to find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we add the total payments to junior and senior programmers:

\[ \text{Total payment to all programmers} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

So, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is:

\[ 224000 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's say the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( x \).
2. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the number of people on the bus becomes \( x + 5 \).
3. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. So, the number of people on the bus becomes \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).
4. We are told that at the third stop, there were 20 people on the bus.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate how many lollipops Oscar has after he eats 2 on his way to school. He starts with 24 lollipops:
\[ 24 - 2 = 22 \]

Next, he passes out 14 lollipops to his friends:
\[ 22 - 14 = 8 \]

Then, he buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends. Since he gave away 14 lollipops, he buys:
\[ 2 \times 14 = 28 \]
Adding these to the lollipops he has left:
\[ 8 + 28 = 36 \]

After that, he eats 3 more lollipops that night:
\[ 36 - 3 = 33 \]

Finally, he eats 2 more lollipops in the morning:
\[ 33 - 2 = 31 \]

So, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is:
\[ 31 \]"
"First, we need to find out how much more the phone needs to be charged to reach 100%. Since the phone is currently at 60%, it needs to be charged by 40% more.

The phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage point every 3 minutes. So, to charge 40 percentage points, it will take:
\[ 40 \text{ percentage points} \times 3 \text{ minutes/percentage point} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
\[ 120 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone."
"Erin starts with 7 lollipops and gets 10 more from her mother. So, she has a total of 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops. Then she gives 3 lollipops to Ella. So, she has 17 - 3 = 14 lollipops left.

The final numerical answer is 14."
"First, let's calculate how many rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip where they spent $80.

For every $20 spent, they get $1 off their next purchase. So, for $80 spent, they would get:
\[ \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ rewards} \]

Each reward is worth $1 off their next purchase. So, they would get $4 off their next purchase.

Now, let's see what happened on this shopping trip where they spent $43. They used their $4 rewards and applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price.

The $4 rewards would normally give them $4 off, but the coupon took twice that amount off, so:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars off} \]

So, the total discount from the rewards and the coupon is $8. This means the customer only paid:
\[ 43 - 8 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the customer paid $35 on this shopping trip."
"First, let's calculate the net pay for Job A.

Job A pays $15 per hour for 2000 hours a year, so the gross pay is:
\[ 15 \times 2000 = 30000 \]

The state tax rate is 20%, so the tax Nick has to pay is:
\[ 30000 \times 0.20 = 6000 \]

Therefore, the net pay for Job A is:
\[ 30000 - 6000 = 24000 \]

Next, let's calculate the net pay for Job B.

Job B pays $42,000 a year, but there is a $6,000 property tax, so the net income after property tax is:
\[ 42000 - 6000 = 36000 \]

The state tax rate on the net income after property tax is 10%, so the tax Nick has to pay is:
\[ 36000 \times 0.10 = 3600 \]

Therefore, the net pay for Job B is:
\[ 36000 - 3600 = 32400 \]

Now, we need to find out how much more money Nick will make at the job with the higher net pay rate compared to the other job.

The difference in net pay between Job B and Job A is:
\[ 32400 - 24000 = 8400 \]

So, Nick will make $8400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate compared to the other job."
"First, let's find out how many castles are ruins. We know that 40 percent of the 220 castles are ruins.

To find 40 percent of 220, we calculate:
\[ 40\% \times 220 = \frac{40}{100} \times 220 = 0.4 \times 220 = 88 \]

So, there are 88 ruined castles in Scotland.

Next, we need to find out how many of these ruined castles are unmanned. We know that half of the ruined castles are unmanned.

To find half of 88, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 88 = 44 \]

Therefore, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 44 \]"

For Cozy Homes:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 installments of $250 each
- Total installments: 9 * $250 = $2,250
- Total cost for Cozy Homes: $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

Now, let's find the cost difference between the two offers:
- Cost difference: $3,450 (Furniture United) - $3,350 (Cozy Homes) = $100

The cost difference between the two offers is $100."
"First, we need to find out the total number of paintball guns that Nick, Richard, Jason (DJ), and RJ have together.

Nick has 10 guns.
Richard has 5 guns.
DJ has 8 guns.
RJ has 1 gun.

Now, let's add these numbers together to find the total number of guns:
10 (Nick) + 5 (Richard) + 8 (DJ) + 1 (RJ) = 24 guns

Now, we need to share these 24 guns equally among the 4 people. To find out how many guns each person would get, we divide the total number of guns by the number of people:

24 guns ÷ 4 people = 6 guns per person

So, each of them would have 6 guns if they share them equally."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

So, Mason needs 310 ounces of sugar to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge."
"First, let's calculate the value of Maria's shares after the first year.

Maria buys 8 shares at $8 each, so the initial total value of her shares is:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8/\text{share} = \$64 \]

After the first year, the stock price increases by 50%. To find the new price per share:
\[ \text{New price per share} = \$8 + (0.50 \times \$8) = \$8 + \$4 = \$12 \]

So, the value of her 8 shares after the first year is:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12/\text{share} = \$96 \]

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. To find the new price per share:
\[ \text{New price per share} = \$12 - (0.25 \times \$12) = \$12 - \$3 = \$9 \]

So, the value of her 8 shares after the second year is:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$9/\text{share} = \$72 \]

Therefore, the final value of all Maria's shares is:
\[ \$72 \]"
"First, let's find out how many hot dogs Thomas ate. Since Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, we can calculate Thomas's hot dogs as follows:

Thomas's hot dogs = 3 * Luke's hot dogs
Thomas's hot dogs = 3 * 2
Thomas's hot dogs = 6

Now, let's find out how many hot dogs John ate. John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so:

John's hot dogs = Thomas's hot dogs / 2
John's hot dogs = 6 / 2
John's hot dogs = 3

To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number John ate:

More hot dogs John ate than Luke = John's hot dogs - Luke's hot dogs
More hot dogs John ate than Luke = 3 - 2
More hot dogs John ate than Luke = 1

So, John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke. The final numerical answer is 1."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know the total number of students is 200.
2. The class is split into 3 groups with 2 groups being equal in number and the third group being 10 students less than each of the other two groups.
3. Let's say the number of students in each of the two equal groups is \( x \).
4. Then the number of students in the smallest group is \( x - 10 \).

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the total number of students:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Add 10 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two equal groups has 70 students. Now, we can find the number of students in the smallest group:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60."
"To solve this, let's first figure out how many cows and chickens Farmer Brown has.

Let's say the number of cows is \( C \).
Since he has twice as many chickens as cows, the number of chickens is \( 2C \).

The total number of animals is the sum of cows and chickens, which is \( C + 2C = 3C \).

We know the total number of animals is 60, so:
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Farmer Brown has 20 cows. Since he has twice as many chickens as cows, he has:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \] chickens.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each.

The total number of legs from the cows is:
\[ 20 \times 4 = 80 \]

The total number of legs from the chickens is:
\[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of legs:
\[ 80 + 80 = 160 \]

So, the total number of legs the animals have is 160."
"Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week. So, after the first week he has 3 + 1 = 4 balls. After the second week, he has 4 + 1 = 5 balls. After the third week, he has 5 + 1 = 6 balls. After the fourth week, he has 6 + 1 = 7 balls.

But when he starts juggling on stage, he slips and drops 3 balls. So, he has 7 - 3 = 4 balls left to juggle. Two of these balls are caught by people in the crowd, but one gets lost. So, Josh is left with 4 - 2 = 2 balls to juggle.

The final number of balls Josh has to juggle is 2."
"First, let's find out the weights of the other animals based on the information given:

1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. The blue beetle weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
3. The green toad weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
4. The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
5. The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add up the weights of one of each animal:
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds

Total weight of the animals = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 240 pounds

The container itself weighs 20 pounds, so the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is:
240 + 20 = 260 pounds

The final numerical answer is 260 pounds."
"First, let's find out how many outfits Laurel received at her baby shower. Since her friend gave her 24 outfits and she received twice that amount at her baby shower, we calculate:

\[ 24 \times 2 = 48 \]

So, Laurel received 48 outfits at her baby shower.

Next, we add the outfits she received at her baby shower to the outfits her friend gave her:

\[ 24 + 48 = 72 \]

Then, we add the outfits her mom gave her:

\[ 72 + 15 = 87 \]

So, the total number of outfits Laurel has for her baby is:

\[ 87 \]"
"First, let's find out how many meters Tyson runs if he follows his coach's advice. His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters than he currently runs. So, we need to calculate 1/5 of 5000 meters and add that to the original 5000 meters.

1/5 of 5000 meters is:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 5000 = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

So, if Tyson follows the coach's advice, he will run:
\[ 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters per day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days are in June. June has 30 days.

So, the total distance Tyson will run in June is:
\[ 6000 \text{ meters/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 180000 \text{ meters} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 180000 \]"
"First, let's find out how much Juice Box B costs. Since Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, and Juice Box A costs 4 dollars, we can calculate the cost of Juice Box B as follows:

Cost of Juice Box B = Cost of Juice Box A + 5 dollars
Cost of Juice Box B = 4 dollars + 5 dollars
Cost of Juice Box B = 9 dollars

Next, let's find out how much Juice Box C costs. Since Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, and Juice Box A costs 4 dollars, we can calculate the cost of Juice Box C as follows:

Cost of Juice Box C = Cost of Juice Box A + 7 dollars
Cost of Juice Box C = 4 dollars + 7 dollars
Cost of Juice Box C = 11 dollars

Now, to find out how much more Juice Box C costs than Juice Box B, we subtract the cost of Juice Box B from the cost of Juice Box C:

Difference = Cost of Juice Box C - Cost of Juice Box B
Difference = 11 dollars - 9 dollars
Difference = 2 dollars

So, Juice Box C is 2 dollars more than Juice Box B. The final numerical answer is 2 dollars."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the total number of legs from both types of tables.

For the 40 tables with 4 legs each:
\[ 40 \times 4 = 160 \text{ legs} \]

For the 50 tables with 3 legs each:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \text{ legs} \]

Now, we add the legs from both types of tables together:
\[ 160 + 150 = 310 \text{ legs} \]

So, the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is 310."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Jenny buys in a week:
- Jenny buys 1 bag of cookies a week.
- Each bag has 36 cookies.

So, the total number of cookies in a week is:
\[ 36 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, let's calculate how many cookies Jenny puts in her son's lunch box:
- She puts 4 cookies in her son's lunch box 5 days a week.
- So, the total number of cookies she puts in her son's lunch box in a week is:
\[ 4 \text{ cookies/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 20 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Now, let's calculate how many cookies her husband eats:
- Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days.
- So, the total number of cookies her husband eats in a week is:
\[ 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 7 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Now, let's find out how many cookies are left for Jenny to eat:
- Total cookies in a week: 36
- Cookies put in son's lunch box: 20
- Cookies eaten by her husband: 7

So, the number of cookies left for Jenny to eat is:
\[ 36 - 20 - 7 = 9 \]

Therefore, the number of cookies Jenny eats is:
\[ 9 \]"
"First, let's find out the total cost of the 2 shirts without any discount. Since each shirt costs $30, the total cost for 2 shirts is:
\[ 30 \times 2 = 60 \]

Now, Davos got a 40% discount on these shirts. To find out how much the discount is, we calculate 40% of $60:
\[ 40\% \text{ of } 60 = \frac{40}{100} \times 60 = 0.4 \times 60 = 24 \]

So, the discount amount is $24. To find out how much Davos paid after the discount, we subtract the discount from the original total cost:
\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

Therefore, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts."
"First, let's calculate how much money they made per day when they made tractors:
- They sold 10 tractors a day.
- Each tractor was sold for $100.

So, the daily income from selling tractors was:
\[ 10 \text{ tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

Now, let's calculate how much money they make per day now that they make silos:
- They sell 5 silos a day.
- Each silo is sold for $220.

So, the daily income from selling silos is:
\[ 5 \text{ silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day} \]

To find out what percentage more they are making now, we use the formula for percentage increase:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New Amount} - \text{Old Amount}}{\text{Old Amount}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\$1100 - \$1000}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{\$100}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, they are making 10% more per day now."
"To find out how much money Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to calculate the monthly cost first and then multiply it by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year).

First, let's calculate the monthly cost:
- Food costs $25 per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the cost of food per month is $25 * 4 = $100.
- Treats cost $20 per month.
- Medicine costs $100 per month.

So, the total monthly cost is $100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $120 per month.

Now, to find the yearly cost, we multiply the monthly cost by 12:
$120 * 12 = $1440.

So, Madeline spends $1440 on her dog per year."
"Let's break down the activities and calculate the total time step by step:

1. **Monday's yoga class**: 1 hour
2. **Tuesday's cooking class**: 3 times as long as Monday's yoga, so 3 * 1 = 3 hours
3. **Wednesday's cheese-tasting event**: 0.5 hours
4. **Thursday's museum tour**: Half as long as the cooking class, so 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours
5. **Friday's errands**: 2 hours

Now, let's add up all the hours:

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 3 hours
- Wednesday: 0.5 hours
- Thursday: 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours

Total hours = 1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5 hours

So, the total time for all Peyton’s after-work activities is 7.5 hours."
"First, let's find out how many plant pots April needs for the roses. Since she needs twice as many for the roses as for the daisies, and she needs 30 plant pots for the daisies, we can calculate the number of plant pots needed for the roses as follows:

\[ \text{Plant pots for roses} = 2 \times \text{Plant pots for daisies} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Now, let's add the plant pots needed for the daisies and the roses to find the total number of plant pots needed:

\[ \text{Total plant pots needed} = \text{Plant pots for daisies} + \text{Plant pots for roses} = 30 + 60 = 90 \]

April had already bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many plant pots she has left over, we subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number of plant pots she already bought:

\[ \text{Plant pots left over} = \text{Plant pots bought} - \text{Total plant pots needed} = 100 - 90 = 10 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 10 \]"
"First, let's figure out how much money Andrea had left after buying the sweater and giving some to her brother.

She started with $36.
She spent $11 on a sweater.
She gave her brother $4.

So, the total amount spent or given away is $11 + $4 = $15.

Now, to find out how much money she had left, we subtract the total amount spent or given away from the initial amount:

$36 - $15 = $21.

So, Andrea saved $21."
"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming.

John spends 6 hours boating.
He spends half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours swimming.

So, the total time spent on boating and swimming is 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

Next, we know that watching 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, took him 3 * 2 = 6 hours.

The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is 9 + 6 = 15 hours.

We are told that this 15 hours is 30% of the total time he spent on all activities. To find the total time, we can set up the equation:

\[ 0.30 \times \text{Total Time} = 15 \]

Solving for the Total Time:

\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John spent 40% of his total time sightseeing. To find the time spent sightseeing, we calculate:

\[ 0.40 \times 50 = 20 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time John spent sightseeing is 20 hours."
"First, let's calculate how much money Annabelle earns from her first job. She works 20 hours at $10 per hour, so:

\[ 20 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$200 \]

Next, let's calculate how much money she earns from her second job. She works 15 hours at $5 per hour, so:

\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times \$5/\text{hour} = \$75 \]

Now, let's add up all the money she has earned so far:

\[ \$80 \text{ (initial savings)} + \$200 \text{ (first job earnings)} + \$75 \text{ (second job earnings)} = \$355 \]

The phone costs $400, so to find out how much more money Annabelle needs, we subtract the total amount she has from the cost of the phone:

\[ \$400 - \$355 = \$45 \]

So, Annabelle still needs \$45 to save for the phone."
"First, let's find the height of the second tree. Since the second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, and the shortest tree is 6 feet tall, we can calculate the height of the second tree as follows:

\[ \text{Height of the second tree} = \text{Height of the shortest tree} + 5 \]
\[ \text{Height of the second tree} = 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the combined height of the shortest and the second tree:

\[ \text{Combined height of the shortest and second tree} = \text{Height of the shortest tree} + \text{Height of the second tree} \]
\[ \text{Combined height} = 6 + 11 = 17 \text{ feet} \]

The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and the second tree:

\[ \text{Height of the tallest tree} = 2 \times \text{Combined height} \]
\[ \text{Height of the tallest tree} = 2 \times 17 = 34 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height of the tallest tree is 34 feet."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the toy cars. Dean bought 6 toy cars and each toy car costs $2. So, the total cost for the toy cars is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the teddy bears. Dean bought 5 teddy bears and each teddy bear costs $1. So, the total cost for the teddy bears is:
\[ 5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's find the total cost of the toys Dean bought. We add the cost of the toy cars and the cost of the teddy bears:
\[ 12 + 5 = 17 \text{ dollars} \]

Dean's mother gave him $28 initially, and he spent $17 on toys. So, the amount of money Dean has left after buying the toys is:
\[ 28 - 17 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

Dean's mother then gives him an extra $10. So, we add this extra money to the $11 Dean has left:
\[ 11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final amount of money Dean has left is:
\[ 21 \text{ dollars} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost for the mini-golf and go-karts.

The cost for one round of mini-golf is $5.
The cost for riding the go-karts twice is $10 x 2 = $20.

So, the total cost for mini-golf and go-karts is $5 + $20 = $25.

Now, we subtract this total cost from the budget to find out how much money is left for arcade tokens and for Morgan herself.

The budget is $90, and the cost for mini-golf and go-karts is $25, so the remaining budget is $90 - $25 = $65.

Morgan wants to have $5 in arcade tokens, so we subtract this from the remaining budget to find out how much is left for her friends.

The remaining budget after buying arcade tokens is $65 - $5 = $60.

Since each friend gets to play one round of mini-golf and ride the go-karts twice, the cost for each friend is $5 (mini-golf) + $20 (go-karts) = $25.

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend to find out how many friends can be invited.

The number of friends she can invite is $60 / $25 = 2.4.

Since she can't invite a fraction of a person, she can invite 2 friends."
"First, let's calculate how much Marisa spends on lollipops each day.

Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and she buys 4 lollipops each day. So, the cost for lollipops each day is:
\[ 4 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 100 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar. So, Marisa spends $1 on lollipops each day.

Now, let's calculate how much money Marisa gets as pocket money each day. She gets $5 every day.

So, the amount of money she saves each day is the pocket money minus the cost of the lollipops:
\[ 5 \text{ dollars} - 1 \text{ dollar} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Marisa saves this amount for 5 days. So, the total amount she saves in 5 days is:
\[ 4 \text{ dollars/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"
"First, let's find out how much money Billy spent on gumballs. If he bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, the total cost for the gumballs is:

\[ 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Since he spent half of his change on gumballs, the total change he received from his $10 is:

\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

This means Billy spent $4 on candy. Since each pound of candy costs $1.5, we can find out how many pounds of candy he bought by dividing the total amount spent on candy by the cost per pound:

\[ \frac{4}{1.5} = \frac{40}{15} = \frac{8}{3} \approx 2.67 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Billy bought approximately 2.67 pounds of candy. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 2.67 \]"
"To solve this, let's use a simple algebraic equation. Let's say the age of Carver's son is \( x \) years.

According to the problem, Carver's age (45 years) is 5 years less than twice his son's age. So we can write the equation as:

\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

First, add 5 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

\[ \frac{50}{2} = x \]
\[ 25 = x \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

The final numerical answer is 25."
"First, let's find out the total distance the train travels in one trip.

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city back to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the second and third city trip. So, the distance from the third city to the first city is 100 miles - 50 miles = 50 miles.

Now, let's add up all the distances for one trip:
75 miles + 100 miles + 50 miles = 225 miles.

The train does this trip 3 times a day, so the total distance traveled in one day is:
225 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 675 miles/day.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance traveled in one day by the service interval:
675 miles/day ÷ 18,000 miles/service = 0.0375 service intervals/day.

To find out how many days it goes between services, we take the reciprocal of 0.0375:
1 ÷ 0.0375 = 26.6667 days.

Since the train can't go for a fraction of a day between services, we round up to the next whole number. So, the train goes between services every 27 days.

The final numerical answer is 27 days."
"First, let's find out how much stuffing a collie bed needs. A collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. A Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds and a chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds. So, the average is:

\[ \text{Stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we know:
- A chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing.
- A collie bed takes 5 pounds of stuffing.

Mark needs to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds. So, the total stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds is:

\[ 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds} \]

And the total stuffing needed for the collie beds is:

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of stuffing Mark needs:

\[ 8 + 15 = 23 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 23 pounds."
"First, let's calculate the time John spent driving to his friend's house. He drove 200 miles at a speed of 70 mph. The time taken can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time taken to drive to his friend's house is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} = \frac{200 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} \]

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} = \frac{200}{70} \text{ hours} \]

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} \]

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} \approx 2.857 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's calculate the time John spent driving back home. He drove 240 miles at a speed of 80 mph. Using the same formula:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{back home}} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} \]

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{back home}} = \frac{240}{80} \text{ hours} \]

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{back home}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add the time taken for both trips to get the total time:

\[ \text{Total Time} = \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} + \text{Time}_{\text{back home}} \]

\[ \text{Total Time} = 2.857 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} \]

\[ \text{Total Time} \approx 5.857 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total trip took approximately 5.857 hours."
"First, let's find out how many fourth-grade boys there are at Small Tree School. We know there are 96 fourth-graders in total and 43 of them are girls. So, the number of boys is:

96 total students - 43 girls = 53 boys

Next, we need to find out how many boys were present on Friday. We know that 5 girls were absent, and 4 boys were absent. So, the number of boys present is:

53 boys - 4 boys absent = 49 boys present

So, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is 49."
"If there are 6 girls in the park and there are twice the number of boys, then there are 6 * 2 = 12 boys in the park.

To find the total number of kids in the park, we add the number of girls and boys together: 6 girls + 12 boys = 18 kids.

So, the final numerical answer is 18."
"To find out the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test, we first need to calculate the total points she has already scored on her first two tests.

Jane scored 15 points on her first test and 18 points on her second test. So, the total points from the first two tests is:
\[ 15 + 18 = 33 \]

Jane needs a total of at least 42 points across all three tests. To find out how many points she needs on her third test, we subtract the points she has already scored from the total points required:
\[ 42 - 33 = 9 \]

So, the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass is 9."
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
2. A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting.
3. Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.
4. A total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart.

Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as \( C \). So, \( C = 3 \).

The number of people kicked out for shoplifting is \( 4C - 5 \). Substituting \( C = 3 \) into this equation, we get:
\[ 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]
So, 7 people were kicked out for shoplifting.

The number of people kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \).

Now, we know the total number of people kicked out is 50. We can calculate the number of people kicked out for other reasons by subtracting the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence from the total number:
\[ 50 - (3 + 7 + 21) = 50 - 31 = 19 \]

So, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is 19."
"First, let's find out how many points Erin has now. We know that Sara scored 8 points and Erin has three times more points than Sara. So, we calculate Erin's current points as follows:

\[ \text{Erin's current points} = 3 \times \text{Sara's points} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, we know that after scoring 14 points, Erin has 24 points. So, to find out how many points Erin had before scoring the 14 points, we subtract 14 from 24:

\[ \text{Erin's points before} = \text{Erin's current points} - 14 = 24 - 14 = 10 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 10."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. Each frame costs $20 and there are 44 seniors, so the cost for the frames is:
\[ 44 \times 20 = 880 \]

Next, we need to add the additional 20% cost for etching the logo on each frame. The additional cost per frame is:
\[ 20 \times 0.20 = 4 \]
So, the total cost for each frame including the additional etching is:
\[ 20 + 4 = 24 \]
Therefore, the total cost for all the frames is:
\[ 44 \times 24 = 1056 \]

Now, we need to add the cost of the pins for 2 seniors. Each pin costs $5, so the total cost for the pins is:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the cords for the officers. There are 44 seniors and 1/4 of them are officers, so the number of officers is:
\[ \frac{44}{4} = 11 \]
Each cord costs $12, so the total cost for the cords is:
\[ 11 \times 12 = 132 \]

Now, we add up all the costs:
\[ 1056 + 10 + 132 = 1200 \]

So, the total amount spent on the senior gifts is:
\[ \boxed{1200} \]"
"First, let's find out how much the DIY materials cost. If the hand-painted wallpaper costs $400 and a DIY saves 20% on the materials cost, then the materials cost is 80% of $400.

To find 80% of $400, we calculate:
\[ 0.80 \times 400 = 320 \]

So, the DIY materials cost $320. Since the question asks for the total cost if Ethan made his own hand-painted wallpaper, we add the materials cost to the original cost of the wallpaper.

The total cost is:
\[ 320 + 400 = 720 \]

So, the total cost if Ethan made his own hand-painted wallpaper is $720."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.
2. On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday. So, they sold \(14 \times 2 = 28\) pairs.
3. On Sunday, they sold one-half the number of shoes sold on Saturday. So, they sold \(28 \div 2 = 14\) pairs.
4. Six pairs were returned, so we need to subtract these from the total sold on Sunday. So, \(14 - 6 = 8\) pairs were actually sold on Sunday.

Now, let's add up all the pairs sold over the three days:
- Friday: 14 pairs
- Saturday: 28 pairs
- Sunday: 8 pairs

So, the total number of pairs sold is \(14 + 28 + 8 = 48\) pairs.

The final numerical answer is 48."
"To find out how many hours a week Hallie had dance practice, we need to add up the hours she practiced on each day.

On Tuesdays, she had 1 hour of practice.
On Thursdays, she had 2 hours of practice.
On Saturdays, she had practice that lasted twice as long as Tuesday's, so that's 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

Now, we add up all the hours:
1 (Tuesday) + 2 (Thursday) + 2 (Saturday) = 5 hours

So, the final numerical answer is 5."
"First, let's find out how many pieces of equipment were faulty. If 40% of the total number of pieces were faulty, then 60% of the total number of pieces were functioning because 100% - 40% = 60%.

The total cost of the equipment is $400,000. So, the cost of the functioning pieces of equipment is 60% of $400,000.

To find 60% of $400,000, we can use the formula:
\[ \text{Amount} = \text{Total Cost} \times \left(\frac{\text{Percentage}}{100}\right) \]

So, the amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment is:
\[ \text{Amount} = 400000 \times \left(\frac{60}{100}\right) \]

Let's calculate this.
\[ \text{Amount} = 400000 \times 0.60 \]
\[ \text{Amount} = 240000 \]

So, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $240,000."
"First, we need to find out how many sheep give 1 kg of milk and how many give 2 kg of milk.

Half of 30 sheep is 30 / 2 = 15 sheep.

So, 15 sheep give 1 kg of milk each, and 15 sheep give 2 kg of milk each.

Now, we calculate the total milk from the 15 sheep that give 1 kg each:
15 sheep * 1 kg/sheep = 15 kg

Next, we calculate the total milk from the 15 sheep that give 2 kg each:
15 sheep * 2 kg/sheep = 30 kg

Now, we add the two amounts together to find the total milk collected every day:
15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg

So, the final numerical answer is 45 kg."
"Mrs. Sherman made a dozen bread rolls, which means she made 12 bread rolls. She gave one roll to each of her 6 children, so she gave away 6 rolls. That leaves her with 12 - 6 = 6 rolls. She then broke each of the remaining 6 rolls into 8 pieces. So, the total number of pieces she fed to the chickens is 6 rolls * 8 pieces per roll = 48 pieces. 

The final numerical answer is 48."
"First, let's find out how many pupils like blue. Since half of the class likes blue, we calculate:

\[
\text{Pupils who like blue} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Now, we subtract the number of pupils who like blue from the total number of pupils to find out how many are left:

\[
\text{Remaining pupils} = 40 - 20 = 20
\]

Next, we find out how many of these remaining pupils like green. Since one-fourth of the remaining pupils like green, we calculate:

\[
\text{Pupils who like green} = \frac{20}{4} = 5
\]

Finally, to find out how many pupils like yellow, we subtract the number of pupils who like blue and green from the total number of pupils:

\[
\text{Pupils who like yellow} = 40 - 20 - 5 = 15
\]

So, the number of pupils who like the color yellow is 15."
"First, let's find out how many apples Lucy sold on Monday. We know that she sold all the apples she picked on Monday and got $56 from selling them at $4 per piece.

To find the number of apples sold on Monday, we divide the total money she got by the price per apple:
\[ \text{Number of apples sold on Monday} = \frac{\$56}{\$4/\text{apple}} = 14 \text{ apples} \]

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples. On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday. So, the number of apples picked on Wednesday is:
\[ \text{Number of apples picked on Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ apples} \]

Now, to find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we add the apples picked on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday:
\[ \text{Total number of apples} = 14 \text{ (Monday)} + 12 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 24 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 50 \text{ apples} \]

So, the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days is 50."
"First, let's understand what Lindsay has washed. She washed 10 pairs of socks. Since each pair consists of 2 socks, 10 pairs would be:

10 pairs * 2 socks/pair = 20 socks

She also washed 15 loose socks. So, the total number of socks she washed is:

20 socks + 15 socks = 35 socks

Now, we know there are 50 socks that need washing. To find out how many socks Lindsay missed, we subtract the number of socks she washed from the total number of socks:

50 socks - 35 socks = 15 socks

So, Lindsay has missed 15 socks."
"Rachel originally had 23 cookies. Janet gave her 42 more cookies. So, Rachel had a total of 23 + 42 = 65 cookies. Then her brother ate 44 cookies. So, Rachel is left with 65 - 44 = 21 cookies.

The final numerical answer is 21."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Karan will have to pay back including the interest and then divide that by the number of months she has to pay.

First, let's calculate the total interest:
- The principal amount (P) is $3,650.
- The interest rate (R) is 10% per year, which is 0.10 as a decimal.
- The time (T) is 5 months, which is 5/12 of a year.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Interest} = P \times R \times T \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} \]

Let's calculate the interest:
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 152.5875 \]

Now, let's find the total amount to be paid back:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.5875 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3802.5875 \]

Since Karan has to pay this amount back in 5 months, we divide the total amount by 5 to find the monthly payment:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{5} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.5875}{5} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.5175 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.52 \]

So, Karan has to pay $760.52 per month."
"First, let's calculate how far Cho hiked. Cho's speed was 14 kilometers per hour and he hiked for 8 hours. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, let's calculate how far Chloe hiked. Chloe's speed was 9 kilometers per hour and she hiked for 5 hours. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

Now, to find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked, we subtract the distance Chloe hiked from the distance Cho hiked:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

So, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe."
"First, let's find out how many silver and gold pesos Anna has.

Axel has 50 silver pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Axel has 80 gold pesos. Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so:
\[ 80 + 40 = 120 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of pesos they have together.

Axel has:
\[ 50 \text{ silver pesos} + 80 \text{ gold pesos} = 130 \text{ pesos} \]

Anna has:
\[ 100 \text{ silver pesos} + 120 \text{ gold pesos} = 220 \text{ pesos} \]

Adding the total pesos they have together:
\[ 130 + 220 = 350 \]

So, the total number of pesos they have together is 350."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she can make 3 pitchers, she can make:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups/pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how much money she makes by selling all 36 cups of lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1, her total revenue is:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1/\text{cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we know that she spent $18 to buy the supplies. To find her profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Millie sells all of the lemonade, and she sells an average of 4 cups per hour. To find out how much profit she makes per hour, we divide her total profit by the number of hours she sells lemonade:

\[ \frac{\$18}{4 \text{ hours}} = \$4.50/\text{hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$4.50 \]"
"To solve this, let's think about it step by step. If Mr. Ruther has 12.8 hectares left after selling 3/5 of his land, that means he has 2/5 of his land left because 1 - 3/5 = 2/5.

Now, if 2/5 of his land is equal to 12.8 hectares, we can find out how much 1/5 of his land is by dividing 12.8 hectares by 2. Then, to find out how much land he had at first, we multiply the amount of 1/5 by 5.

Let's do the calculation:

12.8 hectares ÷ 2 = 6.4 hectares

6.4 hectares is 1/5 of his land. So,

6.4 hectares × 5 = 32 hectares

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

The final numerical answer is 32."
"First, let's find out how many boys and girls are in the choir. Since 50% of the choir are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

Number of girls = 50% of 52 members
Number of girls = 0.50 * 52
Number of girls = 26

Since the choir is made up of 52 members and half are girls, the other half must be boys. So, the number of boys is also 26.

Now, the choir decides to perform with just its female members. So, the number of female members is the same as the number of girls, which is 26.

On the day of the performance, half the people performing can't make it because their bus breaks down. So, half of the 26 female members can't make it:

Number of female members who can't make it = 1/2 * 26
Number of female members who can't make it = 13

This means the number of female members who can make it is:

Number of female members who can make it = 26 - 13
Number of female members who can make it = 13

Then, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. So, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

Total number of people who sang = Number of female members who can make it + Number of teachers
Total number of people who sang = 13 + 3
Total number of people who sang = 16

So, the final numerical answer is 16."
"To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his 5 test scores. The scores are 65, 94, 81, 86, and 74.

First, we add up all the scores:
65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 = 300

Next, we divide the total by the number of tests, which is 5:
300 ÷ 5 = 60

So, Wilson's current math grade is 60.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \$12 + \$24 = \$36 \]

So, the total cost for 6 erasers and 8 pencils is:
\[ \$36 \]"
"First, we need to find out how many messages Mr. Yu received. Since Mr. Yu received 1/3 as many messages as Ms. Thompson, we calculate:

\[ \text{Messages to Mr. Yu} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \]

Now, to find the total number of messages delivered, we add the messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu together:

\[ \text{Total messages} = 66 + 22 = 88 \]

So, the total number of messages James delivered is 88."
"First, let's calculate how much money David spends. David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides. So, David spends $30.

Now, let's calculate how much money Dasha spends. Dasha buys tickets for 9 rides. Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2. So, each ride costs $2 * 2 = $4. For 9 rides, Dasha spends 9 * $4 = $36.

Now, let's find out how much money they would have spent if they both bought tickets. If they both bought tickets, they would need 9 * 2 = 18 tickets. Since each ticket costs $2, they would spend 18 * $2 = $36.

So, Dasha spends $36 and David spends $30. To find out how much money David saves, we subtract the amount David spends from the amount Dasha spends:

$36 - $30 = $6

Therefore, David saves $6."
"To find out how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to divide the total inches of ribbon by the total number of gifts.

First, let's find the total number of gifts:
- Monica has 6 gifts for her family.
- She has 4 gifts for her friends.
- She has 2 gifts for her teachers.

So, the total number of gifts is:
6 + 4 + 2 = 12 gifts

Now, we have 144 inches of ribbon to wrap all these gifts. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow, we divide the total inches of ribbon by the total number of gifts:

144 inches ÷ 12 gifts = 12 inches per gift

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To solve this, we first need to find out how many popsicles Betty and Sam each have. The ratio of Betty's popsicles to Sam's popsicles is 5:6, and together they have 165 popsicles.

First, let's add the parts of the ratio together:
5 + 6 = 11

This means that the total number of popsicles (165) is divided into 11 parts.

Now, to find out how many popsicles are in one part, we divide the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:
165 ÷ 11 = 15

So, each part of the ratio represents 15 popsicles.

Now, we can find out how many popsicles Betty and Sam have individually:
- Betty has 5 parts, so she has 5 × 15 = 75 popsicles.
- Sam has 6 parts, so he has 6 × 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number Sam has:
90 - 75 = 15

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

The final numerical answer is:
15"
"First, let's calculate the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus with the 20% savings.

The normal cost for Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, so together they cost $10 + $10 = $20 a month.

With a 20% savings, the savings amount is 20% of $20, which is:
\[ 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \]

So, the cost after the savings is:
\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \]

Now, let's add the cost of Netflix, which is $10 a month.

So, the total cost for streaming services is:
\[ 16 + 10 = 26 \]

Tim used to pay $60 for his cable package. Now he pays $26 for streaming services.

The amount of money he saves is:
\[ 60 - 26 = 34 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 34 \]"
"First, let's find out how much time Carol spent recording the song. She spent half the time recording that she spent writing, so:

Recording time = Writing time / 2
Recording time = 4 hours / 2
Recording time = 2 hours

Now, let's convert all the time spent into the same unit. We'll use minutes for this calculation.

Writing time = 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes
Recording time = 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes
Editing time = 90 minutes

Now, let's add up all the time spent:

Total time = Writing time + Recording time + Editing time
Total time = 240 minutes + 120 minutes + 90 minutes
Total time = 450 minutes

To find out what percentage of her total work time she spent editing, we use the formula:

Percentage of time spent editing = (Editing time / Total time) * 100

Substituting the values we have:

Percentage of time spent editing = (90 / 450) * 100
Percentage of time spent editing = 0.2 * 100
Percentage of time spent editing = 20%

So, the final numerical answer is 20%."
"To solve this, we first need to find out how many spots are in the shelving system. Since it has 6 rows and 6 columns, we can calculate the total number of spots by multiplying these numbers:

\[ \text{Total spots} = 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in these spots. First, we calculate double the number of spots:

\[ \text{Double the spots} = 36 \times 2 = 72 \]

Then, we add 20 to this number to find out how many books Wendy wants to place:

\[ \text{Books Wendy wants to place} = 72 + 20 = 92 \]

So, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cards Erica has initially:

- Erica made 20 cards.
- Her dad brought her 2 boxes with 15 cards each, so that's 2 * 15 = 30 cards.

Now, let's add these together:

20 (made by Erica) + 30 (brought by her dad) = 50 cards.

Next, we need to account for the cards she passed out and received:

- She passed out 24 cards to her classmates.
- She received 17 cards from family and friends.

Now, let's subtract the cards she passed out and add the cards she received:

50 (total cards) - 24 (passed out) + 17 (received) = 43 cards.

So, the final number of Valentine's cards Erica has is 43."
"First, let's find out how many slices Jenny gives to Bill and Mark.

Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ slices} \]

Next, Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. So we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's add the slices given to Bill and Mark:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny eats 2 slices. So, we subtract the slices given to Bill, Mark, and the slices Jenny eats from the total number of slices:
\[ 12 - 7 - 2 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

So, the number of slices left is:
\[ 3 \]"
"Mark currently has $50 and he needs $300 for the bike. So, he needs an additional $300 - $50 = $250. Since he earns $10 per day, he needs $250 / $10 = 25 days to save the money. 

The final numerical answer is 25."
"First, let's find out how many millipedes Nancy saw. Since she saw 1/3 as many millipedes as spiders, and she saw 90 spiders, we can calculate the number of millipedes as follows:

Number of millipedes = 1/3 * Number of spiders
Number of millipedes = 1/3 * 90
Number of millipedes = 30

Next, we need to find out how many stink bugs Nancy saw. The number of stink bugs is equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12. So we calculate it as follows:

Number of stink bugs = 2 * Number of millipedes - 12
Number of stink bugs = 2 * 30 - 12
Number of stink bugs = 60 - 12
Number of stink bugs = 48

Now, to find the total number of bugs Nancy saw, we add the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs together:

Total number of bugs = Number of spiders + Number of millipedes + Number of stink bugs
Total number of bugs = 90 + 30 + 48
Total number of bugs = 168

So, Nancy counted a total of 168 bugs."
"If Erica is 30 years old, and Beth is 5 years older than Erica, then Beth is:
\[ 30 + 5 = 35 \text{ years old} \]

Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so Alice is:

\[ 8 \text{ ounces/glass} \times 2 \text{ glasses} = 16 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories are in 16 ounces of milk. Since there are 3 calories in each ounce, we multiply:

\[ 16 \text{ ounces} \times 3 \text{ calories/ounce} = 48 \text{ calories} \]

So, the total number of calories John consumed is 48 calories."
"First, let's calculate how many days the builder works in a month:

He works 4 weeks every month and 6 days every week.
So, in a month, he works 4 * 6 = 24 days.

Now, let's calculate how much he earns in a month:
He gets paid $50 every day, so in a month, he earns 24 * $50 = $1200.

Finally, let's calculate how much he earns in a year:
There are 12 months in a year, so in a year, he earns 12 * $1200 = $14400.

So, the final numerical answer is $14400."
"First, let's find out how much flour and milk Mark needs for a quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour. For a quadruple batch, he needs:
\[ 3 \text{ cups} \times 4 = 12 \text{ cups of flour} \]

The normal recipe calls for 1 cup of milk. For a quadruple batch, he needs:
\[ 1 \text{ cup} \times 4 = 4 \text{ cups of milk} \]

Now, let's find out how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy.

Flour is sold in 2-cup bags. To get 12 cups of flour, he needs:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups per bag}} = 6 \text{ bags of flour} \]

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles. To get 4 cups of milk, he needs:
\[ \frac{4 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups per bottle}} = 2 \text{ bottles of milk} \]

Now, let's find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy:
\[ 6 \text{ bags of flour} - 2 \text{ bottles of milk} = 4 \]

So, Mark has to buy 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's find out how much energy the air conditioner uses in one day before the reduction. Since the air conditioner uses 900 watts for 8 hours, we can calculate the daily energy usage in watt-hours:

\[ 900 \, \text{watts} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watt-hours} \]

To convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours, we divide by 1000:

\[ 7200 \, \text{watt-hours} \div 1000 = 7.2 \, \text{kilowatt-hours} \]

So, the air conditioner uses 7.2 kilowatt-hours of energy each day.

Now, if Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, the new daily usage will be:

\[ 7.2 \, \text{kilowatt-hours} - \left( \frac{900 \, \text{watts}}{1000} \times 5 \, \text{hours} \right) \]

\[ = 7.2 \, \text{kilowatt-hours} - 4.5 \, \text{kilowatt-hours} \]

\[ = 2.7 \, \text{kilowatt-hours} \]

So, the air conditioner now uses 2.7 kilowatt-hours of energy each day.

To find out how much energy he saves in 30 days, we calculate the difference in energy usage over 30 days:

\[ 7.2 \, \text{kilowatt-hours/day} - 2.7 \, \text{kilowatt-hours/day} = 4.5 \, \text{kilowatt-hours/day} \]

\[ 4.5 \, \text{kilowatt-hours/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kilowatt-hours} \]

So, Mel will save 135 kilowatt-hours of electric energy in 30 days."
"First, let's find out the total number of stripes on all the zebras Jane counted.

Jane has:
- 2 zebras with 17 stripes each.
- 1 zebra with 36 stripes.
- 1 zebra with half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of stripes:
- For the 2 zebras with 17 stripes each: 2 * 17 = 34 stripes.
- For the zebra with 36 stripes: 36 stripes.
- For the zebra with 18 stripes: 18 stripes.

Adding these together:
34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes in total.

To find the average number of stripes, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras:
There are 2 zebras with 17 stripes + 1 zebra with 36 stripes + 1 zebra with 18 stripes = 4 zebras in total.

So, the average number of stripes is:
88 stripes / 4 zebras = 22 stripes per zebra.

The final numerical answer is 22."
"First, let's find out how many sandwiches Tyson needs to make to serve 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each sandwich serves:

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Now, we know each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. So, for 5 sandwiches, Tyson will need:

5 sandwiches * 1 pound of meat per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat
5 sandwiches * 1 pound of cheese per sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese

Next, we calculate the cost for the meat and cheese:

Cost of meat = 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
Cost of cheese = 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

Finally, we add the cost of the meat and cheese to find the total cost:

Total cost = Cost of meat + Cost of cheese
Total cost = $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

So, Tyson would spend $50.00 on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people."
"First, let's find out how many corns Allan has initially. We know that he has twice as much corn as cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, the number of corns he has initially is:

\[ \text{Number of corns} = 2 \times \text{Number of cannolis} = 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

Next, Allan bought 60 more cannolis. So, the new number of cannolis he has is:

\[ \text{New number of cannolis} = 40 + 60 = 100 \]

Now, Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought. Since he bought 60 more cannolis, the number of corns he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of corns bought} = 60 - 40 = 20 \]

So, the new number of corns he has is:

\[ \text{New number of corns} = 80 + 20 = 100 \]

Now, to find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house, we add the new number of corns and the new number of cannolis:

\[ \text{Total} = \text{New number of corns} + \text{New number of cannolis} = 100 + 100 = 200 \]

So, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 200."
"Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which means he walked 5,000 steps there and back. He also did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So far, he has walked 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

He had 2,000 steps left to take. This means that the total number of steps he planned to take in the day was 6,000 (already taken) + 2,000 (left) = 8,000 steps.

Since his goal was 10,000 steps and he has already taken 8,000 steps, the number of steps he took during his jog is 10,000 - 8,000 = 2,000 steps.

So, the final numerical answer is 2000."
"First, let's find out how many words are in the book. The book is 45 pages long and each page has 200 words. So, the total number of words in the book is:

\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes Toby to read the entire book. He reads at a rate of 300 words per minute. So, the time it takes to read the book is:

\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby plans to leave as soon as he finishes the book, which will take 30 minutes. He also needs 10 minutes to get to the airport. So, the total time he needs is:

\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby has 60 minutes until he needs to be at the airport. So, the number of minutes early Toby will be is:

\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 40 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Toby will be 20 minutes early."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carolyn's company paid in May.

Each employee works 40 hours a week and is paid $15 per hour. So, the weekly pay for one employee is:
\[ 40 \text{ hours/week} \times \$15/\text{hour} = \$600/\text{week} \]

Since there are 40 employees in May, the total pay for all employees in May is:
\[ 40 \text{ employees} \times \$600/\text{employee} = \$24,000 \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money the company paid in June. In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired. This means that 1/4 of the 40 employees' contracts expired, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \text{ employees} \]

So, 10 employees' contracts expired in June, and the other 30 employees continued to work. The 30 employees who continued to work in June still get paid the same amount as in May, which is $600 per week. The 10 employees who lost their contracts in June did not get paid in June.

The total pay for the 30 employees who continued to work in June is:
\[ 30 \text{ employees} \times \$600/\text{employee} = \$18,000 \]

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in June is:
\[ \$18,000 \]

Now, we add the total pay from May and June to find the total amount of money paid in the two months:
\[ \$24,000 + \$18,000 = \$42,000 \]

So, the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is:
\[ \boxed{42000} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means for 2 pounds, the first pound costs $3 and the second pound costs $3/2 or $1.50. So, the total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells. She bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50.

Then, let's calculate the cost of the magnets. She bought 4 magnets at $0.25 each, so the total cost for the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Cost of taffy: $4.50
- Cost of seashells: $1.50
- Cost of magnets: $1.00

Total cost = $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00

Sally's parents gave her $10 to spend. So, the money she has left is:
$10 - $7.00 = $3.00

The final numerical answer is $3.00."
"First, let's find out how much Tim spent on the two packs of fireworks. The first pack costs $400. The second pack costs twice as much as the first pack, so it costs $400 * 2 = $800.

The total cost for the two packs of fireworks is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Tim gets a 20% discount on the fireworks. To find out how much the discount is, we calculate 20% of $1200, which is $1200 * 0.20 = $240.

So, the cost of the fireworks after the discount is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Tim also bought a finale firework that costs $150.

To find the total amount Tim spent, we add the cost of the fireworks after the discount to the cost of the finale firework: $960 + $150 = $1110.

So, the total amount Tim spent is $1110."
"Shannon eats 2 cookies a night, so in 30 days, she will eat:
2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, to find out how many dozens she needs to make 60 cookies, we divide:
60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozens

So, Shannon will need to make 5 dozens of cookies to last her for 30 days."
"First, let's find out how many candles are dangerous. Since 5% of the candles are dangerous, we can calculate this by multiplying 50000 by 5%.

\[ 50000 \times 0.05 = 2500 \]

So, there are 2500 dangerous candles. Now, we need to find out how many of these dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog. Since 5% of the dangerous candles have this defect, we can calculate this by multiplying 2500 by 5%.

\[ 2500 \times 0.05 = 125 \]

So, 125 of the dangerous candles will both smell like wet dog and explode. The final numerical answer is:

125"
"First, let's find out the discount price for each blouse. If the regular price is $20 and there's a 30% off sale, then the discount amount for each blouse is:

\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Regular Price} \times \text{Discount Percentage} \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \$20 \times 0.30 \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \$6 \]

So, the price of each blouse after the discount is:

\[ \text{Discounted Price} = \text{Regular Price} - \text{Discount Amount} \]
\[ \text{Discounted Price} = \$20 - \$6 \]
\[ \text{Discounted Price} = \$14 \]

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so the total cost for the discounted blouses is:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = \text{Discounted Price} \times \text{Number of Blouses} \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \$14 \times 4 \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \$56 \]

So, the final numerical answer is \$56."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Joanne's Apples:**
   - From the tallest trees: 30 apples.
   - From the shortest trees: half of 30, which is 15 apples.
   - From the average trees: let's call this number \(x\).

2. **Sister's Apples:**
   - From the tallest trees: twice as many as Joanne, which is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) apples.
   - From the shortest trees: three times as many as Joanne, which is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) apples.
   - From the average trees: 0 apples.

3. **Total Apples:**
   - Combined total apples gathered by Joanne and her sister is 500.

Now, let's calculate the total number of apples Joanne gathered:
- From the tallest trees: 30 apples.
- From the shortest trees: 15 apples.
- From the average trees: \(x\) apples.

So, the total number of apples Joanne gathered is:
\[ 30 + 15 + x \]

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne and her sister is:
\[ (30 + 15 + x) + (60 + 45 + 0) = 500 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 = 500 \]
\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

Solve for \(x\):
\[ x = 500 - 150 \]
\[ x = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{350} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's use a system of equations. Let's say the number of camels is \( c \) and the number of dromedaries is \( d \).

We know that each animal has one head, so the total number of heads gives us the first equation:
\[ c + d = 180 \]

We also know that camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump, and the total number of humps is 304. This gives us the second equation:
\[ 2c + d = 304 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \)

To find the values of \( c \) and \( d \), we can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( d \):
\[ (2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180 \]
\[ 2c + d - c - d = 124 \]
\[ c = 124 \]

Now that we know \( c = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( d \):
\[ 124 + d = 180 \]
\[ d = 180 - 124 \]
\[ d = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 56 \]"
"First, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days. He traveled 200 kilometers every day, so:

\[ 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \]

Next, we need to find out how far he traveled in the next two days. He traveled only 30% of the distance he traveled in the first four days. So, we calculate 30% of 800 km:

\[ 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \]

So, in the next two days, he traveled 240 kilometers. Now, let's add up the distances for the first six days:

\[ 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} = 1040 \text{ km} \]

During the seventh day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance for the seventh day is 0 km. For the eighth day, he traveled 300 kilometers. Now, let's add up the distances for the last two days:

\[ 0 \text{ km} + 300 \text{ km} = 300 \text{ km} \]

Now, we can find the total distance traveled during the two-week trip by adding the distances from the first six days and the last two days:

\[ 1040 \text{ km} + 300 \text{ km} = 1340 \text{ km} \]

So, the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is:

\[ 1340 \text{ km} \]"
"First, let's find out how big Zack's locker is. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Zack's locker} = 4 \times \text{Peter's locker} \]

\[ \text{Zack's locker} = 4 \times 5 \]

\[ \text{Zack's locker} = 20 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Now, we know Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. So, we can find out how big Timothy's locker is by doubling Zack's locker size:

\[ \text{Timothy's locker} = 2 \times \text{Zack's locker} \]

\[ \text{Timothy's locker} = 2 \times 20 \]

\[ \text{Timothy's locker} = 40 \text{ cubic inches} \]

So, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches."
"Stanley's comb fell from an elevation of 10,000 feet to 6,000 feet (10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet). Oliver is at 3,000 feet. So, Oliver needs to climb 3,000 - 6,000 = -3,000 feet. However, since we are talking about distance, we consider the absolute value, which means Oliver needs to climb 3,000 feet to reach Stanley's comb.

The final numerical answer is 3000 feet."
"First, let's find out how much money Mr. Josue got from the second bank. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is $4000. So, the second bank gave him:

\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Now, let's add the money he got from both banks to the initial capital he had:

\[ 4000 + 8000 + 5000 = 17000 \]

So, the total capital Mr. Josue has now is:

\[ 17000 \]"
"First, let's find out how many cats were taken away by the boats. Four boats came and each carried away 5 cats. So, the total number of cats taken away is:

4 boats * 5 cats/boat = 20 cats

Now, we subtract the number of cats taken away from the original number of cats:

50 cats - 20 cats = 30 cats

Next, we need to find out how many cats ran after the mouse. The problem states that 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after the mouse. So, we calculate 3/5 of the 30 cats that were left:

3/5 * 30 cats = 18 cats

Finally, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats:

30 cats - 18 cats = 12 cats

So, the number of cats left on the rock is 12."
"To solve this, let's break it down month by month.

For the first 6 months, the cost is $8 a month. So for 6 months, it would be:
\[ 6 \times 8 = 48 \]

For the next 2 months (months 7 and 8), the cost is $12 a month. So for 2 months, it would be:
\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \]

After 8 months, the cost goes up to $14 a month. For the next 16 months (months 9 to 24), the cost is $14 a month. So for 16 months, it would be:
\[ 16 \times 14 = 224 \]

Now, let's add up all these costs to find the total cost for 2 years:
\[ 48 + 24 + 224 = 296 \]

So, the total cost for 2 years of the service is $296."
"First, let's find out how much the jogger jeans cost. The tattered jeans cost $28, and the jogger jeans cost $6 less than that. So, the jogger jeans cost:
\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's determine the total cost of both jeans:
\[ 28 + 22 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Cole saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can find out how much he saved from each type of jeans. The total savings is $6, so 1/3 of $6 is:
\[ \frac{6}{3} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]
This means he saved $2 from the jogger jeans and the rest, which is:
\[ 6 - 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]
from the tattered jeans.

Now, let's find out the original cost of the jogger jeans. We know the jogger jeans cost $22, and the savings from the jogger jeans is $2. This means the original cost of the jogger jeans was:
\[ 22 + 2 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

The original cost of the tattered jeans is $28. So, the difference in the original cost between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is:
\[ 28 - 24 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $4 more than the tattered jeans. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total capacity of the buses:
4 buses * 60 employees per bus = 240 employees

Next, let's calculate the total capacity of the minibusses:
6 minibusses * 30 employees per minibus = 180 employees

Then, let's calculate the total capacity of the minivans:
10 minivans * 15 employees per minivan = 150 employees

Now, let's add up all the capacities:
240 employees (from buses) + 180 employees (from minibusses) + 150 employees (from minivans) = 570 employees

So, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"Lillian builds 3 bird feeders herself and buys 3 more, so she has a total of 3 + 3 = 6 bird feeders.

Each store-bought bird feeder attracts 20 birds a day.
Each bird feeder Lillian made attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds a day.

So, the store-bought feeders attract a total of 3 * 20 = 60 birds a day.
And the feeders Lillian made attract a total of 3 * 30 = 90 birds a day.

Therefore, Lillian can expect to see 60 + 90 = 150 birds in her garden each day.

The final numerical answer is 150."
"First, let's find out the cost of the soup. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. The bagel costs $4.

To find 25% of $4, we calculate:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 4 = \frac{25}{100} \times 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]

So, the soup costs $4 + $1 = $5.

Next, we know the cake costs half of the price of the bagel. The bagel costs $4, so the cake costs:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \]

Now, we add up the cost of the soup, the bagel, and the cake to find the total cost of the dinner:
\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \]

So, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for the dinner she ordered."
"First, let's figure out how much money Kenny made from selling his Pokemon cards. He got $50 in spending cash and the ticket to the amusement park costs $100, so he must have made $100 - $50 = $50 from selling the cards.

Now, we know that he sells each card for $1.5. To find out how many cards he sold, we divide the total money he made by the price per card:

\[ \text{Number of cards sold} = \frac{\text{Total money made}}{\text{Price per card}} = \frac{50}{1.5} \]

Let's calculate this.
\[ \frac{50}{1.5} = \frac{50 \times 2}{1.5 \times 2} = \frac{100}{3} \approx 33.33 \]

Since Kenny can't sell a fraction of a card, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 33 cards.

Now, we know that he kept 1/3 of his cards. This means that the 33 cards he sold represent 2/3 of his original collection. To find out the total number of cards he started with, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Total cards} = 33 \]

To find the total number of cards, we solve for the total cards:

\[ \text{Total cards} = 33 \times \frac{3}{2} = 33 \times 1.5 = 49.5 \]

Since the number of cards must be a whole number, and we know he kept 1/3 of them, we can conclude that he started with 49 cards (since 49 is the closest whole number that, when 1/3 is taken, gives 33 cards).

So, Kenny started with 49 cards."
"First, let's calculate how many hotdogs the caterer prepared. He was told to prepare enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs each. There were 36 guests, so half of the guests would be:

\[ \frac{36}{2} = 18 \]

Each of these 18 guests would have 2 hotdogs, so the total number of hotdogs prepared would be:

\[ 18 \times 2 = 36 \]

But then, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. Since only 36 hotdogs were prepared, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:

\[ 40 - 36 = 4 \]

So, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 4."
"First, let's find out how many letters are in her sister's name. We know that Indras' name has 6 letters. Half of the letters in Indras' name is:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than this number, so:

\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Now, to find out the total number of letters in both names, we add the number of letters in Indras' name to the number of letters in her sister's name:

\[ 6 + 7 = 13 \]

So, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- The pot and pans set cost $120.00.
- The mixing bowls cost $20.00.
- The 5 utensils cost $5.00 each, so 5 utensils cost $5.00 * 5 = $25.00.

Now, let's add these costs together to find the total cost before the discount:
$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

The items are 20% off, so we need to calculate 20% of $165.00 and subtract it from $165.00 to find the final cost.

20% of $165.00 is calculated as:
$165.00 * 20% = $165.00 * 0.20 = $33.00

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost:
$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

So, the final numerical answer is $132.00."
"First, let's add up the total cost of the items Dora wants to buy:
- Skipping rope: $6
- Board game: $11
- Playground ball: $2

Total cost = $6 + $11 + $2 = $19

Now, let's add up the money Dora has:
- From her allowance: $2
- From her mother: $16

Total money Dora has = $2 + $16 = $18

To find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the total money she has from the total cost of the items:
Money needed = Total cost - Total money Dora has
Money needed = $19 - $18 = $1

So, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball."
"First, let's find out how many dragons Prince Arthur slew. Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons. Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Arthur} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \]

Next, we find out how many dragons Prince Walter slew. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Walter} = 2 \times 75 = 150 \]

Now, we find out how many dragons Prince Bruce slew. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Bruce} = \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 30 \]"
"First, we need to find out how much gas is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were divided equally into 5 containers, we divide 15 gallons by 5:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Josey needed 1/4 of a container. Since each container has 3 gallons, 1/4 of a container would be:

\[ \frac{3 \text{ gallons}}{4} = 0.75 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so:

\[ 0.75 \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints/gallon} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

So, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline."
"First, let's find out how much money George spent on chips. He got 3 bags of chips, and each bag costs 40 cents. So, the total cost for the chips is:
\[ 3 \times 40 = 120 \text{ cents} \]

Since George spent $5, which is 500 cents, and he had 1% of his money left after buying the chips, we can calculate how much money he had left:
\[ 500 \times 0.01 = 5 \text{ cents} \]

This means the total amount of money George spent is:
\[ 500 - 5 = 495 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we know that the cost of the chips is 120 cents, so the money spent on candy bars is:
\[ 495 - 120 = 375 \text{ cents} \]

Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so the number of candy bars George bought is:
\[ \frac{375}{75} = 5 \]

So, George bought 5 candy bars. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"Ray started with 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. So, the number of lollipops he shared with his friends is:

25 - 5 = 20 lollipops

He shared these equally with his four friends, so each friend received:

20 ÷ 4 = 5 lollipops

So, each of his friends received 5 lollipops."
"Rory cuts the cake into 8 pieces, so each piece weighs 20 ounces divided by 8, which is 2.5 ounces per piece.

Rory and her mom each have a piece, so together they have 2 pieces. The weight of the pieces they have is 2 pieces times 2.5 ounces per piece, which is 5 ounces.

The remaining cake would weigh the original weight minus the weight of the pieces Rory and her mom have, which is 20 ounces minus 5 ounces, equaling 15 ounces.

So, the remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"First, let's find out how many oranges they have in total. Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. So, we add these together:

34 + 22 = 56 oranges

Now, they want to share these 56 oranges equally among themselves and their 6 friends. That means the oranges will be shared among 8 people (Sitti, Juris, and their 6 friends).

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people:

56 ÷ 8 = 7

So, everyone will get 7 oranges."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of onions Antoine needs. The recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, and he likes to double that amount. So, he needs:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds of onions} \]

Next, we need to find out the cost of the onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound, so for 4 pounds:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00 \text{ per pound} = \$8.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box is $2.00:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00 \text{ per box} = \$4.00 \]

So, the total cost for the onions and beef stock is:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

Antoine's soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

\[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00 \text{ per serving} \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is:

\[ \$2.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$2.00 \]"
"First, let's find out how long it takes to drive to the theater from Bernadette's apartment. We know that it takes Wayne four minutes to drive to the theater, and the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel.

So, the time it takes to drive to the theater from Bernadette's apartment is:
\[ 4 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since it takes 16 minutes to drive to the theater from her apartment, she should leave:
\[ 16 \text{ minutes} - 5 \text{ minutes} = 11 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 11 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 11 \]"
"First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of Billie's room in feet is:
\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet. We can find the width by dividing the area by the length:
\[ \text{Width} = \frac{\text{Area}}{\text{Length}} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

To find the perimeter, we use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 98 \]"
"First, let's calculate how many beads Elizabeth bought. She bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, we can calculate the total number of beads Elizabeth bought as follows:

\[ \text{Total beads Elizabeth bought} = 1 \times 20 + 2 \times 20 = 20 + 40 = 60 \]

Next, let's calculate how many beads Margareth bought. She bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Again, since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, we can calculate the total number of beads Margareth bought as follows:

\[ \text{Total beads Margareth bought} = 3 \times 20 + 4 \times 20 = 60 + 80 = 140 \]

Now, to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth, we subtract the total number of beads Elizabeth bought from the total number of beads Margareth bought:

\[ \text{Difference} = 140 - 60 = 80 \]

So, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 80 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much the temperature rises when Marcus is baking. He spends 3 hours in the oven, and the temperature rises by 5 degrees every hour. So, the total increase in temperature due to baking is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees} \]

The initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees. After baking for 3 hours, the temperature becomes:
\[ 40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} = 55 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes. The temperature drops by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since the window is open for 30 minutes, which is 3 times 10 minutes, the temperature drops by:
\[ 3 \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 6 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the final temperature of the house after opening the window is:
\[ 55 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees} \]

The final temperature of the house is:
\[ \boxed{49} \]"
"First, let's convert all the times Jon took to do the triathlon into minutes for easier calculation:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 60 + 20 = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Now, let's calculate the total time Jon took:
\[ 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes} \]

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. So, we calculate 10% of Jon's swim time:
\[ 10\% \text{ of 40 minutes} = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ minutes} \]
So, James's swim time is:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon:
\[ 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Let's denote the run time for James as \( R \) minutes. The total time James took is:
\[ 36 + 85 + R = 121 + R \text{ minutes} \]

We know that Jon won the race by 10 minutes, so James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's:
\[ 170 + 10 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we can set up the equation for James's total time:
\[ 121 + R = 180 \]

Solving for \( R \):
\[ R = 180 - 121 = 59 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the time it took James to do the run is:
\[ \boxed{59} \]"
"First, let's convert the length of Movie C into minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the length of Movie C in minutes as follows:

\[ 1.25 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So, we can find the length of Movie B by adding 5 minutes to the length of Movie C:

\[ 75 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we know that Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B. So, we can find the length of Movie A by dividing the length of Movie B by 4:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ minutes}}{4} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"First, we need to find out how many miles the horse runs. The horse runs at 32 miles per hour for 30 minutes. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, we calculate the distance as follows:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 32 \text{ miles/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how many bails of hay the horse eats. Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, we calculate the total bails of hay as follows:

\[ \text{Total bails of hay} = 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail/mile} = 8 \text{ bails} \]

Now, we need to find out the total cost of the hay. Since each bail of hay costs $3, the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars/bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, so the total amount of money he has is:

\[ \text{Total money} = 6 \times 5 \text{ dollars} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we subtract the total cost of the hay from the total amount of money he has:

\[ \text{Change} = 30 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"First, let's find out how many eggs Rozanne has in total. She has 4 dozen eggs. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs would be:

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ eggs} \]

She also has 2 loose eggs. So, the total number of eggs she has is:

\[ 48 + 2 = 50 \text{ eggs} \]

Each glass of eggnog needs 5 eggs. To find out how many glasses of eggnog she can make, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs needed per glass:

\[ \frac{50}{5} = 10 \text{ glasses} \]

Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog. To find out how many trays she can put out, we divide the total number of glasses by the number of glasses each tray can hold:

\[ \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ trays} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's calculate Joey's new score after he scores 26 points. 

Joey's initial points: 214

Joey's new score = 214 + 26 = 240 points

Next, let's calculate Marcy's new score after she scores 10 points.

Marcy's initial points: 225
Points Marcy scores: 10

Marcy's new score = 225 + 10 = 235 points

Now, we need to find out by how many points Joey is winning.

Joey's new score: 240
Marcy's new score: 235

The difference in their scores is:

240 - 235 = 5 points

So, Joey is now winning by 5 points."
"First, let's find out the cost price of each sneaker. The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576, so the cost price per sneaker is:

\[ \text{Cost price per sneaker} = \frac{\$576}{48} = \$12 \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 17 sneakers at $20 each:

\[ \text{Revenue from 17 sneakers} = 17 \times \$20 = \$340 \]

Now, let's find out how many sneakers were sold to the department store. Since he sold 17 sneakers at $20 each, the rest of the sneakers sold to the department store are:

\[ \text{Remaining sneakers} = 48 - 17 = 31 \]

The revenue from selling these 31 sneakers at $25 each is:

\[ \text{Revenue from 31 sneakers} = 31 \times \$25 = \$775 \]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the sneakers:

\[ \text{Total revenue} = \$340 + \$775 = \$1115 \]

The total cost for the 48 sneakers is $576. So, the profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ \text{Profit} = \$1115 - \$576 = \$539 \]

So, the salesman's profit is:

\[ \boxed{539} \]"
"To solve this, let's break it down into parts:

First, we calculate the total number of crayons in the six packets that each have eight pieces:
\[ 6 \text{ packets} \times 8 \text{ pieces/packet} = 48 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of crayons in the four packets that each have sixteen pieces:
\[ 4 \text{ packets} \times 16 \text{ pieces/packet} = 64 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we add the two totals together to find the total number of crayons Beatrice bought:
\[ 48 \text{ pieces} + 64 \text{ pieces} = 112 \text{ pieces} \]

So, the total number of crayon pieces Beatrice bought is 112."
"Let's break down the costs:

- Super ticket cost: $20
- Extra cost for popcorn and soda with super ticket: $1
- Total cost with super ticket: $20 + $1 = $21

Now, let's look at the second option:
- Movie ticket cost: $12
- Cost of popcorn and soda: $3 (soda) + regular price of popcorn (let's call this P)
- Total cost with regular ticket and snacks: $12 + $3 + P

We know that you saved $2 by choosing the second option. So, the cost of the second option is $2 less than the cost of the super ticket:
- $12 + $3 + P = $21 - $2

Now, let's solve for P:
- $15 + P = $19
- P = $19 - $15
- P = $4

So, the regular price of popcorn is $4."
"First, let's find out how much it cost to fill one balloon on the first day. If 20 balloons cost $900, then one balloon cost:

\[ \text{Cost per balloon on the first day} = \frac{\$900}{20} = \$45 \]

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20. So, the new cost per balloon is:

\[ \text{New cost per balloon} = \$45 + \$20 = \$65 \]

Now, we need to find out how much it would cost to fill 170 balloons at the new price:

\[ \text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = 170 \times \$65 \]

Let's calculate this:
\[ 170 \times 65 = 170 \times (60 + 5) = (170 \times 60) + (170 \times 5) \]
\[ 170 \times 60 = 10200 \]
\[ 170 \times 5 = 850 \]
\[ 10200 + 850 = 11050 \]

So, the total cost for Bentley to fill 170 balloons after the price increase is:

\[ \$11050 \]"
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance for each part of the trip:
- For the first part, the car drives at 60 mph for 2 hours. The distance is \(60 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles}\).
- For the second part, the car drives at 30 mph for 1 hour. The distance is \(30 \text{ mph} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 30 \text{ miles}\).

Now, let's add up the total distance and the total time:
- Total distance = \(120 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 150 \text{ miles}\).
- Total time = \(2 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} = 3 \text{ hours}\).

The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time:
\[ \text{Average speed} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ mph} \]

So, the car's average speed during the trip is 50 mph."
"First, let's calculate the value of the sapphires Jenna has left after the trade. She started with 8 sapphires and traded 3, so she has 5 sapphires left. Since each sapphire is worth $800, the value of her remaining sapphires is:
\[ 5 \times 800 = 4000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the value of the rubies she received. She traded 3 sapphires for 2 rubies, and each ruby is worth $1200. So, the value of the 2 rubies is:
\[ 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the value of the remaining sapphires and the value of the rubies to find the total value of all her jewels:
\[ 4000 + 2400 = 6400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total value of all her jewels is:
\[ 6400 \]"
"To find out how many apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. First, find out how many apples both of them eat in one day. Since Marin eats 4 apples and Nancy also eats 4 apples, together they eat:
   \[
   4 + 4 = 8 \text{ apples per day}
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how many apples they eat in 30 days. Since they eat 8 apples per day, in 30 days they will eat:
   \[
   8 \times 30 = 240 \text{ apples}
   \]

So, the final numerical answer is 240 apples."
"First, we need to find out the total volume of the raised beds. Each raised bed is 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. So, the volume of one raised bed is:

\[ \text{Volume of one bed} = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{height} = 2 \times 8 \times 2 = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of all the beds combined is:

\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. So, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total volume}}{\text{Volume per bag}} = \frac{320}{2} = 160 \text{ bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost for 160 bags is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \times 12 = 1920 \]

So, the potting soil will cost Bob $1920."
"First, let's find out how many green cards there are. If there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of green cards = Number of red cards + 60% of the number of red cards
Number of green cards = 15 + 0.60 * 15
Number of green cards = 15 + 9
Number of green cards = 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards:

Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
Number of yellow cards = 15 + 24
Number of yellow cards = 39

To find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards together:

Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39
Total number of cards = 78

So, the final numerical answer is 78."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Katelyn initially saw 50 fairies.
2. After 20 minutes, one of her friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw. So, the friend saw \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) fairies.
3. These 25 fairies joined the 50 fairies that Katelyn initially saw. So, the total number of fairies became \( 50 + 25 = 75 \).
4. Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. So, the number of fairies remaining is \( 75 - 30 = 45 \).

Therefore, the final number of fairies remaining is 45."
"First, let's find out the total number of puppies. Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. So, the total number of puppies is:

8 + 12 = 20

Next, let's find out the total number of puppies with spots. Jennifer's dog has 3 spotted puppies and Brandon's dog has 4 spotted puppies. So, the total number of spotted puppies is:

3 + 4 = 7

To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of Spotted Puppies}}{\text{Total Number of Puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 \]

Now, let's calculate this:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.35 \times 100 = 35\% \]

So, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is 35%."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed the farmer buys:

- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes at 1 pound each = 2 pounds
- Carrots: 4 bags at 12 pounds each = 4 * 12 = 48 pounds
- Hay: 42 bales at 75 pounds each = 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks at 65 pounds each = 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds

Now, let's add up the total weight of all the feed:

Total weight = Weight of sugar cubes + Weight of carrots + Weight of hay + Weight of oats
Total weight = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 pounds

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips the farmer needs to make, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:

Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
Number of trips = 4500 / 2250 = 2

So, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"First, let's find out how much Grayson earns from recycling cans and bottles in one week.

She drinks 3 aluminum cans a week, and each can is worth 2 cents. So, the money earned from aluminum cans in one week is:
\[ 3 \text{ cans} \times 2 \text{ cents per can} = 6 \text{ cents} \]

She drinks 5 plastic bottles a week, and each bottle is worth 3 cents. So, the money earned from plastic bottles in one week is:
\[ 5 \text{ bottles} \times 3 \text{ cents per bottle} = 15 \text{ cents} \]

Now, let's add the money earned from both cans and bottles in one week:
\[ 6 \text{ cents} + 15 \text{ cents} = 21 \text{ cents} \]

Since Grayson does this recycling for four weeks, we need to multiply the weekly earnings by 4:
\[ 21 \text{ cents per week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ cents} \]

So, the total amount Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month is:
\[ 84 \text{ cents} \]"
"First, let's find out how many plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we can calculate the number of plants Toni has as follows:

Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + 60% of Frederick's plants
Toni's plants = 10 + 0.60 * 10
Toni's plants = 10 + 6
Toni's plants = 16

Now, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So, we can calculate the number of plants Shondra has:

Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

So, Shondra has 9 plants."

So, the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man is $18."
"Let's break down the race step by step:

1. Finley started in first place.
2. She fell back 5 spots. So, she moved to 1st - 5 = -4th place. But since she can't be in negative place, this means she moved to 6th place (because 1st - 5 = 6).
3. She then moved ahead 2 spots. So, she moved to 6 + 2 = 8th place.
4. She fell behind 3 spots. So, she moved to 8 - 3 = 5th place.
5. Lastly, she jumped ahead 1 spot. So, she moved to 5 + 1 = 6th place.

Finley finished the race in 6th place."

"First, let's break down the laundry items for one room:

- Sheets: 2
- Comforter: 1
- Pillow cases: Twice as many as sheets, so 2 * 2 = 4 pillow cases
- Towels: Twice as many as pillow cases, so 4 * 2 = 8 towels

Now, let's add up all the laundry items for one room:
2 sheets + 1 comforter + 4 pillow cases + 8 towels = 15 pieces of laundry per room.

Since there are 80 rooms, we multiply the number of pieces of laundry per room by the number of rooms:
15 pieces/room * 80 rooms = 1200 pieces of laundry.

So, the final numerical answer is 1200."
"First, let's calculate how many pairs of shoes Fireman Frank has after Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

He starts with 200 shoes. On Monday, he gets 5 pairs. Since each pair has 2 shoes, he gets 5 * 2 = 10 shoes. So, after Monday, he has 200 + 10 = 210 shoes.

On Wednesday, he gets 15 pairs. So, he gets 15 * 2 = 30 shoes. Adding these to the 210 shoes he had after Monday, he now has 210 + 30 = 240 shoes.

On Friday, he gets 30 pairs. So, he gets 30 * 2 = 60 shoes. Adding these to the 240 shoes he had after Wednesday, he now has 240 + 60 = 300 shoes.

On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes. So, subtracting 180 from the 300 shoes he had after Friday, he now has 300 - 180 = 120 shoes.

Therefore, the final number of shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday is 120."
"First, we need to find out how many cupcakes Mary can make with all her sprinkles. Since each jar of sprinkles can decorate 8 cupcakes and she has 6 jars, we multiply the number of jars by the number of cupcakes each jar can decorate:

\[ 6 \text{ jars} \times 8 \text{ cupcakes/jar} = 48 \text{ cupcakes} \]

Now, we need to find out how many pans of cupcakes Mary should bake. Since each pan holds 12 cupcakes, we divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes each pan can hold:

\[ 48 \text{ cupcakes} \div 12 \text{ cupcakes/pan} = 4 \text{ pans} \]

So, Mary should bake 4 pans worth of cupcakes."
"First, let's find out how much the piece of paper cost. The pen cost $2, and the paper costs $1 less than three times the pen's price. So, we calculate:

Three times the price of the pen is \(3 \times 2 = 6\).

The paper costs $1 less than this amount, so it costs \(6 - 1 = 5\).

Now, we add the cost of the pen and the paper to find the total cost:

Pen cost: $2
Paper cost: $5
Total cost: $2 + $5 = $7

Theo gave the cashier $10. To find out the change she received, we subtract the total cost from $10:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total.
2. According to the rule, the number of cookies Matt can have is half the number of carrot sticks he eats plus 2 extra.

Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( x \).

The equation based on the rule is:
\[ \text{Cookies} = \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know Matt wants 5 cookies, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 5 = \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

Now, we need to solve for \( x \):
\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{x}{2} \]
\[ 3 = \frac{x}{2} \]
\[ x = 3 \times 2 \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks.

"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit. We'll use inches for this calculation.

1 foot = 12 inches

So, the shark is 10 feet long, which is:
10 feet * 12 inches/foot = 120 inches

Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras, so the total length of the remoras is:
2 remoras * 6 inches/remora = 12 inches

Now, we need to find what percentage 12 inches (the total length of the remoras) is of the shark's total length (120 inches).

The formula to find the percentage is:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Whole}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12}{120} \right) \times 100 \]

Let's calculate this:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{10} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home. This means that one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer at home.
2. We are told that 20 students do not have desktop computers. Since this represents one-fourth of the total number of students, we can set up the following equation to find the total number of students:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Total number of students} = 20
   \]
3. To find the total number of students, we need to multiply both sides of the equation by 4:
   \[
   \text{Total number of students} = 20 \times 4 = 80
   \]

So, the total number of students at that grade level is 80."
"First, we need to find out how many minutes Jason needs to walk in total to break in the shoes. We know it takes 240 minutes and he has three weeks to do it. Since there are 7 days in a week, three weeks would be:

\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days} \]

Jason wants to walk 4 days a week, so in 3 weeks, he will walk:

\[ 4 \text{ days/week} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 12 \text{ days} \]

Now, to find out how many minutes he needs to walk each day, we divide the total minutes by the number of days he will walk:

\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{12 \text{ days}} = 20 \text{ minutes/day} \]

So, Jason has to spend 20 minutes walking each day."
"First, we need to find out how many books Sarah bought. Since each book costs $15 and she spent $300, we can find the total number of books by dividing the total amount spent by the cost of each book.

\[ \text{Total number of books} = \frac{\text{Total amount spent}}{\text{Cost per book}} = \frac{300}{15} = 20 \]

Now, Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids. To find out how many books each child got, we divide the total number of books by the number of kids.

\[ \text{Books per child} = \frac{\text{Total number of books}}{\text{Number of kids}} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

So, each child got 5 books."
"First, let's find out how many kids are allergic to something. We know that 9 kids are allergic to dairy, 6 are allergic to peanuts, and 3 are allergic to both. To find the total number of kids allergic to something, we need to add the number of kids allergic to dairy and the number of kids allergic to peanuts, and then subtract the number of kids allergic to both (because they were counted twice).

So, the number of kids allergic to something is:
\[ 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

This means 12 kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both. Now, to find out how many kids are not allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids allergic to something from the total number of kids in the class.

The total number of kids in the class is 32. So, the number of kids not allergic to anything is:
\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 20."
"First, we need to find out how many employees there are in total. Since there are 3 groups and each group has 200 employees, we can find the total number of employees by multiplying 3 by 200.

\[ 3 \times 200 = 600 \]

So, there are 600 employees going on the tour.

Now, we need to find out how many tour guides there are in total. Since each of the 3 groups has 7 tour guides, we can find the total number of tour guides by multiplying 3 by 7.

\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

So, there are 21 tour guides going on the tour.

To find the total number of people going on the tour, we add the number of employees to the number of tour guides.

\[ 600 + 21 = 621 \]

Therefore, the total number of people going on this tour is 621."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the plane tickets. Since Tom and his wife each need a plane ticket, the total cost for the plane tickets is:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Next, we need to find out the cost of the hotel. The hotel is 20% more expensive than its normal price. The normal price of the hotel per day is $1500. So, the increased price per day is:
\[ 1500 + (1500 \times 0.20) = 1500 + 300 = 1800 \]

Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 1800 \times 3 = 5400 \]

Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel to find the total cost of the trip:
\[ 10000 + 5400 = 15400 \]

So, the total cost of the trip is:
\[ 15400 \]"
"First, let's find out how many tubes of blue paint Jasper has. Since Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint and Jasper has half as many, we calculate:

\[ \text{Jasper's blue paint} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ tubes} \]

Next, let's find out how many tubes of yellow paint Jasper has. Since Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint and Jasper has three times as many, we calculate:

\[ \text{Jasper's yellow paint} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ tubes} \]

Now, to find the total number of tubes of paint Jasper has, we add the blue and yellow paint together:

\[ \text{Total tubes of paint Jasper has} = 2 + 9 = 11 \text{ tubes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 11 \]"
"First, we need to find the weight of the 2010 penny. We know that the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. The 1959 penny weighs 48 grains.

To find the weight of the 2010 penny, we calculate:
\[ \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Weight of 1959 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48 \]

Now, let's do the multiplication:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 48 = 3 \times 12 = 36 \]

So, the 2010 penny weighs 36 grains.

Next, we need to find the combined weight of both pennies:
\[ \text{Combined weight} = \text{Weight of 1959 penny} + \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = 48 + 36 \]

Now, let's do the addition:
\[ 48 + 36 = 84 \]

Therefore, the combined weight of the two pennies is 84 grains."
"First, let's find out how much money Keegan and Tashay have earned together by 3 pm.

Keegan earned $83.
Tashay earned $91.

So, together they earned $83 + $91 = $174.

Their goal was to raise $200.

To find out how much more they need to earn, we subtract the amount they have already earned from their goal:

$200 - $174 = $26

So, they need to earn $26 more to reach their goal.

The final numerical answer is 26."
"First, let's find out how many songs Luri has on his player. We know that Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel. Gabriel has 20 songs, so:

\[ \text{Luri's songs} = 3 \times \text{Gabriel's songs} = 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

Now, let's find out how many more songs each can add to their player. Both players can store up to 100 songs.

For Gabriel:
\[ \text{Songs Gabriel can add} = 100 - \text{Gabriel's songs} = 100 - 20 = 80 \]

For Luri:
\[ \text{Songs Luri can add} = 100 - \text{Luri's songs} = 100 - 60 = 40 \]

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add than Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add:
\[ \text{Fewer songs Luri can add} = \text{Gabriel's songs to add} - \text{Luri's songs to add} = 80 - 40 = 40 \]

So, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to his player than Gabriel can add to his."
"First, we need to find out how many oranges Stetson ate. He ate 2/5 of the oranges they picked. They picked 60 oranges in total.

To find out how many oranges Stetson ate, we calculate:
\[ \text{Number of oranges Stetson ate} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60 \]

Let's do the multiplication:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{2 \times 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24 \]

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges. Now, Stetson gives up $10 for each orange he eats. To find out the total amount of money he gave up, we multiply the number of oranges he ate by $10:
\[ \text{Total amount of money given up} = 24 \times 10 \]

Let's do the multiplication:
\[ 24 \times 10 = 240 \]

So, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is $240."
"First, we need to find out what 3 times the cost of Jillian's shoes is. Since her shoes cost $80, we multiply $80 by 3:

\[ 80 \times 3 = 240 \]

Next, we need to find out how much Jillian's handbag cost, which is $20 less than the result we just found. So we subtract $20 from $240:

\[ 240 - 20 = 220 \]

Therefore, Jillian's handbag cost $220."
"To find out how many hours James runs a week, we first need to calculate the total miles he runs in a week and then divide that by his running speed.

James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week, so the total miles he runs in a week is:
\[ 12 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 60 \text{ miles/week} \]

Now, if he runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour, we can find out how many hours he runs in a week by dividing the total miles by his speed:
\[ 60 \text{ miles/week} \div 10 \text{ miles/hour} = 6 \text{ hours/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \]"
"First, let's find out how much oats one horse needs for one meal:
- Each horse needs 5 pounds of oats per meal.

Since he feeds the horses twice a day, one horse needs:
- 5 pounds/meal * 2 meals/day = 10 pounds/day.

Uncle Ben has four horses, so the total amount of oats needed for all horses per day is:
- 10 pounds/horse/day * 4 horses = 40 pounds/day.

Now, we need to find out how much oats are needed for five days:
- 40 pounds/day * 5 days = 200 pounds.

If one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, then the number of bags needed is:
- 200 pounds / 50 pounds/bag = 4 bags.

So, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days."
"First, we need to find out how many puppies are Pomeranians. Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranian, we can calculate this by multiplying the total number of puppies by two thirds.

Total puppies = 27
Pomeranian puppies = 2/3 * 27

Now let's calculate the number of Pomeranian puppies:
Pomeranian puppies = 2/3 * 27 = 18

Next, we need to find out how many of these Pomeranian puppies are girls. We know that one third of the Pomeranian puppies are girls, so we can calculate this by multiplying the number of Pomeranian puppies by one third.

Number of girl Pomeranians = 1/3 * 18

Now let's calculate the number of girl Pomeranian puppies:
Number of girl Pomeranians = 1/3 * 18 = 6

So, Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians."
"To find the average highest temperature, we need to add up all the highest temperatures and then divide by the number of places.

The highest temperature in Southlandia is -48 degrees Fahrenheit.
The highest temperature in Northlandia is 21 degrees Fahrenheit.
The highest temperature in Midlandia is -3 degrees Fahrenheit.

First, we add these temperatures together:
-48 + 21 + (-3) = -28

Now, we divide this sum by the number of places, which is 3:
-28 ÷ 3 = -9.3333...

The average highest temperature is approximately -9.33 degrees Fahrenheit."
"First, we need to find out how much more money the child needs to buy the toy car. The toy car costs $12 and the child already has $4.

So, the remaining amount needed is:
\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \]

The child promises to save $2 every day. To find out how many days it will take to save $8, we divide the remaining amount by the daily savings:
\[ 8 \div 2 = 4 \]

So, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount of money."
"Each tray can hold 24 eggs. Jaime has 2 trays, so the total number of eggs that can be placed on the trays is:

24 eggs/tray * 2 trays = 48 eggs

Jaime has 64 eggs in total. To find out how many eggs won't be placed on the tray, we subtract the number of eggs that can be placed on the trays from the total number of eggs:

64 eggs - 48 eggs = 16 eggs

So, the number of eggs that won't be placed on the tray is 16."
"First, let's find out how much the family-size pizza costs. The small pizza costs $8, and the family-size pizza costs 3 times as much, so:

Family-size pizza cost = 3 * $8 = $24

Now, to find out how much Sally spends in all, we add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza:

Total cost = Cost of small pizza + Cost of family-size pizza
Total cost = $8 + $24 = $32

So, Sally spends $32 in all."
"First, let's find out how many razors Heather will get if she buys 2 packs and they are on sale for buy one get one free.

If she buys 2 packs, she gets 2 razors for the first pack and 2 more for the second pack, making a total of 4 razors.

Now, let's calculate the cost of 2 packs of razors on sale.

The cost of 1 pack is $4.00, so the cost of 2 packs is $4.00 * 2 = $8.00.

She also has a $2.00 coupon, so the total cost after applying the coupon is $8.00 - $2.00 = $6.00.

Now, we need to find out how much each individual razor costs after the discount.

Since she gets 4 razors for $6.00, each razor costs $6.00 / 4 = $1.50.

To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100 (since $1.00 = 100 cents).

So, each razor costs 1.50 * 100 = 150 cents.

The final numerical answer is 150 cents."
"First, let's find the average height of the cheerleaders. There are 9 cheerleaders who are 64 inches tall and 1 cheerleader who is 60 inches tall. To find the average height, we add up all the heights and divide by the total number of cheerleaders.

Total height of the 9 cheerleaders = 9 * 64 inches = 576 inches
Height of the 10th cheerleader = 60 inches

Total height of all cheerleaders = 576 inches + 60 inches = 636 inches

Now, we find the average height:
Average height = Total height of all cheerleaders / Total number of cheerleaders
Average height = 636 inches / 10 = 63.6 inches

Next, we need to find the total height of the human pyramid. The pyramid has 4 girls on the bottom, 3 on the next level, 2 on the next, and 1 at the top. We use the average height to calculate the total height of the pyramid.

Total height of the pyramid = (4 * 63.6 inches) + (3 * 63.6 inches) + (2 * 63.6 inches) + (1 * 63.6 inches)

Let's calculate this step by step:
Total height of the pyramid = 4 * 63.6 + 3 * 63.6 + 2 * 63.6 + 1 * 63.6
Total height of the pyramid = 254.4 + 190.8 + 127.2 + 63.6
Total height of the pyramid = 636 inches

Now, we convert the total height from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot.

Total height in feet = Total height in inches / 12
Total height in feet = 636 inches / 12 = 53 feet

So, the height of the human pyramid is 53 feet."
"Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour. Since she works for 8 hours a day, we can calculate the total minutes she walks in one day by multiplying 8 hours by 5 minutes per hour.

So, in one day, she walks: 8 hours/day * 5 minutes/hour = 40 minutes/day.

Now, to find out how many minutes she has walked after 5 days, we multiply the daily walking time by 5.

So, after 5 days, she has walked: 40 minutes/day * 5 days = 200 minutes.

The final numerical answer is 200 minutes."
"First, let's find out how old Brett will be in four years. Since Brett is currently 14 years old, in four years he will be:

14 + 4 = 18 years old.

According to the question, in four years Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Since Brett is now 14 years old, three times that age is:

3 * 14 = 42 years old.

So, Angela will be 42 years old in four years. To find out how old Angela is right now, we subtract four years from her age in four years:

42 - 4 = 38 years old.

Therefore, Angela is currently 38 years old."
"To find out how much money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost for each type of ride and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost for the morning rides:
- Paul drives in the morning twice a day.
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- So, the cost for one day's morning rides is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) dollars.
- Over 14 days, the cost for morning rides is \(14 \times 12 = 168\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the afternoon rides:
- Paul drives in the afternoon twice a day.
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- So, the cost for one day's afternoon rides is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) dollars.
- Over 14 days, the cost for afternoon rides is \(14 \times 4 = 56\) dollars.

Now, we add the costs for the morning and afternoon rides to find the total cost:
- Total cost = Cost for morning rides + Cost for afternoon rides
- Total cost = \(168 + 56 = 224\) dollars.

So, Paul spent 224 dollars on driving his car during these two weeks."
"First, let's find out how many oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box, so:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, let's add up all the oranges they brought together:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Each greek orange pie needs three oranges, so to find out how many pies they can make, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed per pie:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ oranges}}{3 \text{ oranges/pie}} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 40."
"To solve this, let's first write down the cost equations for both venues.

For the first venue:
- The cost is a flat fee of $200 plus $5 per person for food.
- So, the total cost \( C_1 \) for \( p \) people is:
\[ C_1 = 200 + 5p \]

For the second venue:
- The cost is $25 per person for food.
- So, the total cost \( C_2 \) for \( p \) people is:
\[ C_2 = 25p \]

We need to find the number of guests \( p \) for which the costs are equal, so we set \( C_1 = C_2 \):
\[ 200 + 5p = 25p \]

Now, let's solve this equation for \( p \):
\[ 200 = 25p - 5p \]
\[ 200 = 20p \]
\[ p = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ p = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10."
"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Let's say David found \( D \) insects.
2. According to the problem, Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects.
3. It's also given that David found half of what Bodhi found, so if Bodhi found \( B \) insects, then \( D = \frac{B}{2} \) or \( B = 2D \).
4. The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   (D + 7) + D + B = 43
   \]
5. Substituting \( B = 2D \) into the equation, we get:
   \[
   (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43
   \]
6. Simplifying the equation:
   \[
   4D + 7 = 43
   \]
7. Subtract 7 from both sides:
   \[
   4D = 36
   \]
8. Divide both sides by 4:
   \[
   D = 9
   \]
9. Now we know David found 9 insects. Since Lily found 7 more than David:
   \[
   \text{Lily's insects} = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16
   \]

So, Lily found 16 insects. The final numerical answer is 16."
"First, let's find out how many yards of yarn Mariah used. Since a full skein is 364 yards and Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, we calculate:

\[ \text{Yards Mariah used} = \frac{1}{4} \times 364 \]

\[ \text{Yards Mariah used} = 91 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's find out how many yards of yarn her grandma used. Since her grandma used 1/2 of a skein, we calculate:

\[ \text{Yards grandma used} = \frac{1}{2} \times 364 \]

\[ \text{Yards grandma used} = 182 \text{ yards} \]

Now, to find out how many yards of yarn they used altogether, we add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma:

\[ \text{Total yards used} = 91 + 182 \]

\[ \text{Total yards used} = 273 \text{ yards} \]

So, the total number of yards of yarn they used altogether is 273 yards."
"First, let's calculate the total number of gifts Cherrie bought for her 5 friends.

For 2 friends, each wants 5 gifts:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ gifts} \]

For the other 3 friends, each wants 2 gifts:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ gifts} \]

Now, let's add the gifts for her friends together:
\[ 10 + 6 = 16 \text{ gifts} \]

Cherrie also decided to buy 10 more random gifts as a surprise. So, we add these to the total:
\[ 16 + 10 = 26 \text{ gifts} \]

Therefore, the total number of gifts Cherrie bought is:
\[ 26 \]"
"First, let's find out the width of the rug. Since the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair and the chair is 3 feet wide, we can calculate the width of the rug as follows:

Width of the rug = Width of the chair + 5 feet
Width of the rug = 3 feet + 5 feet
Width of the rug = 8 feet

Now, we know that the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. So, let's calculate twice the width of the rug:

Twice the width of the rug = 2 * Width of the rug
Twice the width of the rug = 2 * 8 feet
Twice the width of the rug = 16 feet

Now, we can find out the length of the couch:

Length of the couch = Twice the width of the rug + 2 feet
Length of the couch = 16 feet + 2 feet
Length of the couch = 18 feet

So, the length of the couch is 18 feet."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Suzie bought four packs of gum.
- Two packs were strawberry.
- One pack was grape, and it cost $2.
- One pack was green apple, and it cost half as much as the grape pack, so it cost $2 / 2 = $1.
- The total cost was $7.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the strawberry gum:

- The total cost for the grape and green apple gum is $2 + $1 = $3.
- Since the total cost was $7, the cost for the strawberry gum is $7 - $3 = $4.

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $4.

The final numerical answer is:
4"
"First, let's find out how many 2 x 4 pieces Frederick can buy with $24. Each 2 x 4 costs $4.

Number of 2 x 4 pieces = $24 / $4 = 6 pieces

Now, let's find out how many 2 x 8 pieces Frederick can buy with $24. Each 2 x 8 costs $6.

Number of 2 x 8 pieces = $24 / $6 = 4 pieces

To get the most popsicle sticks, Frederick should buy the cheapest lumber, which is the 2 x 4 pieces. Each 2 x 4 gives him 200 sticks.

Total sticks from 2 x 4 pieces = 6 pieces * 200 sticks/piece = 1200 sticks

So, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make is 1200."
"First, we need to find out how many pairs of snowshoes Mario needs to buy. Since each dog has four legs and each pair of snowshoes is for one dog, Mario needs 6 pairs of snowshoes.

Next, we need to calculate the total cost. Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, so we multiply the number of pairs by the cost per pair:

\[ 6 \text{ pairs} \times \$12.00 \text{ per pair} = \$72.00 \]

So, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is $72.00."
"First, let's calculate how much Janet spends on bus trips each week without a pass.

She takes 2 bus trips a day and does this 5 days a week. So, the total number of bus trips she takes in a week is:
\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 10 \text{ trips/week} \]

Each bus trip costs her $2.20, so the total cost for 10 trips in a week is:
\[ 10 \text{ trips/week} \times $2.20/\text{trip} = $22.00 \text{ per week} \]

Now, if she buys a weekly bus pass for $20, the amount she would save by buying the pass instead of paying for each trip individually is:
\[ $22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00 \]

So, Janet would save $2.00 by buying the weekly bus pass."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has 20 sheep.
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does. This means the zoo has 30 cows * 2 = 60 cows.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. This means the farm has 20 sheep / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's add up all the animals:

- The farm has 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.
- The zoo has 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.

So, the total number of animals the farm and zoo have combined is 40 + 80 = 120 animals."
"First, let's find out how many onions and potatoes Rose bought in total. Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. So, the total number of onions and potatoes Rose bought is:

12 onions + 4 potatoes = 16 items

We know that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought. Let's denote the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought as \( S \). According to the information given, we can write the equation:

\[ 4S = 16 \]

To find \( S \), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:

\[ S = \frac{16}{4} = 4 \]

So, Sophia bought 4 onions and 4 potatoes. To find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we add the number of onions and potatoes together:

\[ 4 onions + 4 potatoes = 8 items \]

Therefore, the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is 8."
"First, we need to find out how many days Andy has until his birthday. From December 31st to July 19th is 181 days.

To lose 30 pounds, Andy needs to burn 30 * 3500 calories. So, the total calories he needs to burn is:
\[ 30 \times 3500 = 105000 \text{ calories} \]

To find out how many calories Andy needs to burn each day, we divide the total calories by the number of days:
\[ \frac{105000 \text{ calories}}{181 \text{ days}} \approx 579.45 \text{ calories/day} \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, Andy needs to burn approximately 580 calories each day to reach his goal."
"Gerald earns $30 per day and he worked for 7 days in a week, so his total earnings are:
\[ 30 \times 7 = 210 \]

He spent $100, so the amount he has left is:
\[ 210 - 100 = 110 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
110"
"First, we need to find out the total distance Hannah will run. Since each lap is 0.25 km and she is running 8 laps, we can calculate the total distance by multiplying the number of laps by the distance of each lap:

\[ \text{Total distance} = 8 \text{ laps} \times 0.25 \text{ km/lap} = 2 \text{ km} \]

Now, we know that Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs. So, to find out how much water she needs for 2 kilometers, we multiply the total distance by the amount of water she needs per kilometer:

\[ \text{Total water needed} = 2 \text{ km} \times 60 \text{ ml/km} = 120 \text{ ml} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 120 ml."
"First, let's find out how much money Julie spent on clothes. She spent 20% of $500 on clothes.

\[ 20\% \text{ of } \$500 = \frac{20}{100} \times 500 = 0.20 \times 500 = \$100 \]

So, after buying clothes, Julie had:

\[ \$500 - \$100 = \$400 \]

Next, Julie spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs.

\[ 25\% \text{ of } \$400 = \frac{25}{100} \times 400 = 0.25 \times 400 = \$100 \]

So, after buying CDs, Julie had:

\[ \$400 - \$100 = \$300 \]

Therefore, the final amount of money Julie had left is $300."
"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, the house cost three times as much as the lot, so we can write:

\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Now, we can substitute \( H \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

To find \( L \), we divide both sides by 4:

\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000 \]

Now that we know the lot costs $30,000, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):

\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000 \]

So, the house cost $90,000."
"First, let's find out how many canvas bags Tara bought. She bought 8 packs and each pack contains 5 bags.

So, the total number of bags is:
\[ 8 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ bags/pack} = 40 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we need to find out how much Tara spent on the bags. She bought 8 packs at $4 each.

So, the total cost is:
\[ 8 \text{ packs} \times $4/\text{pack} = $32 \]

Now, let's calculate how much money Tara made from selling the bags. She sold each bag for $8.

So, the total revenue from selling the bags is:
\[ 40 \text{ bags} \times $8/\text{bag} = $320 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ $320 - $32 = $288 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ $288 \]"
"First, let's find out how many minutes the fight lasts. If a fight lasts 5 rounds and each round is 3 minutes, then the total time of the fight is:

\[ 5 \text{ rounds} \times 3 \text{ minutes/round} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, if Joe throws 25 punches per minute, then in 15 minutes he would throw:

\[ 25 \text{ punches/minute} \times 15 \text{ minutes} = 375 \text{ punches} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 375."
"First, let's find out how many cookies Josh made. Since Suzanne made 36 cookies and Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, we can calculate the number of cookies Josh made as follows:

\[ \text{Cookies Josh made} = \frac{36}{4} = 9 \]

Now, Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. Since Josh made 9 cookies, we can calculate the number of cookies Kelsie made as follows:

\[ \text{Cookies Kelsie made} = 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

So, Kelsie made 18 cookies."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has. He has four $10 bills and six $20 bills.

The total amount from the $10 bills is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

The total amount from the $20 bills is:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \]

So, the total amount of money Ali has is:
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \]

Ali gives half of this total money to his sister. So, the amount he gives to his sister is:
\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \]

After giving half to his sister, the remaining amount of money Ali has is:
\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \]

Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner. So, the amount he uses for dinner is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = \frac{3 \times 80}{5} = \frac{240}{5} = 48 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Ali has after buying the dinner is:
\[ 80 - 48 = 32 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 32 \]"
"First, we need to convert Rob's time into minutes. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 2 hours is 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.

Now, we know that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time Rob takes. So, we first calculate double the time Rob takes:

Double the time Rob takes = 2 * 120 minutes = 240 minutes.

Then, we add the 40 minutes extra that Royce takes:

Royce's time = 240 minutes + 40 minutes = 280 minutes.

So, the final numerical answer is 280 minutes."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Martha needs to make 5 items for each grandchild: a hat, a scarf, a sweater, a pair of mittens, and a pair of socks.
2. For each grandchild, she needs:
   - 2 skeins for a hat
   - 4 skeins for a scarf
   - 12 skeins for a sweater
   - 1 skein for a pair of mittens
   - 2 skeins for a pair of socks
3. Now, let's add up the total number of skeins needed for one grandchild:
   2 (for hat) + 4 (for scarf) + 12 (for sweater) + 1 (for mittens) + 2 (for socks) = 19 skeins
4. Since she has 3 grandchildren, we need to multiply the total for one grandchild by 3:
   19 (skeins for one grandchild) × 3 (grandchildren) = 57 skeins

So, Martha will need to buy 57 skeins of wool."
"First, let's calculate how many problems Chris completes on Tuesday. Since he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, and he completed 12 problems on Monday, we can calculate the number of problems he completes on Tuesday as follows:

\[ \text{Problems on Tuesday} = 3 \times 12 = 36 \]

Next, we need to find out how many problems are left after Monday and Tuesday. Initially, Chris has 100 problems. After Monday, he has:

\[ 100 - 12 = 88 \]

After Tuesday, he completes 36 more problems, so the number of problems left is:

\[ 88 - 36 = 52 \]

On Wednesday, Chris completes one-quarter of the remaining problems. So, the number of problems he completes on Wednesday is:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 52 = 13 \]

After Wednesday, the number of problems left to complete is:

\[ 52 - 13 = 39 \]

So, the number of math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday is:

\[ 39 \]"
"First, let's find out how many quarts each person can pick per hour:

- Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.
- Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
- Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick \(5 \times 2 = 10\) quarts per hour.
- Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky can pick \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, let's add up the quarts they can pick per hour together:

- Tony: 6 quarts
- Bobby: 5 quarts
- Kathy: 10 quarts
- Ricky: 8 quarts

Total quarts per hour = \(6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29\) quarts.

So, the final numerical answer is 29 quarts."
"First, let's find out how many loaves were sold in total. They sold 93 loaves in the morning and 39 loaves in the afternoon. So, the total sold is:

93 + 39 = 132 loaves

Now, we start with 200 loaves and subtract the 132 loaves that were sold:

200 - 132 = 68 loaves

Then, they got 6 loaves back from the grocery store, so we add those to the remaining loaves:

68 + 6 = 74 loaves

So, the final number of loaves of bread they had left is 74."
"First, we need to find out how many rows of red tulips Jackson can plant. He has 36 red tulips and can fit 6 red tulips in a row. So, we divide the total number of red tulips by the number of red tulips that fit in a row:

\[ \text{Rows of red tulips} = \frac{36 \text{ red tulips}}{6 \text{ red tulips/row}} = 6 \text{ rows} \]

Next, we find out how many rows of blue tulips Jackson can plant. He has 24 blue tulips and can fit 8 blue tulips in a row. So, we divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of blue tulips that fit in a row:

\[ \text{Rows of blue tulips} = \frac{24 \text{ blue tulips}}{8 \text{ blue tulips/row}} = 3 \text{ rows} \]

Now, to find the total number of rows of flowers Jackson will plant, we add the rows of red tulips and the rows of blue tulips:

\[ \text{Total rows} = 6 \text{ rows of red tulips} + 3 \text{ rows of blue tulips} = 9 \text{ rows} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 9 rows."
"First, we need to find out how much raisins Heather has for each item. Since she wants to divide the 27 cups of raisins equally among oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix, we divide 27 by 3.

\[ \text{Raisins per item} = \frac{27 \text{ cups}}{3} = 9 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we know that each batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we divide the raisins she has for oatmeal cookies by the amount needed for one batch.

\[ \text{Number of batches} = \frac{9 \text{ cups}}{\frac{3}{4} \text{ cups per batch}} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 12 \]

So, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies."
"First, let's calculate Ada's daily electric consumption before adding the new device:
- Ada's daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour
- New device's daily consumption: 2 kilowatts per hour
- Total daily consumption after adding the new device: 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour

Next, let's calculate the cost per day:
- Cost per kilowatt per hour: $1.50
- Total daily cost: 14 kilowatts per hour * $1.50 = $21

Now, let's calculate the weekly cost:
- There are 7 days in a week
- Weekly cost: $21 * 7 = $147

Now, let's calculate Ada's daily electric consumption after adding the new device:
- Total daily consumption after adding the new device: 14 kilowatts per hour

Next, let's calculate the cost per day after adding the new device:
- Total daily cost after adding the new device: 14 kilowatts per hour * $1.50 = $21

Now, let's calculate the weekly cost after adding the new device:
- Weekly cost after adding the new device: $21 * 7 = $147

Finally, let's find the difference between the weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device:
- Difference: $147 - $147 = $0

The difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is $0."
"First, let's figure out how much one person can paint in one day. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then in one day, one person can paint:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \text{ house} \div 5 \text{ days} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ house per day}
\]

So, one person paints \(\frac{1}{10}\) of a house in one day. Now, if we have 5 people working together, they can paint:

\[
5 \times \frac{1}{10} \text{ house per day} = \frac{5}{10} \text{ house per day} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ house per day}
\]

This means that 5 people can paint half a house in one day. To paint a whole house, they would need:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \text{ house} \times 2 = 1 \text{ house}
\]

Since they can paint half a house in one day, to paint a whole house, it would take them:

\[
1 \text{ day}
\]

Now, we need to convert this into hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day, it would take:

\[
1 \text{ day} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 24 \text{ hours}
\]

So, it would take 24 hours for 5 people to paint a whole house."
"First, let's find out how many sofas and chairs Ophelia has. We know that Ophelia has 20 sofas. According to the information given, Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. So, if we let the number of chairs Ophelia has be \( C \), then:

\[ C - 2 = 20 \]

To find \( C \), we add 2 to both sides of the equation:

\[ C = 20 + 2 \]
\[ C = 22 \]

So, Ophelia has 22 chairs.

Next, we need to find out how many sofas and chairs Jenna has. We know that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. Since Ophelia has 22 chairs, Jenna has:

\[ 3 \times 22 = 66 \]

chairs. According to the information given, Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. So, if we let the number of sofas Jenna has be \( S \), then:

\[ S = 66 - 2 \]
\[ S = 64 \]

So, Jenna has 64 sofas.

Now, we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together. Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs, and Jenna has 64 sofas and 66 chairs. The total number of sofas is:

\[ 20 + 64 = 84 \]

The total number of chairs is:

\[ 22 + 66 = 88 \]

So, the total number of sofas and chairs that they have together is:

\[ 84 + 88 = 172 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 172 \]"
"First, let's find out how much money Tom spent on the headphone set. We know he spent $4 on a CD and the total amount he spent was $48. So, we can calculate the cost of the headphone set by subtracting the cost of the CD from the total amount.

Cost of headphone set = Total amount - Cost of CD
Cost of headphone set = $48 - $4
Cost of headphone set = $44

Now, if Tom had not bought the headphone set, he would have had $44 more to spend on CDs. To find out how many more CDs he could have bought, we need to divide the extra money by the cost of one CD.

Number of additional CDs = Extra money / Cost of one CD
Number of additional CDs = $44 / $4
Number of additional CDs = 11

So, Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

The final numerical answer is 11."
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we need to add up the hours he worked out each week.

First, we know that for 6 weeks, he worked out for 4 hours each week. So, the total for these 6 weeks is:
\[ 6 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ hours/week} = 24 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that for 2 weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each week. So, the total for these 2 weeks is:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ hours/week} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

Then, we know that for 1 week, he worked out for 6 hours. So, the total for this week is:
\[ 1 \text{ week} \times 6 \text{ hours/week} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add up all these hours to get the total number of hours he spent working out over the 8 weeks:
\[ 24 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.
2. On the first stop, 8 people get off. So, the number of people on the bus becomes:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]
3. Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (which is 8) get on the bus. So, the number of people who get on is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
4. After these people get on, the number of people on the bus becomes:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80
   \]
5. On the second stop, 21 people get off. So, the number of people on the bus becomes:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59
   \]
6. Then, 3 times fewer people get on the bus than those who got off. Since 21 people got off, 3 times fewer means:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]
7. After these people get on, the number of people on the bus becomes:
   \[
   59 + 7 = 66

So, the final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is 66."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Jame's Age in 5 Years:**
   - Jame will be 27 in 5 years.
   - So, currently, Jame is \(27 - 5 = 22\) years old.

2. **Cousin's Age in 8 Years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \(27 + 8 = 35\) years old.
   - According to the question, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \(2 \times 35 = 70\).
   - So, Jame's cousin will be \(70 - 5 = 65\) years old in 8 years.

3. **Cousin's Current Age:**
   - If Jame's cousin will be 65 in 8 years, then currently, Jame's cousin is \(65 - 8 = 57\) years old.

4. **Age Difference Between Jame and His Cousin:**
   - Jame is 22 years old now.
   - Jame's cousin is 57 years old now.
   - The difference in their ages is \(57 - 22 = 35\) years.

So, the final numerical answer is 35."
"First, let's find out how much Errol paid for the printer. Since he paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100, the printer cost:
\[ 1100 - 400 = 700 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add up the cost of the computer, the printer, and the two monitors. We know the total cost was $2,400. So, if we let the cost of one monitor be \( x \), then the cost of two monitors is \( 2x \). The equation for the total cost is:
\[ 1100 + 700 + 2x = 2400 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ 1800 + 2x = 2400 \]

To find \( 2x \), we subtract 1800 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2x = 2400 - 1800 \]
\[ 2x = 600 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 2:
\[ x = \frac{600}{2} \]
\[ x = 300 \]

So, the cost of one monitor is $300. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"First, we need to find out how many boys and girls went on the trip. Since there were 20 kids in total and they were divided into two equal groups, there were 10 boys and 10 girls.

Each boy brought back 60 seashells. So, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is:
\[ 10 \text{ boys} \times 60 \text{ seashells/boy} = 600 \text{ seashells} \]

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. So, the total number of seashells brought by the girls is:
\[ 600 \text{ seashells} + 4 \times 600 \text{ seashells} = 600 \text{ seashells} + 2400 \text{ seashells} = 3000 \text{ seashells} \]

To find out how many seashells each girl brought, we divide the total number of seashells by the number of girls:
\[ \frac{3000 \text{ seashells}}{10 \text{ girls}} = 300 \text{ seashells/girl} \]

So, the number of seashells brought by each girl is:
\[ 300 \]"
"If George has 3 candies left after eating 5, it means George originally had 3 + 5 = 8 candies.

Since Nick had twice as many candies as George originally, Nick had 2 * 8 = 16 candies.

So, the final numerical answer is 16."
"First, let's find out how old Alyana is. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, we can calculate Alyana's age as follows:

Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4 years
Alyana's age = 10 years - 4 years
Alyana's age = 6 years

Now, we know that Anne is 2 years older than Alyana. So, we can find Anne's age by adding 2 years to Alyana's age:

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2 years
Anne's age = 6 years + 2 years
Anne's age = 8 years

So, Anne is 8 years old."
"To find the total thickness of the four books, let's calculate the thickness of each book step by step.

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so it is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm thick.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is \(31 \times 2 = 62\) mm thick.

Now, let's add the thicknesses of all four books together:

\[31 + 50 + 45 + 62\]

First, add 31 and 50:

\[31 + 50 = 81\]

Next, add 45 to the result:

\[81 + 45 = 126\]

Finally, add 62 to the result:

\[126 + 62 = 188\]

So, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma still needs to make, we need to add up the vlogs she has already made and subtract that from the total she needs to make.

She has made:
- 18 vlogs in the first week
- 21 vlogs in the second week
- 15 vlogs in the third week

So, the total vlogs she has made so far is:
18 + 21 + 15 = 54 vlogs

The total vlogs she needs to make is 72. So, the vlogs she still needs to make are:
72 - 54 = 18 vlogs

The final numerical answer is 18."
"First, we need to calculate the tip. The tip is 20% of the $50 dinner bill. 

To find 20% of $50, we can use the formula:
\[ \text{Tip} = \text{Bill Amount} \times \frac{\text{Tip Percentage}}{100} \]

So, the tip is:
\[ \text{Tip} = 50 \times \frac{20}{100} = 50 \times 0.20 = 10 \]

Now, to find out the total amount you paid, we add the bill amount to the tip:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Bill Amount} + \text{Tip} = 50 + 10 = 60 \]

So, you ended up paying $60."
"First, let's find out how much each boy gets when $18 is shared among 3 boys. We do this by dividing $18 by 3.

\[ \text{Each boy's share} = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \]

So, each boy gets $6. The eldest boy gets an additional $5 the next day, so his share becomes:

\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \]

The following day, he adds another $10 to his share:

\[ 11 + 10 = 21 \]

He then spends $8 from his total:

\[ 21 - 8 = 13 \]

After saving some more, he triples the amount he had left after spending the $8. So, we need to triple $13:

\[ 13 \times 3 = 39 \]

So, the final amount the eldest boy has now is $39."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to know how many days are in April. April has 30 days.

Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half. So, if we let the amount saved in the first half be \( x \), then the amount saved in the second half would be \( 2x \).

The total amount saved in April is the sum of the amount saved in the first half and the second half, which is \( x + 2x = 3x \).

We know that the total amount saved in April should be $1125. So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 3x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{1125}{3} = 375 \]

So, Elvis needs to save $375 in the first half of the month. Since the second half of the month is also 15 days, he needs to save \( 2 \times 375 = 750 \) dollars in the second half.

To find out how much he needs to save each day in the second half, we divide the total amount saved in the second half by the number of days in the second half:
\[ \frac{750}{15} = 50 \]

So, Elvis has to save $50 for each day in the second half of the month.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 50 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the apples:
- Verna bought 3 apples at $1.50 each.
- So, the total cost for apples is \(3 \times 1.50 = 4.50\).

Next, let's calculate the cost of the oranges:
- Verna bought 5 oranges at $0.80 each.
- So, the total cost for oranges is \(5 \times 0.80 = 4.00\).

Then, let's calculate the cost of the peaches:
- Verna bought 6 peaches at $0.75 each.
- So, the total cost for peaches is \(6 \times 0.75 = 4.50\).

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the fruits:
- Total cost = cost of apples + cost of oranges + cost of peaches
- Total cost = $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

Verna gave $20 to the seller. To find out how much change she received, we subtract the total cost of the fruits from the amount she gave:
- Change = $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{7}
\]"
"First, let's calculate how much money Jairus gets for completing 20 tasks. Jairus earns $0.8 for each task. So, for 20 tasks, he earns:

\[ 0.8 \times 20 = 16 \]

Next, let's calculate how much money Jenny gets for completing 20 tasks. Jenny earns $0.5 for each task. So, for 20 tasks, she earns:

\[ 0.5 \times 20 = 10 \]

Now, to find out how much more Jairus gets than Jenny, we subtract the amount Jenny earns from the amount Jairus earns:

\[ 16 - 10 = 6 \]

So, Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny."
"Let's break this down step by step.

1. Let's say Brad gets \( x \) dollars.
2. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets \( 4x \) dollars.
3. The total amount of money is $100, so we can write the equation: \( x + 4x = 100 \).
4. Simplifying the left side, we get \( 5x = 100 \).
5. To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5: \( x = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \).
6. So, Brad gets $20.
7. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets \( 4 \times 20 = 80 \) dollars.

Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars.

The final numerical answer is 80."
"To find out how many miles Jeff walks in a week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we know that Jeff walks 3 miles to work and 3 miles back home each day. So, for one round trip, he walks:
   \[
   3 \text{ miles (to work)} + 3 \text{ miles (back home)} = 6 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. Since he works 5 times a week, we need to multiply the miles he walks in one day by 5:
   \[
   6 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 30 \text{ miles/week}
   \]

So, the total number of miles Jeff walks in a week is 30 miles."
"To solve this, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The alphabet has 26 letters.
2. Elise writes the alphabet twice in full. So, for the first two times, she writes:
   \[
   26 \times 2 = 52 \text{ letters}
   \]
3. Then, she writes half of the alphabet once. Half of 26 is 13, so she writes:
   \[
   13 \text{ letters}
   \]
4. Now, she re-writes everything she has already written. This means she writes the 52 letters she wrote twice plus the 13 letters she wrote once:
   \[
   52 + 13 = 65 \text{ letters}
   \]
5. So, the total number of letters she has written is:
   \[
   52 + 13 = 65
   \]

Therefore, the total number of letters Elise has written is 65."
"Let's break this down step by step:

- In the first round, Ali calls 3 families.
- In the second round, each of the 3 families calls 3 other families, so that's 3 families * 3 = 9 new families.
- In the third round, each of the 9 families calls 3 other families, so that's 9 families * 3 = 27 new families.
- Now, we need to find out how many families will be called in the fourth round. Each of the 27 families from the third round will call 3 other families, so that's 27 families * 3 = 81 new families.

So, the number of families notified during the fourth round of calls is 81."
"Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, so he lost a total of 10 * 3 = 30 pounds.

If his final weight was 70 pounds, we can find his initial weight by adding the weight he lost to his final weight. So, his initial weight was 70 + 30 = 100 pounds.

The final numerical answer is 100 pounds."
"First, let's find out how many toys James's play set would have if it were five times larger. James's play set has 80 toys, so five times that would be:

\[ 80 \times 5 = 400 \text{ toys} \]

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have enough toys to make a sorted play set that is five times larger than James's play set. So, Jonathan needs 400 toys to have a play set five times larger than James's. If he needs 2 more toys to reach 400, then he currently has:

\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \text{ toys} \]

So, Jonathan currently has 398 toys."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each item Daniel wants to buy without the discount:

- One notebook costs $1.50, so five notebooks cost \(5 \times 1.50 = 7.50\).
- One pen costs $0.25, so two pens cost \(2 \times 0.25 = 0.50\).
- One calculator costs $12.
- One geometry set costs $10.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items:
\[7.50 + 0.50 + 12 + 10 = 20\]

Next, we need to apply the 10% discount. A 10% discount means Daniel only pays 90% of the total cost. So, we calculate 90% of $20:
\[20 \times 0.90 = 18\]

Therefore, the final amount Daniel has to spend is $18."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the hamburgers. Carly orders five hamburgers at $4 each:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \]
So, the cost of the hamburgers is $20.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the potato fries. Carly orders ten packs of potato fries at $0.30 each pack:
\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3 \]
So, the cost of the potato fries is $3.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the fruit drinks. Carly orders five cans of fruit drinks at $2 each can:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]
So, the cost of the fruit drinks is $10.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
\[ 20 + 3 + 10 = 33 \]
So, the total cost is $33.

Carly gives a fifty-dollar bill, so we need to find out how much change she gets back:
\[ 50 - 33 = 17 \]

Therefore, the change Carly gets back is $17."
"To solve this, we need to break down the commission calculation into two parts: the first $1000 and the amount over $1000.

1. For the first $1000, the commission is 30%.
   - Commission on $1000 = $1000 * 30% = $1000 * 0.30 = $300.

2. For the amount over $1000, which is $1500 (since $2500 - $1000 = $1500), the commission is an additional 10% on top of the initial 30%.
   - Initial commission on $1500 = $1500 * 30% = $1500 * 0.30 = $450.
   - Additional commission on $1500 = $1500 * 10% = $1500 * 0.10 = $150.
   - Total commission on $1500 = $450 + $150 = $600.

3. Now, we add the two parts of the commission together to get the total amount Antonella earned.
   - Total commission = $300 + $600 = $900.

So, Antonella earned $900."
"First, let's find out how many bottles of water Bill already has. He has 2 cases of water, and each case has 24 bottles. So, the total number of bottles he has is:

2 cases * 24 bottles/case = 48 bottles

Now, let's calculate how many bottles of water he needs for his 70 guests. He wants to have 2 bottles for each guest:

70 guests * 2 bottles/guest = 140 bottles

To find out how many additional bottles he needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the number of bottles he needs:

140 bottles needed - 48 bottles he has = 92 bottles

So, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water."
"First, let's find out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile when the water is warm.

When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as it takes in cold water. So, we calculate twice the cold time and then add 2 minutes:

\[ \text{Warm time} = 2 \times 16 + 2 = 32 + 2 = 34 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water.

For cold water:
\[ \text{Time for 3 miles} = 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

For warm water:
\[ \text{Time for 3 miles} = 3 \times 34 = 102 \text{ minutes} \]

To find out how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day, we subtract the cold time from the warm time:

\[ \text{Difference} = 102 - 48 = 54 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day."
"First, let's calculate how much money John saves in one day. He gets paid $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day, so:

\[ \text{Daily Savings} = 2 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours/day} = 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \]

Next, let's find out how much he saves in one week. He works 4 days a week, so:

\[ \text{Weekly Savings} = 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 4 \, \text{days/week} = 40 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Now, to find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80, we divide the total amount he wants to save by his weekly savings:

\[ \text{Weeks Needed} = \frac{80 \, \text{dollars}}{40 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 2 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80."
"First, we need to find out how much the six-inch cold-cut combo sub costs. Since it costs thrice as much as the foot-long fish sub, we multiply the cost of the foot-long fish sub by 3.

Cost of foot-long fish sub = $40
Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo sub = 3 * $40 = $120

Now, we add the cost of the foot-long fish sub and the six-inch cold-cut combo sub to find the total cost.

Total cost = Cost of foot-long fish sub + Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo sub
Total cost = $40 + $120 = $160

So, the final numerical answer is $160."
"First, we need to find out how many buttons had four holes. Since there were 21 buttons in total and 7 of them had two holes, we subtract 7 from 21 to find the number of buttons with four holes.

21 - 7 = 14 buttons had four holes.

Next, we calculate the total number of holes. We do this by multiplying the number of buttons with two holes by 2 and the number of buttons with four holes by 4, then adding the two results together.

For the buttons with two holes: 7 buttons * 2 holes = 14 holes.
For the buttons with four holes: 14 buttons * 4 holes = 56 holes.

Now, we add the holes from both types of buttons together:

14 holes + 56 holes = 70 holes.

So, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is 70."
"First, let's find out how big Zack's locker is. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we divide the size of Timothy's locker by 2.

Timothy's locker size = 24 cubic inches
Zack's locker size = 24 cubic inches / 2 = 12 cubic inches

Now, let's find out how big Peter's locker is. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, so we divide the size of Zack's locker by 4.

Zack's locker size = 12 cubic inches
Peter's locker size = 12 cubic inches / 4 = 3 cubic inches

So, Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches."
"First, let's find out how many cups of coffee Octavia drinks. The daily recommended cups of coffee is not given, but we know Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups. So, if we let the daily recommended cups of coffee be \( R \), then Octavia drinks \( \frac{R}{2} \) cups of coffee.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks. So, Juan drinks \( 10 \times \frac{R}{2} = 5R \) cups of coffee.

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. This means Juan needs to reduce his coffee intake from \( 5R \) cups to 4 cups. To find out how many cups Juan must reduce, we subtract 4 from \( 5R \).

So, the reduction needed is \( 5R - 4 \) cups.

Since the problem does not provide the value of \( R \), we can't calculate a specific numerical answer. However, if we assume the daily recommended cups of coffee \( R \) is a value that allows the calculation, we can express the answer in terms of \( R \).

The final numerical answer, assuming \( R \) is a value that allows the calculation, is:

\( 5R - 4 \) cups."
"To find the total number of rodents, we need to add the number of hamsters to the number of guinea pigs.

First, we calculate the total number of hamsters:
- There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each.
- So, the total number of hamsters is \(3 \times 10 = 30\).

Next, we calculate the total number of guinea pigs:
- There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each.
- So, the total number of guinea pigs is \(3 \times 5 = 15\).

Now, we add the total number of hamsters and guinea pigs to get the total number of rodents:
- Total number of rodents = Total number of hamsters + Total number of guinea pigs
- Total number of rodents = \(30 + 15 = 45\).

So, the pet shop had a total of 45 rodents."
"First, let's find out how much Susan weighs. Since Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, we subtract 20 from Mark's weight:

Mark's weight = 150 pounds
Susan's weight = Mark's weight - 20 pounds
Susan's weight = 150 pounds - 20 pounds
Susan's weight = 130 pounds

Now, let's find out how much Bob weighs. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so we multiply Susan's weight by 2:

Bob's weight = 2 * Susan's weight
Bob's weight = 2 * 130 pounds
Bob's weight = 260 pounds

Now we have the weights of all three friends:
- Mark weighs 150 pounds
- Susan weighs 130 pounds
- Bob weighs 260 pounds

To find the average weight, we add up all their weights and then divide by the number of friends:

Total weight = Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight
Total weight = 150 pounds + 130 pounds + 260 pounds
Total weight = 540 pounds

Now we divide the total weight by the number of friends (which is 3):

Average weight = Total weight / Number of friends
Average weight = 540 pounds / 3
Average weight = 180 pounds

So, the final numerical answer is 180 pounds."
"First, let's understand the problem step by step:

1. The great pyramids sit at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground.
2. The sun moves 5 degrees upward from the pyramid every hour.
3. The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is at 32 degrees from the ground.
4. The sun moves for 10 hours.

To find out how many degrees the sun will be from the ground after 10 hours, we need to add the angle the sun moves upward to the initial angle from the ground.

The angle the sun moves upward in 10 hours is:
\[ 5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees} \]

Now, we add this to the initial angle from the ground:
\[ 32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 82 \]"
"First, let's find out the ages of James' sons. If one son is 12 years old and the other is 4 years younger, then the other son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Now, James needs candles for both sons. So, he needs 12 candles for the 12-year-old son and 8 candles for the 8-year-old son. In total, he needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

A pack of 5 candles costs $3. To find out how many packs James needs, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles in a pack: 20 ÷ 5 = 4 packs.

Since each pack costs $3, the total cost for 4 packs is 4 × $3 = $12.

So, James spends $12 on candles."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

First, we calculate how many minutes Judy read in the first week. Since she read for 15 minutes each night and there are 7 nights in a week, we multiply 15 by 7:
\[ 15 \times 7 = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pages she read in the second week. We know she read a total of 100 pages in the second week.

Now, we need to find out how many pages she read in the first week. We know she reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she reads in 1 minute, we divide 2 by 1.5:
\[ \frac{2}{1.5} = \frac{20}{15} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages per minute} \]

Now, we calculate how many minutes she read in the first week, which we already know is 105 minutes. So, we multiply 105 by the rate of 4/3 pages per minute to find out how many pages she read in the first week:
\[ 105 \times \frac{4}{3} = 105 \times \frac{4}{3} = 35 \times 4 = 140 \text{ pages} \]

Finally, we add the pages read in the first week and the second week to find the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks:
\[ 140 + 100 = 240 \text{ pages} \]

So, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"First, let's find out how many sandwiches Cody ate. Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, so we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
\]

So, Cody ate 4 sandwiches. Now, let's find out how many sandwiches Trevor ate. Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, so we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3
\]

So, Trevor ate 3 sandwiches. Now, let's find out how many sandwiches are left by subtracting the number of sandwiches eaten by Cody and Trevor from the total number of sandwiches:

\[
12 - 4 - 3 = 5
\]

So, the number of sandwiches left is 5."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Shiloh is currently 44 years old.
2. In 7 years, Shiloh will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old.
3. At that time, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, if we let the nephew's age in 7 years be \( x \), then we have the equation:
   \[
   51 = 3x
   \]
4. To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
   \[
   x = \frac{51}{3} = 17
   \]
   So, in 7 years, the nephew will be 17 years old.
5. To find the nephew's current age, we subtract 7 years from 17:
   \[
   17 - 7 = 10
   \]

Therefore, the nephew is 10 years old today.

The final numerical answer is 10."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. For the first tooth, the tooth fairy gave $5.00.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave $1.00 each. So for three teeth, that's $1.00 * 3 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of money per tooth as the previous three teeth. Since each of the previous three teeth was $1.00, half of that is $0.50. So for two teeth, that's $0.50 * 2 = $1.00.

Now, let's add it all up:
- First tooth: $5.00
- Next three teeth: $3.00
- Last two teeth: $1.00

Total money given by the tooth fairy = $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00

So, the tooth fairy left Sharon $9.00 in total."
"First, let's find out how many goals Mark scored. Since Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark and Richie scored 80 goals, we can subtract 20 from 80 to find out how many goals Mark scored.

80 - 20 = 60 goals

Now, let's find out how many goals Anna scored. Since Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, we can subtract 45 from the 80 goals Richie scored to find out how many goals Anna scored.

80 - 45 = 35 goals

Now we know:
- Mark scored 60 goals
- Anna scored 35 goals
- Richie scored 80 goals

To find out how many goals all three teenagers scored together, we add their goals:

60 (Mark's goals) + 35 (Anna's goals) + 80 (Richie's goals) = 175 goals

So, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is 175."
"First, let's find out how much Mitchell made. Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 each. So, we multiply the number of lemonades by the price per lemonade:

\[ 21 \text{ lemonades} \times 4 \text{ dollars/lemonade} = 84 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we know Liam made $63. To find out how many more dollars Mitchell made than Liam, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings:

\[ 84 \text{ dollars} - 63 \text{ dollars} = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 21 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much money Peter spends on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. He buys one wooden action figure each day, and each wooden action figure costs $5.

Number of wooden action figures bought = 4 (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday)
Total cost for wooden action figures = 4 * $5 = $20

Now, let's find out how much money Peter has left after buying the wooden action figures.

Money left after buying wooden action figures = $70 - $20 = $50

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Sunday), Peter will buy plastic action figures. Each plastic action figure costs $2.

Number of plastic action figures he can buy = $50 / $2 = 25

Now, let's calculate the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week.

Total number of action figures = Number of wooden action figures + Number of plastic action figures
Total number of action figures = 4 + 25 = 29

So, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is 29."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Leah got 3 vaccines, and each vaccine costs $20. So, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the broken vases. The kitten broke 4 vases, and each vase costs $12. So, the total cost for the broken vases is:
\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \]

Now, we add the cost of spaying the kitten, the cost of the vaccines, and the cost of the broken vases to find the total cost:
\[ 200 + 60 + 48 = 308 \]

So, the total cost for the kitten so far is:
\[ 308 \]"
"First, let's find out how many roses Ford supplies to the flower shops each week. 

The first flower shop orders 20 roses.
The second flower shop orders 15 roses.
The third flower shop orders 30 roses.

So, the total number of roses supplied each week is:
20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.

Now, let's calculate how many roses Ford grows in a month. There are 4 weeks in a month, so:
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month.

The flower shops need:
20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses/month.

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the roses needed from the roses grown:
160 roses/month - 65 roses/month = 95 roses/month.

So, Ford lacks 95 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"To solve this, we need to calculate how much money Katina will have left after 2 years if she removes $100 every month.

First, let's find out how many months are in 2 years:
\[ 2 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ months} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money she removes over 24 months:
\[ 24 \text{ months} \times $100/\text{month} = $2400 \]

Now, we subtract the total amount removed from her initial savings:
\[ $3000 - $2400 = $600 \]

So, the amount of money remaining in her account after 2 years is:
\[ $600 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the bread and cheese for 10 sandwiches.

The cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00 per loaf, and since 10 sandwiches are made from 1 loaf, the cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00.

The cost of cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches is $30.00.

So, the total cost for 10 sandwiches is:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost of Bread} + \text{Cost of Cheese and Condiments} \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \$3.00 + \$30.00 = \$33.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 10 sandwiches at $7.00 each.

\[ \text{Total Revenue} = \text{Price per Sandwich} \times \text{Number of Sandwiches Sold} \]
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = \$7.00 \times 10 = \$70.00 \]

Now, to find the net profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

\[ \text{Net Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} \]
\[ \text{Net Profit} = \$70.00 - \$33.00 = \$37.00 \]

So, the net profit is \$37.00."
"First, let's find out how many crayons Kate has in total. She has 3 boxes of 64 crayons each. So, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of crayons in each box:

\[ 3 \times 64 = 192 \text{ crayons} \]

Next, we need to find out how many crayon muffins Kate can make. She melts 8 small pieces of crayons together to make one crayon muffin. So, we divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons needed for one muffin:

\[ 192 \div 8 = 24 \text{ muffins} \]

Now, if she can sell each muffin for $1.50, we can find out how much money she can make by multiplying the number of muffins by the price per muffin:

\[ 24 \times 1.50 = 36 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 36 \]"
"First, let's calculate the area of Michael's bedroom:
- The bedroom measures 18 feet by 12 feet.
- So, the area is 18 * 12 = 216 square feet.

Next, we calculate the cost of the new carpet and padding:
- The new carpet costs $12 per square foot, and the padding costs $2 per square foot.
- So, the total cost per square foot for the new carpet and padding is $12 + $2 = $14 per square foot.
- For 216 square feet, the cost will be 216 * $14 = $3024.

Then, we calculate the cost of removing the old carpet:
- The contractor charges $4 per square foot to remove the old carpet.
- So, for 216 square feet, the cost will be 216 * $4 = $864.

Finally, we calculate the cost of installing the new carpet:
- The contractor charges $34 per square foot to install the new carpet.
- So, for 216 square feet, the cost will be 216 * $34 = $7344.

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Cost of new carpet and padding: $3024
- Cost of removing the old carpet: $864
- Cost of installing the new carpet: $7344
- Total cost: $3024 + $864 + $7344 = $11232

So, the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet is $11232."
"To find the average number of birds Mack saw per day, we need to add up all the birds he saw and then divide by the number of days.

First, let's add up the total number of birds:
- Day 1 and Day 2: 50 birds
- Day 3: 0 birds
- Day 4 and Day 5: 120 birds
- Day 6: 20 birds
- Day 7: 90 birds

Total birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds

Now, we count the number of days:
- Day 1
- Day 2
- Day 3
- Day 4
- Day 5
- Day 6
- Day 7

Total days = 7

To find the average, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days:
Average = Total birds / Total days = 280 / 7 = 40

So, on average, Mack saw 40 birds per day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Diane gave the number train a starting value of 20.
2. The first operation is to add half of the starting value to the starting value. So, we calculate half of 20, which is 10. Adding this to the starting value gives us \(20 + 10 = 30\).
3. The next operation is to divide the result by 5. So, we divide 30 by 5, which gives us \(30 \div 5 = 6\).
4. The final operation is to multiply the result by the starting value minus 12. The starting value is 20, so we subtract 12 from it, which gives us \(20 - 12 = 8\). Then we multiply the result from the previous step (6) by 8, which gives us \(6 \times 8 = 48\).

So, the final value of the number train is 48."
"The boy has 5 cards.
His brother has 3 fewer cards, so his brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

Together, they have 5 + 2 = 7 cards.

The final numerical answer is 7."
"To solve this, we need to find the percentage by which the oven is off and then use that percentage to find the correct temperature setting for 520 degrees.

First, let's find the percentage by which the oven is off when set to 450 degrees. The actual temperature is 468 degrees when she sets it to 450 degrees.

The difference is:
\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage off is:
\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

Now, we need to find the temperature setting that would give the same 4% off for 520 degrees. Let's call the temperature she should set the oven to \( T \).

The actual temperature would be:
\[ T - 0.04T = 520 \]
\[ 0.96T = 520 \]
\[ T = \frac{520}{0.96} \]
\[ T = 541.67 \]

So, Maggie should set the oven to approximately 541.67 degrees to get the temperature her recipe calls for, considering the oven's malfunction."
"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch both movies, we need to add the lengths of the two movies together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, 1 hour and 30 minutes is:
\[ 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Since 2 hours is equal to 120 minutes, 2 hours and 5 minutes is:
\[ 120 + 5 = 125 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the lengths of the two movies together:
\[ 90 + 125 = 215 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is 215 minutes."
"First, we need to find out how much Juan's house is worth. If Herb's house is worth $76,000 and Juan's house is 30% less expensive, we can calculate the value of Juan's house by finding 30% of $76,000 and subtracting that from $76,000.

30% of $76,000 is calculated as:
\[ 0.30 \times 76,000 = 22,800 \]

So, Juan's house is:
\[ 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200 \]

Now, we add the value of both houses to find the total value:
\[ 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200 \]

So, the value of the two houses combined is $129,200."
"First, let's figure out how many cups and dishes Judy bought.

Judy bought a dozen cups. A dozen means 12 cups.
She bought twice as many dishes as cups. So, if she bought 12 cups, she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.

Now, let's find out how many dishes her friend brought. Her friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy. Since Judy brought 24 dishes, her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

Next, we need to find out how many cups her friend brought. Her friend brought 40 cups.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend.

Judy brought 12 cups and her friend brought 40 cups, so together they brought \(12 + 40 = 52\) cups.

Judy brought 24 dishes and her friend brought 44 dishes, so together they brought \(24 + 44 = 68\) dishes.

The total number of cups and dishes brought by both is \(52 + 68 = 120\).

So, the total number of utensils brought by the two is 120."
"First, let's find out the cost of one box of contacts after the discount. The original price of one box is $100.00, and it's currently 10% off. So, the discount amount is:

\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the price of one box after the discount is:

\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

Now, if Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost for 2 boxes is:

\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Since each box contains 90 single use contacts, 2 boxes will contain:

\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \]

So, the cost per pair of contacts (which is 90 contacts) is:

\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

Each pair of contacts will cost Pete $1.00."
"First, let's calculate how much Jill earned.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so she worked a total of:
2 + 1 = 3 hours

Since she was paid $10 an hour, her total earnings are:
3 hours * $10/hour = $30

Now, let's calculate how much John earned.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked:
2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday

John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked:
3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday

So, John worked a total of:
4 + 3 = 7 hours

Since he was also paid $10 an hour, his total earnings are:
7 hours * $10/hour = $70

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings:
$70 - $30 = $40

So, John earned $40 more than Jill."
"First, let's calculate how many calories Hannah burns while doing aerobics. She does aerobics for 2 hours and burns 500 calories per hour. So, the total calories burned from aerobics is:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 500 \text{ calories/hour} = 1000 \text{ calories} \]

Next, let's calculate how many calories Hannah burns while running. She runs for 1 hour and burns 600 calories per hour. So, the total calories burned from running is:
\[ 1 \text{ hour} \times 600 \text{ calories/hour} = 600 \text{ calories} \]

Now, let's find the total calories burned by adding the calories burned from aerobics and running:
\[ 1000 \text{ calories} + 600 \text{ calories} = 1600 \text{ calories} \]

Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. To find out how many ml of water she needs to drink for 1600 calories, we can set up a proportion:
\[ \frac{100 \text{ ml}}{200 \text{ calories}} = \frac{x \text{ ml}}{1600 \text{ calories}} \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{100 \text{ ml} \times 1600 \text{ calories}}{200 \text{ calories}} = \frac{160000 \text{ ml}}{200} = 800 \text{ ml} \]

So, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( B \) represent the number of blue jelly beans.
   - According to the note, the number of red jelly beans is 1% less than the number of blue jelly beans. So, the number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \).
   - The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans. So, the number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \).

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - The total number of jelly beans is the sum of red, blue, and green jelly beans. This gives us the equation:
     \[
     0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500
     \]

3. **Combine Like Terms:**
   - Simplify the left side of the equation:
     \[
     0.99B + B + 1.01B = 3B
     \]
   - So, the equation becomes:
     \[
     3B = 4500
     \]

4. **Solve for \( B \):**
   - Divide both sides by 3 to find \( B \):
     \[
     B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500
     \]

5. **Find the Number of Red and Green Jelly Beans:**
   - The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \):
     \[
     0.99 \times 1500 = 1485
     \]
   - The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \):
     \[
     1.01 \times 1500 = 1515
     \]

6. **Calculate the Difference Between Green and Red Jelly Beans:**
   - The difference is:
     \[
     1515 - 1485 = 30
     \]

So, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans."
"First, let's find out Jared's typing speed after the second increase. He started at 47 WPM and increased it by 5 words to 52 WPM. If he increases it by 5 words again, his new speed will be:

\[ 52 + 5 = 57 \text{ WPM} \]

Now, we have three measurements of his typing speed: 47 WPM, 52 WPM, and 57 WPM. To find the average of these three measurements, we add them together and then divide by 3:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{47 + 52 + 57}{3} \]

Let's calculate the sum first:

\[ 47 + 52 + 57 = 156 \]

Now, we divide the sum by 3 to find the average:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{156}{3} = 52 \]

So, the average of the three measurements is 52 WPM."
"First, let's calculate how much Martin will lose in 5 weeks if he eats Cheerios every day for breakfast. We know he loses 1.25 pounds per week. So, for 5 weeks, we multiply 1.25 pounds/week by 5 weeks:

\[ 1.25 \, \text{pounds/week} \times 5 \, \text{weeks} = 6.25 \, \text{pounds} \]

Next, let's calculate how much Martin will gain in 5 weeks if he eats donuts every day for breakfast. We know he gains 1.75 pounds per week. So, for 5 weeks, we multiply 1.75 pounds/week by 5 weeks:

\[ 1.75 \, \text{pounds/week} \times 5 \, \text{weeks} = 8.75 \, \text{pounds} \]

Now, to find the difference in his weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options, we subtract the weight loss from the weight gain:

\[ 8.75 \, \text{pounds} - 6.25 \, \text{pounds} = 2.5 \, \text{pounds} \]

So, the difference in his weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and eating donuts is 2.5 pounds."
"First, let's calculate the number of people Alex will have based on the emails she sent out. She invited 100 people, and each of those 100 people invites 2 friends. So, the number of friends invited is:
\[ 100 \times 2 = 200 \]

Next, we add the 10 friends Alex called to invite. So, the total number of people invited is:
\[ 100 + 200 + 10 = 310 \]

Now, we need to consider the spouses of 8 of the invited friends. So, we add 8 more people to the total:
\[ 310 + 8 = 318 \]

Therefore, Alex will need 318 seats for the event."
"First, let's find out how much the Dachshund weighs. Since the Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, and the Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds, the Dachshund weighs:
\[ 10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we find out how much the Papillon weighs. The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so:
\[ 20 \div 4 = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we know the Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon. So, the Mastiff weighs:
\[ 5 \times 44 = 220 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 220 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost for the boots on Amazon.com.

The cost of the boots on Amazon is $16.
The shipping cost on Amazon is $4.
So, the total cost on Amazon is $16 + $4 = $20.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the boots on eBay.

The cost of the boots on eBay is $13.
The shipping cost on eBay is twice as much as on Amazon, so it's 2 * $4 = $8.
So, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

Now, to find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon, we subtract the total cost on Amazon from the total cost on eBay.

The difference is $21 - $20 = $1.

So, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay."
"First, let's figure out how tall the beanstalk is after each day. We know it starts at 4 feet and doubles every day. We need to find out how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than 20 feet.

- On day 0 (starting point), the beanstalk is 4 feet tall.
- On day 1, the beanstalk is 4 * 2 = 8 feet tall.
- On day 2, the beanstalk is 8 * 2 = 16 feet tall.
- On day 3, the beanstalk is 16 * 2 = 32 feet tall.

So, on day 3, the beanstalk is 32 feet tall, which is taller than Mark's window that is 20 feet off the ground.

Therefore, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window."
"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms every day, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out how much protein is in 200 grams of mushrooms. Since 100 grams of mushrooms have 3 grams of protein, we can calculate the protein in 200 grams by doubling the protein content:
   \[
   \text{Protein in 200 grams} = 3 \text{ grams} \times 2 = 6 \text{ grams}
   \]

2. Now, we know that John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. To find out how much protein he gets in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by the number of days in a week:
   \[
   \text{Protein in a week} = 6 \text{ grams/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams/week}
   \]

So, John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms every day."
"Let's break this down step by step.

1. Let's say Jerry's age 5 years ago was \( x \).
2. According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, his current age is \( 2x \).
3. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age. So, his age in 3 years will be \( 2x + 3 \).

Now, we need to find the value of \( x \). Since the problem doesn't give us Jerry's current age directly, we can use the relationship we have to express his current age in terms of \( x \).

Since \( x \) is Jerry's age 5 years ago, and his current age is \( 2x \), we can see that \( x \) must be a number that fits this relationship. But we don't need to find \( x \) explicitly to answer the question. We just need to express Jerry's age in 3 years in terms of \( x \).

So, Jerry's age in 3 years is \( 2x + 3 \).

Since the problem doesn't give us a specific value for \( x \), we can't find a specific numerical age for Jerry. But if we assume \( x \) is a number that fits the relationship, we can say that Jerry's age in 3 years is \( 2x + 3 \).

If we assume \( x = 5 \) (a reasonable guess since it's a common age for someone 5 years ago), then Jerry's current age is \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \). So, in 3 years, Jerry will be \( 10 + 3 = 13 \).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
13"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

George needs 2 implants, and each implant costs $2000.
So, the cost for the implants is: \(2 \times 2000 = 4000\) dollars.

For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500.
So, the total cost for the implants and the porcelain crown is: \(4000 + 500 = 4500\) dollars.

George has already put down a deposit of $600.
So, the remaining amount he needs to pay is: \(4500 - 600 = 3900\) dollars.

George makes $15 per hour at work.
To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
\[ \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \]

So, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work.

The final numerical answer is:
260"
"Let's call the smallest angle \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so that angle is \( 2x \) degrees. The other angle is three times the smallest angle, so that angle is \( 3x \) degrees. The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms gives us:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 6:

\[ x = 30 \]

So the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The angle that is twice the smallest angle is:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

And the angle that is three times the smallest angle is:

\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees. So the measure of the largest angle is:

\[ 90 \]"
"First, let's find out how many gumballs Colby can buy with the money he has.

He has 8 quarters. Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, the total amount of money from quarters is:
\[ 8 \times 25 = 200 \text{ cents} \]

He has 6 dimes. Since each dime is worth 10 cents, the total amount of money from dimes is:
\[ 6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ cents} \]

He has 14 nickels. Since each nickel is worth 5 cents, the total amount of money from nickels is:
\[ 14 \times 5 = 70 \text{ cents} \]

He has 15 pennies. Since each penny is worth 1 cent, the total amount of money from pennies is:
\[ 15 \times 1 = 15 \text{ cents} \]

Now, let's add up all the money he has:
\[ 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 \text{ cents} \]

Each gumball costs 5 cents. To find out how many gumballs he can buy, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball:
\[ \frac{345}{5} = 69 \]

So, Colby can buy 69 gumballs."
"To solve this, let's count the legs for each type of pet:

- Dogs: Each dog has 4 legs. Since there are 5 dogs, the total number of legs for dogs is \(5 \times 4 = 20\).
- Cats: Each cat has 4 legs. Since there are 2 cats, the total number of legs for cats is \(2 \times 4 = 8\).
- Birds: Each bird has 2 legs. Since there are 10 birds, the total number of legs for birds is \(10 \times 2 = 20\).

Now, let's add up all the legs:
- Legs from dogs: 20
- Legs from cats: 8
- Legs from birds: 20

Total number of legs = \(20 + 8 + 20 = 48\)

So, the total number of legs in the pet store is 48."
"First, we need to find out what 50% of the original weight is. The original weight is 8 pounds.

50% of 8 pounds is calculated as:
\[ 8 \times \frac{50}{100} = 8 \times 0.5 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Jamaal increases the weight by 4 pounds. The new weight is:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Since the weight is too heavy, Jamaal uses a weight two pounds lighter than 12 pounds. So, the new weight he uses is:
\[ 12 - 2 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"Let's break down the problem year by year.

**First Year:**
- Steve starts with 5 games.
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months.
- So, he buys 12 games in the first year.
- Total games after the first year = 5 (initial) + 12 (bought) = 17 games.

**Second Year:**
- He starts the year with 17 games.
- He buys 2 games per month for 12 months.
- So, he buys 24 games in the second year.
- Total games after the second year = 17 (from the first year) + 24 (bought) = 41 games.

**Third Year:**
- He starts the year with 41 games.
- He buys 4 games per month for 12 months.
- So, he buys 48 games in the third year.
- He also gets 5 games for Christmas.
- Total games after the third year = 41 (from the second year) + 48 (bought) + 5 (Christmas) = 94 games.

So, the final number of games Steve has after 3 years is 94."
"First, we need to find out the speed of the plane. Speed is calculated by dividing the distance by the time. So, the plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours. 

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now, we need to find out how many hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed.

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, the plane would take 5 additional hours to travel an additional 2000 miles."
"First, let's find out how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz makes in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we divide 120 by 2 to find out how much he makes in one hour:

\[ \text{Ruiz's production per hour} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we know that Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 60 pounds in an hour, we calculate Marissa's production per hour as follows:

\[ \text{Marissa's production per hour} = \frac{3}{4} \times 60 \text{ pounds} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we calculate how much Ruiz makes in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Ruiz's total production in 12 hours} = 60 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

And how much Marissa makes in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Marissa's total production in 12 hours} = 45 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the total production of Ruiz and Marissa to find the total amount of chocolate they made together in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Total production} = 720 \text{ pounds} + 540 \text{ pounds} = 1260 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1260 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much money Howard spends each day.

On Monday, he spends $8.

On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as he did on Monday, so:
\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as he did on Tuesday, so:
\[ 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add up all the money he spent over the three days:
\[ 8 + 16 + 64 = 88 \text{ dollars} \]

He originally had $100. To find out how much money he has left, we subtract the total amount he spent from his original amount:
\[ 100 - 88 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"To find out how much money Patrick earned, we need to calculate the earnings for each part of the time he worked and then add them together.

For the first four hours:
- He sold 15 cups per hour.
- Each cup was sold for $0.50.
- So, the earnings per hour were 15 cups * $0.50/cup = $7.50.
- For four hours, the total earnings were 4 hours * $7.50/hour = $30.00.

For the next two hours:
- He sold 10 cups per hour.
- Each cup was sold for $0.60.
- So, the earnings per hour were 10 cups * $0.60/cup = $6.00.
- For two hours, the total earnings were 2 hours * $6.00/hour = $12.00.

Now, we add the earnings from both parts of the time:
- Total earnings = $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

So, Patrick earned $42.00 from selling lemonade for 6 hours."
"First, let's find out how many times the tires rotate in total for Jeremy's monthly driving.

The car rotates its tires 725 times for every 2 miles. So, for 400 miles, the tires rotate:

\[ \text{Rotations per 2 miles} = 725 \]
\[ \text{Miles driven} = 400 \]
\[ \text{Rotations for 400 miles} = \frac{725}{2} \times 400 \]

Let's calculate that:
\[ \text{Rotations for 400 miles} = 362.5 \times 400 = 145,000 \]

So, the tires rotate 145,000 times in a month.

Now, we need to find out how many months it will take for the tires to rotate 10,440,000 times:

\[ \text{Total rotations} = 10,440,000 \]
\[ \text{Rotations per month} = 145,000 \]
\[ \text{Months needed} = \frac{10,440,000}{145,000} \]

Let's calculate that:
\[ \text{Months needed} = \frac{10,440,000}{145,000} = 72 \]

So, it will take 72 months for the tires to rotate 10,440,000 times. Since there are 12 months in a year, we can find out how many years it will take:

\[ \text{Years needed} = \frac{72}{12} = 6 \]

Therefore, the tires need to be replaced after 6 years."
"First, we need to find out how many times Jackie can use the shampoo with 1 pump per wash. Since the directions say 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give half as many washings. So, 120 washings / 2 pumps = 60 washings per pump.

The bottle costs $24.00, and we need to find out how much each pump costs in dollars. Since 1 pump gives 60 washings, we need to find out how many pumps are in the bottle. We do this by dividing the total number of washings the bottle can give by the number of washings per pump.

The bottle can give 120 washings, and each pump gives 60 washings, so the number of pumps in the bottle is 120 washings / 60 washings per pump = 2 pumps.

Now, we need to find out how much each pump costs. The bottle costs $24.00, and it contains 2 pumps, so each pump costs $24.00 / 2 pumps = $12.00 per pump.

To convert this to cents, we know that $1.00 is equal to 100 cents. So, $12.00 is equal to 12 * 100 cents = 1200 cents.

Therefore, each pump costs 1200 cents."
"First, let's calculate the discount on the shirt. The shirt originally costs $25 and there is a 30% off sale.

To find the discount amount on the shirt:
\[ \text{Discount on shirt} = 25 \times \frac{30}{100} = 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]

So, the shirt will cost:
\[ \text{Discounted price of shirt} = 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

Next, let's calculate the discount on the shorts. The shorts originally cost $35 and there is a 30% off sale.

To find the discount amount on the shorts:
\[ \text{Discount on shorts} = 35 \times \frac{30}{100} = 35 \times 0.30 = 10.50 \]

So, the shorts will cost:
\[ \text{Discounted price of shorts} = 35 - 10.50 = 24.50 \]

Now, let's add the discounted prices of the shirt and the shorts to find the total cost of the outfit:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 17.50 + 24.50 = 42.00 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. To find out how much money he will have left after the purchase, we subtract the total cost of the outfit from the amount he has:
\[ \text{Money left} = 50 - 42.00 = 8.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 8.00 \]"
"To find out how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a day. He wants to make 4 dozen a day.
2. Next, we need to find out how many dozens of croissants he wants to make in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, he will make 4 dozen a day for 7 days, which is \(4 \times 7 = 28\) dozen.
3. We know that it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. So, to find out how many pounds of butter he needs for 28 dozen, we multiply 28 by 1/4.

Let's do the multiplication:
\[ 28 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7 \]

So, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 28 dozen croissants.

The final numerical answer is:
7"
"First, we need to calculate the cost to repave Monica's street. The cost is $194 per meter and her street is 150 meters long.

\[ \text{Cost for Monica's street} = 194 \times 150 \]

Let's calculate this:

\[ 194 \times 150 = 29100 \]

So, it costs $29,100 to repave Monica's street.

Next, we need to calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street. Lewis' street is 490 meters long.

\[ \text{Cost for Lewis' street} = 194 \times 490 \]

Let's calculate this:

\[ 194 \times 490 = 94860 \]

So, it costs $94,860 to repave Lewis' street.

Now, to find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we subtract the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis' street.

\[ \text{Difference} = 94860 - 29100 \]

Let's calculate this:

\[ 94860 - 29100 = 65760 \]

So, it costs $65,760 more to repave Lewis' street than Monica's street.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 65760 \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. John gets $100,000 for the first 5 months of research.
2. The research takes 10 times longer than the initial 5 months, so it takes 10 * 5 = 50 months in total.
3. The first 5 months cost $100,000 each month.
4. The next 45 months (50 months total - 5 months initial) cost 50% more per month than the initial $100,000.

Let's calculate the cost for the next 45 months.

- The cost per month for the next 45 months is $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000.
- So, the total cost for the next 45 months is $150,000 * 45.

Now, let's add the cost of the first 5 months to the cost of the next 45 months to get the total cost of the research.

Let's do the math:
- Cost for the first 5 months: $100,000 * 5 = $500,000.
- Cost for the next 45 months: $150,000 * 45 = $6,750,000.

Total cost = Cost for the first 5 months + Cost for the next 45 months
Total cost = $500,000 + $6,750,000 = $7,250,000.

So, the total cost of John's research is $7,250,000."
"To solve this, let's break down the meat consumption for each player:

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce, so that's 8 * 1 = 8 ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, that's 16 ounces.
4. The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they didn't eat any meat.

Now, let's add up the meat consumption:
6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces

So, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the total number of posts in March. March has 31 days. If each of the 1000 members posts an average of 3 times a day, we can find the total number of posts by multiplying the number of members by the average number of posts per member per day and then by the number of days in March.

So, the calculation is:
\[ 1000 \text{ members} \times 3 \text{ posts/member/day} \times 31 \text{ days} \]

Let's do the math:
\[ 1000 \times 3 = 3000 \text{ posts/day} \]
\[ 3000 \times 31 = 93000 \text{ posts} \]

The total number of posts in March is 93000."
"To find out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total gallons of water Gary uses for laundry in a week.
2. Calculate the total gallons of water Gary uses for laundry in a year.
3. Calculate the total cost of the water used for laundry in a year.

Step 1: Gary does laundry twice a week, and each load uses 20 gallons of water.
So, in a week, Gary uses \(2 \times 20 = 40\) gallons of water for laundry.

Step 2: There are 52 weeks in a year, so in a year, Gary uses \(40 \times 52 = 2080\) gallons of water for laundry.

Step 3: A gallon of water costs $0.15, so the total cost for 2080 gallons is \(2080 \times 0.15 = 312\) dollars.

Therefore, Gary spends $312 on water for laundry in a year."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each item Scarlett bought:

1. The aquarium cost $10.00.
2. The cost of 2 bags of rocks is \(2 \times $2.50 = $5.00\).
3. The cost of 3 pieces of coral is \(3 \times $2.00 = $6.00\).
4. The cost of 20 fish is \(20 \times $0.50 = $10.00\).
5. The cost of fish food is $2.00.

Now, let's add up all these costs to find the total amount Scarlett spent:

So, the total amount Scarlett spent is $33.00."
"To find out how tall Jane's beanstalk was after 3 weeks, let's calculate its height step by step.

1. After the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.
2. In the second week, it doubled in height. So, the height after the second week is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.
3. In the third week, it grew another 4 inches. So, the height after the third week is \(6 + 4 = 10\) inches.

Therefore, the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks is 10 inches."
"First, let's find out how much meat Prince can sell in one day. He sells 15kg of meat every hour and he works 10 hours a day, so:

\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for Prince to sell 750kg of meat from the bull. We do this by dividing the total weight of the bull by the amount of meat Prince can sell in one day:

\[ 750 \, \text{kg} \div 150 \, \text{kg/day} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

So, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull."
"First, let's find out the total number of seats in the auditorium. There are 4 rows with 18 seats in each row. So, we multiply the number of rows by the number of seats per row:

\[ 4 \times 18 = 72 \]

Next, we need to find out how many seats were occupied by the administrators. One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18 \]

Now, we subtract the number of seats occupied by the administrators from the total number of seats to find out how many seats were left:

\[ 72 - 18 = 54 \]

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents. So, we calculate one-third of the remaining 54 seats:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18 \]

Now, we subtract the number of seats occupied by the parents from the remaining seats to find out how many seats were occupied by the students:

\[ 54 - 18 = 36 \]

So, the number of students in the school auditorium is:

\[ 36 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 36 \]"
"First, let's find out how many street lights are there in total. Each pole has 4 street lights and there are 6 poles at each intersection. So, the number of street lights at one intersection is:

\[ 4 \text{ lights/pole} \times 6 \text{ poles} = 24 \text{ lights} \]

Since there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights in the road is:

\[ 24 \text{ lights/intersection} \times 4 \text{ intersections} = 96 \text{ lights} \]

Now, we know that 20 of these street lights are not working. So, the number of functioning street lights is:

\[ 96 \text{ lights} - 20 \text{ non-functioning lights} = 76 \text{ functioning lights} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 76 \]"
"First, let's find out how many times each DVD can still be played before it breaks.

For the first DVD:
It has been played 356 times.
So, it can be played for 1000 - 356 = 644 more times.

For the second DVD:
It has been played 135 times.
So, it can be played for 1000 - 135 = 865 more times.

Now, let's add the remaining play counts of both DVDs together:
644 + 865 = 1509

So, the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is 1509."
"First, let's break down the information given:
- John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks.
- Each week, he went twice for 2 hours at a time.
- The cost per hour is $125.

Now, let's calculate the total hours John spent in therapy:
- Each session is 2 hours long.
- He went twice a week, so each week he spent 2 hours x 2 = 4 hours.
- Over 6 weeks, he spent 4 hours/week x 6 weeks = 24 hours.

Next, we calculate the total cost:
- The cost per hour is $125.
- So, the total cost for 24 hours is 24 hours x $125/hour = $3000.

Therefore, the total cost of the physical therapy is $3000."
"First, let's figure out how many pieces of gum Jim chews during the school day. Since he chews 1 piece every 2 hours and a school day lasts 8 hours, we can calculate the number of pieces he chews during school hours as follows:

8 hours / 2 hours per piece = 4 pieces

He chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so that's an additional 2 pieces.

So far, Jim has chewed 4 (during school) + 2 (on the way home and after dinner) = 6 pieces of gum.

Jim started with a 20 pack of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

Then, he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Half of 14 is 14 / 2 = 7 pieces.

So, after giving 7 pieces to his sister, Jim has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

The final numerical answer is 7."
"To find out how old Charmaine will be 4 years from now, we first need to determine her current age. If she will be 16 years old in 12 years, we can subtract 12 years from 16 to find her current age.

16 - 12 = 4

So, Charmaine is currently 4 years old. To find out how old she will be 4 years from now, we add 4 years to her current age.

4 + 4 = 8

Therefore, Charmaine will be 8 years old 4 years from now."
"First, let's calculate how much the baseball coach spent. He bought 9 baseballs at $3 each, so we multiply 9 by 3:

9 * 3 = 27

So, the baseball coach spent $27.

Now, let's calculate how much the basketball coach spent. He bought 8 basketballs at $14 each, so we multiply 8 by 14:

8 * 14 = 112

So, the basketball coach spent $112.

To find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we subtract the amount the baseball coach spent from the amount the basketball coach spent:

112 - 27 = 85

So, the basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach."
"First, we need to find out the total number of flowers in the garden. Since there are 10 rows with 20 flowers in each row, we can calculate the total number of flowers by multiplying these two numbers:

\[ \text{Total number of flowers} = 10 \times 20 = 200 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these flowers have bloomed. We know that 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed. To find this number, we multiply the total number of flowers by 4/5:

\[ \text{Number of flowers that have bloomed} = 200 \times \frac{4}{5} \]

To perform the multiplication:

\[ 200 \times \frac{4}{5} = 200 \times 0.8 = 160 \]

So, the number of flowers that have bloomed is 160."
"First, we need to convert Ashley's internet speed from kilobytes per second (kb/s) to megabytes per second (Mb/s).

Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we can convert 20 kb/s to Mb/s by dividing 20 by 1000.

\[ 20 \, \text{kb/s} = \frac{20}{1000} \, \text{Mb/s} = 0.02 \, \text{Mb/s} \]

Next, we need to find out how much data Ashley can get in one hour. There are 3600 seconds in one hour.

\[ 0.02 \, \text{Mb/s} \times 3600 \, \text{s} = 72 \, \text{Mb} \]

So, Ashley’s internet connection speed in Mb per hour is 72 Mb/hour."
"To solve this, let's break it down day by day.

For the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day. So for three days, it would be:
10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars

For the last four days (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday), the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day than the first three days. So it pulled:
10 cars - 4 cars = 6 cars/day

For the last four days, it would be:
6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars

Now, to find the total number of cars towed that week, we add the cars towed in the first three days to the cars towed in the last four days:
30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars

So, the total number of cars the tow truck towed that week is 54 cars."
"First, we need to convert Adam's height from inches to feet to compare it with the requirement. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we divide Adam's height in inches by 12 to get his height in feet.

Adam's height in feet = 40 inches / 12 inches/foot = 3.3333 feet

The minimum height required to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. So, we need to find out how much more height Adam needs to grow to reach the minimum height requirement.

Height needed to grow = Minimum height required - Adam's current height
Height needed to grow = 4 feet - 3.3333 feet = 0.6667 feet

Adam grows 2 inches per year, which is equivalent to 2/12 feet per year. To find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow 0.6667 feet, we divide the height needed to grow by his yearly growth rate.

Years needed = Height needed to grow / Adam's yearly growth rate
Years needed = 0.6667 feet / (2/12 feet/year) = 0.6667 feet * (12/2 year/foot) = 4 years

So, Adam will be tall enough to ride the roller coaster in 4 years."
"First, let's find out the total cost of the 10 cars James sold. Each car costs $25,000, so:

\[ 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000 \]

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars. So, the cost the company paid for the cars is:

\[ 250,000 \times 0.30 = 75,000 \]

Now, let's find out the profit James made. The profit is the total cost of the cars minus what the company paid for them:

\[ 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000 \]

James gets a 10% commission on the profits. So, his commission is:

\[ 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 17,500 \]"
"First, let's find out how many riders can stay upright on the wave. Since only 25% of the riders can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives, we calculate 25% of 100 riders:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 100 = \frac{25}{100} \times 100 = 25 \text{ riders} \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 25 riders are women. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we calculate 60% of 25 riders:

\[ 60\% \text{ of } 25 = \frac{60}{100} \times 25 = 15 \text{ women} \]

To find out how many of these 25 riders are men, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

\[ 25 \text{ riders} - 15 \text{ women} = 10 \text{ men} \]

So, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is 10."
"First, let's find the price of the gold jewel. We know that the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of a diamond jewel. Since a diamond jewel costs $2000, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * $2000
Price of gold jewel = $1600

Next, we need to find the price of the silver jewel. We know that the silver jewel costs $400 less than the gold jewel. So, we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
Price of silver jewel = $1600 - $400
Price of silver jewel = $1200

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
Total price = $2000 + $1600 + $1200
Total price = $4800

So, the total price for all three jewels is $4800."
"First, let's find out how many truck stamps Max bought. Since he bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, and he bought 16 snowflake stamps, we can calculate the number of truck stamps as follows:

Number of truck stamps = Number of snowflake stamps + 3
Number of truck stamps = 16 + 3
Number of truck stamps = 19

Next, we need to find out how many rose stamps Max bought. Since he bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, we can calculate the number of rose stamps as follows:

Number of rose stamps = Number of truck stamps - 9
Number of rose stamps = 19 - 9
Number of rose stamps = 10

Now, to find the total number of stamps Max bought, we add the number of snowflake stamps, truck stamps, and rose stamps together:

Total number of stamps = Number of snowflake stamps + Number of truck stamps + Number of rose stamps
Total number of stamps = 16 + 19 + 10
Total number of stamps = 45

So, the total number of stamps Max bought is 45."
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how long it will take for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between him and Bob.

First, let's determine the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap. Since Bob is driving at 55 mph and Tom is driving at 70 mph, Tom is gaining on Bob at a rate of:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is closing the 75-mile gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. To find out how long it will take Tom to close this gap, we divide the distance by the rate at which he's closing the gap:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Rate}} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"First, let's find out how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less than Naomi and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate the number of fish Darren caught as follows:

Darren's fish = Naomi's fish - 6
Darren's fish = 17 - 6
Darren's fish = 11

Now, we know that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. So, we can calculate the number of fish Tommy caught as follows:

Tommy's fish = Darren's fish + 3
Tommy's fish = 11 + 3
Tommy's fish = 14

So, Tommy caught 14 fish."
"First, let's find out how much each class costs on average if Manny misses some classes. If the total cost is $60 for 10 classes, then the cost per class is:

\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of classes}} = \frac{60}{10} = 6 \]

Now, Manny's parents will not sign him up again if the cost per class exceeds $10. Since each class costs $6, he can miss all the classes and still stay under the $10 per class limit. However, the question asks how many classes he can miss before they don't sign him up again. Since the cost per class is $6, which is less than $10, he can miss all 10 classes and still stay under the limit.

So, Manny can miss all 10 classes before they don't sign him up again. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 10 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how many customers Julie processes in a day. Since Julie operates the cash register twice as fast as Jewel, and Jewel processes 50 customers a day, Julie processes:
   \[
   2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ customers per day}
   \]

2. Now, we need to find out how many customers they process together in a day. Since Jewel processes 50 customers and Julie processes 100 customers, together they process:
   \[
   50 + 100 = 150 \text{ customers per day}
   \]

3. To find out how many customers they process in a week, we multiply the daily total by the number of days in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:
   \[
   150 \times 7 = 1050 \text{ customers per week}
   \]

So, the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel is 1050 customers."
"First, let's find out how far Reggie ran. Since Paisley ran 4 miles and Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, we can calculate Reggie's distance as follows:

Reggie's distance = 5 * Paisley's distance
Reggie's distance = 5 * 4 miles
Reggie's distance = 20 miles

Now, we know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. So, to find out how far Lynn ran, we subtract 3 miles from Reggie's distance:

Lynn's distance = Reggie's distance - 3 miles
Lynn's distance = 20 miles - 3 miles
Lynn's distance = 17 miles

So, Lynn ran 17 miles."
"First, let's find out the cost of one apple and one orange.

For apples:
- 4 apples cost $5.20
- So, the cost of one apple is $5.20 ÷ 4 = $1.30

For oranges:
- 3 oranges cost $3.30
- So, the cost of one orange is $3.30 ÷ 3 = $1.10

Now, we need to find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

Cost of 5 apples = 5 × $1.30 = $6.50
Cost of 5 oranges = 5 × $1.10 = $5.50

Total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges = $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00

So, the final numerical answer is $12.00."
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the hole Bob wants to dig. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 3 \]

Now, let's calculate the volume:

\[ V = 72 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it will take Bob to dig this volume of earth. We know that it takes him 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) required to dig the hole is:

\[ T = \text{volume} \times \text{time per cubic foot} \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ T = 72 \times 3 \]

Now, let's calculate the total time:

\[ T = 216 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 216 \text{ seconds} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of each additional feature:

1. King cab upgrade: $7,500
2. Leather seats: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so $7,500 / 3 = $2,500
3. Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats, so $2,500 - $500 = $2,000
4. Upgraded exterior light package: $1,500

Now, let's add up all the extra costs:
- King cab upgrade: $7,500
- Leather seats: $2,500
- Running boards: $2,000
- Upgraded exterior light package: $1,500

Total extra cost = $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1,500 = $13,500

Now, let's add the base price of the truck to the total extra cost:
- Base price of the truck: $30,000
- Total extra cost: $13,500

Total cost = $30,000 + $13,500 = $43,500

So, the total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"First, let's calculate Tim's new monthly salary after the raise. A 5% raise on $20000 is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Raise amount} = 20000 \times \frac{5}{100} = 20000 \times 0.05 = 1000 \]

So, his new monthly salary is:

\[ \text{New monthly salary} = 20000 + 1000 = 21000 \]

Next, we need to add the bonus. The bonus is half a month's salary, which is:

\[ \text{Bonus} = 20000 \times \frac{1}{2} = 10000 \]

So, his total monthly salary including the bonus is:

\[ \text{Total monthly salary} = 21000 + 10000 = 31000 \]

To find out how much he makes in a year, we multiply his total monthly salary by 12 (months in a year):

\[ \text{Yearly salary} = 31000 \times 12 = 372000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 372000 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the suits. James buys 10 suits, and each suit costs $750. So, the total cost for the suits is:
\[ 10 \times 750 = 7500 \]

Next, let's find the cost of the dress pants. The dress pants cost 1/5 of the cost of a suit. Since a suit costs $750, the cost of a pair of dress pants is:
\[ \frac{750}{5} = 150 \]
James buys 10 pairs of dress pants, so the total cost for the dress pants is:
\[ 10 \times 150 = 1500 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the dress shirts. James buys 3 dress shirts per suit, and he buys 10 suits. So, the total number of dress shirts he buys is:
\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \]
Each dress shirt costs $60, so the total cost for the dress shirts is:
\[ 30 \times 60 = 1800 \]

Finally, to find the total cost of everything, we add the cost of the suits, the dress pants, and the dress shirts:
\[ 7500 + 1500 + 1800 = 10800 \]

So, the total cost is:
\[ 10800 \]"
"To find the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we need to calculate the number of articles each website publishes and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of articles the news website publishes in February:
- The news website publishes an average of 20 articles per day.
- February has 28 days.

So, the total number of articles the news website publishes in February is:
\[ 20 \text{ articles/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 560 \text{ articles} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of articles the sister company publishes in February:
- The sister company publishes an average of 10 articles per day.
- February has 28 days.

So, the total number of articles the sister company publishes in February is:
\[ 10 \text{ articles/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 280 \text{ articles} \]

Now, we add the total number of articles published by both websites in February:
\[ 560 \text{ articles} + 280 \text{ articles} = 840 \text{ articles} \]

So, the total number of articles the two websites published together in February is:
\[ 840 \]"
"First, let's find out how old Steve's wife is. Since Steve is 60 years old and his wife is 4 years older, we can calculate her age as follows:

\[ \text{Steve's wife's age} = \text{Steve's age} + 4 = 60 + 4 = 64 \]

Next, we need to find out how old Steve's son is. The problem states that Steve's son is half as old as his mom. Since Steve's wife (and thus Steve's mom) is 64 years old, we can calculate Steve's son's age as follows:

\[ \text{Steve's son's age} = \frac{\text{Steve's wife's age}}{2} = \frac{64}{2} = 32 \]

Now, we need to find out how old Steve's son's wife is. The problem states that Steve's son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband. Since Steve's son is 32 years old, we can calculate his wife's age as follows:

\[ \text{Steve's son's wife's age} = \text{Steve's son's age} - 3 = 32 - 3 = 29 \]

So, Steve's son's wife is 29 years old. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how much flour is in one bag before it is divided into portions. If one bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, then the total amount of flour in one bag is:

\[ 8 \times 2 = 16 \text{ kilograms} \]

Now, to find out how much flour is in three bags in total, we multiply the amount of flour in one bag by 3:

\[ 16 \times 3 = 48 \text{ kilograms} \]

So, the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions is 48 kilograms."
"First, let's calculate how many miles Alisa biked. We can use the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Alisa:
\[ \text{Speed} = 12 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 4.5 \text{ hours} \]

So,
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Alisa}} = 12 \times 4.5 \]

Now, let's calculate the distance:
\[ 12 \times 4.5 = 12 \times \left(4 + 0.5\right) = 12 \times 4 + 12 \times 0.5 = 48 + 6 = 54 \text{ miles} \]

Next, let's calculate how many miles Stanley biked. Using the same formula:

For Stanley:
\[ \text{Speed} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 2.5 \text{ hours} \]

So,
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Stanley}} = 10 \times 2.5 \]

Now, let's calculate the distance:
\[ 10 \times 2.5 = 10 \times \left(2 + 0.5\right) = 10 \times 2 + 10 \times 0.5 = 20 + 5 = 25 \text{ miles} \]

Now, to find the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley, we add their distances together:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Alisa}} + \text{Distance}_{\text{Stanley}} = 54 + 25 = 79 \text{ miles} \]

So, the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles."
"First, let's figure out how fast Bill can dig through each type of ground.

Bill can dig 4 feet of soil in 1 hour. So, to dig 24 feet of soil, we divide the total feet of soil by the rate of digging through soil:
\[ \text{Time to dig soil} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's find out how fast he can dig through clay. He can dig half as fast through clay as he can through soil, so:
\[ \text{Rate of digging through clay} = \frac{4 \text{ feet/hour}}{2} = 2 \text{ feet/hour} \]

To dig 8 feet of clay, we divide the total feet of clay by the rate of digging through clay:
\[ \text{Time to dig clay} = \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add the time it takes to dig through both the soil and the clay to find the total time:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time to dig soil} + \text{Time to dig clay} = 6 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time it will take Bill to dig the well is 10 hours."
"First, let's figure out how many people are in Howie's class. We know there's Howie, his teacher, and 25 classmates. So, we add these numbers together:

Howie + Teacher + 25 classmates = 1 + 1 + 25 = 27 people

Each of these 27 people will get 2 cupcakes. So, we need to multiply the number of people by the number of cupcakes each person gets:

27 people * 2 cupcakes/person = 54 cupcakes

So, Howie should buy 54 cupcakes."
"First, let's find out how many likes the photo had three weeks after Fishio posted it. We know that after 1 week, she had 2000 likes. Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes. So, we calculate:

\[ 70 \times 2000 = 140000 \]

This means that three weeks after posting, the photo had 140,000 likes. Now, we are told that she received 20000 more new likes recently. So, we add these 20000 likes to the 140,000 likes she had three weeks after posting:

\[ 140000 + 20000 = 160000 \]

So, the total number of likes the photo has now is:

\[ 160000 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the pomegranates Clara bought on Tuesday.

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

She got $2 off because of the voucher, so the final cost for Clara is:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pomegranates Sheila bought on the next day.

The price per pomegranate increased to $30, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount is:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final cost for Sheila is:
\[ 600 - 60 = 540 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila:
\[ 540 - 398 = 142 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:
\[ 142 \text{ dollars} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the sales from green hats in the first month:**
   - The sales from red hats in the first month were $400.
   - The sales from green hats were twice that amount because they were half the total amount from green hats.
   - So, the sales from green hats in the first month were \(400 \times 2 = 800\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total sales for the first month:**
   - The total sales for the first month were the sum of the sales from red and green hats.
   - So, the total sales for the first month were \(400 + 800 = 1200\) dollars.

3. **Determine the sales for the second month:**
   - The sales for the second month were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales of the first month.
   - So, the sales for the second month were \(\frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900\) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total sales for the two months:**
   - The total sales for the two months were the sum of the sales from the first and second months.
   - So, the total sales for the two months were \(1200 + 900 = 2100\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is 2100."
"First, let's break down the time James hires the carriage. He hires it from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is 4 hours in total. But he gets 1 hour free, so he only pays for 3 hours.

The cost for the first hour is $15. The cost for each subsequent hour is twice the cost of the first hour, which means it's $30 for the second hour and $60 for the third hour.

So, the total cost is the sum of the costs for the 3 paid hours:
- First hour: $15
- Second hour: $30
- Third hour: $60

Now, let's add these up:
$15 + $30 + $60 = $105

So, James paid $105 for the carriage service."
"To find out how many dollars were withheld from Sally’s wage, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how much money Sally has in her bank account at the end of the week.
2. Determine how much money Sally should have in her bank account if she had received her full wage.
3. Subtract the amount she should have from the amount she actually has to find out how much was withheld.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Sally's bank account at the end of the week is $420.
2. If Sally had received her full wage of $300, her bank account would have been $200 (initial amount) + $300 (wage) = $520.
3. The amount that was withheld is $520 (what it should be) - $420 (what it actually is) = $100.

So, the amount withheld from Sally’s wage is $100."
"First, let's find out how many deviled egg halves Lori needs in total. Since each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves and she is inviting 16 guests, we multiply 3 by 16:

\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ deviled egg halves} \]

Next, we need to find out how many whole eggs are required. Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2 to find the number of whole eggs:

\[ \frac{48}{2} = 24 \text{ whole eggs} \]

Now, we need to find out how many dozens of eggs Lori needs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, we divide the total number of whole eggs by 12:

\[ \frac{24}{12} = 2 \text{ dozens} \]

So, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs."
"Shiela has already written 1/3 of the 15-page research paper. To find out how many pages she has written, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \text{ pages} \]

So, Shiela has written 5 pages. To find out how many pages she has left to write, we subtract the pages she has already written from the total number of pages:

\[ 15 - 5 = 10 \text{ pages} \]

So, Shiela has 10 pages left to write. The final numerical answer is:

10"
"Mike plans to read 10 pages a day. If the book is 200 pages long, we can find out how many days it will take him to finish by dividing the total number of pages by the number of pages he reads per day.

So, 200 pages ÷ 10 pages/day = 20 days.

Mike will finish his reading 20 days before the deadline."
"First, let's calculate the monthly cost for James to maintain the plane. He pays $5000 a month to rent a hanger and twice that amount on fuel. So, the fuel cost per month is:
\[ 2 \times 5000 = 10000 \]

Now, let's add the hanger cost and the fuel cost to find the total monthly cost:
\[ 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

James pays $15000 a month to get and maintain the plane. To find the total cost for the first year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 (the number of months in a year):
\[ 15000 \times 12 = 180000 \]

So, the total cost for the first year is $180,000."
"First, let's find out how long it took to cook pork. Since it took Finley 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, and it took 30 minutes to cook rice, we can calculate the cooking time for pork as follows:

Cooking time for pork = Cooking time for rice + 20 minutes
Cooking time for pork = 30 minutes + 20 minutes
Cooking time for pork = 50 minutes

Next, we need to find out how long it took to cook beans. The problem states that beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. First, we need to find the combined cooking time of pork and rice:

Combined cooking time of pork and rice = Cooking time for pork + Cooking time for rice
Combined cooking time of pork and rice = 50 minutes + 30 minutes
Combined cooking time of pork and rice = 80 minutes

Now, we can find the cooking time for beans:

Cooking time for beans = 1/2 * Combined cooking time of pork and rice
Cooking time for beans = 1/2 * 80 minutes
Cooking time for beans = 40 minutes

Finally, to find the total cooking time for all the food, we add the cooking times for rice, beans, and pork:

Total cooking time = Cooking time for rice + Cooking time for beans + Cooking time for pork
Total cooking time = 30 minutes + 40 minutes + 50 minutes
Total cooking time = 120 minutes

So, it took Finley 120 minutes to cook all the food."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the almonds and walnuts in each mixture.

For the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- So, the total cost for the first mixture is \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars.

For the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- So, the total cost for the second mixture is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars.

Now, to find out how much more the first mixture costs compared to the second mixture:
- The difference in cost is \( 10 - 7 = 3 \) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is 3 dollars."
"To solve this problem, let's use the information given:

- Each sheep has 4 legs and 1 head.
- Each goose has 2 legs and 1 head.
- The total number of animal heads is 20.
- The total number of animal legs is 70.

Let's denote the number of sheep as \( S \) and the number of geese as \( G \).

From the information given, we can write two equations:
1. The total number of heads: \( S + G = 20 \)
2. The total number of legs: \( 4S + 2G = 70 \)

We can solve these equations step by step. First, let's solve the first equation for \( G \):
\[ G = 20 - S \]

Now, substitute \( G \) in the second equation:
\[ 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]
\[ 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ 2S + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2S = 30 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is 15.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered in a day.

So, we do the following calculation:

Total newspapers delivered = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers delivered - Newspapers delivered to District A - Newspapers delivered to District C

Let's do the math:

Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - 198 - 209

First, subtract the newspapers to District A from the total:

600 - 198 = 402

Then, subtract the newspapers to District C from the result:

402 - 209 = 193

So, James delivers 193 newspapers to District B.

The final numerical answer is 193."
"First, let's calculate the total number of class hours John attends. The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time. So, the number of hours per week is:

\[ 4 \text{ times/week} \times 2 \text{ hours/time} = 8 \text{ hours/week} \]

The class lasts for 6 weeks, so the total number of hours John spends in class is:

"First, we need to find out how many history teachers there are. We know that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers. To find this number, we calculate:

\[ 60\% \text{ of } 150 = \frac{60}{100} \times 150 = 0.60 \times 150 = 90 \]

So, there are 90 history teachers. Since the rest of the teachers are math teachers, we can find the number of math teachers by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[ 150 - 90 = 60 \]

So, there are 60 math teachers. Each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day, we multiply the number of math teachers by the number of hours each teacher sleeps:

\[ 60 \times 6 = 360 \]

So, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 360 hours."
"First, let's find out how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120, we can calculate Kassidy's money as follows:

\[ \text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \]

Now, we know that Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's money as:

\[ \text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \]

Now we have the amounts of money each person has:
- Aurelia has $120
- Kassidy has $90
- Rayna has $150

To find out how much money they would have if they added together their money and shared it equally, we first add their money:

\[ \text{Total money} = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 \]

"To find out how many good days are left in the month, we need to subtract the days that are not good from the total number of days.

Christina had twelve good days in total over thirty days. Out of these, the first eight days were good, the next eight days were bad, and the last eight days were neutral. So, we can calculate the remaining good days as follows:

Total good days = 12
Good days in the first eight days = 8
Good days in the last eight days (neutral and bad) = 0 (since we don't know how many were bad yet)

So, the remaining good days are:
Remaining good days = Total good days - Good days in the first eight days
Remaining good days = 12 - 8
Remaining good days = 4

Now, we are told that the next three days were good, neutral, and good. So, we add these to the remaining good days:
Remaining good days + Good days in the next three days = 4 + 2 = 6

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is 6."
"To solve this, let's use the information given:

1. Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has.
2. Janey has 21 books.

Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \).

According to the first piece of information, we can write the equation:
\[ \text{Janey's books} = 2 \times S + 3 \]

We know Janey has 21 books, so we can substitute 21 for Janey's books in the equation:
\[ 21 = 2 \times S + 3 \]

Now, we need to solve for \( S \):
\[ 21 - 3 = 2 \times S \]
\[ 18 = 2 \times S \]
\[ S = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

The final numerical answer is:
9"
"First, we need to convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches because the growth rate is given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot.

So, 20 feet = 20 * 12 inches = 240 inches.

The bamboo grows 30 inches a day. We need to find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches.

The total growth needed is 600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches.

If the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, then the number of days required to grow 360 inches is:

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days.

So, the final numerical answer is 12 days."
"First, let's figure out how many toys James needs for the initial 4 dogs. Since each dog needs one toy, and he currently has 4 toys for 4 dogs, he already has enough toys for the 4 dogs.

Now, there are 8 more dogs in the shelter. So, James needs 8 more toys for these 8 dogs. That means he needs 8 toys.

After buying the toys for the 8 dogs, James went back to see that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left. This means there are now 8 * 2 = 16 more dogs in the shelter.

So, James needs 16 more toys for these 16 dogs.

When James came back again, 3 dogs were gone, so he no longer needed those toys. This means he can remove the 3 toys he bought for the 16 dogs.

So, the total number of toys James needs is the sum of the toys he needs for the 8 dogs and the 16 dogs minus the 3 toys he no longer needs.

Total toys needed = 8 + 16 - 3 = 21 toys.

So, the final numerical answer is 21 toys."
"First, let's find out how much Dylan invested. Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount, which is $1200.

\[ \text{Dylan's investment} = \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = \frac{2 \times 1200}{5} = \frac{2400}{5} = 480 \]

So, Dylan invested $480. Now, let's find out how much money was left after Dylan's investment.

\[ \text{Remaining amount after Dylan} = 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

Next, Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount.

\[ \text{Frances's investment} = \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = \frac{2 \times 720}{3} = \frac{1440}{3} = 480 \]

So, Frances invested $480. Now, let's find out how much money was left after Frances's investment.

\[ \text{Remaining amount after Frances} = 720 - 480 = 240 \]

Skyler's investment accounted for the rest of the money, which is $240.

So, Skyler's investment was $240."
"First, let's find out how many signatures Carol and Jennifer have collected so far. Carol has 20 signatures and Jennifer has 44 signatures. So together, they have:

20 + 44 = 64 signatures

They want to reach a total of 100 signatures. To find out how many more signatures they need to collect, we subtract the number of signatures they already have from their goal:

100 - 64 = 36 signatures

So, Carol and Jennifer need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal of 100 signatures."
"First, let's find out how much Karen earns per hour. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns:

\[ 10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much Karen earns in one day if she works 3 hours. So, we multiply her hourly wage by the number of hours she works in a day:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ dollars per day} \]

Now, we need to find out how much Karen earns in two days. We multiply her daily earnings by 2:

\[ 60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 120 \]"
"To solve this, we first need to find out how many hash browns one potato can make. If 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, then:

\[ \text{Hash browns per potato} = \frac{36 \text{ hash browns}}{6 \text{ potatoes}} = 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} \]

Now, if we have 96 potatoes, we can calculate the total number of hash browns by multiplying the number of potatoes by the number of hash browns one potato can make:

\[ \text{Total hash browns} = 96 \text{ potatoes} \times 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} = 576 \text{ hash browns} \]

So, you can make 576 hash browns out of 96 potatoes."
"First, let's find out the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults.

An adult weighs an average of 80 kg. So, the weight of 8 adults is:
\[ 80 \, \text{kg/adult} \times 8 \, \text{adults} = 640 \, \text{kg} \]

Now, let's add Jack's weight to this total. Jack weighs the same as an average adult, so:
\[ 640 \, \text{kg} + 80 \, \text{kg} = 720 \, \text{kg} \]

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg. To find out by how much they will exceed the maximum load, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight:
\[ 720 \, \text{kg} - 700 \, \text{kg} = 20 \, \text{kg} \]

So, they will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg."
"First, let's find out how many cookies Max has. We know that Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, and Katarina has 68 cookies. So, if we add 5 to 68, we get the number of cookies Max has:

\[ 68 + 5 = 73 \]

So, Max has 73 cookies.

Next, we need to find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has. We know that Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster. So, if we subtract 12 from 73, we get the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has:

\[ 73 - 12 = 61 \]

So, the Cookie Monster has 61 cookies.

Now, we need to find out how many cookies Summer has. We know that Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. So, if we add 23 to 73, we get the number of cookies Summer has:

\[ 73 + 23 = 96 \]

So, Summer has 96 cookies.

Now, to find the total number of cookies they all have, we add the number of cookies each person has:

\[ 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 \]

Let's add these numbers step by step:

\[ 68 + 73 = 141 \]
\[ 141 + 61 = 202 \]
\[ 202 + 96 = 298 \]

So, the total number of cookies they have is:

\[ 298 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say the original length of the dress is \( x \) cm.
2. Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, so the new length after extension is \( x + 0.5x = 1.5x \).
3. She then adds 20 cm to the bottom of the dress with a lace trim. So, the final length of the dress is \( 1.5x + 20 \).
4. We know the final length is 140 cm. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   1.5x + 20 = 140
   \]
5. Now, let's solve for \( x \):
   \[
   1.5x + 20 = 140
   \]
   Subtract 20 from both sides:
   \[
   1.5x = 120
   \]
   Divide both sides by 1.5:
   \[
   x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80
   \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

The final numerical answer is:
80"
"First, let's understand the speeds in minutes:
- In ""turtle"" mode, Chris takes 60 minutes to mow the entire lawn.
- In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris takes 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn.

Chris mows half of the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and the other half in ""rabbit"" mode. So, he mows 30 minutes in ""turtle"" mode and 20 minutes in ""rabbit"" mode.

Now, let's add the time he spent mowing:
- Time spent in ""turtle"" mode: 30 minutes
- Time spent in ""rabbit"" mode: 20 minutes

Total time spent mowing the lawn is:
30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes

So, the final numerical answer is 50 minutes."
"First, let's add up the time it takes for John and Jack to get to the library and then to the fire station.

Time to library: 6 minutes
Time to fire station: 13 minutes

Total time spent: 6 + 13 = 19 minutes

They have 30 minutes in total to get to school. So, to find out how much longer they have to get to school without being late, we subtract the time they've already spent from the total time they have.

Time left: 30 - 19 = 11 minutes

So, they have 11 more minutes to get to school without being late."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of fruit Catherine bought:

- Apples: 1 kilo at $4 per kilo.
- Bananas: 2 kilos at $2 per kilo.
- Oranges: 2 kilos at $3 per kilo.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for each type of fruit:

- Cost of apples = 1 kilo * $4/kilo = $4
- Cost of bananas = 2 kilos * $2/kilo = $4
- Cost of oranges = 2 kilos * $3/kilo = $6

Now, let's add up the total cost:

Total cost = Cost of apples + Cost of bananas + Cost of oranges
Total cost = $4 + $4 + $6 = $14

So, Catherine pays a total of $14."
"First, let's find out how many cookies Celinda bakes. Since Celinda bakes twice as many cookies as Greta, and Greta bakes 30 cookies, Celinda bakes:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Now, let's add the cookies baked by Greta and Celinda together:

\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, they eat 10 cookies while they are cooling. So, we subtract the 10 cookies they ate from the total:

\[ 90 - 10 = 80 \text{ cookies} \]

Therefore, the number of cookies in the box is:

\[ 80 \]"
"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We have one set of twins and one set of triplets. Let's call the age of one twin \( T \) and the age of one triplet \( Tr \).

2. According to the problem, one twin is 7 years older than one triplet. So, we can write this as:
   \[
   T = Tr + 7
   \]

3. We also know that the combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44. Since there is one twin and one triplet, we can write this as:
   \[
   T + Tr = 44
   \]

4. Now we have two equations:
   \[
   T = Tr + 7
   \]
   \[
   T + Tr = 44
   \]

5. We can substitute the first equation into the second equation. Replace \( T \) in the second equation with \( Tr + 7 \):
   \[
   (Tr + 7) + Tr = 44
   \]

6. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   2Tr + 7 = 44
   \]

7. Subtract 7 from both sides:
   \[
   2Tr = 37
   \]

8. Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   Tr = 18.5
   \]

9. Now that we know the age of the triplet, we can find the age of the twin. Using the first equation:
   \[
   T = Tr + 7 = 18.5 + 7 = 25.5
   \]

So, one of the twins is 25.5 years old."
"First, let's add up the time John needs to finish his homework:
- Math homework: 20 minutes
- Reading homework: 40 minutes
- History homework: 20 minutes

So, the total time for homework is:
20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, 3 hours is equal to:
3 * 60 = 180 minutes

Now, to find out how many minutes John has left for a nap, we subtract the time he spends on homework from the total time he has before dinner:
180 minutes (total time before dinner) - 80 minutes (time for homework) = 100 minutes

So, John has 100 minutes to nap."
"First, let's find out the cost of one candy. We know that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for $3.20, and each lollipop costs $0.40. So, the cost of five lollipops is:

\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

This means the cost of four candies is:

\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

So, the cost of one candy is:

\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Now, we need to find out the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:

\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

And the cost of 10 candies is:

\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

So, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:

\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 7.00 \]"
"First, let's find out how many coins Rong saves in a year. Since Rong saves 20 coins every month, in a year (which has 12 months), he saves:

\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 240 \text{ coins/year} \]

Now, let's find out how many coins Neil saves in a year. Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong. So, Neil saves:

\[ 240 \text{ coins/year} + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 240 \text{ coins/year} \right) = 240 \text{ coins/year} + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 240 \right) \text{ coins/year} \]

\[ = 240 \text{ coins/year} + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 240 \right) \text{ coins/year} = 240 \text{ coins/year} + 96 \text{ coins/year} = 336 \text{ coins/year} \]

Now, let's find out how many coins they have together after 10 years. Rong saves 240 coins per year, so in 10 years, he will have:

\[ 240 \text{ coins/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Neil saves 336 coins per year, so in 10 years, he will have:

\[ 336 \text{ coins/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Adding the coins they both have after 10 years:

\[ 2400 \text{ coins} + 3360 \text{ coins} = 5760 \text{ coins} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 5760 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, and each vaccine costs $20. So, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find the cost of the heartworm check. We know that the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill by \( T \). Therefore, the cost of the heartworm check is \( 0.60 \times T \).

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + 0.60 \times T \]

To find \( T \), we need to solve this equation. First, we isolate \( T \) on one side of the equation:
\[ T - 0.60 \times T = 40 \]
\[ 0.40 \times T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, let's find out how much one banana costs. Since one apple costs $0.5 and a banana costs twice as much as an apple, one banana costs:
\[ 0.5 \times 2 = \$1 \]

Next, we know that oranges cost three times as much as a banana. So, one orange costs:
\[ 1 \times 3 = \$3 \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost for one crate of fruit. A crate consists of 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges. So, the total cost for the bananas is:
\[ 5 \times 1 = \$5 \]

The total cost for the apples is:
\[ 12 \times 0.5 = \$6 \]

And the total cost for the oranges is:
\[ 7 \times 3 = \$21 \]

Adding these together gives the total price for the crate:
\[ 5 + 6 + 21 = \$32 \]

So, the price for such a crate of fruit is:
\[ \$32 \]"
"First, let's find out how many squares of each color there are:

- Blue squares: 14 (red squares) + 4 = 18
- Green squares: 18 (blue squares) + 6 = 24
- White squares: 24 (green squares) - 12 = 12

Now, let's add up all the squares to find the total number of squares on the comforter:

Total squares = Red squares + Blue squares + Green squares + White squares
Total squares = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12
Total squares = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is equal to the total number of squares. Therefore, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet."
"First, let's find out how many chairs Mia currently has. We know that there are 8 high chairs and the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. So, the number of regular chairs is:

\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

Now, we know that Mia needs chairs for 42 adults and 15 babies, which means she needs a total of:

\[ 42 + 15 = 57 \]

chairs. Since she currently has 40 chairs, the number of additional chairs she needs to get is:

\[ 57 - 40 = 17 \]

So, Mia has to get 17 more chairs. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how many deer are bucks. Since 50 percent of the deer are bucks, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Number of bucks} = 50\% \times 50 = 0.50 \times 50 = 25 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these bucks are 8 points. Since 20 percent of the bucks are 8 points, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Number of 8 point bucks} = 20\% \times 25 = 0.20 \times 25 = 5 \]

So, the number of 8 point bucks is 5."
"First, let's find out how many points Betty collected. Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. Adam has 50 points, so:

\[ \text{Betty's points} = 50 + (50 \times 0.30) = 50 + 15 = 65 \]

Next, we need to find out how many points Tom collected. Tom has 30 points less than Betty:

\[ \text{Tom's points} = 65 - 30 = 35 \]

Now, we need to find out how many points Martha collected. Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom:

\[ \text{Martha's points} = 35 \times 3 = 105 \]

Now we can add up all the points collected by Adam, Martha, Betty, and Tom:

\[ \text{Total points} = 50 + 105 + 65 + 35 = 255 \]

The minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points. So, the class is missing:

3. Each of these 9 grandchildren has 3 great grand-babies.
   - So, the total number of great grand-babies is \(9 \times 3 = 27\).

Therefore, the number of great grand-babies at the family reunion is 27."
"First, let's find out how much Greta puts into her retirement account. She puts 50% of her $2400.00 paycheck into her retirement account.

\[ \text{Amount for retirement} = 2400 \times \frac{50}{100} = 2400 \times 0.50 = 1200 \]

Next, we calculate how much she uses for her car payment. She uses 20% of her $2400.00 paycheck for her car payment.

\[ \text{Amount for car payment} = 2400 \times \frac{20}{100} = 2400 \times 0.20 = 480 \]

Now, we subtract the amounts she put into her retirement account and the amount she used for her car payment from her total paycheck to find out how much money she has left.

\[ \text{Money left} = 2400 - 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

So, the final amount of money Greta has left to spend is $720."

"First, let's find out how many people are in the group. Aiden and his 12 friends are 13 people, and they meet up with 7 more friends. So, the total number of people is:
\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

Each person gets one seat, two drinks, and three snacks. Since each drink and each snack costs $2, we can calculate the cost for each person's drinks and snacks.

For drinks:
\[ 2 \text{ drinks/person} \times 2 \text{ dollars/drink} = 4 \text{ dollars/person} \]

For snacks:
\[ 3 \text{ snacks/person} \times 2 \text{ dollars/snack} = 6 \text{ dollars/person} \]

So, the total cost for drinks and snacks for one person is:
\[ 4 \text{ dollars} + 6 \text{ dollars} = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Since there are 20 people in the group, the total cost for all the drinks and snacks is:
\[ 20 \text{ people} \times 10 \text{ dollars/person} = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the group has spent a total of:
\[ \boxed{200} \] dollars on snacks and drinks."
"First, let's find out how much gravel Gordy's truck can haul. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, we can calculate Gordy's truck capacity as follows:

Gordy's truck capacity = Gissela's truck capacity + 800 pounds
Gordy's truck capacity = 4,000 pounds + 800 pounds
Gordy's truck capacity = 4,800 pounds

Now, we know that when Gissela, Gordy, and Gary bring their trucks together, they can haul a total of 11,600 pounds. We can use this information to find out how much gravel Gary's truck can carry. Let's denote Gary's truck capacity as G.

The total capacity of all three trucks is:
Gissela's truck capacity + Gordy's truck capacity + Gary's truck capacity = Total capacity
4,000 pounds + 4,800 pounds + G = 11,600 pounds

Now, we solve for G:
4,000 + 4,800 + G = 11,600
8,800 + G = 11,600
G = 11,600 - 8,800
G = 2,800 pounds

So, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

The final numerical answer is 2,800."
"If each female ate 3 dumplings and there are 6 females, then the total number of dumplings eaten by the females is:
\[ 3 \times 6 = 18 \]

Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, each male ate:
\[ 3 + 1 = 4 \]
dumplings. There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is:
\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Adding the dumplings eaten by the males and the females gives the total number of dumplings cooked:
\[ 18 + 32 = 50 \]

So, Larry cooked a total of 50 dumplings."
"First, we need to find out how much money Gerald and Julia each received from the $100.

The total ratio is 3 + 2 = 5 parts.

Gerald's share is 3 parts out of 5, so we calculate:
\[ \text{Gerald's share} = \frac{3}{5} \times 100 = 60 \]

Julia's share is 2 parts out of 5, so we calculate:
\[ \text{Julia's share} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

Now, Gerald spent $10 on a book, so we subtract that from his share:
\[ \text{Gerald's money left} = 60 - 10 = 50 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 50 \]"
"First, we need to find out how fast the turtle is. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, we divide the cat's speed by 5 to find the turtle's speed.

Cat's speed = 15 feet/second
Turtle's speed = Cat's speed / 5 = 15 / 5 = 3 feet/second

Now, we need to find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. We multiply the turtle's speed by the time.

Turtle's distance = Turtle's speed * Time = 3 feet/second * 40 seconds = 120 feet

So, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"First, let's find out how much money the firefighters have raised per hour. They raised $2100 in 3 hours, so we divide $2100 by 3 to find out how much they raise each hour.

\[ \text{Money raised per hour} = \frac{\$2100}{3 \text{ hours}} = \$700 \text{ per hour} \]

Now, we know their goal is to raise $6300. They have already raised $2100, so we need to find out how much more they need to raise.

\[ \text{Amount still needed} = \$6300 - \$2100 = \$4200 \]

Since they raise $700 per hour, we need to find out how many hours it will take to raise the remaining $4200.

\[ \text{Hours needed} = \frac{\$4200}{\$700 \text{ per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

So, they need to raise for a total of 3 hours (already raised) + 6 hours (remaining) = 9 hours.

The final numerical answer is 9 hours."
"First, let's find out what percentage of the Colorado River's water is used for industrial purposes by Colorado City. Since Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River and 80% of that water is used for industrial purposes, we can calculate the industrial use as follows:

\[ \text{Industrial use} = 40\% \times 80\% = 0.40 \times 0.80 = 0.32 \]

So, 32% of the Colorado River's total water is used for industrial purposes by Colorado City.

Now, to find out what percentage of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the industrial use percentage from the total use percentage:

\[ \text{Non-industrial use} = 40\% - 32\% = 8\% \]

So, 8% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes."
"To find out how much Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we first need to calculate how much she charges for one week and then multiply that by 2.

Alex charges $12 per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the cost for one week is:
\[ 12 \text{ dollars/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 84 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Now, to find out the cost for 2 weeks, we multiply the weekly cost by 2:
\[ 84 \text{ dollars/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 168 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 168 \]"
"First, let's find out how much ice cream the factory makes per hour.

For chocolate ice cream:
- 100 quarts in 2 hours means the factory makes 100/2 = 50 quarts per hour.

For vanilla ice cream:
- 50 quarts in 4 hours means the factory makes 50/4 = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, let's calculate how much ice cream the factory can make in 48 hours.

For chocolate ice cream in 48 hours:
- 50 quarts per hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts.

For vanilla ice cream in 48 hours:
- 12.5 quarts per hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts.

Finally, to find the total quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours:
- 2400 quarts (chocolate) + 600 quarts (vanilla) = 3000 quarts.

So, the final numerical answer is 3000 quarts."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of baked good:

- Croissants: 5 croissants at $3.00 each = 5 * $3.00 = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each = 4 * $2.50 = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches at $4.00 each = 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each = 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:

Total cost = Cost of croissants + Cost of cinnamon rolls + Cost of mini quiches + Cost of blueberry muffins
Total cost = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00
Total cost = $40.00

Marcus gets a 10% discount on his purchase. To find out how much the discount is, we calculate 10% of $40.00:

Discount = 10% of $40.00 = 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Marcus has to pay:

Final total = Total cost - Discount
Final total = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

So, Marcus' total bill is $36.00."
"First, let's understand the deal: for every 2 scoops you buy, you get 1 scoop for free. This means for every 3 scoops, you only pay for 2.

Each scoop costs $1.50.

Erin has $6.00.

To find out how many scoops she can get, we need to divide her money by the cost per scoop:
\[ \text{Number of scoops she can buy} = \frac{\text{Erin's money}}{\text{Cost per scoop}} = \frac{6.00}{1.50} = 4 \]

Now, since for every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 free, we need to see how many sets of 3 scoops she can get with her $6.00.

For every 3 scoops, she pays for 2 scoops:
\[ \text{Cost for 3 scoops} = 2 \times 1.50 = 3.00 \]

With $6.00, she can buy:
\[ \text{Number of sets of 3 scoops} = \frac{6.00}{3.00} = 2 \]

So, she can get 2 sets of 3 scoops, which means:
\[ \text{Total scoops} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

Therefore, Erin should buy 6 scoops of ice cream."
"First, let's find out how much candy Ginger eats in two weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so in two weeks, there are 14 days. Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy each day, so in 14 days, she eats:

\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Since Ginger started with 100 pieces, after eating 56 pieces, she has:

\[ 100 - 56 = 44 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, let's find out how much candy Amy eats in two weeks. Amy eats 3 pieces of candy each day, so in 14 days, she eats:

\[ 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Since Amy started with 100 pieces, after eating 42 pieces, she has:

\[ 100 - 42 = 58 \text{ pieces} \]

To find out how much more candy Amy has than Ginger after two weeks, we subtract the number of pieces Ginger has from the number of pieces Amy has:

\[ 58 - 44 = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger after two weeks."
"First, we need to find out what two thirds of Mr. Boarden's bathroom is. His bathroom is 36 square feet, so we calculate:

\[ \text{Two thirds of 36 sq ft} = \frac{2}{3} \times 36 = 24 \text{ sq ft} \]

Now, we know that for every square foot, Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles. So, for 24 square feet, he would need:

\[ 24 \text{ sq ft} \times 24 \text{ tiles/sq ft} = 576 \text{ tiles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 576."
"First, let's calculate how much James spent picking the blueberries.

He had to pay a flat fee of $20 to go picking. Then, for 30 pounds of blueberries, he paid $1.5 per pound. So, the cost for the blueberries is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.5 \text{ per pound} = \$45 \]

Adding the flat fee to the cost of the blueberries gives the total cost James spent:
\[ \$20 + \$45 = \$65 \]

Next, let's calculate how much it would cost James to buy the same 30 pounds of blueberries at the store at $2.5 per pound:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.5 \text{ per pound} = \$75 \]

Now, to find out how much James saved by picking the blueberries himself, we subtract the amount he spent from the amount he would have spent buying them at the store:
\[ \$75 - \$65 = \$10 \]

So, James saved $10 by picking the blueberries himself compared to buying them at the store."
"First, let's find out the new price of each computer. The original price was $700, and it increased by 10%. To find the new price, we calculate 10% of $700 and add it to the original price.

10% of $700 is calculated as:
\[ 0.10 \times 700 = 70 \]

So, the new price of each computer is:
\[ 700 + 70 = 770 \]

Now, the company wanted to buy 500 computers at the new price of $770 each. To find the total amount of money they paid, we multiply the new price by the number of computers:

\[ 770 \times 500 = 385000 \]

So, the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices is $385,000."
"First, let's calculate the calories from the eggs. John uses 6 eggs, and each egg is 75 calories. So, the total calories from eggs are:
\[ 6 \text{ eggs} \times 75 \text{ calories/egg} = 450 \text{ calories} \]

Next, let's calculate the calories from the cheese. John uses 2 oz of cheese, and each ounce of cheese is 120 calories. So, the total calories from cheese are:
\[ 2 \text{ oz} \times 120 \text{ calories/oz} = 240 \text{ calories} \]

Now, let's calculate the calories from the ham. John uses 2 oz of ham, and each ounce of ham is 40 calories. So, the total calories from ham are:
\[ 2 \text{ oz} \times 40 \text{ calories/oz} = 80 \text{ calories} \]

Finally, let's add up all the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham to get the total calories in the omelet:
\[ 450 \text{ calories} + 240 \text{ calories} + 80 \text{ calories} = 770 \text{ calories} \]

So, the total number of calories in the omelet is 770 calories."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the pencils. Since each pencil costs $0.50 and you bought 6 pencils, the total cost for the pencils is:
\[ 0.50 \times 6 = 3.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the erasers. Since each eraser costs $0.25 and you bought 8 erasers, the total cost for the erasers is:
\[ 0.25 \times 8 = 2.00 \]

Now, let's find the total cost of all the items you bought by adding the cost of the pencils and the cost of the erasers:
\[ 3.00 + 2.00 = 5.00 \]

You paid $10 for all the items. To find out how much change you would get, subtract the total cost from the amount you paid:
\[ 10.00 - 5.00 = 5.00 \]

So, the change you would get is $5.00."
"First, let's find out how many people receive interviews. If 30% of the 100 people receive interviews, we calculate:

\[ 100 \times 0.30 = 30 \]

So, 30 people receive interviews.

Next, we find out how many of those who receive interviews get a job offer. If 20% of the 30 people who receive interviews get a job offer, we calculate:

\[ 30 \times 0.20 = 6 \]

So, 6 people get a job offer.

Now, we need to find out how many of those who get a job offer accept the position. If a third of the 6 people who get a job offer accept the position, we calculate:

\[ 6 \times \frac{1}{3} = 2 \]

So, 2 people accept the position.

The final numerical answer is 2."
"First, let's find out how many sacks Goldy gave away in total. She gave 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother, so:

3 sacks + 4 sacks = 7 sacks

Now, we know that each sack contains 25 kilograms of rice. To find out how many kilograms she gave away, we multiply the number of sacks she gave away by the weight of each sack:

7 sacks * 25 kilograms/sack = 175 kilograms

So, the final numerical answer is 175 kilograms."
"First, let's find out how many boxes of cereal Castle bought this week. She bought 3 boxes of Coco Crunch and 5 boxes of Fruit Loops, so:

3 boxes + 5 boxes = 8 boxes

Last week, she bought 4 boxes of cereal.

Now, to find out how many more boxes she bought this week than last week, we subtract the number of boxes she bought last week from the number she bought this week:

8 boxes - 4 boxes = 4 boxes

So, Castle bought 4 more boxes of cereal this week than last week. The final numerical answer is:

4"
"First, let's calculate the number of taps Helga makes when she is dancing with both hands at her sides.

She taps her right foot at 300 taps per minute and her left foot at 250 taps per minute. So, the total number of taps per minute when both hands are at her sides is:
\[ 300 + 250 = 550 \text{ taps per minute} \]

Since she dances for 5 minutes, the total number of taps when both hands are at her sides is:
\[ 550 \times 5 = 2750 \text{ taps} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of taps she makes when she raises her arms.

When her arms are raised, she taps her right foot at 200 taps per minute and her left foot at 200 taps per minute. So, the total number of taps per minute when her arms are raised is:
\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ taps per minute} \]

Since she raises her arms for 2 minutes, the total number of taps when her arms are raised is:
\[ 400 \times 2 = 800 \text{ taps} \]

Now, we add the taps from both scenarios to get the combined total number of taps:
\[ 2750 + 800 = 3550 \]

So, the combined total number of times that she taps both of her feet is:
\[ 3550 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost if Ron fixes the pothole himself.

The fine for unauthorized road maintenance is $120.
The cost of 3 buckets of asphalt is $25 per bucket, so for 3 buckets it would be:
\[ 3 \times 25 = 75 \]

Now, we add the fine and the cost of the asphalt:
\[ 120 + 75 = 195 \]

The damage to his car if the pothole is not fixed is $450.

To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we subtract the total cost of fixing the pothole from the potential damage to his car:
\[ 450 - 195 = 255 \]

So, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole himself."
"First, let's find out how many normal chairs are left after some were sent to the carpenter. The restaurant originally had 170 normal chairs, and 20 of them were sent for repair. So, the number of normal chairs left is:

170 - 20 = 150 normal chairs

Next, let's find out how many baby chairs are left after some were sent to the carpenter. The restaurant originally had 23 baby chairs, and 13 of them were sent for repair. So, the number of baby chairs left is:

23 - 13 = 10 baby chairs

Now, to find the total number of chairs left in the restaurant, we add the number of normal chairs left to the number of baby chairs left:

150 normal chairs + 10 baby chairs = 160 chairs

So, the restaurant has 160 chairs left."
"First, let's figure out how many slices of pizza each person ate.

Bryce and his two friends each ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, each of them ate:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \text{ slices} \]

So, Bryce and his two friends together ate:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ slices} \]

The two remaining friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas. So each of them ate:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9 \text{ slices} \]

So, the two remaining friends together ate:
\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's add up the total number of slices eaten by all four friends:
\[ 24 + 18 = 42 \text{ slices} \]

Since each pizza has 12 slices and there are 4 pizzas, the total number of slices is:
\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ slices} \]

To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices:
\[ 48 - 42 = 6 \text{ slices} \]

So, the number of slices of pizza left is:
\[ 6 \]"
"First, let's find out how long it takes the dog to eat the sausages. The cat takes 30 minutes to eat 9 sausages. The dog takes 2/3 of the time the cat takes, so we calculate:

\[ \text{Time for dog} = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find the average time both the cat and the dog take to eat the sausages. To do this, we add the time it takes for the cat and the dog to eat the sausages and then divide by 2:

\[ \text{Average time} = \frac{\text{Time for cat} + \text{Time for dog}}{2} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 25 \text{ minutes} \]"
"First, let's convert Topher's shoe length to inches only. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, Topher's shoe length of 8-feet and 4-inches is:

\[ 8 \times 12 + 4 = 96 + 4 = 100 \text{ inches} \]

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of Bobby's shoe as \( x \) inches. Then, we can write the equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches. Let's confirm this by plugging it back into the original equation:

\[ 9 \times 10 + 10 = 90 + 10 = 100 \]

The equation holds true, so the length of one of Bobby's shoes is indeed 10 inches. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of windows in the students' cars and teachers' cars.

For the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars.
- Each car has 4 windows.
- So, the total number of windows in the students' cars is \(64 \times 4 = 256\) windows.

For the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each car has 2 windows.
- So, the total number of windows in the teachers' cars is \(32 \times 2 = 64\) windows.

Now, let's calculate how many windows Hannah smashes.

For the students' cars:
- She smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.
- A quarter of 256 windows is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64\) windows.

For the teachers' cars:
- She smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows.
- 3/4ths of 64 windows is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48\) windows.

Now, let's add the number of windows smashed from both types of cars:
- Total windows smashed = 64 (from students' cars) + 48 (from teachers' cars) = 112 windows.

So, the final numerical answer is 112."
"First, let's find out the total number of spools of thread Candy has.

She has:
- 15 light blue spools
- 45 dark blue spools
- 40 light green spools
- 50 dark green spools

To find the total number of spools, we add these numbers together:
15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150 spools

Next, we need to find out how many of these spools are blue. Since blue spools can be either light blue or dark blue, we add the light blue spools to the dark blue spools:
15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60 blue spools

Now, to find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplifying the fraction:
\[ \frac{60}{150} = \frac{2}{5} \]

Now, we calculate the percentage:
\[ \left( \frac{2}{5} \right) \times 100 = 40\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
40%"
"First, let's find out how many people had voted by midday. Since 2/5 of the people had voted by midday, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{People who voted by midday} = \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000 \]

So, the number of people who had not voted by midday is:

\[ \text{People who had not voted by midday} = 5000 - 2000 = 3000 \]

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. The remaining people after midday are 3000. So, the number of people who voted by 16:00 is:

\[ \text{People who voted by 16:00} = \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000 \]

Therefore, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is:

\[ \text{People who had not voted by 16:00} = 3000 - 2000 = 1000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 1000."
"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need for 30 days, we first need to calculate how many pieces of gum he will chew in 30 days.

Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day, so in 30 days he will chew:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we need to find out how many packs of gum he will need. Each pack contains 15 pieces of gum. To find the number of packs needed, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces per pack:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ pieces}}{15 \text{ pieces/pack}} = 8 \text{ packs} \]

So, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"First, let's find out how many smores are needed in total. There are 9 kids and each wants 2 smores, so:
\[ 9 \text{ kids} \times 2 \text{ smores per kid} = 18 \text{ smores} \]

There are 6 adults and each will eat 1 smore, so:
\[ 6 \text{ adults} \times 1 \text{ smore per adult} = 6 \text{ smores} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of smores needed:
\[ 18 \text{ smores} + 6 \text{ smores} = 24 \text{ smores} \]

Each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large smores. To find out how many sleeves are needed for 24 smores, we divide the total number of smores by the number of smores per sleeve:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ smores}}{8 \text{ smores per sleeve}} = 3 \text{ sleeves} \]

Since each box contains 3 sleeves, they will need:
\[ \frac{3 \text{ sleeves}}{3 \text{ sleeves per box}} = 1 \text{ box} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 1 \]"
"First, let's find out how old Dora's father is. The problem states that Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. Since Dora is 15 years old, we can calculate her father's age as follows:

Father's age = 2 * Dora's age + 8
Father's age = 2 * 15 + 8
Father's age = 30 + 8
Father's age = 38

Now, we know Dora's mother is four years younger than her father. So, we can calculate her mother's age as:

Mother's age = Father's age - 4
Mother's age = 38 - 4
Mother's age = 34

Now, to find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we add their ages together:

Total age = Dora's age + Father's age + Mother's age
Total age = 15 + 38 + 34
Total age = 87

So, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is 87 years."
"To find out how much money each person gets, we need to divide the total amount of money by the number of people sharing it. Greg and his 3 siblings make a total of 4 people.

- Math book: 2 pounds
- Science book: 2 pounds
- French book: 4 pounds
- English book: 3 pounds
- History book: 2 times the weight of the English book, which is 2 * 3 = 6 pounds

Now, let's add up the weights of all the books:

2 (math) + 2 (science) + 4 (French) + 3 (English) + 6 (History) = 17 pounds

So, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is 17 pounds."
"First, let's find out how many votes candidate B got. Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A. Since candidate A got 20% of the votes, we can calculate candidate B's votes as follows:

Candidate B's votes = Candidate A's votes + 50% of Candidate A's votes
Candidate B's votes = 20% + 0.5 * 20%
Candidate B's votes = 20% + 10%
Candidate B's votes = 30%

Now, we know that the total number of votes is 100. So, we can calculate the votes for candidate C by subtracting the votes for candidates A and B from the total votes:

Votes for candidate C = Total votes - (Votes for candidate A + Votes for candidate B)
Votes for candidate C = 100 - (20 + 30)
Votes for candidate C = 100 - 50
Votes for candidate C = 50

So, candidate C got 50 votes."
"First, let's find out how many apples Beck has initially. Since Boris has 100 apples and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, we can calculate the number of apples Beck has as follows:

Beck's apples = Boris's apples - 23
Beck's apples = 100 - 23
Beck's apples = 77

Now, if Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Boris will have:

Boris's new apples = Boris's original apples - 10
Boris's new apples = 100 - 10
Boris's new apples = 90

And Beck will have:

Beck's new apples = Beck's original apples + 10
Beck's new apples = 77 + 10
Beck's new apples = 87

To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we subtract Beck's new number of apples from Boris's new number of apples:

Fewer apples = Boris's new apples - Beck's new apples
Fewer apples = 90 - 87
Fewer apples = 3

So, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now."
"First, let's calculate how much water Peter uses for each type of cube.

For the giant cubes:
Peter makes 3 giant cubes, and each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water.
So, the total water used for giant cubes is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) ounces.

For the medium cubes:
Peter makes 7 medium cubes, and each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water.
So, the total water used for medium cubes is \(7 \times 2 = 14\) ounces.

For the small cubes:
Peter makes 8 small cubes, and each small cube uses 1/2 an ounce of water.
So, the total water used for small cubes is \(8 \times \frac{1}{2} = 4\) ounces.

Now, let's add up the total water used for all the cubes:
Total water used = water for giant cubes + water for medium cubes + water for small cubes
Total water used = 12 + 14 + 4 = 28 ounces.

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. To find out how much water he has left, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water:
Water left = initial water - total water used
Water left = 32 - 28 = 4 ounces.

So, the final numerical answer is 4 ounces."
"If Clara has 20 books and Clara has two times as many books as Steven, then Steven has half the number of books Clara has. So Steven has 20 / 2 = 10 books.

Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so Alice has 10 + 6 = 16 books.

To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has. So Clara has 20 - 16 = 4 more books than Alice."
"First, let's find out how much a half-gallon jar costs. We know that a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar, and a gallon jar costs $5. So, we can calculate the cost of a half-gallon jar as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of gallon jar} - 2 \]
\[ \text{Cost of half-gallon jar} = 5 - 2 \]
\[ \text{Cost of half-gallon jar} = 3 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

The cost for 10 gallon jars is:
\[ \text{Cost for 10 gallon jars} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \]

The cost for 16 half-gallon jars is:
\[ \text{Cost for 16 half-gallon jars} = 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 50 + 48 = 98 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 98 \]"
"First, let's find out how many students like to play music. We know that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number of students who like to play basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, we know the total number of students in the class is 50. We also know the number of students who like to bake, which is 10. So, the number of students who like to play video games or play music is:

\[ 50 - (10 + 5) = 50 - 15 = 35 \]

Since we already found that 10 students like to play music, the number of students who like to play video games is:

\[ 35 - 10 = 25 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 25."
"First, let's find out how many birds were scared away. Jeremy threw a stone and scared away 1/3 of the 12 birds. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \]

This means 4 birds were scared away. So, the number of birds left in the backyard after the stone was thrown is:

\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \]

A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the fearless birds. So, we add these 20 birds to the 8 birds that were left:

\[ 8 + 20 = 28 \]

Therefore, the total number of birds now in the backyard is:

\[ 28 \]"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know that the total number of students in the two classes is 80.
2. Since each class has the same number of students, we can divide the total number of students by 2 to find out how many students are in each class.
   \[
   \text{Number of students in each class} = \frac{80}{2} = 40
   \]
3. Now, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find out how many girls are in each class, we calculate 40% of 40.
   \[
   \text{Number of girls in each class} = 40 \times \frac{40}{100} = 40 \times 0.4 = 16
   \]
4. Since the total number of students in each class is 40 and 16 of them are girls, the rest must be boys.
   \[
   \text{Number of boys in each class} = 40 - 16 = 24
   \]

So, the number of boys in each class is 24."
"Mara started with 2 slices and added 3 more slices, so she had 2 + 3 = 5 slices on the plate.

She then tripled the number of slices, so she had 5 * 3 = 15 slices.

She ate 2 slices, leaving her with 15 - 2 = 13 slices.

Her friend then stole 5 slices, so she had 13 - 5 = 8 slices remaining on the plate.

The final number of cake slices that remained on the plate is 8."
"First, we need to find out the total number of animals Melissa needs to groom this week. We do this by adding the number of each type of animal:

- Dogs: 8
- Cats: 5
- Birds: 3
- Horses: 12

So, the total number of animals is:
8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28

Melissa has 7 days in a week to do this grooming. To find out how many animals she will groom each day, we divide the total number of animals by the number of days:

28 ÷ 7 = 4

So, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week."
"First, let's calculate the total cost Mark spent on the packs of magic cards. He bought 3 packs for $1800 each, so the total cost is:
\[ 3 \times 1800 = 5400 \]

Next, let's calculate the total value of the cards Mark got. He got one card worth $4000, another card worth $1000, and 30 cards each worth $50. So, the total value of these cards is:
\[ 4000 + 1000 + 30 \times 50 = 4000 + 1000 + 1500 = 6500 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value of the cards:
\[ 6500 - 5400 = 1100 \]

So, the profit Mark made is:
\[ 1100 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost for the first amusement park:
- The cost for 2 adults at the first park is \(2 \times 26 = 52\) dollars.
- The cost for 2 children at the first park is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dollars.
- So, the total cost for the first park is \(52 + 24 = 76\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the second amusement park:
- The cost for 2 adults at the second park is \(2 \times 14 = 28\) dollars.
- The cost for 2 children at the second park is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) dollars.
- So, the total cost for the second park is \(28 + 20 = 48\) dollars.

Now, to find out how much they can save by choosing the second amusement park over the first, we subtract the total cost of the second park from the total cost of the first park:
- The savings would be \(76 - 48 = 28\) dollars.

So, they will be able to save 28 dollars if they choose the second amusement park over the first."
"First, let's find out how much money the vendor used to spend on tomatoes a day. He used to buy them for $0.5 each and he sells 500 tomatoes a day. So, the cost per day is:

\[ 500 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times \$0.5/\text{tomato} = \$250/\text{day} \]

Now, let's find out how much money he spends on tomatoes a day with his new vendor. The new vendor sells them for $0.4 each. So, the cost per day with the new vendor is:

\[ 500 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times \$0.4/\text{tomato} = \$200/\text{day} \]

To find out how much money he saves a day, we subtract the new cost from the old cost:

\[ \$250/\text{day} - \$200/\text{day} = \$50/\text{day} \]

Now, to find out how much money he saves in a week (7 days), we multiply the daily savings by 7:

\[ \$50/\text{day} \times 7 \text{ days} = \$350 \]

So, the vendor saves $350 a week."
"First, let's find out how many marbles Carl has. Since Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean and Sean has 56 marbles, we can calculate Carl's marbles as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's marbles} = 4 \times \text{Sean's marbles} = 4 \times 56 = 224 \]

Next, we need to find out how many marbles Cal has. Since Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, we can calculate Cal's marbles as follows:

\[ \text{Sean's marbles} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cal's marbles} \]

Given that Sean has 56 marbles, we can solve for Cal's marbles:

\[ 56 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cal's marbles} \]

\[ \text{Cal's marbles} = 56 \times 2 = 112 \]

Now, to find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we add Carl's marbles and Cal's marbles together:

\[ \text{Combined marbles} = \text{Carl's marbles} + \text{Cal's marbles} = 224 + 112 = 336 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 336."
"To solve this, we first need to find out how many students are in each group when there are 6 groups. We do this by dividing the total number of students by the number of groups:

\[ \text{Students per group} = \frac{\text{Total students}}{\text{Number of groups}} = \frac{54}{6} = 9 \]

Now, we need to find out how many groups we can form with 12 groups. Since each group has 9 students, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group to find out how many groups we can form:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{\text{Total students}}{\text{Students per group}} = \frac{54}{9} = 6 \]

The question asks how many more groups are needed to form 12 groups. Since we can only form 6 groups with 54 students, we need to find out how many more groups are needed to reach 12 groups:

\[ \text{Additional groups needed} = 12 - 6 = 6 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 6."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during a single weekday and a single weekend day:
- During weekdays, Candy rents out 60 chairs each day.
- During weekends, Candy rents out 100 chairs each day.

Next, let's find out how many chairs are rented in one week:
- There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a week.
- So, the total chairs rented in a week are:
  \[
  5 \times 60 + 2 \times 100 = 300 + 200 = 500 \text{ chairs}
  \]

Now, let's find out how many chairs are rented in one month (4 weeks):
- Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total chairs rented in one month are:
  \[
  4 \times 500 = 2000 \text{ chairs}
  \]

Finally, let's find out how many chairs are rented in two months:
- Since there are two months, the total chairs rented in two months are:
  \[
  2 \times 2000 = 4000 \text{ chairs}
  \]

So, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is 4000 chairs."
"First, let's find out how many bananas were left after Arnold stole half of them.

Gunther initially had 48 bananas. Arnold stole half of them, so:
\[ \text{Bananas stolen by Arnold} = \frac{48}{2} = 24 \]
\[ \text{Bananas left} = 48 - 24 = 24 \]

The next day, Gunther added 25 more bananas:
\[ \text{Bananas after Gunther added 25} = 24 + 25 = 49 \]

The next day, Arnold stole 12 bananas:
\[ \text{Bananas left after Arnold stole 12} = 49 - 12 = 37 \]

On the third day, Gunther added 6 more bananas:
\[ \text{Bananas after Gunther added 6} = 37 + 6 = 43 \]

So, the number of bananas Gunther found in the pile on the third day is 43."
"To find out how much each roommate will pay per year for electricity, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the monthly cost per roommate.
2. Calculate the yearly cost per roommate.

First, let's find out how much each roommate pays each month. Since the total monthly cost is $100 and there are 4 roommates, we divide $100 by 4:

\[ \text{Monthly cost per roommate} = \frac{100}{4} = 25 \]

Next, we need to find out how much each roommate pays in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12:

\[ \text{Yearly cost per roommate} = 25 \times 12 = 300 \]

So, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity."
"First, let's find out how many glasses and plates Jeff originally sent.

Jeff sent 8 dozen glasses. Since one dozen equals 12, the number of glasses he sent is:
\[ 8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ glasses} \]

Jeff also sent 4 dozen plates. So, the number of plates he sent is:
\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ plates} \]

Next, we need to account for the broken items. 10 glasses and 6 plates were broken. So, the number of glasses and plates that are not broken are:
\[ 96 - 10 = 86 \text{ glasses} \]
\[ 48 - 6 = 42 \text{ plates} \]

Now, we add the number of glasses and plates that are not broken to find the total number of glasses and plates Jeff has now:
\[ 86 + 42 = 128 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 128 \]"
"First, let's calculate how many small stickers Lorraine trades for large buttons. She starts with 30 small stickers and trades 90% of them.

90% of 30 small stickers is:
\[ 0.90 \times 30 = 27 \text{ small stickers} \]

Since each small sticker is worth one small button, Lorraine gets 27 small buttons from trading 27 small stickers.

Next, let's calculate how many large stickers Lorraine trades for large buttons. She starts with 40 large stickers and trades 50% of them.

50% of 40 large stickers is:
\[ 0.50 \times 40 = 20 \text{ large stickers} \]

Since each large button is worth three small buttons, and each large sticker is worth one large button, Lorraine gets 20 large buttons from trading 20 large stickers.

Now, Lorraine has 20 large stickers left to trade for small buttons. Since each large sticker is worth one large button, and each large button is worth three small buttons, Lorraine can trade 20 large buttons for:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ small buttons} \]

Now, let's add up all the buttons Lorraine has:
- From trading small stickers: 27 small buttons
- From trading large stickers: 20 large buttons (which are worth 60 small buttons)
- From the remaining large stickers: 60 small buttons

So, the total number of buttons Lorraine has is:
\[ 27 + 60 = 87 \text{ small buttons} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 87 \]"
"To find out how many matches Joey played in one week, let's break it down:

- Joey played 2 matches on Monday.
- Joey played 1 match on Friday.
- On Saturday, Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday. Since he played 2 matches on Monday, on Saturday he played \(2 \times 2 = 4\) matches.

Now, let's add up all the matches:
- Monday: 2 matches
- Friday: 1 match
- Saturday: 4 matches

So, the total number of matches Joey played in one week is \(2 + 1 + 4 = 7\).

The final numerical answer is 7."
"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Let's say the number of votes against the new regulation is \( x \).
2. Then, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x \) (twice as many as against).
3. The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and against, which is \( x + 2x = 3x \).
4. We know the total number of people on the council is 33, so \( 3x = 33 \).
5. To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3: \( x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \).
6. Since the number of votes in favor is \( 2x \), we substitute \( x = 11 \) into this: \( 2 \times 11 = 22 \).

So, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22."
"First, let's break down the information given:

- 11 students need size extra-small.
- Twice as many students need size small as extra small, so \(2 \times 11 = 22\) students need size small.
- Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so \(22 - 4 = 18\) students need size medium.
- Half as many students need size large as size medium, so \(18 \div 2 = 9\) students need size large.
- Six more students need size extra-large than large, so \(9 + 6 = 15\) students need size extra-large.

Now, let's add up all the students:

- Extra-small: 11
- Small: 22
- Medium: 18
- Large: 9
- Extra-large: 15

Total number of shirts ordered = \(11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15\)

Let's add these numbers:

\(11 + 22 = 33\)
\(33 + 18 = 51\)
\(51 + 9 = 60\)
\(60 + 15 = 75\)

So, Krissa ordered a total of 75 shirts."
"To find out how much you will pay after a 5% discount on a $140 item, you first need to calculate the amount of the discount and then subtract it from the original price.

The discount amount is calculated as:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Original Price} \times \frac{\text{Discount Percentage}}{100} \]

So, for a 5% discount on $140:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 140 \times \frac{5}{100} = 140 \times 0.05 = 7 \]

Now, subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the final price:
\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount Amount} \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 140 - 7 = 133 \]

So, after the discount, you will pay $133."
"First, we need to find out how many songs are in all 20 playlists combined. Since each playlist has 300 songs, we multiply the number of songs in one playlist by the number of playlists:

\[ 300 \text{ songs/playlist} \times 20 \text{ playlists} = 6000 \text{ songs} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours these 6000 songs will last if each song is 10 hours long. We do this by multiplying the total number of songs by the length of each song:

\[ 6000 \text{ songs} \times 10 \text{ hours/song} = 60000 \text{ hours} \]

So, the 20 playlists will last a total of 60000 hours."
"First, let's find out how many people think horse #2 will win. 20% of 50 people is:

\( 20\% \times 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \)

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win.

Now, we subtract the 10 people who think horse #2 will win from the total of 50 people:

\( 50 - 10 = 40 \)

So, 40 people are left.

Next, we find out how many of these 40 people think horse #7 will win. 60% of 40 people is:

\( 60\% \times 40 = 0.60 \times 40 = 24 \)

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win.

Now, we subtract the 24 people who think horse #7 will win from the remaining 40 people:

\( 40 - 24 = 16 \)

So, 16 people think horse #12 will win.

The final numerical answer is 16."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. So, if 6 is one third of the Pomeranians, we can find the total number of Pomeranians by multiplying 6 by 3:
   \[
   6 \times 3 = 18
   \]
   So, Jana has 18 Pomeranian puppies.

2. We also know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Since we've found that 18 Pomeranians are two thirds of all the puppies, we can find the total number of puppies by setting up a proportion:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \text{ of total puppies} = 18
   \]
   To find the total number of puppies, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times \text{total puppies} = 18
   \]
   Solving for the total puppies, we multiply both sides by \(\frac{3}{2}\):
   \[
   \text{total puppies} = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 27
   \]

So, Jana has 27 puppies in total."
"First, let's find out how much money Jayden has after his sister gives him half of her allowance.

Ava's allowance is $90, so half of that is:
\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

Now, add this amount to what Jayden originally had:
\[ 70 + 45 = 115 \]

The camera costs $200, so to find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the amount he has from the cost of the camera:
\[ 200 - 115 = 85 \]

So, Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say the second house needs \( x \) cases of shingles.
2. The first house needs half of the second house, so the first house needs \( \frac{x}{2} \) cases of shingles.
3. The third house needs double the first house, so the third house needs \( 2 \times \frac{x}{2} = x \) cases of shingles.

Now, we know the total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. So we can write the equation:

\[ \frac{x}{2} + x + x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2x = 250 \]

\[ \frac{x}{2} + \frac{4x}{2} = 250 \]

\[ \frac{5x}{2} = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we multiply both sides by 2 and then divide by 5:

\[ 5x = 500 \]

\[ x = 100 \]

So, the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. Now, we can find out how many cases the third house needs:

\[ \text{Third house} = x = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

The final numerical answer is:
100"

So, Jack's total for tomatoes is 5 * $1 = $5.

Now, let's calculate how much Chase spent on lettuce:
Chase buys 1 head of lettuce and each head costs $3.
So, Chase's total for lettuce is 1 * $3 = $3.

Finally, let's add up what Leila, Jack, and Chase spent in total:
Leila's total + Jack's total + Chase's total = $6 + $5 + $3 = $14.

So, the three of them spent $14 in total to make a salad for the potluck."
"First, let's find out how many pears George has. If George has 45% more pears than bananas, and he has 200 bananas, we can calculate the number of pears as follows:

Number of pears = Number of bananas + 45% of the number of bananas
Number of pears = 200 + 0.45 * 200
Number of pears = 200 + 90
Number of pears = 290

Now, to find out the total number of fruits George has, we add the number of bananas and the number of pears:

Total number of fruits = Number of bananas + Number of pears
Total number of fruits = 200 + 290
Total number of fruits = 490

So, the final numerical answer is 490."
"First, let's find out how much money Marissa spent on the ball. She had $80 and spent $20 on the ball. So, the money left for candy bars is:

\[ 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Now, we need to find out how many candy bars she can buy with the remaining $60. Each candy bar costs $5. So, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one candy bar:

"To find out how much money Sam would spend to make 4 liters of juice, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many kilograms of oranges are needed for 4 liters of juice.
2. Calculate the cost of the oranges needed for 4 liters of juice.

First, since 1 liter of juice requires 5 kilograms of oranges, 4 liters of juice would require:
\[ 4 \text{ liters} \times 5 \text{ kilograms/liter} = 20 \text{ kilograms} \]

Next, since each kilogram of oranges costs $3, the cost for 20 kilograms of oranges would be:
\[ 20 \text{ kilograms} \times 3 \text{ dollars/kilogram} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice."
"First, let's find out how many books Ahmed read. Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in one hour, and Ezra read 300 books, we can find out how many Ahmed read by dividing Ezra's books by 2.

Ahmed's books = Ezra's books / 2
Ahmed's books = 300 / 2
Ahmed's books = 150

Now, we know that Ahmed read 150 books. Ezra decided to read 150 more books, so we add those to the 300 books he already read.

Ezra's total books = 300 + 150
Ezra's total books = 450

Now, to find out how many books they read altogether, we add Ahmed's books to Ezra's total books.

Total books = Ahmed's books + Ezra's total books
Total books = 150 + 450
Total books = 600

So, they read 600 books altogether."
"First, let's calculate how much Tanya earns for teaching classes on Monday and Wednesday.

On Monday, she teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. So, her earnings from teaching are:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} \times 5 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 4 \times 5 \times 15 = 4 \times 75 = \$300 \]

Next, we need to calculate her additional earnings for teaching more than 3 classes on Monday. Since she taught 4 classes, she gets an additional $5 per day:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} - 3 \text{ classes} = 1 \text{ extra class} \]
\[ 1 \text{ extra class} \times \$5 = \$5 \]

So, her total earnings for Monday are:
\[ \$300 + \$5 = \$305 \]

Now, let's calculate her earnings for Wednesday. She teaches 2 classes for 2 hours:
\[ 2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 2 \times 2 \times 15 = 2 \times 30 = \$60 \]

Since she did not teach more than 3 classes on Wednesday, she does not get the additional $5 per day:
\[ \$60 \]

Now, we add her earnings from Monday and Wednesday to find her total earnings for the two days:
\[ \$305 + \$60 = \$365 \]

So, Tanya earned a total of \$365 for these two days of teaching."
"To find out how many more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total sales for each type of scent and then find the difference.

For vanilla scents:
They have 4 vanilla scents and sold 5 of each.
So, total vanilla scents sold = 5 * 4 = 20

For fruity scents:
They have 8 fruity scents and sold 2 of each.
So, total fruity scents sold = 2 * 8 = 16

Now, to find out how many more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents:
Difference = Total vanilla scents sold - Total fruity scents sold
Difference = 20 - 16 = 4

So, 4 more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents."
"First, let's calculate how much money Bennet makes from selling the eggplants.

He sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so:
\[ 20 \text{ eggplants} \times \$3/\text{eggplant} = \$60 \]

Now, we know that Bennet wants to make a total of $135. To find out how much more money he needs to make from selling the corn, we subtract the money he already has from the total he wants to make:
\[ \$135 - \$60 = \$75 \]

Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for to make the remaining $75, we divide the remaining money by the number of ears of corn:
\[ \$75 \div 25 \text{ ears} = \$3/\text{ear} \]

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3."

Total weekend hours = 7 + 5 = 12 hours

Tatiana spends 3 hours reading. So, the remaining time after reading is:
Remaining time = Total weekend hours - Time spent reading
Remaining time = 12 - 3 = 9 hours

She plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time:
Time spent on video games = 1/3 * Remaining time
Time spent on video games = 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours

Now, we can find out how much time she spends playing soccer. The total time spent on video games and reading is:
Time spent on video games + Time spent on reading = 3 + 3 = 6 hours

So, the time spent playing soccer is:
Time spent on soccer = Remaining time - Time spent on video games and reading
Time spent on soccer = 9 - 6 = 3 hours

Now, to find out what percentage of her weekend she spends playing soccer, we use the formula:
Percentage of weekend spent on soccer = (Time spent on soccer / Total weekend hours) * 100
Percentage of weekend spent on soccer = (3 / 12) * 100 = 0.25 * 100 = 25%

So, the final numerical answer is 25%."
"First, let's find out how many pencils Anthony gave to Brandon. He gave 1/2 of his 50 pencils to Brandon, so:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \]

Now, Anthony has:

\[ 50 - 25 = 25 \]

pencils left.

Next, Anthony gave 3/5 of the remaining 25 pencils to Charlie. So, we calculate 3/5 of 25:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 25 = 15 \]

So, Anthony gave 15 pencils to Charlie. Now, we find out how many pencils Anthony has left after giving some to Charlie:

\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \]

Therefore, Anthony kept 10 pencils."
"First, we need to calculate the time Jack spends driving to the museum and back. Since the distance to the museum is 150 miles and he drives at a speed of 75 mph, the time taken to drive one way is:

\[ \text{Time to drive one way} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Since he drives both to and from the museum, the total driving time is:

\[ \text{Total driving time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Jack also spends 6 hours at the museum. So, the total time Jack is gone from home is the sum of the driving time and the time spent at the museum:

\[ \text{Total time} = 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 10 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of wheels needed for the cars:
- Henry needs 4 wheels for each car.
- He has 57 cars.
- So, the total wheels needed for cars = 4 wheels/car * 57 cars = 228 wheels.

Next, let's calculate the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles:
- Henry needs 2 wheels for each motorcycle.
- He has 73 motorcycles.
- So, the total wheels needed for motorcycles = 2 wheels/motorcycle * 73 motorcycles = 146 wheels.

Now, let's find the total number of wheels needed for all the toys:
- Total wheels needed = wheels needed for cars + wheels needed for motorcycles
- Total wheels needed = 228 wheels + 146 wheels = 374 wheels.

Finally, let's find out how many wheels will be left after Henry uses 374 wheels from the box of 650 wheels:
- Wheels left = total wheels in the box - total wheels needed
- Wheels left = 650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels.

So, the number of wheels left is 276."
"To find out how much you have to pay after a 20% discount on a $1000 laptop, you first need to calculate the discount amount and then subtract it from the original price.

The discount amount is 20% of $1000, which is calculated as:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \frac{20}{100} \times 1000 = 0.20 \times 1000 = 200 \]

Now, subtract the discount amount from the original price:
\[ \text{Price After Discount} = 1000 - 200 = 800 \]

So, you have to pay $800 for the laptop after the discount."
"First, let's find out how many movies are in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of series movies} = \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \]

So, the number of movies that are not in series is:

\[ \text{Number of non-series movies} = 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Next, we find out how many of these non-series movies are older movies. Since 40% of the non-series movies are older movies, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of older movies} = 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \]

Therefore, the number of non-series movies that are not older movies is:

\[ \text{Number of non-series movies that are not older} = 400 - 160 = 240 \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the series movies. Since each series movie can be bought for $6 instead of $10, the total cost for the series movies is:

\[ \text{Cost of series movies} = 200 \times 6 = 1200 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the older movies. Since each older movie costs $5, the total cost for the older movies is:

\[ \text{Cost of older movies} = 160 \times 5 = 800 \]

Finally, we calculate the cost of the non-series movies that are not older. Since each of these movies costs $10, the total cost for these movies is:

\[ \text{Cost of non-series movies that are not older} = 240 \times 10 = 2400 \]

Adding all these costs together gives the total cost to replace the movie collection:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 4400 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost for each type of fruit Winston picked:

- For peaches: 6 pounds at $2.00 per pound.
- For plums: 8 pounds at $1.00 per pound.
- For apricots: 6 pounds at $3.00 per pound.

Now, let's calculate the cost for each type:

- Cost of peaches = 6 pounds * $2.00/pound = $12.00
- Cost of plums = 8 pounds * $1.00/pound = $8.00
- Cost of apricots = 6 pounds * $3.00/pound = $18.00

Now, let's add up the total cost:

Total cost = Cost of peaches + Cost of plums + Cost of apricots
Total cost = $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00
Total cost = $38.00

So, Winston spent $38.00 on fruit."
"First, let's calculate the distance they drove. They drove for 6 hours at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.

\[ \text{Distance driven} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 50 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, let's find out the hiking speed. The hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.

\[ \text{Hiking speed} = \frac{50}{2} - 5 = 25 - 5 = 20 \, \text{miles/hour} \]

They hiked for 1.5 hours at this speed.

\[ \text{Distance hiked} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 20 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find the total distance to their vacation spot, we add the distance they drove to the distance they hiked.

\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance driven} + \text{Distance hiked} = 300 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 330 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 330 miles."
"To solve this, let's break down the points for each player based on the information given.

Let's say Emma's score is E and Ava's score is A.

Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so if Emma jumps on x enemies, Ava jumps on x + 8 enemies. Emma collects 3 more berries than Ava, so if Ava collects y berries, Emma collects y + 3 berries. Ava finishes 4 seconds slower, so she loses 30 * 4 = 120 points due to the timer.

The points for enemies and berries are given as:
- 10 points for each enemy
- 5 points for each berry

So, the points for enemies and berries can be calculated as:
- Emma's points from enemies: 10x
- Ava's points from enemies: 10(x + 8) = 10x + 80
- Emma's points from berries: 5(y + 3) = 5y + 15
- Ava's points from berries: 5y

Now, we need to calculate the difference in points due to the timer:
- Ava loses 120 points due to the timer.

So, the total points for each player are:
- Emma's total score: E = 10x + 5y + 15
- Ava's total score: A = 10x + 80 + 5y - 120 = 10x + 5y - 40

The difference in their scores is:
A - E = (10x + 5y - 40) - (10x + 5y + 15) = -40 - 15 = -55

The difference between their two scores is -55 points."
"First, let's find out how much the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each together cost. 

30 dollars + 30 dollars = 60 dollars

The total cost for all four pizzas is 64 dollars. So, the cost of the other two pizzas together is:

64 dollars - 60 dollars = 4 dollars

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of these two pizzas by 2 to find the cost of each:

4 dollars ÷ 2 = 2 dollars

So, each of the other two pizzas cost 2 dollars.

The final numerical answer is 2 dollars."
"First, let's calculate how many times they ride their bikes on a regular day. They ride their bikes 3 times a day.

So, for 5 regular days, they ride:
\[ 3 \text{ times/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ times} \]

On the two other days, they ride twice as many times as they do on a regular day. So, on these days, they ride:
\[ 3 \text{ times/day} \times 2 = 6 \text{ times/day} \]
For 2 days, they ride:
\[ 6 \text{ times/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ times} \]

Now, let's add the times they ride on the regular days and the special days:
\[ 15 \text{ times} + 12 \text{ times} = 27 \text{ times} \]

So, the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is:
\[ 27 \text{ times} \]"
"First, let's understand the situation. Bob originally had 7 fish in his pond, with 3 being orange and 4 being white. He then added 17 fish from the pet store to his pond. After adding these 17 fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as \( w \) and the number of orange fish he bought as \( o \). We know that the total number of fish he bought from the pet store is 17, so:
\[ o + w = 17 \]

After adding these 17 fish to his pond, the total number of orange fish became \( 3 + o \) and the total number of white fish became \( 4 + w \). According to the problem, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]

Now, let's solve these equations step by step. First, simplify the second equation:
\[ 3 + o = 8 + 2w \]
\[ o - 2w = 5 \]

We now have a system of linear equations:
1. \( o + w = 17 \)
2. \( o - 2w = 5 \)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use elimination. Multiply the first equation by 2 to align the coefficients of \( o \):
\[ 2o + 2w = 34 \]
\[ o - 2w = 5 \]

Add these two equations:
\[ (2o + 2w) + (o - 2w) = 34 + 5 \]
\[ 3o = 39 \]
\[ o = 13 \]

Now substitute \( o = 13 \) back into the first equation:
\[ 13 + w = 17 \]
\[ w = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. Let's verify the solution:
- If Bob bought 4 white fish and 13 orange fish, the total is \( 4 + 13 = 17 \) fish.
- After adding these fish, the number of orange fish is \( 3 + 13 = 16 \) and the number of white fish is \( 4 + 4 = 8 \).
- Check if the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish: \( 16 = 2 \times 8 \), which is true.

Therefore, the number of white fish Bob bought is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"First, let's calculate how many miles Andy drives in a week. Since he goes to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days. If the one-way distance is 5 miles, then the round trip (going to work and coming back) is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles per day. So, in a week, he drives 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

Next, we need to find out how many gallons of gas Andy uses in a week. Since his car's fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon, we divide the total miles driven in a week by the miles per gallon to find the gallons used. So, 50 miles/week ÷ 10 miles/gallon = 5 gallons/week.

Finally, to find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we multiply the gallons used by the price per gallon. The price for regular gas is $3/gallon, so 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week.

So, the final numerical answer is $15."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie has in quarters. Since she has 140 quarters and each quarter is worth $0.25, we can calculate the total amount of money in quarters as follows:

\[ 140 \text{ quarters} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/quarter} = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie has in twenties. Since she has 10 twenties and each twenty is worth $20, we can calculate the total amount of money in twenties as follows:

\[ 10 \text{ twenties} \times 20 \text{ dollars/twenty} = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Carrie spent 3/5 of the twenties. So, we need to calculate 3/5 of $200:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the amount spent in quarters and the amount spent in twenties to find the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch:

\[ 35 \text{ dollars} + 120 \text{ dollars} = 155 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is:

\[ 155 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{155} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of tomatoes Ricardo can get. Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes, and he has 5 tomato plants. So, the total number of tomatoes is:
\[ 22 \times 5 = 110 \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggplants Ricardo can get. Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants, and he has 8 eggplant plants. So, the total number of eggplants is:
\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Now, to find the total number of fruits, we add the number of tomatoes and the number of eggplants:
\[ 110 + 32 = 142 \]

So, the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his plants is:
\[ 142 \]"
"To find out how many OLED TVs were sold, we first need to calculate how many smart TVs and analog TVs were sold.

For smart TVs, it's one-fourth of the total sales:
\[ \text{Smart TVs} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

For analog TVs, it's one-eighth of the total sales:
\[ \text{Analog TVs} = \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5 \]

Now, to find out how many OLED TVs were sold, we subtract the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total sales:
\[ \text{OLED TVs} = \text{Total Sales} - (\text{Smart TVs} + \text{Analog TVs}) \]
\[ \text{OLED TVs} = 40 - (10 + 5) \]
\[ \text{OLED TVs} = 40 - 15 \]
\[ \text{OLED TVs} = 25 \]

So, the number of OLED TVs sold is 25."
"To find out how much money John is missing, we need to calculate the total cost of the trip and then subtract the amount he already has.

The total cost of the trip is $300.
The school is covering half of the cost, so the school will cover $300 / 2 = $150.

John has $50.

So, the total amount needed is the cost covered by the school plus the amount John needs, which is $150 + (total amount John needs).

Since the school covers $150, John needs $150 - $50 = $100 more.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
100"
"First, let's find out how cold it gets at night. If it was 45 degrees during the day and it's 33 degrees colder at night, we can calculate the night temperature as follows:

\[ \text{Night temperature} = \text{Day temperature} - 33 \]
\[ \text{Night temperature} = 45 - 33 \]
\[ \text{Night temperature} = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

Now, we know that the pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. Since it's 12 degrees at night, we need to find out how much more it needs to warm up to reach 32 degrees:

\[ \text{Temperature needed to warm up} = 32 - \text{Night temperature} \]
\[ \text{Temperature needed to warm up} = 32 - 12 \]
\[ \text{Temperature needed to warm up} = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Since each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees, we can calculate the number of logs needed to warm up 20 degrees:

\[ \text{Number of logs needed} = \frac{\text{Temperature needed to warm up}}{\text{Temperature increase per log}} \]
\[ \text{Number of logs needed} = \frac{20}{5} \]
\[ \text{Number of logs needed} = 4 \]

So, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing."
"First, we need to find out how many groups were formed. Since 90 people were split into 9-person groups, we divide 90 by 9:

\[ 90 \div 9 = 10 \]

So, there were 10 groups.

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups brought back seashells. According to the problem, 3/5 of the groups each had members bring back 2 seashells. So, we calculate 3/5 of 10:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6 \]

This means 6 groups brought back seashells. Each of these groups brought back 2 seashells, so we multiply the number of groups by the number of seashells each group brought:

\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

So, the total number of seashells brought back is 12."
"Initially, there are 172 people on the train.

At the first stop, 47 people get off, so the number of people left on the train is:
172 - 47 = 125

Then, 13 more people get on, so the number of people on the train becomes:
125 + 13 = 138

At the next stop, 38 people get off, so the number of people left on the train is:
138 - 38 = 100

So, the final number of people on the train is 100."
"To find out how much money Damien makes in a 30 day month, we need to follow these steps:

2. Multiply the number of bottle caps he gets in a day by the value of each bottle cap.
3. Multiply the total value of bottle caps he gets in a day by the number of days in the month.

Step 1: Damien gets 10 bottle caps a day.
Step 2: Each bottle cap is worth $0.25, so in a day, he gets \(10 \times 0.25 = 2.5\) dollars.
Step 3: In a 30 day month, he gets \(2.5 \times 30 = 75\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is 75."
"First, let's find out Jamie's regular hourly rate. She earns $20 per hour for 8 hours of work each day. So, her regular hourly rate is $20.

For the additional hours she worked, she is paid 150% of her regular hourly rate. To find out how much she earns for each additional hour, we calculate 150% of $20:
\[ 150\% \text{ of } \$20 = 1.5 \times \$20 = \$30 \]

Jamie worked 11 hours in total, which means she worked 3 additional hours (since she worked 8 regular hours). Now, let's calculate her earnings for the additional hours:
\[ 3 \text{ additional hours} \times \$30 \text{ per hour} = \$90 \]

Next, we calculate her earnings for the regular 8 hours:
\[ 8 \text{ regular hours} \times \$20 \text{ per hour} = \$160 \]

Now, we add the earnings from the regular hours and the additional hours to find her total earnings for the day:
\[ \$160 + \$90 = \$250 \]

So, Jamie was paid \$250 for her work on last Tuesday."
"To find the total number of lions in the enclosure, we need to add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs together.

First, we know there are 12 female lions.
Next, we need to find out how many male lions there are. The problem states that there are half as many male lions as female lions. So, we calculate:
\[ \text{Number of male lions} = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]

Then, we know there are 14 lion cubs.

Now, we add all these numbers together to find the total number of lions:
\[ \text{Total number of lions} = \text{Number of female lions} + \text{Number of male lions} + \text{Number of lion cubs} \]
\[ \text{Total number of lions} = 12 + 6 + 14 \]
\[ \text{Total number of lions} = 32 \]

So, the total number of lions in the enclosure is 32."
"First, let's find out the discount amount on the jeans. The jeans are 25% off, and the original price is $40. To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage:

\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Original Price} \times \frac{\text{Discount Percentage}}{100} \]

\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 40 \times \frac{25}{100} \]

\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 40 \times 0.25 \]

\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 10 \]

So, the discount amount is $10. Now, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the sale price:

\[ \text{Sale Price} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount Amount} \]

\[ \text{Sale Price} = 40 - 10 \]

\[ \text{Sale Price} = 30 \]

Mike pays with a $50.00 bill, so to find out how much money Mike will have left over, we subtract the sale price from the $50.00:

\[ \text{Money Left Over} = \text{Payment Amount} - \text{Sale Price} \]

\[ \text{Money Left Over} = 50 - 30 \]

\[ \text{Money Left Over} = 20 \]

So, Mike will have $20.00 left over."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Employee Count**: The company starts with 200 employees.
2. **New Employees Added**: The company hires 20 new employees every month.
3. **Total Employees After Three Months**: After three months, the company will have hired \(20 \times 3 = 60\) new employees. So, the total number of employees will be \(200 + 60 = 260\).
4. **Salary per Employee**: Each employee is paid $4000 per month.
5. **Total Salary Paid**: To find the total amount of money the company pays to its employees, we multiply the total number of employees by the salary per employee. So, \(260 \times 4000 = 1040000\).

Therefore, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is $1,040,000."
"First, we need to find out the total time for ""Deck the Halls"". Since they are singing it twice, we multiply the length of one song by 2:
150 seconds * 2 = 300 seconds

Next, we add the length of ""Jingle Bells"" to the total time of ""Deck the Halls"":
300 seconds + 240 seconds = 540 seconds

"First, let's find out Billy's starting salary and his salary after the raises.

Billy's initial pay rate was $10 per hour. After 2 months, he got a raise to $10.50 per hour. On his first anniversary, he got another raise to $11.00 per hour.

Now, let's calculate his total earnings for 20 hours at each of these rates:
- For the first 2 months (20 hours * $10.00/hour) = $200.00
- For the next 2 months (20 hours * $10.50/hour) = $210.00
- For the next 2 months (20 hours * $11.00/hour) = $220.00

So, Billy's total earnings for 60 hours are $200.00 + $210.00 + $220.00 = $630.00.

Now, let's find out Sally's starting salary. Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary, which was $10.00 per hour. So, Sally's starting salary is $10.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate Sally's total earnings for 20 hours at $10.50 per hour:
- Sally's total earnings for 20 hours = 20 hours * $10.50/hour = $210.00.

Now, we need to find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally:
- Difference in earnings = Billy's total earnings - Sally's total earnings = $630.00 - $210.00 = $420.00.

So, Billy will earn $420.00 more than Sally."
"First, let's calculate the cost of 3 loaves of bread:
- The cost of one loaf of bread is $2.
- So, the cost of 3 loaves of bread is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of 2 bagels:
- The cost of one bagel is $1.
- So, the cost of 2 bagels is \(2 \times 1 = 2\) dollars.

Now, to find out how much more 3 loaves of bread cost than 2 bagels, we subtract the cost of 2 bagels from the cost of 3 loaves of bread:
- The difference is \(6 - 2 = 4\) dollars.

So, 3 loaves of bread cost 4 dollars more than 2 bagels. The final numerical answer is 4."
"First, let's find out how many points Nikita scored. We know that Nikita scored 11 more than half as many as Pierson. Pierson scored 278 points.

To find half of Pierson's score, we divide 278 by 2:
\[ \frac{278}{2} = 139 \]

Now, we add 11 to this number to find Nikita's score:
\[ 139 + 11 = 150 \]

So, Nikita scored 150 points.

To find the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita, we add Pierson's score to Nikita's score:
\[ 278 + 150 = 428 \]

Therefore, the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita is 428."
"First, let's find out how many students and teachers there are in total at Ashley's school.

There are 40 classes, and each class has an average of 25 students. So, the total number of students is:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 25 \text{ students/class} = 1000 \text{ students} \]

Each class also has an average of 3 teachers. So, the total number of teachers is:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 3 \text{ teachers/class} = 120 \text{ teachers} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees planted by the students and the teachers.

Each student plants 1 tree, so the total number of trees planted by the students is:
\[ 1000 \text{ students} \times 1 \text{ tree/student} = 1000 \text{ trees} \]

Each teacher plants 2 trees, so the total number of trees planted by the teachers is:
\[ 120 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ trees/teacher} = 240 \text{ trees} \]

To find the total number of trees planted by both students and teachers, we add the two amounts together:

"First, let's find out how many stuffed animals Bubbles currently has. She has:
- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

Adding these up, we get:
3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 stuffed animals

Now, let's assume Bubbles buys \( x \) stuffed goats. The total number of stuffed animals after buying the goats will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30%. This means that the number of stuffed goats should be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. We can set up the following equation to represent this:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step.

First, distribute the 0.30 on the right side:
\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Next, we need to isolate \( x \). Subtract \( 0.30x \) from both sides:
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Now, divide both sides by 0.70:
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats. Let's check the final answer:

If Bubbles buys 6 stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be:
\[ 14 + 6 = 20 \]

The percentage of stuffed goats will be:
\[ \frac{6}{20} \times 100\% = 30\% \]

This confirms that the solution is correct. The final numerical answer is:
6"
"First, let's calculate how many hours Kris has already played.

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, so:
\( 14 \text{ days} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/day} = 7 \text{ hours} \)

Next, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\( 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/day} = 14 \text{ hours} \)

Now, let's add the hours she has already played:
\( 7 \text{ hours} + 14 \text{ hours} = 21 \text{ hours} \)

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. So, the number of hours she still needs to play is:
\( 30 \text{ hours} - 21 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \)

The final numerical answer is:
9"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the distance each car travels in 2 hours:**
   - The first car travels at 60 miles per hour. In 2 hours, it will travel:
     \[
     60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles}
     \]
   - The second car travels at 70 miles per hour. In 2 hours, it will travel:
     \[
     70 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 140 \text{ miles}
     \]

2. **Calculate the difference in the distance traveled by the two cars after 2 hours:**
   - The second car is 140 miles from the starting point, and the first car is 120 miles from the starting point. The difference in their distances is:
     \[
     140 \text{ miles} - 120 \text{ miles} = 20 \text{ miles}
     \]

So, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car. The final numerical answer is:

20 miles"
"First, let's find out the total cost of the ring before the premium. The diamond costs $600 and the gold costs $300. So, the total cost is:

\[ 600 + 300 = 900 \]

Next, we need to calculate the premium. The premium is 30% of the total cost. To find 30% of $900, we multiply $900 by 0.30:

\[ 900 \times 0.30 = 270 \]

Now, we add the premium to the total cost to find out how much James paid:

\[ 900 + 270 = 1170 \]

So, the final amount James paid is:

\[ 1170 \]"
"First, let's find the pass rates for each grade.

For the third graders:
340 out of 500 passed, so the pass rate is \( \frac{340}{500} \).

For the fourth graders:
40 out of 100 passed, so the pass rate is \( \frac{40}{100} \).

For the fifth graders:
The pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders, so it is \( 2 \times \frac{40}{100} \).

Now, let's calculate these pass rates.

For the third graders:
\( \frac{340}{500} = 0.68 \) or 68%.

For the fourth graders:
\( \frac{40}{100} = 0.40 \) or 40%.

For the fifth graders:
\( 2 \times 0.40 = 0.80 \) or 80%.

Now, let's find the overall pass rate for the whole school. The total number of students is \( 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 \). The total number of students who passed is \( 340 + 40 + 400 = 780 \).

The overall pass rate is \( \frac{780}{1000} = 0.78 \) or 78%.

So, the school's overall pass rate is 78%."
"First, let's find out how many glass chips Milo has in total. Since each bag holds 72 chips and he has two bags, he has:

\[ 72 \text{ chips/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Now, we know that it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic. So, with 144 chips, Milo can make:

\[ \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips/square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. To find out how many inches long he can make his mosaic, we divide the total square inches by the height:

\[ \frac{12 \text{ square inches}}{3 \text{ inches}} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Next, 16 students each drank 2 quarts of tea:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Now, let's add the total quarts of tea consumed by all the students:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

We know that there are 10 quarts of tea left. So, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is the sum of the tea consumed and the tea left:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we need to convert the total quarts to gallons:
\[ \frac{48}{4} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
12"
"Dale initially had 100 candies and sold 150, but since he only had 100, he couldn't sell all of them. So he's short by 50 candies. Then he ordered 100 more candies. Now he has 100 (initial) + 100 (new order) = 200 candies. Since he sold 150 already, he still needs to sell 200 (total now) - 150 (already sold) = 50 candies.

The final numerical answer is 50."
"To solve this, let's break it down month by month.

- At the beginning of January, there are 10 students.
- By the end of January, the number of students doubles, so there are 10 * 2 = 20 students.
- By the end of February, the number doubles again, so there are 20 * 2 = 40 students.
- By the end of March, the number doubles again, so there are 40 * 2 = 80 students.
- By the end of April, the number doubles again, so there are 80 * 2 = 160 students.
- By the end of May, the number doubles again, so there are 160 * 2 = 320 students.

Now, to find out how many additional students joined by the end of May, we subtract the number of students at the beginning of the year from the number at the end of May.

So, the additional students are 320 - 10 = 310.

The final numerical answer is 310."
"First, we need to find out how many branches Felix climbed in total to make $105. Since each branch costs $0.25, we can find the total number of branches by dividing the total money made by the cost per branch.

\[ \text{Total branches} = \frac{\text{Total money made}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} \]

Now, let's do the division:

\[ \text{Total branches} = 420 \]

Felix made $105 in a week, and there are 7 days in a week. To find out how many branches he climbed per day, we divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week.

\[ \text{Branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches}}{\text{Number of days in a week}} = \frac{420}{7} \]

Now, let's do the division:

\[ \text{Branches per day} = 60 \]

So, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 60 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose picks initially:

- For the first 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals.
- For the next 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals.
- For the next 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals.
- For the last 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals.

Now, let's add up all the petals she picks:
\[15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\] petals.

Next, Rose drops 1 of each type of flower:
- She drops 1 of the 5-petal flowers, so she loses 5 petals.
- She drops 1 of the 6-petal flowers, so she loses 6 petals.
- She drops 1 of the 4-petal flowers, so she loses 4 petals.
- She drops 1 of the 7-petal flowers, so she loses 7 petals.

Now, let's calculate the total number of petals she loses:
\[5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\] petals.

Subtract the petals she loses from the total petals she initially picked:
\[101 - 22 = 79\] petals.

So, the total number of petals in the vase is:
\[79\]"
"First, let's find out how many marshmallows John and DeSean used to make S'mores.

John makes 9 S'mores, and each S'more uses one marshmallow, so John uses 9 marshmallows.
DeSean also makes 9 S'mores, so he uses 9 marshmallows too.

Together, they used 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows.

They started with 35 marshmallows and dropped 3 on the ground, so they have 35 - 3 = 32 marshmallows left.

Now, let's find out how many marshmallows are left for each kid.

Since John and DeSean used the same number of marshmallows, they each used 9 out of the 18 used. So, they each have 9 marshmallows left.

Now, we need to find out how many S'mores each can make with the remaining marshmallows.

Each S'more uses one marshmallow, so each can make 9 S'mores with the marshmallows left.

So, the final answer is:
John and DeSean can each have 9 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag."
"First, let's figure out how long each person can play the game.

Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter.
His two friends who are worse than him can play for half as long, so they can play for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes with one quarter.
His friend who is better than him can play for 1.5 times as long, so he can play for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes with one quarter.

Now, let's calculate the total time they play together:
Jack plays for 20 minutes.
His two worse friends play for 10 minutes each, so together they play for 10 * 2 = 20 minutes.
His better friend plays for 30 minutes.

So, the total time they play together is 20 + 20 + 30 = 70 minutes.

They play for 4 hours, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

Now, let's find out how much time they have left after playing for 70 minutes:
240 - 70 = 170 minutes.

Since each quarter gets them 20 minutes, we need to find out how many quarters they need for 170 minutes:
170 / 20 = 8.5 quarters.

Since they can't use half a quarter, they will need to use 9 quarters.

So, the final numerical answer is 9 quarters."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance.
2. She uses twice as much oil as salt.
3. She uses twice as much salt as zest.
4. She uses the same amount of salt as sugar.
5. She fills a 10-ounce jar each time.

Let's denote the amount of zest as \( Z \) ounces. Then:
- The amount of fragrance is also \( Z \) ounces.
- The amount of salt is \( Z \) ounces.
- The amount of sugar is also \( Z \) ounces.
- The amount of oil is \( 2 \times Z \) ounces.

Now, we can add up all the ingredients:
\[ Z \text{ (zest)} + Z \text{ (fragrance)} + Z \text{ (salt)} + Z \text{ (sugar)} + 2Z \text{ (oil)} = 10 \text{ ounces} \]

This simplifies to:
\[ Z + Z + Z + Z + 2Z = 10 \]
\[ 6Z = 10 \]

To find \( Z \), we divide both sides by 6:
\[ Z = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \]

Now, we know the amount of oil is \( 2Z \):
\[ 2Z = 2 \times \frac{5}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \]

So, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \( \frac{10}{3} \) ounces. To express this as a decimal:
\[ \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 3.33 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the goats. John bought 3 goats at $500 each, so the total cost for the goats is:
\[ 3 \times 500 = 1500 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the cows. John bought 2 cows at $1500 each, so the total cost for the cows is:
\[ 2 \times 1500 = 3000 \]

Now, to find out the total amount of money John spent, we add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows:
\[ 1500 + 3000 = 4500 \]

So, the total amount of money John spent is $4500."
"Paul already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes, which totals to:
8 + 40 = 48 cupcakes.

He needs 63 cupcakes in total, so the number of cupcakes he should buy is:
63 - 48 = 15 cupcakes.

The final numerical answer is 15."
"First, let's find out how many cars Joe has initially. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find out how many cars he sells, we calculate 20% of 40:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

After selling 8 cars, Joe has:

\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

After giving away 16 cars, Joe has:

\[ 32 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, the final number of cars Joe has after selling and giving some to his mother is:

"First, we need to find out how much money the students raised. The total money raised is $175,000, and $50,000 of that came from organizations. So, the students raised:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Now, we need to divide this amount by the number of students to find out how much each student raised. There are 20 students, so:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

So, each student raised $6,250."
"First, let's find out how many hours Sandy walked on the second day. She walked half as many hours on the second day as she did on the first day. Since she walked 8 hours on the first day, on the second day she walked:

\[ \text{Hours on second day} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's add the hours from both days to find the total hours Sandy walked:

\[ \text{Total hours} = 8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Since we need the total time in minutes, we convert hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ \text{Total minutes} = 12 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days in minutes is:

"First, let's find out how many cars were in the parking lot during the lunch break.

Hunter initially counted 50 cars. During the first break, he saw 20 more cars. So, the total number of cars before the lunch break was:
\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \]

During the lunch break, half of these cars left the parking lot. So, the number of cars that left is:
\[ \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Therefore, the number of cars remaining in the parking lot during the lunch break is:
\[ 70 - 35 = 35 \]

So, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35."
"First, let's find out how much John makes in one day. He does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle has 5 tasks. So, the total number of tasks he does in one day is:

30 cycles/day * 5 tasks/cycle = 150 tasks/day

Each task pays $1.20, so the total amount he makes in one day is:

150 tasks/day * $1.20/task = $180/day

Now, to find out how much he makes in a full 7 day week, we multiply the daily earnings by 7:

$180/day * 7 days/week = $1260/week

So, the final numerical answer is $1260."
"First, let's find out how many points Julie scored in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, and Sasha scored 14 points, we can calculate Julie's score as follows:

Julie's score in the first game = Sasha's score in the first game - 4
Julie's score in the first game = 14 - 4
Julie's score in the first game = 10 points

Now, we know that in the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie did in the first game. So, we can calculate Sasha's score in the second game as follows:

Sasha's score in the second game = Julie's score in the first game - 6
Sasha's score in the second game = 10 - 6
Sasha's score in the second game = 4 points

Now, to find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add the points from both games:

Total points Sasha scored = Sasha's score in the first game + Sasha's score in the second game
Total points Sasha scored = 14 + 4
Total points Sasha scored = 18 points

So, the final numerical answer is 18."
"First, let's calculate the total number of tins of cat food Kimberly bought. She bought 8 packages of cat food, and each package contains 11 tins. So, we multiply 8 by 11:

\[ 8 \times 11 = 88 \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of tins of dog food Kimberly bought. She bought 6 packages of dog food, and each package contains 6 tins. So, we multiply 6 by 6:

\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

Now, to find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we subtract the total number of tins of dog food from the total number of tins of cat food:

\[ 88 - 36 = 52 \]

So, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 52 \]"
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \).

According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards.

Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now we know PJ has 47 cards. To find out how many cards Smendrick has, we multiply PJ's cards by 3:
\[ 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \]

And to find out how many cards Becca has, we add 12 to Smendrick's cards:
\[ 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

So, Becca has 153 cards. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how many blue eggs Cindy has. Since she has twice as many blue eggs as green ones, and she has 5 green eggs, we can calculate the number of blue eggs as follows:

Number of blue eggs = 2 * Number of green eggs
Number of blue eggs = 2 * 5
Number of blue eggs = 10

Next, we need to find out how many pink eggs Cindy has. She has one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so:

Number of pink eggs = Number of blue eggs - 1
Number of pink eggs = 10 - 1
Number of pink eggs = 9

Now, we need to find out how many yellow eggs Cindy has. She has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so:

Number of yellow eggs = 1/3 * Number of pink eggs
Number of yellow eggs = 1/3 * 9
Number of yellow eggs = 3

Finally, to find out the total number of eggs Cindy has, we add up all the eggs:

Total number of eggs = Number of green eggs + Number of blue eggs + Number of pink eggs + Number of yellow eggs
Total number of eggs = 5 + 10 + 9 + 3
Total number of eggs = 27

So, Cindy had 27 eggs altogether."
"First, let's calculate the cost of shipping the book.

The cost of shipping is calculated as follows:
- The cost per pound is $0.35.
- The book weighs 4 pounds.
- The cost for the weight of the book is \(4 \times 0.35 = 1.40\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the cost based on the distance:
- The cost per mile is $0.08.
- The book needs to be returned 20 miles away.
- The cost for the distance is \(20 \times 0.08 = 1.60\) dollars.

Now, we add the cost for the weight and the cost for the distance to get the total shipping cost:
- Total shipping cost = $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

Next, we calculate the refund Milly will receive from Amazon. Amazon will refund 75% of the book's purchase price:
- The book cost $32.
- The refund amount is \(32 \times 0.75 = 24\) dollars.

Now, we calculate how much money Milly will lose:
- The total cost Milly has to pay is the shipping cost plus the cost of the book.
- The cost of the book is $32.
- The total cost is $32 + $3.00 = $35.00.
- The loss is the total cost minus the refund amount.
- The loss is $35.00 - $24.00 = $11.00.

So, Milly will lose $11.00."
"First, let's calculate how much money Mulan has after her father gave her $100. She originally had $40, so:

\[ 40 + 100 = 140 \]

Next, we need to subtract the cost of the items she bought. She bought two pairs of jeans at $30 each and a bag for $20. The total cost of the jeans is:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Adding the cost of the bag:

\[ 60 + 20 = 80 \]

Now, we subtract the total cost of the items from the money she had after her father gave her the money:

\[ 140 - 80 = 60 \]

So, the final amount of money Mulan has left is:

\[ 60 \]"
"To find out how many bars of chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to first calculate how many bars he produces in the first three weeks and then subtract that from the total monthly production.

First week: 8,000 bars
Second week: Half of the first week, so 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars
Third week: Three times the first week, so 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars

Now, let's add up the production for the first three weeks:
8,000 (first week) + 4,000 (second week) + 24,000 (third week) = 36,000 bars

Boris produces 50,000 bars each month, so to find out how many he produces in the fourth week, we subtract the total production of the first three weeks from the monthly total:
50,000 (total monthly production) - 36,000 (production of first three weeks) = 14,000 bars

So, Boris produces 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week."
"First, let's calculate the time Britany spends on TikTok videos each week.

She records 18 videos each week, and each video is 4 minutes long. So, the total time spent on TikTok videos each week is:
\[ 18 \text{ videos} \times 4 \text{ minutes per video} = 72 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time she spends writing songs each week. She spends 2 hours a week writing songs. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 2 hours is:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's calculate the time she spends on makeup each week. She spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup. So, the total time spent on makeup each week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes per day} \times 6 \text{ days per week} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's add up the time she spends on TikTok videos, writing songs, and doing makeup each week:
\[ 72 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} + 90 \text{ minutes} = 282 \text{ minutes} \]

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly total by 4 to find the monthly total:
\[ 282 \text{ minutes per week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 1128 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month is:
\[ \boxed{1128} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost for the additional items Angela needs.

Angela needs:
- 6 mirrors
- 2 chandeliers
- 20 pictures

The cost for each additional item is $15.00.

So, the cost for the mirrors is:
6 mirrors * $15.00/mirror = $90.00

The cost for the chandeliers is:
2 chandeliers * $15.00/chandelier = $30.00

The cost for the pictures is:
20 pictures * $15.00/picture = $300.00

Now, let's add up the cost for the additional items:
$90.00 (mirrors) + $30.00 (chandeliers) + $300.00 (pictures) = $420.00

The base installation cost is $129.00.

So, the total cost for Angela is:
$129.00 (base installation) + $420.00 (additional items) = $549.00

The final numerical answer is $549.00."
"First, let's find out how much money Anthony has saved. Since Eva has saved $20.00 and Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, we can calculate Anthony's savings as follows:

Anthony's savings = Eva's savings + $10.00
Anthony's savings = $20.00 + $10.00
Anthony's savings = $30.00

Now, we know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find out how much more Roy has saved, we calculate 40% of Anthony's savings:

40% of Anthony's savings = 0.40 * $30.00
40% of Anthony's savings = $12.00

So, Roy has saved $12.00 more than Anthony. Now we can find out how much Roy has saved in total:

Roy's savings = Anthony's savings + $12.00
Roy's savings = $30.00 + $12.00
Roy's savings = $42.00

The final numerical answer is $42.00."
"First, let's figure out how high each person can lift a mountain based on the information given.

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain \(12 \times 1 = 12\) inches high.
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain \(4 \times 12 = 48\) inches high.
4. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain \(10 \times 48 = 480\) inches high.

Now, we need to convert 480 inches into feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we divide 480 by 12.

\[ 480 \div 12 = 40 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 40 feet."
"Mason travels at a rate of 8 miles per hour for 4 hours, so he covers:
\[ 8 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 32 \text{ miles} \]

Then he travels for another 6 hours, so he covers:
\[ 8 \text{ miles/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 48 \text{ miles} \]

Adding both distances together, the total distance he has traveled is:
\[ 32 \text{ miles} + 48 \text{ miles} = 80 \text{ miles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 80 miles."
"First, let's understand the information given:
- 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway.
- Each kangaroo travels at the same speed.
- Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo.

To find out how long it will take for 4 turtles to cross the highway, we need to consider the speed relationship between the kangaroos and the turtles.

If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway, we can think of the total distance as being covered by the combined speed of the 3 kangaroos over 18 hours. If we let the speed of one kangaroo be \( v \), then the total distance \( D \) can be calculated as:
\[ D = 3v \times 18 \]

Now, if we have 4 turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, the speed of one turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \). The total speed of 4 turtles is:
\[ 4 \times \frac{v}{2} = 2v \]

We need to find out how long it will take for these 4 turtles to cover the same distance \( D \). Using the formula \( \text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \), we get:
\[ \text{time} = \frac{D}{2v} \]

Substituting \( D = 3v \times 18 \) into the equation:
\[ \text{time} = \frac{3v \times 18}{2v} \]
\[ \text{time} = \frac{3 \times 18}{2} \]
\[ \text{time} = \frac{54}{2} \]
\[ \text{time} = 27 \]

So, it will take 4 turtles 27 hours to cross the highway."
"First, let's find out how many dishes each person made.

Kora made 20 dishes.

Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory made:
20 (Kora's dishes) + 20 = 40 dishes.

Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made:
2 * 40 (Rory's dishes) = 80 dishes.

Now, to find out how many dishes they all made together, we add the number of dishes each person made:
20 (Kora's dishes) + 40 (Rory's dishes) + 80 (Jada's dishes) = 140 dishes.

So, the total number of clay dishes they all made together is 140."
"First, let's find out the final price of the laptop after the trade-in discount. The original price of the laptop is $600, and the discount is $200. So, the final price is:

\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means she has $400 - $50 = $350 now.

We know that Erika has already been paid $150 for her part-time job and her mom will give her $80. So, the total amount of money she has now is:

\[ 150 + 80 = 230 \]

Since the total amount she has now is $350, the amount of money she has in her purse is:

\[ 350 - 230 = 120 \]

So, Erika has $120 in her purse."
"First, let's calculate the total number of slices from the large apples. Adam slices 3 large apples, and each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces. So, the total number of slices from the large apples is:
\[ 3 \text{ apples} \times 5 \text{ slices/apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of slices from the small apples. Adam slices 5 small apples, and each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces. So, the total number of slices from the small apples is:
\[ 5 \text{ apples} \times 3 \text{ slices/apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's find the total number of slices Adam has after slicing all the apples:
\[ 15 \text{ slices from large apples} + 15 \text{ slices from small apples} = 30 \text{ slices} \]

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:
\[ 30 \text{ slices} - 15 \text{ slices} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

So, the final number of apple slices left is:
\[ 15 \]"
"First, let's find out how much milk 3 cows produce in a day. Since each cow gives 5 liters of milk a day, 3 cows will give:

\[ 3 \text{ cows} \times 5 \text{ liters/cow} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. To find out how many more cows are needed, we need to calculate the difference between the desired milk production and the current milk production:

\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cows are needed to produce 10 liters of milk a day. Since each cow produces 5 liters a day, we divide the needed milk by the milk each cow produces:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

So, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The final numerical answer is:

2"
"To solve this, we need to calculate how much of each glue stick is not used and then add those amounts together.

1. For the first glue stick, which has 1/6 left, the amount not used is:
   \[
   12 \text{ mm} - \left(12 \times \frac{1}{6}\right) = 12 \text{ mm} - 2 \text{ mm} = 10 \text{ mm}
   \]

2. For the second glue stick, which has 2/3 left, the amount not used is:
   \[
   12 \text{ mm} - \left(12 \times \frac{2}{3}\right) = 12 \text{ mm} - 8 \text{ mm} = 4 \text{ mm}
   \]

3. For the third glue stick, which has 1/2 left, the amount not used is:
   \[
   12 \text{ mm} - \left(12 \times \frac{1}{2}\right) = 12 \text{ mm} - 6 \text{ mm} = 6 \text{ mm}
   \]

Now, we add the amounts not used from all three glue sticks:
\[
10 \text{ mm} + 4 \text{ mm} + 6 \text{ mm} = 20 \text{ mm}
\]

So, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 20 millimeters."
"First, let's add up all the money Gabriel has:
- Money from working on weekends: $5000
- Money given by his brother: $200

Now, let's add these amounts together:
$5000 + $200 = $5200

Next, we need to find out the total cost of the car and the phone:
- Cost of the car: $10000
- Cost of the phone: $800

Now, let's add these costs together:
$10000 + $800 = $10800

Finally, to find out how much more money Gabriel needs, we subtract the total amount of money he has from the total cost of the car and the phone:
$10800 - $5200 = $5600

So, Gabriel still needs $5600."
"First, let's find out how much money Thea gave to the craftsman. She gave four $20 bills. So, we need to multiply 4 by 20.

4 * 20 = 80

Thea gave $80 to the craftsman. The hat she bought was worth $70. To find out how much change she got, we subtract the cost of the hat from the amount she gave.

80 - 70 = 10

So, Thea got $10 in change."
"First, let's calculate how much money Craig has initially. He has 2 twenty dollar bills, so:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the squirt guns. He buys 6 squirt guns at $2 each, so:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the packs of water balloons. He buys 3 packs at $3 each, so:
\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's find out the total cost of the squirt guns and the packs of water balloons:
\[ 12 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, let's find out how much money Craig has left after his purchases:
\[ 40 - 21 = 19 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"If Jack collected 60 dishes, and Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, then Peter collected half as many dishes as Jack. So, Peter collected:

\[ \text{Peter's dishes} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, and Jack has the same number of socks as dishes, which is 60, then Peter has:

\[ \text{Peter's socks} = 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

Now, to find the total number of socks and dishes they have together, we add Peter's and Jack's socks and dishes:

\[ \text{Total socks} = 120 + 60 = 180 \]
\[ \text{Total dishes} = 30 + 60 = 90 \]

So, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is:

\[ \text{Total} = 180 + 90 = 270 \]

The final numerical answer is 270."
"First, let's add the number of students who are good at math only and those who perform well in English only:
5 (good at math only) + 8 (perform well in English only) = 13 students

Since there are 20 students in total, the number of students who are good at both math and English is:
20 total students - 13 students (good at math only or English only) = 7 students

So, the number of students who are good at math (which includes those who are good at both math and English) is:
5 (good at math only) + 7 (good at both) = 12 students

The final numerical answer is 12."
"First, let's calculate the total time each group takes to perform, including the time to get on stage, perform, and exit the stage. Each group takes:

2 minutes (getting on stage) + 6 minutes (performing) + 2 minutes (exiting) = 10 minutes per group.

Next, we need to add the time for the intermission. The intermission is 10 minutes long.

So, the total time for one group including the intermission is:

10 minutes (group performance) + 10 minutes (intermission) = 20 minutes per group.

Now, we know the concert is 2 hours long. We need to convert 2 hours into minutes to make it easier to calculate how many groups can perform:

2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.

To find out how many groups can perform in the concert, we divide the total concert time by the time each group takes:

120 minutes (concert time) ÷ 20 minutes (time per group) = 6 groups.

So, the final numerical answer is 6."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the principal amount (P):**
   The principal amount is the initial amount Brenda invested, which is $300.

2. **Determine the annual interest rate (r):**
   The interest rate is given as three-quarters of the original amount per year. So, the annual interest rate is:
   \[
   r = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225\%
   \]

3. **Calculate the total interest earned over 3 years:**
   Simple interest is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Interest} = P \times r \times t
   \]
   where \( t \) is the time in years. Here, \( P = 300 \), \( r = 225\% = 2.25 \) (as a decimal), and \( t = 3 \) years.
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 300 \times 2.25 \times 3 = 2025
   \]

4. **Calculate the total amount after 3 years:**
   The total amount after 3 years is the sum of the principal and the interest earned.
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = P + \text{Interest} = 300 + 2025 = 2325
   \]

So, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is $2325."
"First, let's find out how many white shirts have collars and how many don't.

There are 40 white shirts in total. Half of them have collars, so:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ white shirts have collars.} \]
Therefore, the number of white shirts without collars is:
\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ white shirts without collars.} \]

Next, we know that 20 of the 50 floral shirts have buttons. So, the number of floral shirts without buttons is:
\[ 50 - 20 = 30 \text{ floral shirts without buttons.} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more floral shirts without buttons there are than white shirts without collars:
\[ 30 - 20 = 10. \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 10. \]"
"First, we need to find out how many trays the farmer needs to hold all 900 eggs. Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold:

\[ \text{Number of trays} = \frac{\text{Total number of eggs}}{\text{Number of eggs per tray}} = \frac{900}{30} = 30 \]

So, the farmer needs 30 trays to hold all the eggs.

Next, we need to calculate the total earnings. Since each tray is sold for $2.5, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of trays} \times \text{Price per tray} = 30 \times 2.5 = 75 \]

Therefore, the farmer will earn $75 if he sells all the trays."
"First, let's find out how many goats Mr. Smith sold from each farm.

From Farm X, he sold 10 goats.
From Farm Y, he sold twice as many as from Farm X, so he sold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) goats.

Now, let's calculate how many goats are left in each farm.

In Farm X, he originally had 55 goats and sold 10, so the number of goats left is \(55 - 10 = 45\).

In Farm Y, he originally had 45 goats and sold 20, so the number of goats left is \(45 - 20 = 25\).

To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the goats left in Farm X and Farm Y together:

\(45 + 25 = 70\)

So, the final numerical answer is 70."
"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
2. Divide the total amount he spends on shoes by the total number of pairs he buys.

First, since James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month, we can calculate the total number of pairs he buys in a year:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

Next, we know that he spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs:
\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

So, the average amount James pays for each pair of shoes is $110."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the green food. Since each basket of green food costs $25 and you are buying 3 baskets, the total cost for the green food is:
\[ 25 \times 3 = 75 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the red food. Each basket of red food costs $18, but you get $2 off for each basket. So, the cost per basket of red food after the discount is:
\[ 18 - 2 = 16 \]
Since you are buying 3 baskets of red food, the total cost for the red food is:
\[ 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

Now, we add the total cost of the green food and the total cost of the red food to find the overall total cost:
\[ 75 + 48 = 123 \]

So, the total amount you will have to pay is:
\[ 123 \]"
"First, we need to find out how many rooms are half of 90 rooms. Half of 90 is 45 rooms.

Next, we know it takes 20 minutes to clean each room. So, to clean 45 rooms, it would take 45 rooms * 20 minutes/room = 900 minutes.

To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60 because there are 60 minutes in an hour. So, 900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours.

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first year, the town builds 12 homes.
2. In the second year, they build three times the number of homes they built in the first year. So, they build \(3 \times 12 = 36\) homes.
3. In the third year, they double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total number of homes built in the first two years is \(12 + 36 = 48\). So, in the third year, they build \(2 \times 48 = 96\) homes.

Now, let's add up all the homes built over the three years:
- First year: 12 homes
- Second year: 36 homes
- Third year: 96 homes

Total homes built = \(12 + 36 + 96 = 144\)

So, the town will have built 144 homes over the next three years."
"Let's denote the ages as follows:
- Your age = \( x \)
- Your brother's age = \( x + 3 \)
- Your sister's age = \( x - 2 \)

According to the problem, the sum of your ages, your brother's age, and your sister's age is 87. So we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) = 87 \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:
\[ x + x + 3 + x - 2 = 87 \]
\[ 3x + 1 = 87 \]

Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3x = 86 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = \frac{86}{3} \]
\[ x = 28.67 \]

Since we are dealing with ages and the result is not a whole number, it seems there might be a misunderstanding or a need for rechecking the problem statement. However, based on the given information and the steps followed, the age of the person you are asking about is 28.67 years. But typically, ages are whole numbers, so let's assume the problem might have a slight rounding or simplification issue. 

The final numerical answer, considering the problem constraints and the steps followed, is:

"First, we need to find out how many glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs in total. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, we multiply 27 by 2:

\[ 27 \times 2 = 54 \]

So, Mr. Jackson needs 54 glue sticks in total.

Next, we need to figure out how many packs of glue sticks he needs to buy. Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:

\[ 54 \div 8 = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number. This means he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[ 7 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Amount of Water**: The initial amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

2. **After a Day of Heavy Rain**: The amount of water doubles. So, we calculate:
   \[
   4000 \text{ gallons} \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **On the Third Day**: The volume of water increases by 6000 gallons. So, we add 6000 gallons to the amount of water on the third day:
   \[
   8000 \text{ gallons} + 6000 \text{ gallons} = 14000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point on the third day is 14000 gallons."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand how the infection spreads each day. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Day 0 (initial):** We start with 10 people infected.
2. **Day 1:** Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others. So, the number of new infections on Day 1 is \(10 \times 6 = 60\). Adding these to the initial 10, the total number of infected people at the end of Day 1 is \(10 + 60 = 70\).
3. **Day 2:** Now, there are 70 infected people. Each of these 70 people infects 6 others. So, the number of new infections on Day 2 is \(70 \times 6 = 420\). Adding these to the 70 from the previous day, the total number of infected people at the end of Day 2 is \(70 + 420 = 490\).
4. **Day 3:** Now, there are 490 infected people. Each of these 490 people infects 6 others. So, the number of new infections on Day 3 is \(490 \times 6 = 2940\). Adding these to the 490 from the previous day, the total number of infected people at the end of Day 3 is \(490 + 2940 = 3430\).

So, the total number of people infected after three days is \(\boxed{3430}\)."
"First, let's find out how much money Rafaela received as tips. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate her total tips by multiplying the number of customers by the amount each customer gave:

\[ \text{Rafaela's total tips} = 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money Julieta received as tips. Julieta received 10% less money than Rafaela. To find out how much less, we calculate 10% of Rafaela's total tips:

\[ \text{10% of Rafaela's total tips} = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]

So, Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela, which means she received:

\[ \text{Julieta's total tips} = 800 - 80 = 720 \]

Now, to find out how much money Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether, we add their individual totals:

\[ \text{Total tips} = \text{Rafaela's total tips} + \text{Julieta's total tips} = 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

So, the total amount of money Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether is:

"First, let's understand how many badges each person earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge every month. So in a year (which has 12 months), Claire earns:
\[ 1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 12 \text{ badges/year} \]

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire. So Amber earns:
\[ \frac{1 \text{ badge}}{2 \text{ months}} = 0.5 \text{ badges/month} \]
In a year, Amber earns:
\[ 0.5 \text{ badges/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 6 \text{ badges/year} \]

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. So Wendy earns:
\[ 3 \times 12 \text{ badges/year} = 36 \text{ badges/year} \]

Now, to find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns:
\[ 36 \text{ badges/year} - 6 \text{ badges/year} = 30 \text{ badges/year} \]

So, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a year."
"First, let's calculate how many hours Paige bakes banana bread. She starts at 1:00 PM and stops at 6:00 PM, so she bakes for 5 hours.

Since she can bake 2 banana bread loaves every hour, in 5 hours she can bake:
\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so in 10 loaves, she gets:
\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, so the total amount raised in cents is:
\[ 80 \text{ slices} \times 50 \text{ cents/slice} = 4000 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, the total amount raised in dollars is:
\[ \frac{4000 \text{ cents}}{100 \text{ cents/dollar}} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 40 \]"
"If Gretchen has 70 gold coins and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, then she has 70 - 30 = 40 silver coins.

To find the total number of coins, we add the number of gold coins and silver coins together: 70 gold coins + 40 silver coins = 110 coins.

So, the final numerical answer is 110."
"First, let's find out how many burritos were given to the students. There were 50 students and each student was given 10 burritos.

So, the total number of burritos given to students is:
\[ 50 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ burritos/student} = 500 \text{ burritos} \]

Next, we need to account for the burritos Mr. George ate. He ate 20 burritos.

So, the total number of burritos given out (to students and Mr. George) is:
\[ 500 \text{ burritos} + 20 \text{ burritos} = 520 \text{ burritos} \]

George ordered 600 burritos in total. To find out how many burritos were leftover, we subtract the total number of burritos given out from the total number of burritos ordered:

"First, let's find out how many green cars there are. Since there are 2 fewer green cars than red cars, and there are 12 red cars, we can calculate the number of green cars as follows:

Number of green cars = Number of red cars - 2
Number of green cars = 12 - 2
Number of green cars = 10

Next, we need to find out how many blue cars there are. The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars. So:

Number of blue cars = 3 * Number of green cars
Number of blue cars = 3 * 10
Number of blue cars = 30

Now, let's add up all the red, green, and blue cars:

Total of red, green, and blue cars = Number of red cars + Number of green cars + Number of blue cars
Total of red, green, and blue cars = 12 + 10 + 30
Total of red, green, and blue cars = 52

The rink has 75 cars in total. To find out how many yellow cars there are, we subtract the total of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:

Number of yellow cars = Total number of cars - Total of red, green, and blue cars
Number of yellow cars = 75 - 52
Number of yellow cars = 23

So, the rink has 23 yellow cars."
"Let's break this down step by step.

First, let's define the number of books each person has:
- Let \( F \) be the number of books Fawn has.
- Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Anne has \( F - 12 \) books.
- Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has \( (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \) books.

Now, we know the total number of books they have together is 85. So we can write the equation:
\[ F + (F - 12) + (F + 13) = 85 \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:
\[ F + F - 12 + F + 13 = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books. Let's check the answer:
- Fawn has 28 books.
- Anne has \( 28 - 12 = 16 \) books.
- Sofie has \( 28 + 13 = 41 \) books.
- The total number of books is \( 28 + 16 + 41 = 85 \), which matches the given total.

Therefore, the number of books Fawn has is 28."
"First, we need to find out how much the sweet potatoes weigh. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, we can calculate the weight of the sweet potatoes as follows:

\[ \text{Weight of sweet potatoes} = 2 \times \text{Weight of potatoes} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out how much the carrots weigh. The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so we can calculate the weight of the carrots as follows:

\[ \text{Weight of carrots} = \text{Weight of sweet potatoes} - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Daisy bought 7 pounds of carrots."
"First, let's find out how many jello cups Greg needs to make. Since there are 30 kids and each kid should have 4 jello cups, we multiply 30 by 4:

30 kids * 4 jello cups/kid = 120 jello cups

Now, we know that a three-ounce box of flavored jello makes 10 small jello cups. To find out how many boxes of jello Greg needs, we divide the total number of jello cups by the number of jello cups made by one box:

120 jello cups / 10 jello cups/box = 12 boxes

Each box of jello costs $1.25, so to find out the total cost, we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:

12 boxes * $1.25/box = $15

So, Greg will spend $15 on jello."
"First, we need to find out the total cost of the 5 phones. Each phone costs $700, so:

\[ 5 \text{ phones} \times \$700 \text{ per phone} = \$3500 \]

The seller received $4000 in dollar bills. To find out the change the seller will give back, we subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount received:

\[ \$4000 - \$3500 = \$500 \]

So, the seller will give back $500 in change."
"First, let's find out how much Madeline pays in a month. Since she pays 60% of the $400, we calculate:

\[ \text{Madeline's monthly payment} = 400 \times \frac{60}{100} = 400 \times 0.60 = 240 \]

So, Madeline pays $240 per month. This means Keenan pays the remaining 40% of the $400:

\[ \text{Keenan's monthly payment} = 400 - 240 = 160 \]

Now, to find out how much Keenan spends per week, we divide his monthly payment by the number of weeks in a month. There are 4 weeks in a month, so:

\[ \text{Keenan's weekly payment} = \frac{160}{4} = 40 \]

So, Keenan spends $40 per week."
"First, let's find out how many pieces Tobias ate on the first day. He ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces.

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \]

So, he ate 24 pieces on the first day. Now, let's find out how many pieces are left after the first day.

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces. So, let's find out how many pieces are left after the second day.

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Now, Tobias ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces on the third day. Let's find out how many pieces that is.

\[ \frac{7}{13} \times 26 = 14 \]

So, he ate 14 pieces on the third day. Now, let's find out how many pieces are left after the third day.

\[ 26 - 14 = 12 \]

Now, let's add up all the pieces he ate over the three days.

\[ 24 + 10 + 14 = 48 \]

So, Tobias has eaten 48 pieces of pizza so far."
"First, let's find out the cost of one bottle of soda. If seven bottles of soda cost $21.00, then one bottle of soda costs $21.00 / 7 = $3.00.

Next, let's find out the cost of one bottle of water. If four bottles of water cost $8, then one bottle of water costs $8 / 4 = $2.00.

Now, David wants to buy 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water. The cost for 3 bottles of soda is 3 * $3.00 = $9.00.

The cost for 2 bottles of water is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

So, the total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00.

The final numerical answer is $13.00."
"First, let's find out how much 16 bolts cost. Each bolt costs $0.03, so we multiply the cost of one bolt by the number of bolts:

\[ 0.03 \times 16 = 0.48 \]

So, 16 bolts cost $0.48. Now, we need to subtract this cost from the $12.48 David has:

\[ 12.48 - 0.48 = 12.00 \]

So, after buying the bolts, David has $12.00 left."
"First, we need to find out how much Ella earns per hour. We know she earned $33 for 3 hours, so we can calculate her hourly rate by dividing the total amount she earned by the number of hours she worked.

Hourly rate = Total earnings / Hours worked
Hourly rate = $33 / 3 hours
Hourly rate = $11 per hour

Now that we know Ella earns $11 per hour, we can calculate how much she would earn after 12 hours of work.

Total earnings for 12 hours = Hourly rate * Hours worked
Total earnings for 12 hours = $11 per hour * 12 hours
Total earnings for 12 hours = $132

So, Ella would earn $132 after 12 hours of dog walking."
"First, we need to find out how many marbles Paul has after his friend gives him more marbles. Paul originally has 52 marbles and his friend gives him 28 more. So, we add these together:

\[ 52 + 28 = 80 \]

Now, Paul has 80 marbles. Next, we need to find out how many marbles he loses. He loses 1/4 of his marbles. To find out how many marbles that is, we calculate 1/4 of 80:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20 \]

So, Paul loses 20 marbles. To find out how many marbles he has left, we subtract the 20 marbles he lost from the 80 marbles he had:

\[ 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of marbles Paul has left is 60."
"First, let's calculate the number of questions Amy got right in each type:

For multiple-choice questions:
- There are 10 questions.
- She got 80% of them right.
- So, the number of correct multiple-choice questions = 10 * 0.80 = 8 questions.

For true/false questions:
- There are 20 questions.
- She got 90% of them right.
- So, the number of correct true/false questions = 20 * 0.90 = 18 questions.

For long-answer questions:
- There are 5 questions.
- She got 60% of them right.
- So, the number of correct long-answer questions = 5 * 0.60 = 3 questions.

Now, let's calculate the total points she scored:

- Points from multiple-choice questions = 8 questions * 1 point/question = 8 points.
- Points from true/false questions = 18 questions * 1 point/question = 18 points.
- Points from long-answer questions = 3 questions * 5 points/question = 15 points.

Total points = Points from multiple-choice + Points from true/false + Points from long-answer
Total points = 8 + 18 + 15 = 41 points.

So, the final numerical answer is 41 points."
"First, let's find out how many chickens Isaias plans to sell. He plans to sell 3/5 of his 300 chickens.

\[ \text{Number of chickens to sell} = \frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \]

Next, we know that he plans to sell each chicken for $50. So, the total money he will get from selling 180 chickens is:

\[ \text{Total money from selling} = 180 \times 50 = 9000 \]

Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. To find out how much he bought the chickens for, we need to subtract the profit from the total money he will get from selling the chickens.

\[ \text{Cost of the chickens} = \text{Total money from selling} - \text{Profit} \]
\[ \text{Cost of the chickens} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \]

So, Isaias bought the chickens for $7000."
"First, let's find out how many glasses Micah sold. We know that Julie sold 14 glasses and the total number of glasses sold by Julie, Micah, and Mitchell is 32. So, we can subtract the number of glasses Julie sold from the total to find out how many glasses Micah and Mitchell sold together.

32 - 14 = 18 glasses

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the remaining glasses by 2:

18 ÷ 2 = 9 glasses

So, Micah sold 9 glasses.

Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold:

14 - 9 = 5 glasses

So, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah. The final numerical answer is 5."
"First, let's find out how much Iris spent on the manicure. She spent 1/4 as much on the manicure as she did on the hair, which was $400. So, the cost of the manicure is:

\[ \text{Cost of manicure} = \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100 \]

Next, we need to find out how much she spent on the pedicure. She spent 3/4 as much on the pedicure as she did on the manicure. So, the cost of the pedicure is:

\[ \text{Cost of pedicure} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \]

Now, we can find the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa by adding the cost of the hair, manicure, and pedicure:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 400 + 100 + 75 = 575 \]

So, the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa is $575."
"First, let's find out how much money Sarah will get from selling her rope. The rope is 20 meters long and she sells it at $2 per meter.

\[ \text{Total money from selling the rope} = 20 \text{ meters} \times \$2/\text{meter} = \$40 \]

Now, Sarah plans to use this $40 to buy a new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter. To find out how many meters of the new rope she can buy, we divide the total money she has by the cost per meter of the new rope.

\[ \text{Meters of new rope she can buy} = \frac{\$40}{\$1.5/\text{meter}} = \frac{40}{1.5} = \frac{400}{15} = \frac{80}{3} \approx 26.67 \text{ meters} \]

Since she can only buy whole meters of rope, she can buy 26 meters of the new rope. Now, let's calculate the cost of 26 meters of the new rope.

\[ \text{Cost of 26 meters of new rope} = 26 \text{ meters} \times \$1.5/\text{meter} = \$39 \]

Finally, to find out how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the money she got from selling her rope.

\[ \text{Money left over} = \$40 - \$39 = \$1 \]

So, Sarah will have $1 left over after she buys the new rope."
"To solve this, let's first find out how old Melanie is now. If in 10 years she will be 18 years old, then currently she is:

\[ 18 - 10 = 8 \text{ years old} \]

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Her current age is 8, so three times her current age is:

\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

To find out how many years it will take for her to be 24 years old, we subtract her current age from 24:

\[ 24 - 8 = 16 \]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her present age. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 16 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of each item Kelly has in her cart.

1. The cost of bacon:
   Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total.
   So, the cost of one pack of bacon is $10 / 5 = $2.

2. The cost of chicken:
   Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   So, each packet of chicken costs $2 * 2 = $4.
   Kelly has 6 packets of chicken.
   So, the total cost of chicken is $4 * 6 = $24.

3. The cost of strawberries:
   Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries.
   So, the total cost of strawberries is $4 * 3 = $12.

4. The cost of apples:
   Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   So, each pack of apples costs $4 / 2 = $2.
   Kelly has 7 packs of apples.
   So, the total cost of apples is $2 * 7 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
Total cost = Cost of bacon + Cost of chicken + Cost of strawberries + Cost of apples
Total cost = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60.

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget:
Money left = Budget - Total cost
Money left = $65 - $60 = $5.

So, Kelly has $5 left in her budget."
"To solve this, let's break down the information given:

1. The final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts.
2. The final concert also includes a 15-minute encore.
3. The total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes.

First, we need to find out how long the concert itself is without the encore. We subtract the encore time from the total runtime:

\[ 65 \text{ minutes} - 15 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

This 50 minutes is the length of the concert itself, which is twice the length of her usual concerts. Let's denote the usual concert length as \( x \). Therefore, we have:

\[ 2x = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the usual concerts run for 25 minutes."
"First, let's find out how many toys Argo gave away in total. He gave 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky. So, we add these numbers together:

40 + 80 + 30 = 150 toys

Argo originally had 200 toys. After giving away 150 toys, we subtract the number of toys given away from the original number of toys:

200 - 150 = 50 toys

So, Argo has 50 toys now."
"To find out how many chimichangas the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes on those three days, we need to add up the number of chimichangas made each day.

On Tuesday, they make 125 chimichangas.
On Wednesday, they also make 125 chimichangas.
On Friday, they make twice as many as on Tuesday, which is 125 * 2 = 250 chimichangas.

Now, let's add them up:
125 (Tuesday) + 125 (Wednesday) + 250 (Friday) = 500 chimichangas

So, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"First, let's find out how many microphones won't fit. If 20% of the microphones won't fit, then:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 10 \text{ microphones} \]

So, 10 microphones won't fit. This means the number of microphones that can fit into pairs is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ microphones} \]

Now, we need to find out how many pairs of microphones can be arranged with 40 microphones. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, we divide the number of microphones that can fit by 2:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ pairs} \]

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage."
"First, let's find out how many birds are flying overhead. Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes. The number of birds flying overhead is 2/3 of the number of birds nesting, which is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ birds} \]

Next, we need to find out how many birds are in the three groups feeding. Each group has 8 birds, so the total number of birds in the three groups is:

\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ birds} \]

Now, we add up all the birds Jerry counts:

- Birds nesting: 6
- Birds flying overhead: 4
- Birds feeding: 24

So the total number of birds is:

\[ 6 + 4 + 24 = 34 \]

The final numerical answer is 34."
"Lani started with 55 cookies and ate 5, so she had 55 - 5 = 50 cookies left.

She placed these 50 cookies equally into 5 jars, so each jar had 50 ÷ 5 = 10 cookies.

The final numerical answer is 10."
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals on the orchids. Joelle has 5 orchids and each orchid has 5 petals. So, the total number of petals on the orchids is:

\[ 5 \text{ orchids} \times 5 \text{ petals/orchid} = 25 \text{ petals} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals on the African daisies. Joelle has 4 African daisies and each daisy has 10 petals. So, the total number of petals on the daisies is:

\[ 4 \text{ daisies} \times 10 \text{ petals/daisy} = 40 \text{ petals} \]

Now, to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies:

\[ 40 \text{ petals} - 25 \text{ petals} = 15 \text{ petals} \]

So, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 15 \]"
"First, let's find out how many indoor plants there are. Since one-fourth of the plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Now, we subtract the number of indoor plants from the total number of plants to find out how many are left:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Next, we find out how many of these remaining plants are outdoor plants. Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants:

\[ \text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

Now, to find out how many plants are flowering plants, we subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:

\[ \text{Number of flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25 \]

To find out what percent of the total plants are flowering plants, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percent of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percent of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, 25% of the plants are flowering plants."
"First, we need to find out how fast a thingamabob spins. We know that a whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob and that it spins at 121 meters per second. So, to find the speed of a thingamabob, we divide the speed of a whatchamacallit by 11:

\[ \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{121 \text{ meters/second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters/second} \]

Now, we know that a whirligig spins five times faster than a thingamabob. So, to find the speed of a whirligig, we multiply the speed of a thingamabob by 5:

\[ \text{Speed of whirligig} = 11 \text{ meters/second} \times 5 = 55 \text{ meters/second} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 55 meters per second."
"First, let's find out how much Ellen pays for the salad and the yogurt each day.

The salad costs $6.
The yogurt costs half the price of the salad, so it costs $6 / 2 = $3.

Now, let's add the cost of the salad and the yogurt:
$6 (salad) + $3 (yogurt) = $9.

Ellen pays a total of $11 for her goods every day. So, the amount she spends on carrots is:
$11 (total) - $9 (salad and yogurt) = $2.

Ellen eats two carrots every day, so the cost of one carrot is:
$2 / 2 carrots = $1 per carrot.

The final numerical answer is $1."
"First, let's find out how much Mark makes per hour after the raise. He used to make $10 an hour and they raised his pay by $2 per hour. So, his new hourly wage is:

$10 + $2 = $12 per hour

Next, we need to calculate how much he makes in a day. He works 8 hours a day, so:

$12 per hour * 8 hours = $96 per day

Now, we need to find out how much he makes in a week. He works 5 days a week, so:

$96 per day * 5 days = $480 per week

So, the final numerical answer is $480."
"First, let's find out how much Tasha made from mowing lawns.

If Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's, and she mowed Joe's lawn once, then she mowed Kamala's lawn three times.

If Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's, and she mowed Joe's lawn once, then she mowed Alba's lawn five times.

Now, let's calculate the total money she made from mowing lawns.

For Joe's lawn, she made $6.
For Kamala's lawn, she made 3 times $6 = 3 * 6 = $18.
For Alba's lawn, she made 5 times $6 = 5 * 6 = $30.

So, the total money she made from mowing lawns is $6 + $18 + $30 = $54.

Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns last month. To find out how much she made from lemonade sales, we subtract the money she made from mowing lawns from the total money she made.

So, the money she made from lemonade sales is $80 - $54 = $26.

The final numerical answer is $26."
"First, let's find out how much Carl weighs. Since Carl weighs 16 kg more than Martin, and Martin weighs 55 kg, we can calculate Carl's weight as follows:

Carl's weight = Martin's weight + 16 kg
Carl's weight = 55 kg + 16 kg
Carl's weight = 71 kg

Now, we know that Christian weighs 8 kg more than Carl. So, we can find Christian's weight:

Christian's weight = Carl's weight + 8 kg
Christian's weight = 71 kg + 8 kg
Christian's weight = 79 kg

Finally, Harry weighs 5 kg less than Christian. So, we can find Harry's weight:

Harry's weight = Christian's weight - 5 kg
Harry's weight = 79 kg - 5 kg
Harry's weight = 74 kg

So, the weight of Harry is 74 kg."
"First, let's calculate how many hours John rents his car out in a month. He rents it 10 times a month and each time it's for 3 hours. So, we multiply 10 by 3:

10 * 3 = 30 hours

Now, we know he gets $25 for each hour. So, to find out how much he earns in a month, we multiply the number of hours he rents the car by the amount he gets paid per hour:

30 * 25 = $750

John's car payment is $500. To find out his profit, we subtract the car payment from the total amount he earns:

750 - 500 = $250

So, John makes a profit of $250 on his car."
"First, let's find out how many notebooks Martha originally had. We know that after buying 5 more notebooks, Martha has a total of 7 notebooks. So, we subtract the 5 notebooks she bought from the total to find out how many she originally had:

7 notebooks (total now) - 5 notebooks (bought) = 2 notebooks (originally had)

Now, we know that Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha originally had. So, we multiply the number of notebooks Martha originally had by 3 to find out how many Joseph had:

2 notebooks (Martha originally had) * 3 = 6 notebooks (Joseph had)

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. We subtract the number of notebooks Joseph had from the number of notebooks Martha now has:

7 notebooks (Martha now has) - 6 notebooks (Joseph has) = 1 notebook

So, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph. The final numerical answer is:

1"
"First, let's find out how many miles Anis rowed. We know that Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. Since Dijana rowed 50 miles, we can calculate the additional miles Anis rowed by finding 1/5 of 50 miles.

\[ \text{Additional miles Anis rowed} = \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add this additional distance to the distance Dijana rowed to find the total distance Anis rowed.

\[ \text{Total miles Anis rowed} = 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Now, to find the total distance both Dijana and Anis rowed, we add the distances they each rowed.

\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance Dijana rowed} + \text{Distance Anis rowed} = 50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles} \]

So, the total distance the two of them rowed on that day is 110 miles."
"First, we need to find out how many cookies Susan would have if she didn't give any to her husband. She made 100 cookies and her husband took 4, so:

\[ 100 - 4 = 96 \]

Now, Susan wants to divide these 96 cookies equally among her 6 nephews. To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we divide 96 by 6:

\[ 96 \div 6 = 16 \]

So, each of Susan’s nephews will get 16 cookies."
"First, let's find out how many pages Denise read today. According to the question, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel did yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages today.

Now, let's add up the pages each of them read over the two days.

Denise's total pages read:
Yesterday: 10 pages
Today: 18 pages
Total: 10 + 18 = 28 pages

Daniel's total pages read:
Yesterday: 13 pages
Today: 0 pages
Total: 13 + 0 = 13 pages

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract Daniel's total from Denise's total:
28 - 13 = 15 pages

So, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel."
"First, let's figure out how much soup Calvin has. The pot can fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls. Since Calvin is an adult, he will eat from the adult bowls. So, the pot can fill 4 adult's bowls.

Now, there are 4 people eating: Calvin, his wife, and their two children. Each person will have one bowl of soup. So, they will need 4 bowls of soup.

Since the pot can fill 4 adult's bowls, it can also fill 8 child's bowls. With 4 bowls needed, the pot can provide soup for 4 child's bowls.

Therefore, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, and there will be no leftover soup for the second bowl.

The final numerical answer is:
1"
"To find out how much William spent, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen separately and then add them together.

The cost of one notebook is $1.50. William bought five notebooks, so the total cost for the notebooks is:
\[ 1.50 \times 5 = 7.50 \]

The cost of one ballpen is $0.50. William bought one ballpen, so the total cost for the ballpen is:
\[ 0.50 \times 1 = 0.50 \]

Now, we add the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen together to find the total amount William spent:
\[ 7.50 + 0.50 = 8.00 \]

So, William spent a total of $8.00."
"First, let's find out how much material Jo needs to make one small mask and one large mask.

For small masks:
- 2 yards of material make 4 small masks.
- So, 1 yard of material makes 4/2 = 2 small masks.
- Therefore, to make 1 small mask, Jo needs 1/2 = 0.5 yards of material.

For large masks:
- 2.25 yards of material make 3 large masks.
- So, 1 yard of material makes 3/2.25 = 1.333... (or 4/3) large masks.
- Therefore, to make 1 large mask, Jo needs 1/1.333... = 0.75 yards of material.

Now, let's calculate the material needed for 20 small masks and 8 large masks.

For 20 small masks:
- 20 small masks * 0.5 yards per small mask = 10 yards.

For 8 large masks:
- 8 large masks * 0.75 yards per large mask = 6 yards.

Adding these together:
- 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards.

So, Jo would need 16 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks."
"First, we need to find out the total number of tickets Deepa has bought. Since she has seen each of the 9 movies three times, the total number of tickets is:

\[ 9 \text{ movies} \times 3 \text{ times per movie} = 27 \text{ tickets} \]

Deepa has spent $216 in total for these 27 tickets. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets:

\[ \text{Average price per ticket} = \frac{\$216}{27 \text{ tickets}} \]

Now, let's do the division:

\[ \frac{\$216}{27} = \$8 \]

So, the average price Deepa paid per ticket is:

\[ \$8 \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
- He works for 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours.
- He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, let's calculate the total time he spends on these activities:

- Sleep: 10 hours
- Work: 8 hours
- Dog walking: 1 hour

Total time spent = Sleep + Work + Dog walking
Total time spent = 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 hours

Since there are 24 hours in a day, the free time Harold has left is:

Free time = Total hours in a day - Total time spent
Free time = 24 - 19 = 5 hours

So, the final numerical answer is 5 hours."
"First, let's find out how many blue shoe boxes Tim uses. He uses 3 blue shoe boxes.

Now, let's find out how many red shoe boxes he uses. He uses 1/3 of his red shoe boxes. He has 9 red shoe boxes, so:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3 \]
So, he uses 3 red shoe boxes.

Now, let's calculate how many blue shoe boxes are left:
\[ 7 - 3 = 4 \]
So, 4 blue shoe boxes are left.

And let's calculate how many red shoe boxes are left:
\[ 9 - 3 = 6 \]
So, 6 red shoe boxes are left.

The total number of shoe boxes left is:
\[ 4 \text{ (blue)} + 6 \text{ (red)} = 10 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 10."
"Sarah has 9 books.
Joseph had twice the number of Sarah’s books, so Joseph had 9 * 2 = 18 books.
Joseph lost 2 of them, so he currently has 18 - 2 = 16 books.

The final numerical answer is 16."
"First, let's find out how many marbles Dean gives to Jamie. He gives 1/5 of his 30 marbles to Jamie. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 30 = 6 \]

Dean gives 6 marbles to Jamie. Now, let's find out how many marbles Dean has left after giving 6 to Jamie:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Dean then gives 10 marbles to Donald. So, we subtract 10 from the 24 marbles he has left:

\[ 24 - 10 = 14 \]

So, Dean is left with 14 marbles."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

1. Duncan's current age is 60 years.
2. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \(60 - 8 = 52\) years.
3. According to the problem, eight years ago, Duncan's age (52) was two times Adam's age four years ago.
4. Let's denote Adam's age four years ago as \(x\). So, \(52 = 2x\).
5. Solving for \(x\), we get \(x = \frac{52}{2} = 26\). So, four years ago, Adam was 26 years old.
6. To find out how old Adam is now, we add 4 years to his age four years ago: \(26 + 4 = 30\).
7. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 years to his current age: \(30 + 8 = 38\).

So, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years."
"First, let's find out how many acres Farmer Smith's farm has. We know that Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

So, twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm is:
\[ 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ acres} \]

Now, we add 100 acres to this amount to find out how many acres Farmer Smith's farm has:
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \text{ acres} \]

Now, to find out the total number of acres both farms have together, we add the acres of Farmer Brown's farm to the acres of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 200 + 500 = 700 \text{ acres} \]

So, the total number of acres the two farms have together is 700 acres."
"First, let's find out how many packages Colby completes in an hour. The problem states that he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. So, we subtract 10 from 50:

50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour

Now, we know Colby gets paid $0.20 for each package he completes. To find out how much he earns in an hour, we multiply the number of packages he completes by the amount he gets paid per package:

40 packages/hour * $0.20/package = $8.00/hour

Colby works for an eight-hour workday, so to find out how much he earns in a day, we multiply his hourly wage by the number of hours he works:

$8.00/hour * 8 hours = $64.00

So, the final numerical answer is $64.00."
"First, let's find out how long an extreme sudoku takes. A normal sudoku takes 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long. So, we calculate:

\[ 45 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find out how many half-hour intervals are in 180 minutes. Since there are 30 minutes in a half-hour, we divide 180 by 30:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \div 30 \text{ minutes/half-hour} = 6 \text{ half-hours} \]

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half-hour, he will drink 6 bottles of water in that time. So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"First, let's figure out how many pieces of bologna Benny used for the red balloons. Since he threw two pieces of bologna at each red balloon and there were twenty red balloons, we can calculate the total pieces of bologna for the red balloons as follows:

\[ 2 \text{ pieces/bologna} \times 20 \text{ red balloons} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we know that Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna. If 40 pieces were used for the red balloons, then the remaining pieces were used for the yellow balloons:

\[ 58 \text{ total pieces} - 40 \text{ pieces for red} = 18 \text{ pieces for yellow} \]

Since Benny threw three pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, we can find out how many yellow balloons there were by dividing the total pieces of bologna used for yellow balloons by the number of pieces per yellow balloon:

\[ \frac{18 \text{ pieces}}{3 \text{ pieces/bologna}} = 6 \text{ yellow balloons} \]

So, the number of yellow balloons in the bundle is 6."
"First, let's find out how many miles Jon drives in a month. He drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, so:

\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know that his car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles. To find out how many tune-ups he needs for 3000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by the number of miles between tune-ups:

\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

So, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time."
"To find out how many hours Bruce works in total over these three days, let's break it down day by day.

On Tuesday, Bruce works for 5 hours.

On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday. So, he works \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday. So, he works \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.

Now, to find the total hours worked over the three days, we add the hours from each day together:
\[5 \text{ hours (Tuesday)} + 10 \text{ hours (Wednesday)} + 8 \text{ hours (Thursday)} = 23 \text{ hours}\]

So, the total number of hours Bruce works in these three days is 23 hours."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items they bought.

The cake costs $11.

The balloons cost $0.5 for 2 balloons. So, for 1 dozen (12 balloons), the cost would be:
\[ \frac{12}{2} \times 0.5 = 6 \times 0.5 = 3 \]

The ice cream costs $7 each, and they bought 2 tubs, so the cost for the ice cream is:
\[ 2 \times 7 = 14 \]

Now, let's add up all the costs to find the total amount spent:
\[ 11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \]

This means Julia and Nadine spent a total of $28. Since they combined their allowances, the total amount given by their mother is also $28. Since they split the allowance equally, each one of them received:
\[ \frac{28}{2} = 14 \]

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14."
"Kira bought 3 apples, which means she had 3 pieces of apples.
She also bought 5 bananas, which means she had 5 pieces of bananas.
And she bought 6 oranges, which means she had 6 pieces of oranges.

So, the total number of fruit pieces Kira had initially is 3 (apples) + 5 (bananas) + 6 (oranges) = 14 pieces.

Lola ate 2 pieces of the fruit, so the number of pieces left is 14 - 2 = 12 pieces.

The final numerical answer is 12."
"First, let's find out how many students are playing volleyball. Since there are 6 students playing tennis and twice that number playing volleyball, we can calculate the number of volleyball players as follows:

Number of volleyball players = 2 * Number of tennis players
Number of volleyball players = 2 * 6
Number of volleyball players = 12

Now, we know there are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer. So, the total number of students playing soccer is:

Total soccer players = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total soccer players = 16 + 22
Total soccer players = 38

Now, we add the number of students playing tennis, volleyball, and soccer to find the total number of students:

Total students = Number of tennis players + Number of volleyball players + Total soccer players
Total students = 6 + 12 + 38
Total students = 56

So, the total number of students is 56."
"First, let's calculate the total number of lollipops sold by all the students.

Each student sold 10 lollipops, and there are 30 students.
So, the total number of lollipops sold is:
\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling these lollipops. Each lollypop was sold for $0.8.
So, the total revenue is:
\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollypop} = \$240 \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops. Each lollypop cost $0.5.
So, the total cost is:
\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollypop} = \$150 \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ \$240 - \$150 = \$90 \]

So, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops."
"First, let's find out how many dogs Larry has. Since he has 3 cats and 3 times as many dogs as cats, we can calculate the number of dogs as follows:
\[ \text{Number of dogs} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \]

Next, we find out how many rabbits Larry has. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so:
\[ \text{Number of rabbits} = 9 - 2 = 7 \]

Now, we calculate the number of fish. Larry has three times the number of fish as rabbits, so:
\[ \text{Number of fish} = 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Then, we find out how many gerbils Larry has. He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so:
\[ \text{Number of gerbils} = \frac{21}{3} = 7 \]

Finally, to find out the total number of pets Larry has, we add up the number of cats, dogs, rabbits, fish, and gerbils:
\[ \text{Total number of pets} = 3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47 \]

So, the total number of pets Larry has is 47."
"First, let's find out how many slices Josh can eat in a day. Since Josh can eat twice as much as Abby, and Abby can eat 2 slices a day, Josh can eat:

\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ slices a day} \]

Now, let's find out how many slices they can eat together in a day. Abby eats 2 slices and Josh eats 4 slices, so together they eat:

\[ 2 + 4 = 6 \text{ slices a day} \]

The loaf of bread has 24 slices. To find out how many days the loaf will last, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat together in a day:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{6 \text{ slices/day}} = 4 \text{ days} \]

So, the loaf of bread will last for 4 days."
"Martha collects shells every month. She started collecting at the age of 5 and her 10th birthday is when she turns 10 years old. To find out how many months she has been collecting shells, we calculate the difference in age and then convert that into months.

From age 5 to 10, she has been collecting shells for 5 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply 5 years by 12 months/year:

\[ 5 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 60 \text{ months} \]

Since she collects one shell every month, the total number of shells she has collected by her 10th birthday is:

\[ 60 \text{ shells} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 60."
"First, let's figure out how many cups of chamomile and mint tea Lana has in total. She has 27 cups in total and she uses 15 of them for cinnamon tea. So, the number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea is:

\[ 27 - 15 = 12 \]

Since she divides these 12 cups equally between chamomile and mint tea, we can find out how many cups of each are there:

\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]

So, she has 6 cups of chamomile tea and 6 cups of mint tea. Now, she divides these 6 cups of chamomile and mint tea into 3 rows equally. So, the number of cups of each type of tea in each row is:

\[ \frac{6}{3} = 2 \]

Therefore, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is 2.

The final numerical answer is:
2"
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many berries the sloth can pick up in one trip and then see how many trips he needs to make to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

First, we know that the sloth takes 4 hours for one trip down to pick berries and back up. So, in 8 hours, the sloth can make 8 hours / 4 hours per trip = 2 trips.

Since the sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours and he can make 2 trips in that time, he needs to pick up 24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries per trip.

So, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip is 12.

The final numerical answer is 12."
"First, we need to find out how much water is in the tank. Since the tank has half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons, the tank has:

\[ \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much water will be left in the tank after 6 days, given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. The total amount of water used in 6 days is:

\[ 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[ 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

The final numerical answer is 2000 gallons."
"First, let's calculate how much Colby has spent on popcorn and candy.

He bought 2 tubs of popcorn, and each tub costs $8.
So, the total spent on popcorn is 2 * $8 = $16.

He also bought 4 boxes of candy, and each box costs $2.
So, the total spent on candy is 4 * $2 = $8.

Now, let's add the cost of popcorn and candy to the total amount he has spent on tickets.

He has $150 to spend on tickets.
He has already spent $16 on popcorn and $8 on candy.
So, the remaining amount for tickets is $150 - $16 - $8 = $126.

Now, let's calculate how many tickets he can buy with the remaining $126.

Tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10 each.
Tickets for other days cost $7 each.

He has already seen 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, so he has spent 5 * $10 = $50 on those tickets.
He has also seen 8 movies on other days, so he has spent 8 * $7 = $56 on those tickets.

So, the total amount spent on tickets is $50 + $56 = $106.

Now, subtract the amount already spent on tickets from the remaining amount for tickets.
$126 - $106 = $20.

With the remaining $20, he can buy 2 more tickets (since each ticket costs $10).

Now, let's add the tickets he has already seen to the tickets he can buy with the remaining money.
He has already seen 5 + 8 = 13 movies.
He can buy 2 more tickets, so he can see 2 more movies.

Therefore, the total number of movies he can see is 13 + 2 = 15 movies.

The final numerical answer is 15."
"First, let's find out how many calories are in a mini cinnamon roll and a mini blueberry muffin.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories. Since a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll, we calculate:
\[ \text{Calories in a mini cinnamon roll} = \frac{600}{3} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories. Since a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin, we calculate:
\[ \text{Calories in a mini blueberry muffin} = \frac{450}{3} = 150 \text{ calories} \]

Now, let's calculate the total calories for the mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins.

For the mini cinnamon rolls:
\[ \text{Total calories for mini cinnamon rolls} = 200 \text{ mini cinnamon rolls} \times 200 \text{ calories per mini cinnamon roll} = 40000 \text{ calories} \]

For the mini blueberry muffins:
\[ \text{Total calories for mini blueberry muffins} = 300 \text{ mini blueberry muffins} \times 150 \text{ calories per mini blueberry muffin} = 45000 \text{ calories} \]

Finally, we add the total calories from both types of pastries to get the final answer:
\[ \text{Total calories} = 40000 \text{ calories} + 45000 \text{ calories} = 85000 \text{ calories} \]

So, the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked is 85000 calories."
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the five days and then divide that number by 5.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as Monday, which is \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she also removed twice as many as Monday, which is \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's add up all the Junebugs removed over the five days:
\[39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57\]

First, add 39 and 78:
\[39 + 78 = 117\]

Next, add 78 to the result:
\[117 + 78 = 195\]

Then, add 48 to the result:
\[195 + 48 = 243\]

Finally, add 57 to the result:
\[243 + 57 = 300\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days is 300.

To find the average, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days (5):
\[\frac{300}{5} = 60\]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is 60."
"First, we need to calculate how far the bus traveled. The bus travels at a speed of 60 miles per hour for 5 hours. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time:

\[ \text{Distance of the bus} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate how far the car traveled. The car travels at a speed of 30 miles per hour for 8 hours. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time:

\[ \text{Distance of the car} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance of the bus} - \text{Distance of the car} = 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to add up all the toys Sophie already has and then subtract that number from the total number of toys she has now.

The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks.
The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals.
The tower of stacking rings has 9 multicolored rings.

So, the total number of toys Sophie already has is:
31 (blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (rings) = 48 toys.

Sophie now has a total of 62 toys for her nephew.

To find out how many bouncy balls are in the tube, we subtract the number of toys she already had from the total number of toys she has now:
62 (total toys) - 48 (toys she already had) = 14 bouncy balls.

So, the number of bouncy balls that came in the tube is 14."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say Jean's age is \( J \).
2. Paul's age is \( P \).
3. Peter's age is \( T \).
4. According to the problem, the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   T + P + J = 100
   \]
5. We are also told that Paul is 10 years older than Jean, so:
   \[
   P = J + 10
   \]
6. And Peter's age is the sum of Paul's and Jean's age, so:
   \[
   T = P + J
   \]
7. Now, we can substitute \( P \) from the second equation into the third equation:
   \[
   T = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
   \]
8. Now we substitute \( T \) and \( P \) in the first equation:
   \[
   (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
   \]
9. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
   \]
   \[
   4J + 20 = 100
   \]
10. Subtract 20 from both sides:
    \[
    4J = 80
    \]
11. Divide by 4:
    \[
    J = 20
    \]
12. Now we can find Paul's age:
    \[
    P = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
    \]
13. And Peter's age:
    \[
    T = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
    \]

So, Peter's age is 50 years. Let's write the final answer in a separate line.

50"
"First, let's calculate the number of water balloons Maria gave to her friends. Maria invited 4 friends, and she gave each of them 2 water balloons. So, the total number of water balloons given to her friends is:

\[ 4 \text{ friends} \times 2 \text{ balloons per friend} = 8 \text{ balloons} \]

Maria also got 2 water balloons. So, the total number of water balloons Maria had initially is:

\[ 8 \text{ balloons} + 2 \text{ balloons} = 10 \text{ balloons} \]

Next, her mom gave each person 3 more water balloons. Including Maria, there are 5 people in total (4 friends + 1 Maria). So, the total number of water balloons given by her mom is:

\[ 5 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ balloons per person} = 15 \text{ balloons} \]

Now, we add the water balloons given by her mom to the initial number of water balloons:

\[ 10 \text{ balloons} + 15 \text{ balloons} = 25 \text{ balloons} \]

So, the total number of water balloons the girls had is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes of stuff they have.

10 people donate 5 boxes each, so that's 10 * 5 = 50 boxes.
They also have 10 boxes already.

So, the total number of boxes is 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Now, we need to find out how many tables they can use with the 60 boxes if each table can hold 2 boxes.

60 boxes / 2 boxes per table = 30 tables.

They already have 15 tables, so we need to find out how many more tables they need.

30 tables needed - 15 tables they already have = 15 new tables needed.

So, the final numerical answer is 15."
"First, let's calculate the total distance Zoey spits her seeds. Zoey has 40 seeds and she spits each one 10 feet. So, the total distance Zoey spits is:
\[ 40 \text{ seeds} \times 10 \text{ feet/seed} = 400 \text{ feet} \]

Next, let's calculate the total distance Sydney spits her seeds. Sydney has 35 seeds and she spits each one 12 feet. So, the total distance Sydney spits is:
\[ 35 \text{ seeds} \times 12 \text{ feet/seed} = 420 \text{ feet} \]

Now, to find the average total distance spat by both Zoey and Sydney, we add their total distances and divide by 2:
\[ \text{Average total distance} = \frac{400 \text{ feet} + 420 \text{ feet}}{2} = \frac{820 \text{ feet}}{2} = 410 \text{ feet} \]

So, the average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"First, let's calculate how many widgets each machine can make in a day.

The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour. Since it runs 24 hours a day, it makes:
\[ 60 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 1440 \text{ widgets/day} \]

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour. Since it also runs 24 hours a day, it makes:
\[ 45 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 1080 \text{ widgets/day} \]

Next, let's calculate how many widgets each machine can make in a month with 30 days.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
\[ 1440 \text{ widgets/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 43200 \text{ widgets/month} \]

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
\[ 1080 \text{ widgets/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 32400 \text{ widgets/month} \]

Now, let's calculate the total money each machine can make in a month by selling each widget for $6.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
\[ 43200 \text{ widgets} \times 6 \text{ dollars/widget} = 259200 \text{ dollars} \]

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
\[ 32400 \text{ widgets} \times 6 \text{ dollars/widget} = 194400 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, let's find out how much more money the Widgeteer 3000 makes compared to the WidgetMaster 9000.

\[ 259200 \text{ dollars} - 194400 \text{ dollars} = 64800 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Fern will make $64800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000."
"First, let's calculate the total cost if Cameron chooses the 24-hour option.

The hotel charges 1600 pesos for a 24-hour stay. Since Cameron wants to stay from 5 pm to 10 am the next morning, that's a total of 17 hours. After the first 12 hours, he has 5 additional hours. For these additional hours, he pays 70 pesos each.

So, the cost for the additional hours is:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times 70 \text{ pesos/hour} = 350 \text{ pesos} \]

Adding this to the initial 1600 pesos:
\[ 1600 \text{ pesos} + 350 \text{ pesos} = 1950 \text{ pesos} \]

Now, let's calculate the cost if Cameron chooses the 12-hour option and then pays for the additional hours separately.

The cost for the first 12 hours is 1000 pesos. For the additional 5 hours, he pays 70 pesos each hour:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times 70 \text{ pesos/hour} = 350 \text{ pesos} \]

Adding this to the initial 1000 pesos:
\[ 1000 \text{ pesos} + 350 \text{ pesos} = 1350 \text{ pesos} \]

Now, let's find out how much Cameron would save by choosing the 12-hour option instead of the 24-hour option:
\[ 1950 \text{ pesos} - 1350 \text{ pesos} = 600 \text{ pesos} \]

So, Cameron would save 600 pesos."
"First, let's find out how much hay each sheep needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. So, twice the amount each goat needs is:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, each sheep needs 3 pounds less than this amount:

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we know there are 15 goats and each needs 5 pounds of hay:

\[ 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

And there are 12 sheep and each needs 7 pounds of hay:

\[ 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the total amount of hay Nate needs, we add the hay needed for the goats and the sheep:

\[ 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 159 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much money John earned in the week. He earns 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so:

\[ 50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to subtract the cost of gas from his earnings. He spends 50 dollars on gas, so:

\[ 300 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so we subtract that from his remaining money:

\[ 250 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

John also wants to buy 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each. The total cost for the pencils is:

\[ 5 \times 10 \text{ dollars} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the pencils from his remaining money gives:

\[ 150 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we need to find out how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with the remaining 100 dollars. We divide the remaining money by the cost of one pen:

\[ 100 \text{ dollars} \div 25 \text{ dollars/pen} = 4 \text{ pens} \]

So, John can buy 4 pens. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of letters Craig has spelled out. Craig spelled out 20 words with 15 letters each. So, the total number of letters Craig has spelled out is:

\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]

Next, we need to find out how many letters Craig's brother has spelled out. We know that Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. So, the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled out is:

\[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]

Now, to find the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds, we add the total number of letters Craig spelled out to the total number of letters Craig's brother spelled out:

\[ 300 + 350 = 650 \]

So, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is:

\[ 650 \]"
"To find out how many children can be in the drill, we need to multiply the number of children in each row by the number of rows for each school and then multiply that by the number of schools.

First, let's find out how many children are in one row:
8 children in a row.

Next, let's find out how many children are in one school:
8 children/row * 7 rows = 56 children/school.

Now, let's find out how many children are in all the schools:
56 children/school * 5 schools = 280 children.

So, the total number of children in the drill is 280."
"First, let's calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can get from redeeming all the coupons. The teacher has 9 coupons and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice.

\[ 9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles per coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gives to the students. There are 29 pupils in the class and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice.

\[ 29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles per student} = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher received from the coupons to find out how many bottles the teacher has left for herself.

\[ 900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

So, the teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice for herself."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the total cost which includes the visit fee, labor cost, and parts cost.

1. The visit fee is $40.
2. The labor cost is $35 per hour. Since the job took 2.25 hours, the labor cost is $35 * 2.25.
3. The parts cost is $60.

Let's calculate the labor cost first:
\[ 35 \times 2.25 = 78.75 \]

Now, let's add all the costs together:
\[ 40 + 78.75 + 60 = 178.75 \]

So, Patty charged $178.75."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount. James gets 10 new CDs and each CD costs $15.

Total cost before discount = 10 CDs * $15/CD = $150

Now, he gets them for 40% off. To find out how much he actually pays, we need to calculate 40% of $150 and subtract it from $150.

40% of $150 = 0.40 * $150 = $60

So, the amount he actually pays for the CDs is:

$150 - $60 = $90

James decides he doesn't like 5 of the CDs and sells them for $40. To find out how much money he lost, we need to subtract the amount he sold the CDs for from the amount he originally paid for them.

Money lost = Amount paid for the CDs - Amount he sold the 5 CDs for

Money lost = $90 - $40 = $50

So, James was out $50."
"First, let's calculate the earnings from the yams:
Jen has 6 yams and each yam can be sold for $1.5.
So, the total earnings from yams = 6 yams * $1.5/yam = $9.

Next, let's calculate the earnings from the sweet potatoes:
Jen has 10 sweet potatoes and each sweet potato can be sold for $2.
So, the total earnings from sweet potatoes = 10 sweet potatoes * $2/sweet potato = $20.

Now, let's calculate the earnings from the carrots:
Jen has 4 carrots and each carrot can be sold for $1.25.
So, the total earnings from carrots = 4 carrots * $1.25/carrot = $5.

Finally, let's add up all the earnings:
Total earnings = Earnings from yams + Earnings from sweet potatoes + Earnings from carrots
Total earnings = $9 + $20 + $5 = $34.

So, Jen will earn $34 if she sells everything."
"First, let's break down the problem into parts to understand how long James spends swimming and resting.

James has to swim a total distance of 20 miles. He swims 60% of the distance. So, the distance he swims is:
\[ 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ miles} \]

James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour. So, the time he spends swimming 12 miles is:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

After swimming, he rests for half as long as the swimming time. So, the rest time is:
\[ \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

The remaining distance to be swum is:
\[ 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

He swims this remaining distance at half the speed, which is:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile/hour} \]

So, the time he spends swimming the remaining 8 miles is:
\[ \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add up all the times:
\[ 6 \text{ hours (swimming)} + 3 \text{ hours (resting)} + 8 \text{ hours (swimming)} = 17 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time it took James to get across the lake is:
\[ 17 \text{ hours} \]"
"First, let's find out how many loaves of bread the bakery had by following the information given:

The bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had last Friday. 

Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday. 

So, seven times as many loaves as Sam had is:
\[ 7 \times 70 = 490 \]

Now, the bakery has 40 less than this amount:
\[ 490 - 40 = 450 \]

So, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

The final numerical answer is 450."
"Jasmine starts with 15 stickers. She loses 7 stickers, so we subtract 7 from 15:
\[ 15 - 7 = 8 \]
Then, her teacher gives her 5 more stickers, so we add 5 to the 8 stickers she has left:
\[ 8 + 5 = 13 \]
So, at the end, Jasmine has 13 stickers."
"First, let's calculate the commission Cayley earns from selling the New York Times. Each New York Times costs $5 and he gets a 10% commission on each. So, the commission per New York Times is:
\[ 5 \times \frac{10}{100} = 5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \]
Since he sells 6 copies, the total commission from New York Times is:
\[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the commission Cayley earns from selling the Wall Street Journal. Each Wall Street Journal costs $15 and he gets an 8% commission on each. So, the commission per Wall Street Journal is:
\[ 15 \times \frac{8}{100} = 15 \times 0.08 = 1.20 \]
Since he sells 10 copies, the total commission from Wall Street Journal is:
\[ 10 \times 1.20 = 12.00 \]

Now, to find the total commission Cayley earns from both newspapers, we add the two amounts together:
\[ 3.00 + 12.00 = 15.00 \]

So, the total commission Cayley will earn is:
\[ \boxed{15.00} \]"
"First, let's find out how old Marcus is. Since Deanna is 26 years old and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, Marcus is:

\[ 26 - 5 = 21 \text{ years old} \]

Now, we know that Marcus is half of Leo's age. So, if Marcus is 21 years old, then Leo is:

\[ 21 \times 2 = 42 \text{ years old} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 42."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Bahati scored the most points, which is 20 more than Azibo and 10 more than Dinar.
- The total points scored by the three is 45.

Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as \( A \) and by Dinar as \( D \).

From the information given:
- Bahati's points (\( B \)) = \( A + 20 \)
- Bahati's points (\( B \)) = \( D + 10 \)

Since Bahati scored the most, we can say:
- \( B = A + 20 \)
- \( B = D + 10 \)

We also know that the total points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar is 45:
- \( B + A + D = 45 \)

Substituting \( B \) from the first equation into the total points equation:
- \( (A + 20) + A + D = 45 \)
- \( 2A + D + 20 = 45 \)
- \( 2A + D = 25 \)

Now, substituting \( B \) from the second equation into the total points equation:
- \( (D + 10) + A + D = 45 \)
- \( A + 2D + 10 = 45 \)
- \( A + 2D = 35 \)

Now we have two equations:
1. \( 2A + D = 25 \)
2. \( A + 2D = 35 \)

We can solve these equations by substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination. Multiply the first equation by 2:
- \( 4A + 2D = 50 \)
- \( A + 2D = 35 \)

Subtract the second equation from the first:
- \( 4A + 2D - (A + 2D) = 50 - 35 \)
- \( 3A = 15 \)
- \( A = 5 \)

So, Azibo scored 5 points."
"To find out how many pages are in the book, we need to multiply the thickness of the book in inches by the number of pages that fit into one inch of paper.

Given:
- The book is 1.5 inches thick.
- There are 100 pages in one inch of paper.

So, we calculate the total number of pages in the book as follows:
\[ \text{Total pages} = \text{Thickness of the book (in inches)} \times \text{Pages per inch} \]
\[ \text{Total pages} = 1.5 \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Total pages} = 150 \]

The final numerical answer is 150 pages."
"First, let's find out how many hours Vince was stapling reports. He started at 8:00 AM and finished at 11:00 PM. 

From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 13 hours.

Now, we know Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 13 hours, we need to convert 13 hours into minutes and then divide by 15.

13 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 780 minutes

Now, we divide the total minutes by the number of minutes it takes to staple 30 reports:

780 minutes / 15 minutes = 52 intervals

Since Vince staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by 30 to find the total number of reports stapled:

52 intervals * 30 reports/interval = 1560 reports

So, Vince stapled a total of 1560 reports."
"To solve this, let's break down the time Kim was sleepwalking and the time she woke up early.

Kim usually wakes up at 6 a.m. but that day she woke up 5 minutes earlier, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m.

She sleepwalked from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. That's a total of 23 minutes of sleepwalking.

Now, let's calculate the total time she was asleep that day. She usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m., so she was asleep for 8 hours. But that day, she woke up at 5:55 a.m., which means she was asleep for 10 hours and 55 minutes.

To find out how many minutes she slept on her bed, we need to subtract the time she was sleepwalking from the total time she was asleep.

Total asleep time: 10 hours and 55 minutes = 655 minutes
Sleepwalking time: 23 minutes

So, the time she slept on her bed is 655 minutes - 23 minutes = 632 minutes.

The final numerical answer is 632 minutes."
"First, let's find out how many measuring spoons Jonathan has initially. We know that he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. He has two dozen measuring cups, which is 2 * 12 = 24 measuring cups.

Now, we calculate the number of measuring spoons he has:
\[ \text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so we subtract those from his initial number of measuring spoons:
\[ \text{Remaining measuring spoons} = 16 - 6 = 10 \]

Now, we add the remaining measuring spoons to the number of measuring cups to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has:
\[ \text{Total utensils} = \text{Number of measuring cups} + \text{Remaining measuring spoons} = 24 + 10 = 34 \]

So, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is 34."
"First, let's find out how many beds are occupied initially. The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied.

\[ \text{Occupied beds initially} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

So, the number of unoccupied beds initially is:

\[ \text{Unoccupied beds initially} = 1000 - 200 = 800 \]

Next, we need to calculate the number of patients admitted over 2 weeks. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, and 50 patients are admitted each day.

\[ \text{Total patients admitted in 2 weeks} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

Now, we add the patients admitted to the initial number of occupied beds to find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks.

\[ \text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Finally, we subtract the total number of occupied beds from the total capacity to find the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks.

\[ \text{Unoccupied beds after 2 weeks} = 1000 - 900 = 100 \]

So, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100."
"First, let's find out how many emails are not work emails. Since Robyn sends sixteen emails a day and seven of them are work emails, we subtract the work emails from the total:

16 - 7 = 9 emails are not work emails.

Out of these 9 emails, two-thirds are to family. To find out how many emails are to family, we calculate:

\( \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \) emails are to family.

Now, we need to find out how many emails are left after we've accounted for the work emails and the emails to family. We subtract the emails to family from the non-work emails:

9 - 6 = 3 emails are not to family or to family.

These 3 emails are sent to her boyfriend. So, Robyn sends 3 emails a day to her boyfriend."
"First, let's find out how old Shawna is. We know that Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, and Aliya is 3 years old. So, we can calculate Shawna's age as follows:

\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Now, we know that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. So, we can calculate Shawna's father's age as follows:

\[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 45."
"If Courtney reported 48 people and she made a mistake of overstating the number by 20%, we need to find out the actual number of people who attended the concert.

First, let's understand what it means to be overstated by 20%. This means that the number Courtney reported (48) is 120% of the actual number of people. We can set up the equation to find the actual number of people:

\[ 120\% \text{ of actual number} = 48 \]

To find the actual number, we can convert the percentage to a decimal and solve for the actual number:

\[ 1.20 \times \text{actual number} = 48 \]

Now, we solve for the actual number:

\[ \text{actual number} = \frac{48}{1.20} \]

Let's calculate this.
\[ \text{actual number} = \frac{48}{1.20} = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jason carried 2 balls.
2. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \(2 \times 2 = 4\) balls.
3. Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jeffrey carried \(2 \div 2 = 1\) ball.

Now, let's add up all the balls they carried:
- Jason carried 2 balls.
- Jordan carried 4 balls.
- Jeffrey carried 1 ball.

So, the total number of balls is \(2 + 4 + 1 = 7\).

The total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 7."
"To solve this, let's break down the digging process day by day.

On the first day, they dug 10 holes.
On the second day, they dug 13 holes.
On the third day, they dug 8 holes but also filled in 2 holes, so the net digging for the third day is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

So, by the end of the third day, the total number of holes dug is:
\[10 + 13 + 6 = 29\]

The problem states that by the end of the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, four times that number is:
\[4 \times 10 = 40\]

By the end of the third day, there were 29 holes. So, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is the difference between the total holes by the end of the fourth day and the total holes by the end of the third day:
\[40 - 29 = 11\]

Therefore, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is 11."
"First, let's understand the distribution of the corn chips. Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips. Collins got 15 more corn chips than Amora and Lainey, so Collins got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

Now, let's add up all the corn chips:
Amora's chips + Lainey's chips + Collins's chips = 70 + 70 + 85 = 225

So, the total number of corn chips is 225."
"First, let's find out how much the travel tickets cost. The problem states that the travel tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. The supplies cost $400 in total.

To find 50% of $400, we calculate:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 400 = \frac{50}{100} \times 400 = 0.5 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the travel tickets cost $200 more than the supplies. Therefore, the total cost for the travel tickets is:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

So, the travel cost is $600."
"Let's break this down step by step.

First, let's define the number of Pokemon each person has caught:
- Let \( A \) be the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.
- Let \( S \) be the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
- Let \( W \) be the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( A + S + W = 339 \)
2. \( A = S + 5 \)
3. \( S = 4W - 13 \)

We need to find the value of \( S \).

First, substitute the expression for \( A \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ (S + 5) + S + W = 339 \]
\[ 2S + W + 5 = 339 \]
\[ 2S + W = 334 \]
\[ W = 334 - 2S \]

Now we have expressions for \( A \) and \( W \) in terms of \( S \):
- \( A = S + 5 \)
- \( W = 334 - 2S \)

Next, substitute these expressions into the third equation:
\[ S = 4(334 - 2S) - 13 \]
\[ S = 1336 - 8S - 13 \]
\[ S = 1323 - 8S \]
\[ 9S = 1323 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

The final numerical answer is:
147"
"First, let's find out how many episodes there are. We know that each episode is 20 minutes long. The question also tells us that there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. So, we can calculate the number of episodes as follows:

Number of episodes = Minutes per episode / 2
Number of episodes = 20 / 2
Number of episodes = 10

Now, to find out how many minutes John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode:

Total minutes = Number of episodes * Minutes per episode
Total minutes = 10 * 20
Total minutes = 200

So, the final numerical answer is 200 minutes."

   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance = Time × Speed = 5 hours × 22 miles/hour = 110 miles

Now, we add up the distances from each leg of the journey to find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes.

Total distance = 300 miles + 36 miles + 110 miles = 446 miles

So, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 446 miles."
"First, let's find out how many brownies Greta made initially. She made one dozen brownies for herself. Since one dozen equals 12, she made 12 brownies.

At her office, she got 1/2 a dozen brownies. Since one dozen is 12, 1/2 a dozen is 6 brownies. So, she got 6 more brownies from her office party.

When her friends threw her a surprise party, they gave her 4 dozen brownies. Since one dozen is 12, 4 dozen is 48 brownies. So, she got 48 more brownies from her friends.

Now, let's add up all the brownies she received:
12 (from herself) + 6 (from her office) + 48 (from her friends) = 66 brownies in total.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. Since one dozen is 12, 1 1/2 dozen is 18 brownies. So, 18 brownies were eaten.

Now, let's subtract the brownies eaten from the total number of brownies:
66 (total brownies) - 18 (brownies eaten) = 48 brownies left over.

So, the final numerical answer is 48."
"First, let's find out how old Nani's brother is. Since his brother is twice Nani's age, we multiply Nani's age by 2:

\[ 8 \times 2 = 16 \]

So, Nani's brother is 16 years old.

Next, let's find out how old Nani's sister is. Since she is 25% younger than Nani, we need to find 25% of Nani's age and subtract it from Nani's age:

\[ 8 \times 0.25 = 2 \]

So, Nani's sister is 2 years younger than Nani, which means:

\[ 8 - 2 = 6 \]

Therefore, Nani's sister is 6 years old.

Now, let's add up the ages of all three family members:

\[ 8 + 16 + 6 = 20 \]

So, the total age of all three family members is 20."
"First, let's calculate the total time Andy will spend on each type of racquet:

For synthetic gut:
3 racquets * 15 minutes per racquet = 45 minutes

For polyester string:
5 racquets * 22 minutes per racquet = 110 minutes

For hybrid sets:
4 racquets * 18 minutes per racquet = 72 minutes

Now, let's add up all the time:
45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes

So, the total time it will take Andy to string all of those racquets is 227 minutes."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. John buys 1 phone at full price.
2. He buys 2 phones at half price.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first phone:
- The first phone costs $600.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the two half-price phones:
- Half of $600 is $600 / 2 = $300.
- So, each of the two half-price phones costs $300.
- Therefore, the total cost for the two half-price phones is $300 + $300 = $600.

Now, let's add up the total cost for all the phones:
- The cost of the first phone is $600.
- The cost of the two half-price phones is $600.

So, the total cost is $600 + $600 = $1200.

The final numerical answer is:
1200"
"First, we need to find out how many players Zeke's team has. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we can calculate the number of players in Zeke's team by adding 7 to 13.

So, Zeke's team has \(13 + 7 = 20\) players.

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams combined, we add the number of players in Zeke's team to the number of players in Carlton's team.

So, the total number of players is \(13 + 20 = 33\).

The final numerical answer is 33."
"First, we need to find out how many feet of fencing Robert needs to build. Since the fence is rectangular and he needs to cover all sides, we calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given that the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (15 + 10) = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Now, Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing. So, we multiply the total length of the fencing by the number of slats needed per foot:

\[ \text{Total slats needed} = 50 \times 2 = 100 \text{ slats} \]

So, Robert will need 100 wooden slats."
"First, let's find out how many boxes Mrs. Harrington gave away. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, so she gave away a total of 2 + 2 = 4 boxes.

She started with 12 boxes and gave away 4, so she had 12 - 4 = 8 boxes left.

She kept 1/4 of the oranges, so she gave away 3/4 of the oranges. Since each box contains 20 oranges, she had 8 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 160 oranges in total.

The number of oranges she gave away is 3/4 of 160 oranges, which is (3/4) * 160 = 120 oranges.

So, Mrs. Harrington sold 120 oranges."
"To solve this, let's first figure out how many states are in the USA. We know that India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. Let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( x \). According to the problem, India has \( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \) states.

We need to find the total number of states in both countries. So, the total number of states in both countries is \( x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) \).

To simplify, we combine like terms:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{3x}{2} + 4 \]

Now, we need to know the actual number of states in the USA. The USA has 50 states. So, we substitute \( x = 50 \) into the equation:
\[ \frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79 \]

So, the total number of states in both countries together is 79."
"First, let's find out the total cost of the books Tyler wants to buy. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. So, we add these amounts together:

\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \]

Tyler needs $39 to buy all the books. He already has $14 saved from his allowance. To find out how much more money he needs, we subtract the amount he has from the total cost:

\[ 39 - 14 = 25 \]

Tyler needs $25 more to buy the books. Since he earns $5 per hour, we need to find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $25. We do this by dividing the amount he needs by his hourly wage:

\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

So, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to earn the additional $25 he needs. The final numerical answer is:

5"
"First, let's find out how many cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 30 cherries and 10 more than Richard, we can calculate Richard's cherries as follows:

\[ \text{Richard's cherries} = \text{Robert's cherries} - 10 = 30 - 10 = 20 \]

Now, we know the total number of cherries is 60. We can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting the number of cherries Richard and Robert have from the total:

\[ \text{Jerry's cherries} = \text{Total cherries} - (\text{Richard's cherries} + \text{Robert's cherries}) = 60 - (20 + 30) = 60 - 50 = 10 \]

Now, to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has:

\[ \text{More cherries Robert has than Jerry} = \text{Robert's cherries} - \text{Jerry's cherries} = 30 - 10 = 20 \]

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"First, let's find out how many boxes of each type of pie Sunny sold on each day.

On Saturday:
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes
- Apple pie: 10 - 4 = 6 boxes

On Sunday:
- Gingerbread: 10 + 5 = 15 boxes
- Apple pie: 15 boxes

Now, let's calculate the total number of boxes sold for each type of pie over the two days.

Total gingerbread sold:
- Saturday: 10 boxes
- Sunday: 15 boxes
- Total: 10 + 15 = 25 boxes

Total apple pie sold:
- Saturday: 6 boxes
- Sunday: 15 boxes
- Total: 6 + 15 = 21 boxes

Next, we calculate the total earnings from each type of pie.

Earnings from gingerbread:
- Each box of gingerbread costs $6
- Total gingerbread sold: 25 boxes
- Total earnings from gingerbread: 25 * $6 = $150

Earnings from apple pie:
- Each box of apple pie costs $15
- Total apple pie sold: 21 boxes
- Total earnings from apple pie: 21 * $15 = $315

Finally, we add the earnings from both types of pies to find the total earnings for the two days.

Total earnings:
- Earnings from gingerbread: $150
- Earnings from apple pie: $315
- Total earnings: $150 + $315 = $465

So, Sunny earned $465 for the two days."
"First, let's calculate how much sunscreen Pamela will use in one day. Since she uses 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour and she will be outside for 4 hours a day, she will use:

\[ 1 \text{ ounce/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours/day} = 4 \text{ ounces/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how much sunscreen she will use over 8 days:

\[ 4 \text{ ounces/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we know that her sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles. To find out how many bottles she needs, we divide the total ounces she will use by the number of ounces each bottle contains:

\[ \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces/bottle}} = 4 \text{ bottles} \]

So, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen."
"First, we need to find out how much the red car costs. If the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, it means the red car costs 60% of the blue car's price because 100% - 40% = 60%.

The price of the blue car is $100. So, the red car costs 60% of $100.

To find 60% of $100, we calculate:
\[ 0.60 \times 100 = 60 \]

So, the red car costs $60.

Now, to find the total cost of both cars, we add the cost of the red car to the cost of the blue car:
\[ 60 + 100 = 160 \]

Therefore, the total cost of both cars is $160."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Emil's age when he turns 24:**
   - Emil is currently 19 years old.
   - When he turns 24, he will be 24 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Emil's dad when Emil turns 24:**
   - According to the problem, when Emil is 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
   - If Emil is 24, his dad will be \(24 \times 2 = 48\) years old.

3. **Determine the age of Emil's brother when Emil turns 24:**
   - The problem also states that when Emil is 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.
   - If Emil is 24, his brother will be \(24 \div 2 = 12\) years old.

4. **Determine the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother:**
   - Since Emil's dad will be 48 years old when Emil is 24, his dad is currently \(48 - 24 = 24\) years old.
   - Since Emil's brother will be 12 years old when Emil is 24, his brother is currently \(12 - 24 = -12\) years old. However, this doesn't make sense in the context of age, so we need to recheck the interpretation. The correct interpretation is that Emil's brother is currently 12 years old (since he will be 12 when Emil is 24).

5. **Calculate the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now:**
   - Emil's dad is 24 years old.
   - Emil's brother is 12 years old.
   - The sum of their ages is \(24 + 12 = 36\).

So, the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is 36."
"First, let's find out how many beads Adrianne's sister gave her. Her sister gave her ten more beads than her mother, so:

10 beads (from her sister) = 20 beads (from her mother) + 10 beads

Now, let's find out how many beads Adrianne's friend gave her. Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother gave, so:

2 * 20 beads (from her mother) = 40 beads (from her friend)

Now, let's add up all the beads Adrianne has:

20 beads (from her mother) + 10 beads (from her sister) + 40 beads (from her friend) = 70 beads

So, Adrianne had 70 beads altogether."
"First, let's find out how much crawfish Joe caught on Friday. Since he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, and he caught 3 pounds on Thursday, we can calculate the Friday's catch as follows:

\[ \text{Friday's catch} = 4 \times \text{Thursday's catch} = 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out how much he caught on Saturday. He caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, so:

\[ \text{Saturday's catch} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Friday's catch} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add up all the crawfish he caught over the three days:

\[ \text{Total catch} = \text{Thursday's catch} + \text{Friday's catch} + \text{Saturday's catch} = 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can find out how many servings he has by dividing the total catch by the amount per serving:

\[ \text{Number of servings} = \frac{\text{Total catch}}{\text{Pounds per serving}} = \frac{21}{3} = 7 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 7 \]"
"First, let's find out how many students are football players. If 20% of the class are football players, then:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 30 = \frac{20}{100} \times 30 = 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are football players. This means the remaining number of students is:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Out of these 24 remaining students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. So, we calculate 25% of 24:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 24 = \frac{25}{100} \times 24 = 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are either cheerleaders or part of the band. This means the number of students leaving early is the sum of the football players and the cheerleaders/band members:

\[ 6 \text{ (football players)} + 6 \text{ (cheerleaders or band members)} = 12 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"First, we need to find out the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size five boots, Charlie wears size:

\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

Now, to find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we add their shoe sizes together and then divide by 2:

\[ \text{Average size} = \frac{25 + 5}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 15 \]"
"First, let's convert everything to the same unit. Since the flower bed is measured in feet and the growth of the flowers is in inches, we'll convert the flower bed length to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches

Each flower grows to 12 inches wide, and Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, 1.5 feet is:

1.5 feet * 12 inches/foot = 18 inches

So, the total space taken by one plant and the space left between it and the next plant is:

12 inches (plant) + 18 inches (space) = 30 inches

Now, to find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we divide the total length of the flower bed by the space taken by one plant and the space between them:

1332 inches / 30 inches/plant = 44.4 plants

Since Pat can't have a fraction of a plant, she can only fit 44 plants in her flower bed.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs:

44 plants - 17 plants = 27 new plants

Each new plant costs $6, so the total cost for the new plants is:

27 plants * $6/plant = $162

So, Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed with new plants."
"First, we need to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day. Since Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, we can calculate this by dividing the number of pretzels Edgar eats by 2.

Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day, so his brother eats:
\[ \frac{18}{2} = 9 \text{ pretzels a day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of pretzels he eats in a day by 7.

So, Edgar's brother eats:
\[ 9 \times 7 = 63 \text{ pretzels in a week} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 63 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost for one basket:

- Cost of petunias in one basket: 3 petunias * $3.00/petunia = $9.00
- Cost of sweet potato vines in one basket: 2 vines * $2.50/vine = $5.00

So, the total cost for one basket is $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for 5 baskets:

- Total cost for 5 baskets: 5 baskets * $14.00/basket = $70.00

So, Katherine will spend $70.00 filling all 5 hanging baskets."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil. If they plant 4 sunflowers, the total soil used for sunflowers is:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil. If they plant 10 carnations, the total soil used for carnations is:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

They have a 30-pound bag of soil. After using 27 pounds for the sunflowers and carnations, the remaining soil is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. With 3 pounds of soil left, the number of roses they can plant is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"First, let's find out how much money Jessica sets aside for fancy shoes each month. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 paycheck.

\[ \text{Amount set aside per month} = 25\% \times \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times \$2,000.00 = \$500.00 \]

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, and she can only spend $500.00 a month on shoes. So, we need to find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy with $500.00.

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes she can buy per month} = \frac{\$500.00}{\$1,000.00} = 0.5 \]

Since she can't buy half a pair of shoes, she can buy 0 pairs of shoes per month.

Now, let's find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes she can buy in a year} = 0.5 \times 12 = 6 \]

So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year."
"First, let's find out how long it takes Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, we divide the total number of shrimp by the number of shrimp she can peel in a minute:

\[ \text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's find out how long it takes her to saute 30 shrimp. According to the information, she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. Since we need to saute 90 shrimp, we can calculate the time it takes to saute 90 shrimp by multiplying the time it takes to saute 30 shrimp by 3 (because 90 is 3 times 30):

\[ \text{Time to saute 90 shrimp} = 10 \text{ minutes} \times 3 = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time it takes to peel the shrimp and the time it takes to saute the shrimp to get the total time:

\[ \text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp."
"First, let's calculate how much the temperature changed while the air conditioner was on low. The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low. It ran on low for 3 hours.

\[ 2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the room temperature dropped by 6 degrees while the air conditioner was on low.

Next, let's calculate how much the temperature changed while the air conditioner was on high. The air conditioner cools the room 3 degrees an hour on high. It was on high for 4 hours.

\[ 3 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the room temperature dropped by 12 degrees while the air conditioner was on high.

Now, let's calculate the total temperature change while the air conditioner was running. We add the temperature drops from both low and high settings.

\[ 6 \text{ degrees} + 12 \text{ degrees} = 18 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the room temperature dropped by 18 degrees while the air conditioner was running.

After the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, the room temperature would have warmed up by 2 degrees per hour. Let's calculate the temperature change during this 2-hour period.

\[ 2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the room temperature increased by 4 degrees after the air conditioner was turned off.

Now, let's find the final temperature by subtracting the total temperature drop while the air conditioner was on from the initial temperature and then adding the temperature increase after the air conditioner was turned off.

Let's assume the initial temperature of the room is \( T \) degrees. The final temperature would be:

\[ T - 18 \text{ degrees} + 4 \text{ degrees} = T - 14 \text{ degrees} \]

The final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"First, let's find out how old Bill's father was when he saw the comet. We know that Bill's father saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

Bill saw the comet when he was three times the age his father was when he saw it. So, we calculate Bill's age as follows:
\[ 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

This means Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time. Now, we need to find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time. Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill saw it again 75 years later. So, we subtract 75 years from 90 to find out his age when he saw it for the first time:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

So, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 15 \]"
"To find out how many checks Buford writes per year, let's break down the information given:

1. He writes a check for the electric bill once per month.
2. He writes a check for the gas bill once per month.
3. He writes a check to the church twice per month.
4. He writes a check to the pest and lawn service quarterly (which means 4 times a year).

Now, let's calculate the total number of checks he writes in a year:

- For the electric bill: 12 checks (once per month)
- For the gas bill: 12 checks (once per month)
- For the church: 24 checks (twice per month for 12 months)
- For the pest and lawn service: 4 checks (quarterly for 12 months)

Adding these up:
12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52 checks

So, Buford writes 52 checks per year."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know that the second plane makes 44 trips in one day, and these are all to Poland. So, the first plane must make twice as many trips as the second plane, which means the first plane makes 88 trips in one day.

2. Out of these 88 trips, three-quarters are to Greece. So, the number of trips to Greece is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66
   \]

3. The remaining trips are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. Since the total number of trips is 88 and 66 of them are to Greece, the remaining trips are:
   \[
   88 - 66 = 22
   \]
   These 22 trips are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of trips to France is:
   \[
   \frac{22}{2} = 11
   \]

So, the first plane takes 11 flights to France in one day."
"First, let's find out how long each wolf howls.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so:
Chikote's howl time = 2 * Tobias's howl time = 2 * 20 seconds = 40 seconds.

Igneous howls for as long as Tobias and Chikote combined, so:
Igneous's howl time = Tobias's howl time + Chikote's howl time = 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add up the total time for all three wolves:
Total time = Tobias's howl time + Chikote's howl time + Igneous's howl time
Total time = 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):
Total time in minutes = 120 seconds / 60 = 2 minutes.

So, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes."
"First, let's find out how much money Adam's father gave him. Since his father gave him twice as much as his mother, and his mother gave him $6, his father gave him:

\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Now, let's add the money given by his mother and father:

\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \]

Adam's trousers cost $30, and he got $18 from his mother and father. So, the amount of money Adam had to contribute from his savings is:

\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

So, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings."
"First, let's find the average age of the group. The total age of the children is 20, and there are 4 children, so the average age is:

\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Total age of the children}}{\text{Number of children}} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, so Helene's age is:

\[ \text{Helene's age} = 2 \times \text{Average age} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, we know the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene. Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old. Let's add their ages together:

\[ \text{Akbar's age} + \text{Alessandro's age} + \text{Helene's age} = 3 + 4 + 10 = 17 \]

The total age of all four children is 20, so Wilfred's age can be found by subtracting the sum of the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene from the total age:

\[ \text{Wilfred's age} = \text{Total age} - (\text{Akbar's age} + \text{Alessandro's age} + \text{Helene's age}) = 20 - 17 = 3 \]

So, Wilfred is 3 years old. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Walter has collected from his neighbors and the online fund.

From his neighbors: $500
From the online fund: $1500

Total collected so far: $500 + $1500 = $2000

Now, Walter's lawyer is going to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. To find out how much the lawyer will donate, we need to know how much everyone else has donated. Walter's friend is going to give him $200, which means everyone else has donated a total of $200.

The lawyer's donation will be three times the amount donated by everyone else, which is $200.

So, the lawyer's donation is: 3 * $200 = $600

The final numerical answer is $600."
"First, let's find out the total number of cookies. There were 100 guests, and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies. So, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies/guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies} \]

The bride gave half of the cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500 \text{ cookies}}{2} = 750 \text{ cookies} \]

Each person in the church next door got 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church next door, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people} \]

So, the number of people in the church next door is 50."
"To solve this problem, let's assume the watermelon is divided into 6 equal slices. This means each slice represents 1/6 of the watermelon.

Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, and each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice, we can represent the slices as follows:
- Each kid gets 1 slice.
- Each adult gets 2 slices.

So, the total number of slices given to the adults is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) slices, and the total number of slices given to the kids is \(4 \times 1 = 4\) slices. This means all 6 slices are accounted for.

Now, we need to find out what percentage of the watermelon each adult gets. Since each adult gets 2 slices out of the 6 total slices, each adult gets \(\frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}\) of the watermelon.

To convert \(\frac{1}{3}\) to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 100 = \frac{100}{3} \approx 33.33\%
\]

So, each adult gets approximately 33.33% of the watermelon."
"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on checking on the inpatients. He spends 20 minutes per inpatient and there are 9 inpatients.

\[ 20 \text{ minutes/inpatient} \times 9 \text{ inpatients} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's convert the total time spent on inpatients from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the total time spent on appointments. He has 10 appointments, each taking 30 minutes.

\[ 30 \text{ minutes/appointment} \times 10 \text{ appointments} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Convert the total time spent on appointments from minutes to hours:

\[ 300 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's add up all the time spent on inpatients and appointments:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 5 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic in total. To find out how many hours he has left to update his records, we subtract the time spent on inpatients and appointments from the total clinic time:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"First, let's add up all the time Jordan needs to make the cake:

- Making the cake batter: 20 minutes
- Baking the cake: 30 minutes
- Cooling the cake: 2 hours = 2 * 60 minutes = 120 minutes
- Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

Now, let's add these times together:

20 minutes + 30 minutes + 120 minutes + 10 minutes = 180 minutes

180 minutes is the total time Jordan needs to make the cake. To find out the latest time she can start, we need to subtract this total time from the time she wants to serve the cake, which is 5:00 pm.

5:00 pm is 5 hours and 0 minutes after 12:00 pm. So, we need to subtract 180 minutes from 5:00 pm.

180 minutes is 3 hours (since 180 minutes ÷ 60 minutes/hour = 3 hours).

If we subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm, we get 2:00 pm.

So, the latest time of day that Jordan can start making the cake to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm is 2:00 pm.

The final numerical answer is 2:00 pm."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we first need to calculate the total number of boxes they sold together.

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. So together they sold:
3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes

They sold a total of 64 chocolate bars. To find out how many chocolate bars are in one box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes:
64 ÷ 8 = 8

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost to rent the studio per session**: $25
2. **Cost per student per session**: $1.50
3. **Number of students**: 10
4. **Number of days the studio is rented per week**: 3
5. **Number of weeks in a month**: We'll assume a month has about 4 weeks for simplicity.

First, calculate the cost per session for 10 students:
\[ \text{Cost per session} = \$25 + (\$1.50 \times 10) = \$25 + \$15 = \$40 \]

Next, calculate the earnings per session:
\[ \text{Earnings per session} = \$40 \]

Now, calculate the earnings per week:
\[ \text{Earnings per week} = \$40 \times 3 = \$120 \]

Finally, calculate the earnings for the month:
\[ \text{Earnings per month} = \$120 \times 4 = \$480 \]

So, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are:
\[ \$480 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes.

First, let's find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's boxes. Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars. So, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes Peter has:

\[ \text{Chocolate bars per box for Peter} = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]

Next, let's find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Martha's boxes. Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars. So, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes Martha has:

\[ \text{Chocolate bars per box for Martha} = \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha. We subtract the number of chocolate bars per box for Martha from the number of chocolate bars per box for Peter:

\[ \text{Difference} = 16 - 8 = 8 \]

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 8 \]"
"First, let's find out how many female porcupines there are. We know that the number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. So, the total number of babies born each month is:

\[ \text{Total babies born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120 \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[ \text{Total babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440 \]

Now, we add the babies born in a year to the original population to find the total number of porcupines in the park after a year:

\[ \text{Total porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1490 \]"
"First, we need to find the volume of the pool. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (which is what the pool is) is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:

\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

Let's calculate this step by step:

\[ 25 \times 14 = 350 \]
\[ 350 \times 4 = 1400 \]

So, the volume of the pool is 1400 cubic feet.

Next, we need to find out how many gallons of water are needed. The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9:

\[ \text{Gallons needed} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]

Let's calculate this:

\[ 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \]

So, the pool needs 8260 gallons of water.

Now, we need to find out the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:

\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]

Let's calculate this:

\[ 8260 \times 0.10 = 826 \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is $826.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{826} \]"
"First, let's find out how many blue sticks there are. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, and there are 9 red sticks, we can calculate the number of blue sticks as follows:

Number of blue sticks = Number of red sticks + 5
Number of blue sticks = 9 + 5
Number of blue sticks = 14

Next, we need to find out how many yellow sticks there are. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks, so:

Number of yellow sticks = Number of blue sticks - 3
Number of yellow sticks = 14 - 3
Number of yellow sticks = 11

Now, to find the total number of sticks, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together:

Total number of sticks = Number of red sticks + Number of blue sticks + Number of yellow sticks
Total number of sticks = 9 + 14 + 11
Total number of sticks = 34

So, the total number of sticks they have is 34."
"First, we need to calculate how far Matteo traveled. Matteo traveled at a speed of 55 miles per hour for 4 hours. To find the distance, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

So, for Matteo:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 55 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate how far Shandy traveled. Shandy traveled at a speed of 45 miles per hour for 10 hours. Using the same formula:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} = 45 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the distance Matteo traveled from the distance Shandy traveled:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."
"First, let's find out how many students are over 16 years old. Since half of the students are over 16 years old, we can calculate this as:

\[ \text{Students over 16} = \frac{3000}{2} = 1500 \]

Next, we find out how many of these students over 16 are male. Since one-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male, we can calculate this as:

\[ \text{Male students over 16} = \frac{1500}{4} = 375 \]

So, the number of female students over 16 years old is:

\[ \text{Female students over 16} = 1500 - 375 = 1125 \]

Now, let's find out how many students are under 16 years old. Since the remaining half of the students are under 16 years old, we can calculate this as:

\[ \text{Students under 16} = \frac{3000}{2} = 1500 \]

Next, we find out how many of these students under 16 are male. Since one-half of the students under 16 are male, we can calculate this as:

\[ \text{Male students under 16} = \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \]

So, the number of female students under 16 years old is:

\[ \text{Female students under 16} = 1500 - 750 = 750 \]

Finally, to find the total number of female students enrolled at the school, we add the number of female students over 16 and the number of female students under 16:

\[ \text{Total female students} = 1125 + 750 = 1875 \]

So, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is 1875."
"First, let's find out how many laps each person can run.

Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.

Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so:
\[ 10 + 4 = 14 \text{ laps} \]

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so:
\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ laps} \]

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so:
\[ 7 - 2 = 5 \text{ laps} \]

Now, to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run:
\[ 10 - 5 = 5 \]

So, Bethany can run 5 more laps than Quinn."
"First, let's calculate how much water Wanda and Ms. B filled into the tank on the first day.

On the first day:
- Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity.
- Ms. B filled \( \frac{3}{4} \) of what Wanda filled.

The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons.

So, Wanda filled:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons} \]

Ms. B filled:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons} \]

Total water filled on the first day:
\[ 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons} \]

On the second day:
- Wanda filled \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what she filled on the first day.
- Ms. B filled \( \frac{1}{3} \) of what she filled on the first day.

So, Wanda filled:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Ms. B filled:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons} \]

Total water filled on the second day:
\[ 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \text{ gallons} \]

Total water filled in two days:
\[ 7875 + 4125 = 12000 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, to find out how many gallons are remaining to fill the tank:
\[ 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the number of gallons of water remaining for the tank to be full is 6000 gallons."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Charge**: Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank was 100%.
2. **First 5 Hours**: The power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour. So, after 1 hour, the charge is 91% (100% - 9%). After 2 hours, it's 82% (91% - 9%). After 3 hours, it's 73% (82% - 9%). After 4 hours, it's 64% (73% - 9%). After 5 hours, it's 55% (64% - 9%).
3. **Next 3 Hours**: After 5 hours, the power bank starts losing 7% of its charge each hour. So, after 6 hours, the charge is 48% (55% - 7%). After 7 hours, it's 41% (48% - 7%). After 8 hours, it's 34% (41% - 7%).

Now, we know that after 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%. So, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 48%.

The final numerical answer is:
48%"
"First, let's find out how much Janet makes in a week. She makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips. So, her total weekly earnings are:

\[ 10 \text{ dollars/hour} + 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 25 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

Since she works 40 hours a week, her weekly earnings are:

\[ 25 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} = 1000 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Now, Janet wants to save up 20% of the cost of a $10000 car for a downpayment. So, the amount she needs to save is:

\[ 10000 \text{ dollars} \times 0.20 = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000, we divide the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:

\[ \frac{2000 \text{ dollars}}{1000 \text{ dollars/week}} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

So, Janet will need to work 2 weeks to save the down payment for the car."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already bought.

- Peaches: 3 peaches * $0.50 each = $1.50
- Pears: 4 pears * $0.50 each = $2.00
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00 each = $2.00
- Apples: 5 apples * $0.75 each = $3.75

Now, let's add up the cost of these fruits:
$1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar has $10 to spend. After buying the fruits he has already purchased, he has:
$10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75 left.

Plums cost $0.25 each. To find out how many plums he can buy with $0.75, we divide:
$0.75 ÷ $0.25 = 3 plums.

So, Jamaar can buy 3 plums."
"First, let's find out the total number of pieces of sweets Anne has. She has 15 packs, and each pack has 60 pieces. So, we multiply the number of packs by the number of pieces in each pack:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept 2 packs for herself. So, we need to find out how many packs she gave to her friends. We subtract the packs she kept from the total packs:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} - 2 \text{ packs} = 13 \text{ packs} \]

Now, we need to divide these 13 packs equally among her 10 friends. So, we divide the number of packs given to friends by the number of friends:

\[ 13 \text{ packs} \div 10 \text{ friends} = 1.3 \text{ packs/friend} \]

Since each friend received 1.3 packs, and each pack has 60 pieces, we need to find out how many pieces each friend received. We multiply the number of packs each friend received by the number of pieces in each pack:

\[ 1.3 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 78 \text{ pieces} \]

So, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 78 \]"
"To solve this, we need to calculate the price increase year by year. The price increases by 5% each year, so we multiply the current price by 1.05 (which is the same as adding 5% to the price).

Let's start with the initial price of $120.

After the first year, the price would be:
\[ 120 \times 1.05 = 126 \]

After the second year, the price would be:
\[ 126 \times 1.05 = 132.3 \]

After the third year, the price would be:
\[ 132.3 \times 1.05 = 138.165 \]

Rounding 138.165 to the nearest integer gives us 138.

So, the price of carrots after three years would be $138."
"To solve this, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums to find out how many pictures were in each album. Then we can figure out how many selfies and portraits there are.

Olivia has 72 pictures in 8 albums. So, we divide 72 by 8 to find out how many pictures are in each album:

\[ 72 \div 8 = 9 \]

So, each album has 9 pictures.

Now, we know that 3 of the albums are selfies only and 2 of the albums are portraits. Since each album has 9 pictures, we can calculate the number of selfies and portraits by multiplying the number of albums by the number of pictures per album.

For selfies:
\[ 3 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures/album} = 27 \text{ selfies} \]

For portraits:
\[ 2 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures/album} = 18 \text{ portraits} \]

So, the total number of selfies and portraits is:
\[ 27 \text{ selfies} + 18 \text{ portraits} = 45 \]

The final numerical answer is 45."
"First, we need to find out how many minutes it takes James to read one page. Since it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can divide 10 minutes by 3 pages to find out how many minutes it takes to read one page.

\[ \text{Time to read one page} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} \]

Next, we need to find out how many minutes it takes James to read 18 pages. We can multiply the time it takes to read one page by 18.

\[ \text{Time to read 18 pages} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes} \]

Let's calculate this.
\[ \text{Time to read 18 pages} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 18 \times 3.3333 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, James spends 60 minutes reading."
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.
- 24 guests checked out early.
- 15 guests checked out late.
- Twice as many people checked in as those who checked out late. Since 15 guests checked out late, twice that number is 30.
- 7 more people checked in after dinner.

Now, let's calculate the number of guests after each event:

1. After 24 guests checked out early, the number of guests is:
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76
   \]

2. After 15 guests checked out late, the number of guests is:
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61
   \]

3. After 30 guests checked in (twice as many as those who checked out late):
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91
   \]

4. After 7 more guests checked in:
   \[
   91 + 7 = 98

So, the final number of guests in the hotel is 98."
"To find out how many bananas John has, we need to add up the bananas he picked on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.

On Wednesday, he picked 4 bananas.
On Thursday, he picked 6 bananas.
On Friday, he picked triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

Now, let's add them up:
4 (Wednesday) + 6 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) = 22 bananas

So, the final numerical answer is 22."
"First, let's find out how many easy questions there are in the quiz. Since 40% of the questions are easy, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of easy questions} = 40\% \times 60 = 0.40 \times 60 = 24 \]

Next, we find out how many questions are average and how many are difficult. Since the easy questions make up 40% and the rest are equally divided into average and difficult questions, we have:

\[ \text{Percentage of average and difficult questions} = 100\% - 40\% = 60\% \]

Since the average and difficult questions are equally divided, each makes up:

\[ \text{Percentage of average questions} = \text{Percentage of difficult questions} = \frac{60\%}{2} = 30\% \]

Now, we calculate the number of average and difficult questions:

\[ \text{Number of average questions} = 30\% \times 60 = 0.30 \times 60 = 18 \]
\[ \text{Number of difficult questions} = 30\% \times 60 = 0.30 \times 60 = 18 \]

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct. So, we calculate how many easy questions she gets right:

\[ \text{Easy questions Aries gets right} = 75\% \times 24 = 0.75 \times 24 = 18 \]

Aries is sure to get half of the average and difficult questions correct. So, we calculate how many of these she gets right:

\[ \text{Average and difficult questions Aries gets right} = \frac{1}{2} \times (18 + 18) = \frac{1}{2} \times 36 = 18 \]

Now, we add the number of questions Aries gets right from the easy, average, and difficult questions:

\[ \text{Total questions Aries gets right} = 18 + 18 + 18 = 54 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 54 \]"
"First, let's find out how much Teresa sold each small stuffed animal for. We know that each small stuffed animal costs $4.

Next, we need to find out how much Teresa sold each large stuffed animal for. Since large stuffed animals are sold for three times the price of small ones, each large stuffed animal costs \(3 \times 4 = $12\).

Now, let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \(L\) and the number of small stuffed animals sold as \(S\). According to the problem, Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so \(S = 2L\).

The total earnings from the sales are $120. The earnings from the small stuffed animals are \(4S\) and the earnings from the large stuffed animals are \(12L\). So, the total earnings can be expressed as:
\[4S + 12L = 120\]

Since \(S = 2L\), we can substitute \(2L\) for \(S\) in the equation:
\[4(2L) + 12L = 120\]
\[8L + 12L = 120\]
\[20L = 120\]
\[L = \frac{120}{20}\]
\[L = 6\]

Now that we know \(L = 6\), we can find \(S\):
\[S = 2L = 2 \times 6 = 12\]

So, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals. The final numerical answer is:
\[12\]"
"To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we first need to calculate the total number of sandwiches they eat in one day and then multiply that by 7 (the number of days in a week).

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, the wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and the son eats 2 sandwiches per day. So, the total number of sandwiches they eat in one day is:

5 (man) + 4 (wife) + 2 (son) = 11 sandwiches per day.

Now, to find out how many sandwiches they eat in one week, we multiply the daily total by 7:

11 sandwiches/day * 7 days/week = 77 sandwiches/week.

So, the family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"First, let's calculate how much money Suzanne earned from selling cookies. She sold 80 cookies at $1 each, so:
\[ 80 \text{ cookies} \times \$1/\text{cookie} = \$80 \]

Next, let's calculate how much money she earned from selling cupcakes. She sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each, so:
\[ 60 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$4/\text{cupcake} = \$240 \]

Now, let's add the money she earned from cookies and cupcakes to find her total earnings:
\[ \$80 + \$240 = \$320 \]

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each for helping her, so she gave away:
\[ 2 \times \$10 = \$20 \]

To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we subtract the amount she gave away from her total earnings:
\[ \$320 - \$20 = \$300 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$300 \]"
"The Smith twins found a total of 30 + 30 = 60 eggs.

If there were 100 eggs hidden in total and the Smith twins found 60 eggs, then 100 - 60 = 40 eggs were left.

Since all the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends, the friends found 40 - 10 = 30 eggs.

So, the friends found 30 eggs."
"First, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. We know that with a steel pickaxe, a dwarf can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. Since an iron pickaxe allows a dwarf to mine twice as much as with bare hands, we can calculate the amount of ore mined with a steel pickaxe as follows:

1. Ore mined with bare hands: 12 pounds
2. Ore mined with an iron pickaxe: 12 pounds * 2 = 24 pounds
3. Ore mined with a steel pickaxe: 24 pounds + (50% of 24 pounds) = 24 pounds + 12 pounds = 36 pounds

So, one dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore with a steel pickaxe in a day.

Now, we need to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month with 30 days. We multiply the daily ore mining amount by the number of dwarves and the number of days in the month:

40 dwarves * 36 pounds/dwarf/day * 30 days = 43200 pounds

So, the final numerical answer is 43200 pounds."
"To solve this, we need to find the price for the package with 8 sandwiches based on the given prices for the other packages. We know the prices are proportional, so we can set up a ratio.

For the first package:
- 2 sandwiches cost $3.

For the second package:
- 4 sandwiches cost $6.

For the third package:
- 8 sandwiches cost an unknown price, let's call it \( x \).

Since the prices are proportional, the ratio of the number of sandwiches to the cost should be the same for all packages. So, we can set up the following ratios:

For the first package:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ sandwiches}}{3 \text{ dollars}} \]

For the second package:
\[ \frac{4 \text{ sandwiches}}{6 \text{ dollars}} \]

For the third package:
\[ \frac{8 \text{ sandwiches}}{x \text{ dollars}} \]

Since the ratios are proportional, we can write:
\[ \frac{2}{3} = \frac{4}{6} = \frac{8}{x} \]

We can simplify the ratio \(\frac{4}{6}\) to \(\frac{2}{3}\), which matches the first ratio. So, we can use the first ratio to find \( x \):
\[ \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{x} \]

To find \( x \), we can cross-multiply:
\[ 2x = 3 \times 8 \]
\[ 2x = 24 \]
\[ x = \frac{24}{2} \]
\[ x = 12 \]

So, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"First, let's find out how much Tom has to pay for the bedroom set after selling his old one.

Tom buys a bedroom set for $3000 and sells his old bedroom for $1000. So, the amount he needs to pay for the new bedroom set is:
\[ 3000 - 1000 = 2000 \]

Now, Tom has to pay 10% of this amount per month. To find out how much he has to pay each month, we calculate 10% of $2000:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month for the bedroom set. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 200 \]"
"First, let's calculate how many red balloons burst. Sally started with 25 red balloons and 40% of them burst. So, the number of red balloons that burst is:
\[ 25 \times \frac{40}{100} = 25 \times 0.4 = 10 \]
This means the number of red balloons left is:
\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Next, Sally accidentally released half of the yellow balloons. She started with 12 yellow balloons, so the number of yellow balloons released is:
\[ 12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \]
This means the number of yellow balloons left is:
\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

Now, Sally found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her remaining balloons. The number of blue balloons she added is:
\[ 8 \times \frac{75}{100} = 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \]
So, the total number of balloons she carried into the school is the sum of the remaining red, green, and yellow balloons plus the blue balloons she added:
\[ 15 \text{ (red)} + 7 \text{ (green)} + 6 \text{ (yellow)} + 6 \text{ (blue)} = 34 \]

Therefore, the final number of balloons Sally carried into the school is:
\[ 34 \]"
"To solve this, let's break down the chances step by step:

1. There's a 50% chance the substitute teacher will not collect the homework.
2. If the normal teacher comes, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension.
3. If the normal teacher doesn't give an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher to let him turn in his homework late.

First, let's find the chance that Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework if the normal teacher is there. This is the chance that the teacher doesn't give an extension minus the chance that Marcus convinces the teacher to let him turn it in late.

Chance of no extension = 100% - 40% = 60%
Chance of convincing the teacher = 20%

So, the chance that Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework if the normal teacher is there is 60% - 20% = 40%.

Now, we add the chance that the substitute teacher won't collect the homework (50%) to the chance that the normal teacher gives an extension (40%).

Total chance Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework = 50% + 40% = 90%.

So, the chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is 100% - 90% = 10%.

The final numerical answer is 10%."
"First, we need to find out how many seats are left after accounting for the seats for graduates and faculty.

The total number of seats is 6000.
Seats for graduates are 950.
Seats for faculty are 300.

So, the number of seats left for graduates and their guests is:
6000 - 950 - 300 = 5750 seats.

Now, we need to split these 5750 seats equally among the graduates. Let's assume there are 'G' graduates. Each graduate would get:
5750 / G tickets.

However, the question doesn't specify the number of graduates. Without knowing the exact number of graduates, we can't calculate the exact number of tickets each graduate would get. But if we assume the question is asking for the formula or the process, we can say each graduate would get 5750 divided by the number of graduates.

If we assume the number of graduates is known or can be determined, we can plug that number into the formula to get the exact number of tickets each graduate would receive. Since the number of graduates is not provided, we can't give a specific numerical answer."
"First, let's find out how many medium-sized jelly beans Grandpa can eat. Since he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, and he can eat 75 large beans, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of medium-sized beans} = 2 \times 75 = 150 \]

Next, we need to find out how many small beans he can eat. We know that 3 small beans are the same as 1 medium-sized bean. So, to find out how many small beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans, we multiply:

\[ \text{Number of small beans} = 150 \times 3 = 450 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 450 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time Melissa spends on jury duty. She spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, so:

\[ 6 \, \text{hours/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 18 \, \text{hours} \]

Next, let's calculate her total pay for the 3 days. She is paid $15 per day, so:

\[ 15 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 45 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate her total expenses for parking. She pays $3 for parking each day, so:

\[ 3 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 9 \, \text{dollars} \]

To find out how much she makes after expenses, we subtract her total expenses from her total pay:

\[ 45 \, \text{dollars} - 9 \, \text{dollars} = 36 \, \text{dollars} \]

Finally, to find out how much she makes per hour after expenses, we divide her total pay after expenses by the total number of hours she spent on jury duty:

\[ \frac{36 \, \text{dollars}}{18 \, \text{hours}} = 2 \, \text{dollars/hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the books. Ted buys 3 books at 16 dollars each, so the total cost for the books is:
\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pencils. Ted buys 3 pencils at 6 dollars each, so the total cost for the pencils is:
\[ 3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the books and the cost of the pencils to find the total amount Ted spent:
\[ 48 + 18 = 66 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Ted spent is:
\[ 66 \text{ dollars} \]"
"First, we need to find out how many soda bottles Richard will place along his driveway. Since the driveway is 24 feet wide and he wants to put a bottle every 3 feet, we can divide the total width by the distance between each bottle:

\[ \text{Number of bottles} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles} \]

Richard will need to go from one bottle to the next to drop the candy in each bottle. Since he starts at the first bottle and goes to the next one, he will need to make 7 trips (from the first to the second, second to the third, and so on, until the seventh to the eighth bottle).

Each trip takes 5 seconds, so we multiply the number of trips by the time per trip to find the total time:

\[ \text{Total time} = 7 \text{ trips} \times 5 \text{ seconds/trip} = 35 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is 35 seconds."
"First, let's find out how many apples are in two boxes. Since one box has forty apples, two boxes will have:

40 apples/box * 2 boxes = 80 apples

Now, Uncle Franky plans to pack the apples with eight apples in one pack. To find out how many packs he can make, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack:

80 apples / 8 apples/pack = 10 packs

So, the final numerical answer is 10."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the Parmesan cheese:
- The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound.
- Mo buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese.
- So, the cost for Parmesan cheese is \( 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$11/\text{pound} = \$22 \).

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mozzarella cheese:
- The price of mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound.
- Mo buys 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese.
- So, the cost for mozzarella cheese is \( 3 \text{ pounds} \times \$6/\text{pound} = \$18 \).

Now, let's add the costs of the Parmesan and mozzarella cheese to find the total cost:
- Total cost = Cost of Parmesan + Cost of mozzarella
- Total cost = \$22 + \$18 = \$40.

Mo starts with $50. To find out how much money she has left after buying the cheese, we subtract the total cost from the amount she started with:
- Money left = Starting amount - Total cost
- Money left = \$50 - \$40 = \$10.

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"First, let's calculate how much money Jim borrowed in total. He borrowed $50,000 per year for 4 years, so:

\[ 50,000 \times 4 = 200,000 \]

So, Jim took out $200,000 in loans.

Next, let's calculate how much his income increased after college. His income tripled, so:

\[ 25,000 \times 3 = 75,000 \]

So, after college, his income is $75,000 per year.

Now, let's calculate how much he lost in income while in college. He was making $25,000 per year and didn't work for 4 years, so:

\[ 25,000 \times 4 = 100,000 \]

So, he lost $100,000 in income while in college.

Now, let's add the amount he borrowed and the amount he lost in income:

\[ 200,000 + 100,000 = 300,000 \]

So, Jim needs to earn $300,000 to pay back his loans and make up for the lost income.

To find out how long it would take him to earn $300,000 at his new income of $75,000 per year, we divide the total amount he needs to earn by his annual income after college:

\[ \frac{300,000}{75,000} = 4 \]

So, it would take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's find out the size of the fabric Jim needs for one piece. The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. The fabric needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of the fabric for one piece is:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \]

And the width of the fabric for one piece is:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \]

Now, to find out how many square feet of fabric Jim needs for one piece, we multiply the length by the width:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the square footage of one piece by 2:
\[ 80 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

So, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Monday's Letters**: We are given that the post office delivered 425 letters on Monday.

2. **Tuesday's Letters**: We need to find out how many letters were delivered on Tuesday. The problem states that Tuesday's delivery was 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery. So, we calculate one-fifth of Monday's delivery:
   \[
   \frac{1}{5} \times 425 = 85
   \]
   Then, we add 17 to this amount to get Tuesday's delivery:
   \[
   85 + 17 = 102
   \]
   So, the post office delivered 102 letters on Tuesday.

3. **Wednesday's Letters**: The problem states that Wednesday's delivery was 5 more than twice Tuesday's delivery. First, we calculate twice Tuesday's delivery:
   \[
   2 \times 102 = 204
   \]
   Then, we add 5 to this amount to get Wednesday's delivery:
   \[
   204 + 5 = 209
   \]
   So, the post office delivered 209 letters on Wednesday.

4. **Total Delivery**: To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we add the number of letters delivered each day:
   \[
   425 + 102 + 209 = 736
   \]

So, the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is 736."
"First, let's calculate the cost for the chicken salad. There are 10 people who want the chicken salad and it costs $6.50 per person. So, the total cost for the chicken salad is:
\[ 10 \times 6.50 = 65 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost for the pasta salad. There are 6 people who want the pasta salad and it costs $6 per person. So, the total cost for the pasta salad is:
\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

Now, we add the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad to find the total amount Molly will pay:
\[ 65 + 36 = 101 \]

So, the total amount Molly will pay for the catering is:
\[ 101 \]"
"To find out how much Johnny's dad lost on average, we need to calculate the total amount lost and then divide it by the number of races.

First, let's calculate the amount won or lost in each race:

1. In the first race, he lost $5.
2. In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. So, he won $1 + (2 * $5) = $1 + $10 = $11.
3. In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.5.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost:
- First race: $5
- Second race: $11 (he won, so this is a gain, not a loss)
- Third race: $16.5

Total amount lost = $5 + $16.5 = $21.5

Now, we need to find the average amount lost per race. Since there are 3 races, we divide the total amount lost by 3:
Average amount lost = $21.5 / 3 = $7.16666666667

Rounding to the nearest cent, the average amount lost is $7.17.

So, the final numerical answer is:
$7.17"
"To find the total number of people in South America, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country and then by the number of people living in each city.

Number of countries in South America = 26
Number of cities in each country = 5
Number of people in each city = 1000

Total number of people = Number of countries × Number of cities in each country × Number of people in each city
Total number of people = 26 × 5 × 1000

Now let's calculate this:
Total number of people = 26 × 5 × 1000 = 130,000

So, the total number of people in South America is 130,000."
"First, we need to convert all measurements to the same unit. Let's use inches for this calculation.

Xavier was 4 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert Xavier's height to inches:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Xavier grew 3 inches, so his new height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches, so his new height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's height:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is 1 inch."
"Let's denote the amount the first person took as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount they took together is $1920. So we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Now let's solve this equation step by step:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]
Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]
Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the first person's share is $420.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 420 \]"
"First, we need to find out how many days the painters worked in total. They worked for 3 weeks, and each week has 7 days. So, the total number of days they worked is:

\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days} \]

Next, we know that each day they worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day. So, the total number of days each painter worked is:

\[ 21 \text{ days} \times \frac{3}{8} \text{ days/painter} = \frac{63}{8} \text{ days/painter} \]

To convert this into hours, we know that 1 day is equal to 24 hours. So, the total number of hours each painter worked is:

\[ \frac{63}{8} \text{ days/painter} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = \frac{63 \times 24}{8} \text{ hours/painter} \]

Simplifying the fraction:

\[ \frac{63 \times 24}{8} = \frac{63 \times 3}{1} = 189 \text{ hours/painter} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 189 \]"
"Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, Rory retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

So, we can write the equation for the total number of balls as:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2}) = 2 \cdot 19 \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Then, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now that we know \( x = 6 \), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

So, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation year by year from 2007 to 2010.

The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year, which means it retains 79% (100% - 21%) of its value each year.

Let's calculate the value of the car in 2008:
\[ \text{Value in 2008} = \text{Initial Value} \times 0.79 = 20000 \times 0.79 = 15800 \]

Next, we calculate the value of the car in 2009:
\[ \text{Value in 2009} = \text{Value in 2008} \times 0.79 = 15800 \times 0.79 = 12522 \]

Finally, we calculate the value of the car in 2010:
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = \text{Value in 2009} \times 0.79 = 12522 \times 0.79 = 9884.38 \]

So, the price of the car in the year 2010 is $9884.38."
"First, let's find out how many books are written in English. Since half of the 50 books are in English, we calculate:

\[ \text{English books} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

Next, we find out how many books are written in German. Since 10% of the books are in German, we calculate:

\[ \text{German books} = 10\% \times 50 = 0.10 \times 50 = 5 \]

Now, to find out how many books are in Spanish, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:

\[ \text{Spanish books} = 50 - \text{English books} - \text{German books} \]
\[ \text{Spanish books} = 50 - 25 - 5 = 20 \]

So, the number of Spanish books is 20."
"First, let's find out how many kilometers Bernice has already driven. She drove for 4 days and a total of 325 kilometers.

Now, we need to subtract the kilometers she has already driven from the total distance to find out how many kilometers she still needs to drive.

Total distance = 1955 kilometers
Distance already driven = 325 kilometers

Distance still needed = Total distance - Distance already driven
Distance still needed = 1955 - 325
Distance still needed = 1630 kilometers

So, Bernice will still need to drive 1630 kilometers."
"To solve this, we first need to find out how many cups of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days. Since she drinks 8 cups a day, we multiply 8 by 30:

\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we need to convert cups to gallons. We know that 16 cups make a gallon. So, we divide the total number of cups by 16 to get the number of gallons:

\[ 240 \text{ cups} \div 16 \text{ cups/gallon} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 15 gallons."
"First, let's calculate the number of people on the train after each stop.

1. Initially, there are 120 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   120 + 20 = 140
   \]
3. At the second stop, 50 people get off the train and twice that number (which is 100) get on the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   140 - 50 + 100 = 140 - 50 + 100 = 90 + 100 = 190
   \]
4. At the third stop, 80 more people get off the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   190 - 80 = 110

Therefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110."
"First, let's find out how much Alison spent on each item:

1. Tank top: $10
2. Running shorts: $5 more than the tank top, so $10 + $5 = $15
3. Tennis shoes: The original price was $48, but they were on sale for half price, so $48 / 2 = $24
4. Athletic socks: The original price was $8, but she had a $2 coupon, so $8 - $2 = $6

Now, let's add up all the costs:

$10 (tank top) + $15 (running shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (athletic socks) = $55

So, Alison spent $55 on athletic gear."
"To find out how many tiles you need, you first need to know the area of each tile. Since each tile is a square with a side length of 1ft, the area of each tile is 1ft * 1ft = 1 SqFt.

Your kitchen floor has a total area of 200 SqFt. So, you will need 200 tiles to cover the entire floor.

Each tile costs $12. Therefore, the total cost will be 200 tiles * $12/tile = $2400.

So, the final numerical answer is $2400."
"First, we need to find out how much the insurance cost after the accident. Since the cost was 60% more than normal, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost.

The normal cost is $120 a month. So, 60% of $120 is calculated as follows:
\[ 60\% \text{ of } 120 = \frac{60}{100} \times 120 = 0.60 \times 120 = 72 \]

Now, we add this to the normal cost to find the total cost after the accident:
\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

So, the cost of the insurance after the accident is $192 a month. To find out how much he pays in a year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12:
\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 2304 \]"
"First, let's figure out how many sets of sheets Greg needs to wash each week. A twin set of sheets consists of 2 twin beds, so 4 twin beds make 2 twin sets. A king set of sheets consists of 1 king bed, so 1 king bed makes 1 king set. Therefore, Greg needs to wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set of sheets each week.

Next, we know that Greg's laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time and 1 king set at a time. So, in one load, he can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set.

Now, let's calculate how many loads he needs to do each week:
- For the twin sets: 2 twin sets / 2 twin sets per load = 1 load
- For the king set: 1 king set / 1 king set per load = 1 load

So, in one week, Greg needs to do 1 load for the twin sets and 1 load for the king set, which totals to 2 loads per week.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we can calculate the total number of loads Greg does in a year by multiplying the number of loads per week by the number of weeks in a year:
- 2 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 104 loads/year

So, the final numerical answer is 104."
"First, let's find out how many movies Jill and her friends watch on a Sunday. They watch half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday. Since they watch 4 movies on Saturday, on Sunday they watch:

\[ \text{Movies on Sunday} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Now, let's find out how many movies they watch in one weekend (Saturday and Sunday together):

\[ \text{Movies in one weekend} = 4 + 2 = 6 \]

Since they watch movies every weekend, in 4 weeks, they will have 4 weekends. So, the total number of movies they can watch in 4 weeks is:

\[ \text{Total movies in 4 weeks} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 24."
"Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers. Last year, he collected 50 more stickers, so he had 100 + 50 = 150 stickers. This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, so he collected 50 * 2 = 100 stickers. Therefore, the total number of stickers Leo has now is 150 + 100 = 250 stickers.

The final numerical answer is 250."
"To find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we first need to calculate how much cat food Imma's cats consume in total each day.

Imma has 3 cats and feeds them 60 grams of cat food each time, twice a day. So, the total amount of food consumed per day is:

\[ 3 \text{ cats} \times 60 \text{ grams/cat} \times 2 \text{ feedings/day} = 360 \text{ grams/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last if 360 grams are consumed each day. We do this by dividing the total amount of food by the daily consumption:

\[ \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams/day}} = 2 \text{ days} \]

So, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days."
"First, let's find out how many slices Jake ate. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake and Becky ate 10 slices, we can calculate Jake's slices as follows:

Jake's slices = Becky's slices - 3
Jake's slices = 10 - 3
Jake's slices = 7

Now, we know that Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake. So, we can calculate Silvia's slices as follows:

Silvia's slices = 2 * Jake's slices
Silvia's slices = 2 * 7
Silvia's slices = 14

Now, let's add up all the slices they ate:

Total slices = Becky's slices + Jake's slices + Silvia's slices
Total slices = 10 + 7 + 14
Total slices = 31

So, the total number of slices they ate is 31."
"Let's call the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we can say Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time they spent making the meal is the sum of the time Donovan spent and the time Betsy spent, which is given as 98 minutes. So we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side gives:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides to isolate the term with \( D \):

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( D \):

\[ D = 40 \]

So Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we add 18 to 40:

\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes. The final numerical answer is:

58"
"First, let's break down the costs:

1. The cost of the cast is $200.
2. The doctor charges $300 per hour for a visit. Since the visit is only 30 minutes, we need to convert this to hours. 30 minutes is half an hour, so the cost for the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.
3. The cost of 30 painkillers at $4 each is $4 * 30 = $120.
4. The cost of parking is $6 per hour for a minimum of 2 hours, so the cost is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, we add all these costs together to find the total cost of the doctor's visit:

$200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482.

So, the total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"First, let's find out how many emails James gets that require a response each day. If he gets 80 emails a day and 20% of those don't require a response, then 80% of the emails do require a response.

To find 80% of 80 emails:
\[ 80 \times \frac{80}{100} = 80 \times 0.8 = 64 \]

So, James responds to 64 emails each day. Now, to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5 day work week, we multiply the number of emails he responds to each day by 5:

\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 320."
"To solve this, let's break it down day by day:

- Monday: 32 classes
- Tuesday: Twice as many as Monday, so \(32 \times 2 = 64\) classes
- Wednesday: Three times as many as Monday, so \(32 \times 3 = 96\) classes
- Thursday: 30 classes
- Friday: 25 classes

Now, let's add them all up:

- Monday: 32
- Tuesday: 64
- Wednesday: 96
- Thursday: 30
- Friday: 25

Total = 32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25

Let's add these numbers:

32 + 64 = 96
96 + 96 = 192
192 + 30 = 222
222 + 25 = 247

So, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is 247."
"To find the average score, we need to add up all the scores and then divide by the number of tests.

John's scores are:
- First 3 tests: 100 each
- 4th test: 80

So, the total score is:
100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380

He took 4 tests in total, so we divide the total score by 4 to find the average:
380 ÷ 4 = 95

The final numerical answer is 95."
"First, let's find out how many pizzas the glee club ate. They ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. To find out how many pizzas they ate, we calculate:

\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \text{ pizzas} \]

So, the glee club has:

\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \text{ pizzas left} \]

Next, let's find out how many pizzas the football team ate. They ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ pizzas} \]

They ate 80% of these pizzas, so:

\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \text{ pizzas} \]

So, the football team has:

\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \text{ pizzas left} \]

Now, let's find out the total number of pizzas left by adding the pizzas left from both the glee club and the football team:

\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \text{ pizzas left} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 14 \]"
"First, let's find out how many big coupons Anthony wants to send. He wants to send twice as many big coupons as small coupons. Since he wants to send 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is:

\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so for 700 small coupons, the cost is:

\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so for 1400 big coupons, the cost is:

\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of mailing all the coupons, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons:

\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:

\[ 24500 \text{ cents} = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Anthony spends a total of:

\[ \boxed{245} \text{ dollars} \]"
"First, let's find out how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney ordered. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. So, we calculate:

10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches

Sidney ordered 7 meatball sub sandwiches. Then Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. So, the number of meatball sub sandwiches left after Mark ate some is:

7 - 4 = 3 meatball sub sandwiches

After that, Sidney ordered another 3 meatball sub sandwiches. So, the total number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney has now is:

3 + 3 = 6 meatball sub sandwiches

Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. So, the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is:

6 * 4 = 24 meatballs

The final numerical answer is 24."
"First, let's find out how many trucks had mechanical failures. Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks, and a quarter of them had problems. So, we calculate a quarter of 20:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
\]

This means 5 trucks had mechanical failures and couldn't deliver the fertiliser. Therefore, the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:

\[
20 - 5 = 15
\]

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. So, the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:

\[
15 \times 20 = 300
\]

The final numerical answer is 300 tons."
"First, let's figure out how many pounds of butter Dennis needs. Since he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants and he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need:

\[ 6 \text{ dozen croissants} \times 1 \text{ pound of butter per dozen} = 6 \text{ pounds of butter} \]

Now, let's look at the promotion. The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter get one half off."" This means for every 2 pounds of butter, Dennis only pays for 1 pound.

Since Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter, we can calculate how many sets of 2 pounds he can get:

\[ 6 \text{ pounds} \div 2 = 3 \text{ sets} \]

For each set of 2 pounds, he only pays for 1 pound. So, for 3 sets, he will pay for:

\[ 3 \text{ sets} \times 1 \text{ pound per set} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

The cost of butter is $4.00 per pound. So, the total cost for 3 pounds of butter will be:

\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pound} = \$12.00 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$12.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people invited to the party:

- Kayla invited her 25 classmates.
- She invited 7 girls from her dance class.
- She invited 13 family members.
- Total invited = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 people.

Now, let's find out how many people will actually come to the party. Since 4 people said they could not come, the number of people who will come is:

- Total invited - People who can't come = 45 - 4 = 41 people.

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for the first 20 guests, and then $6 for each additional guest. So, we need to calculate the cost for the additional guests:

- Additional guests = Total guests - Initial guests = 41 - 20 = 21 guests.
- Cost for additional guests = 21 * $6 = $126.

Now, we add the initial rental fee to the cost for the additional guests to get the total cost:

- Total cost = Initial rental fee + Cost for additional guests = $125 + $126 = $251.

So, the party will cost Kayla $251."
"Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she spent $60 / 4 = $15. So, Maggie has $60 - $15 = $45 left.

Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she spent $60 / 3 = $20. So, Riza has $60 - $20 = $40 left.

Together, they have $45 + $40 = $85 left.

The final numerical answer is $85."
"First, let's find out how many bananas the first monkey eats in a week. Since the first monkey eats 10 bananas each day, in a week (7 days) it eats:
\[ 10 \text{ bananas/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ bananas} \]

Next, let's find out how many bananas the second monkey eats in a week. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey each day, so it eats:
\[ 10 \text{ bananas/day} + 4 \text{ bananas/day} = 14 \text{ bananas/day} \]
In a week, the second monkey eats:
\[ 14 \text{ bananas/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 98 \text{ bananas} \]

Now, we know the total number of bananas Mr. Robles bought is 315. The third monkey eats the rest of the bananas for the day. To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats in a week, we subtract the bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys from the total:
\[ 315 \text{ bananas} - 70 \text{ bananas} - 98 \text{ bananas} = 147 \text{ bananas} \]

Since the third monkey eats the same number of bananas each day, we divide the total bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week by 7:
\[ \frac{147 \text{ bananas}}{7 \text{ days}} = 21 \text{ bananas/day} \]

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day."
"Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, so that's 500 / 2 = 250 pieces. Teddy also finished another 500 piece puzzle. So, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is 250 + 500 = 750 pieces."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the roses Jenny bought.

Jenny bought 15 roses. Since roses cost $2 each, the cost for 15 roses is:
\[ 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jenny has initially. She arrived with five 5 dollar bills, so she has:
\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the total cost of the roses is $30 and Jenny only has $25, she needs an additional $5 to pay for the roses. However, the question asks how many quarters she leaves with, which implies we need to find out how many quarters she gets in change.

The change she gets is:
\[ 30 - 25 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Since quarters are worth $0.25 each, the number of quarters she gets is:
\[ \frac{5}{0.25} = 20 \text{ quarters} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total money Terry makes from selling milkshakes. He sells 6 milkshakes for $5.50 each, so:
\[ 6 \times 5.50 = 33 \]

Next, let's calculate the total money he makes from selling burger platters. He sells 9 burger platters for $11 each, so:
\[ 9 \times 11 = 99 \]

Then, let's calculate the total money he makes from selling sodas. He sells 20 sodas for $1.50 each, so:
\[ 20 \times 1.50 = 30 \]

Now, we add up all the money he makes from each item to find the total amount of money he makes:
\[ 33 + 99 + 30 = 162 \]

So, the total amount of money Terry makes is:
\[ 162 \]"
"To solve this, let's break down the schedule of the trains:

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes.
2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 10 + 30 = 40 minutes after the first train arrives. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes.
3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 40 + 60 = 100 minutes after the first train arrives. The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so it stays for 0 minutes.
4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 100 + 20 = 120 minutes after the first train arrives.

Now, let's calculate how long Paul will wait for his train:

- The first train arrives in 10 minutes, and Paul will wait for it.
- The second train arrives in 40 minutes, and Paul will wait for it.
- The third train arrives in 100 minutes, and Paul will wait for it.
- The fourth train arrives in 120 minutes, and Paul will board it.

So, Paul will wait for the first train for 10 minutes, the second train for 40 minutes, and the third train for 100 minutes. The total time Paul will wait is 10 + 40 + 100 = 150 minutes.

The final numerical answer is 150 minutes."
"First, let's calculate how many toothpicks Melanie has saved so far. She saves 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks.

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie needs 200 toothpicks in total. She has already saved 120 toothpicks. So, the number of toothpicks she still needs is:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks, we divide the number of toothpicks she needs by the number of toothpicks she saves each week:

\[ 80 \text{ toothpicks} \div 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks."
"First, let's find out how much Mr. Rogers paid for the watch. The original price of the watch was $2000, and he bought it at 75% of its original price.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers paid} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

Now, we need to find out what percentage discount Mr. Rogers's friend got from the original price. The original price was $2000, and he bought it for $1800.

\[ \text{Discount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

To find the percentage discount, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage Discount} = \left( \frac{\text{Discount}}{\text{Original Price}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage Discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers's friend from the original price is 10%."
"To solve this, we need to figure out how many jellyfish one spring can make in 4 hours and then multiply that by the number of springs.

1 hour has 60 minutes, so 4 hours have \(4 \times 60 = 240\) minutes.
Since every second a new jellyfish is created, in 240 minutes, there are \(240 \times 60 = 14400\) seconds.

So, one spring can create 14400 jellyfish in 4 hours.

Since there are 5 springs working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours is \(14400 \times 5 = 72000\).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 72000."
"First, we need to find out what twice Binkie's score is. Since Binkie's score is 90, twice Binkie's score would be:

\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \]

Now, we know that Frankie's score is 15 points more than twice Binkie's score. So, we add 15 to the result we just found:

\[ 180 + 15 = 195 \]

So, Frankie's score is 195."
"First, let's break down the journey James made:

1. James walks halfway to the store. Since the store is 4 miles away, halfway would be 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles.
2. He then has to walk back home, which is another 2 miles.
3. So, the total distance he walked is 2 miles (to the store) + 2 miles (back home) = 4 miles.

James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour. To find out how long it took him to walk 4 miles, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, it took James 1 hour to reach the store."
"First, let's calculate how many bananas Jenny bought in total. She bought 10 bunches, and each bunch has 4 bananas. So, the total number of bananas is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Next, we need to find out how much it would cost if she bought the bananas individually. Since each banana costs $0.80, the total cost for 40 bananas would be:
\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost if she bought the bananas in bunches. Since each bunch costs $3.00 and she bought 10 bunches, the total cost would be:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

To find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually:
\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

So, Jenny saved $2.00."
"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Let's say Sam gets \( S \) feet of the fence.
2. Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet of the fence.
3. Together, they have 100 feet of fence.

So, the equation we can write is:
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Now, let's solve for \( S \):
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]
\[ 2S = 100 - 60 \]
\[ 2S = 40 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. To find out how much is left over for Sam, we need to subtract the amount he gets from the total:
\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, the amount left over for Sam is 80 feet."
"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to determine its growth rate per year. We know that the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. So, we can calculate the growth rate per year by dividing 8 inches by 4 years.

\[ \text{Growth rate per year} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \]

Now that we know the crocodile grows 2 inches every year, we can calculate how much it will grow in 13 years by multiplying the growth rate per year by 13 years.

\[ \text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

So, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"First, let's find out how many of each type of bike Marcel sold.

- Half of the 300 bikes sold were Trekking bikes. So, the number of Trekking bikes sold is:
  \[
  \frac{300}{2} = 150 \text{ Trekking bikes}
  \]

- 15% of the 300 bikes sold were BMX bikes. So, the number of BMX bikes sold is:
  \[
  0.15 \times 300 = 45 \text{ BMX bikes}
  \]

- The rest of the sold bikes were MTB type. So, the number of MTB bikes sold is:
  \[
  300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \text{ MTB bikes}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the total earnings from each type of bike sold.

- The price of one MTB is $500. So, the total earnings from MTB bikes are:
  \[
  105 \times 500 = 52500 \text{ dollars}
  \]

- The price of one BMX bike is half the price of an MTB, which is:
  \[
  \frac{500}{2} = 250 \text{ dollars}
  \]
  So, the total earnings from BMX bikes are:
  \[
  45 \times 250 = 11250 \text{ dollars}
  \]

- The price of one Trekking bike is $450. So, the total earnings from Trekking bikes are:
  \[
  150 \times 450 = 67500 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Finally, let's add up the earnings from all the bikes to find the total earnings for the month:
\[
52500 + 11250 + 67500 = 131250 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, Marcel earned \(\boxed{131250}\) dollars from selling bicycles during that month."
"First, let's calculate how many bales the farmer makes in a day. The farmer makes 5 bales each hour and works for 6 hours, so:
\[ 5 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ bales} \]

Next, let's calculate how many bales the truck picks up in a day. The truck picks up 3 bales each hour and works for 6 hours, so:
\[ 3 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 18 \text{ bales} \]

Now, to find out how many bales are left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer:
\[ 30 \text{ bales} - 18 \text{ bales} = 12 \text{ bales} \]

So, the number of bales of hay left in the field is:
\[ 12 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of periods John has to take each day. Normally, there are 6 periods, but John has to take 2 extra classes. So, he has:

\[ 6 + 2 = 8 \text{ periods per day} \]

Each period is 40 minutes long, so the total time John spends in class each day is:

\[ 8 \times 40 = 320 \text{ minutes per day} \]

John goes to class for 5 days a week, so the total time he spends in class each week is:

\[ 320 \times 5 = 1600 \text{ minutes per week} \]

John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. So, the extra learning time per week is:

\[ \frac{1600}{16} = 100 \text{ minutes per week} \]

Now, let's add the extra learning time to the time spent in class to find the total time John spends learning each week:

\[ 1600 + 100 = 1700 \text{ minutes per week} \]

To convert the total minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{1700}{60} = \frac{1700 \div 20}{60 \div 20} = \frac{85}{3} \approx 28.33 \text{ hours per week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 28.33 \text{ hours per week} \]"
"First, let's find out how high the ball bounces after the first bounce. The ball starts from the third-floor balcony, and each story is 24 feet high. So, the height of the third-floor balcony is:

\[ 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ feet} \]

After the first bounce, the ball bounces to 2/3 of its starting height. So, the height after the first bounce is:

\[ 72 \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we need to find out how high the ball goes on its second bounce. The ball again bounces to 2/3 of its height after the first bounce. So, the height after the second bounce is:

\[ 48 \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height the ball goes on its second bounce is 32 feet."
"First, let's convert the height of the first child from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child who is 6 feet tall is:
\[ 6 \times 12 = 72 \text{ inches} \]

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so:
\[ 72 + 2 = 74 \text{ inches} \]

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so:
\[ 74 - 5 = 69 \text{ inches} \]

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so:
\[ 69 + 3 = 72 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height of the fourth child is 72 inches."
"First, we need to find out how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we divide the total number of apples sold by the number of apples per bag:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total number of apples}}{\text{Number of apples per bag}} = \frac{2000}{10} = 200 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total earnings. The orchard sells each bag for $5, so we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of bags} \times \text{Price per bag} = 200 \times 5 = 1000 \]

So, the orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag."
"Let's break this down step by step:

1. The lazy Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms of meat. This means before the Allosaurus ate, there were 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms of meat left.

2. The Allosaurus ate half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. So, before the Allosaurus ate, there were 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms of meat left.

3. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops. So, before the T-Rex ate, there were 1080 * 2 = 2160 kilograms of meat on the triceratops.

So, the final numerical answer is 2160 kilograms."
"First, let's calculate the area of each wall:

- The north and south walls are 10 feet wide and 8 feet tall. So, the area of one of these walls is 10 * 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two of these walls, the total area for the north and south walls is 80 * 2 = 160 square feet.
- The east and west walls are 5 feet wide and 8 feet tall. So, the area of one of these walls is 5 * 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two of these walls, the total area for the east and west walls is 40 * 2 = 80 square feet.

Now, let's add up the total area of all the walls:
- Total area = area of north and south walls + area of east and west walls
- Total area = 160 square feet + 80 square feet = 240 square feet

Next, we need to find out how many gallons of paint are needed. Since one gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we divide the total area by the coverage of one gallon:
- Gallons of paint needed = total area / coverage per gallon
- Gallons of paint needed = 240 square feet / 20 square feet per gallon = 12 gallons

Finally, we calculate the cost. Since each gallon of paint costs $12, the total cost is:
- Total cost = gallons of paint needed * cost per gallon
- Total cost = 12 gallons * $12 per gallon = $144

So, the final numerical answer is $144."
"First, let's understand the situation step by step:

1. Ellen starts with 12 sodas.
2. She shakes 3 of them, so now there are 3 shaken sodas and 9 unshaken sodas.
3. Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 8 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.
4. Ellen's brother takes 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas. This leaves 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas.
5. Ellen's friend comes along and takes 1 unshaken soda. This leaves 2 shaken sodas and 5 unshaken sodas.

Now, we need to find the probability that Ellen's friend gets a soda from a shaken can. Since there are 2 shaken sodas and 5 unshaken sodas left, the total number of sodas left is 2 + 5 = 7.

The probability that Ellen's friend gets a soda from a shaken can is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left. So, the probability is:

\[ \frac{2}{7} \]

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[ \frac{2}{7} \times 100 \approx 28.57\% \]

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is approximately 28.57%."
"First, let's find out how fast each train is traveling. The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, so:

\[ \text{Speed of second train} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now, we need to find out how far each train travels in 3 hours. The distance a train travels is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For the first train:

\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \]

For the second train:

\[ \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles} \]

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each train has traveled:

\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 270 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.

March has 31 days. So, from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days.
April has 19 days.

So, the total number of days is 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days.

Billy takes 20% of the days off. So, he takes off 20/100 * 50 = 10 days.

That means he works for 50 - 10 = 40 days.

He helps 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day, so he helps 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Therefore, in 40 days, he helps 40 * 6 = 240 people.

The final numerical answer is 240."
"First, let's calculate the number of people in the buses. Each bus carried 35 people, and there were 12 buses, so:

\[ 35 \text{ people/bus} \times 12 \text{ buses} = 420 \text{ people} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of people in the cars. Each car carried 3 people, and there were 20 cars, so:

\[ 3 \text{ people/car} \times 20 \text{ cars} = 60 \text{ people} \]

Now, to find the total number of people inside the church, we add the number of people in the buses and the number of people in the cars:

\[ 420 \text{ people} + 60 \text{ people} = 480 \text{ people} \]

So, the total number of people inside the church is 480."
"First, let's find out how old Martha is. Since Mike is 24 years old and Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, we can calculate Martha's age as follows:

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20 years old

Now, we know that Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. So, we can find Jeff's age by adding 10 years to Martha's age:

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30 years old

So, the final numerical answer is 30."
"First, we need to calculate how long it takes to slide down the biggest waterslide. The length of the biggest waterslide is 300 feet, and people slide down at a speed of 60 feet per minute. To find out how long it takes, we divide the length of the slide by the speed:

\[ \text{Time for biggest slide} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate how long it takes to slide down the second biggest waterslide. The length of the second biggest slide is 240 feet, and people slide down at a speed of 80 feet per minute. To find out how long it takes, we divide the length of the slide by the speed:

\[ \text{Time for second slide} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide. We subtract the time for the second slide from the time for the biggest slide:

\[ \text{Difference in time} = 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide."
"First, let's find out how much time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks each day.

He takes a 30-minute lunch break and 2 breaks of 15 minutes each day.

So, the total time spent on breaks and lunch each day is:
30 minutes (lunch) + 15 minutes + 15 minutes = 60 minutes

Now, we need to find out how much time this adds up to after 5 days.

60 minutes/day * 5 days = 300 minutes

To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

300 minutes ÷ 60 = 5 hours

So, the total time Bobby spends on his lunches and breaks after 5 days is 5 hours."
"First, let's find out how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's miles as follows:

\[ \text{Micah's miles} = 3.5 \times 8 \]

Now, let's calculate that:

\[ \text{Micah's miles} = 28 \]

Next, we know the total miles run by all three is 52 miles. So, to find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total miles:

\[ \text{Ahito's miles} = \text{Total miles} - (\text{Amber's miles} + \text{Micah's miles}) \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ \text{Ahito's miles} = 52 - (8 + 28) \]

Now, let's calculate Ahito's miles:

\[ \text{Ahito's miles} = 52 - 36 \]
\[ \text{Ahito's miles} = 16 \]

So, Ahito ran 16 miles. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 16 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the items after the returns and purchases.

Sheila initially charged $85.00 on her credit card. She returned an item that cost $15.00. So, the new balance after the return is:
\[ 85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the frying pan after the 20% discount. The original price of the frying pan is $20.00. A 20% discount means she pays 80% of the original price:
\[ 20.00 \times 0.80 = 16.00 \]

Then, let's calculate the cost of the set of towels after the 10% discount. The original price of the set of towels is $30.00. A 10% discount means she pays 90% of the original price:
\[ 30.00 \times 0.90 = 27.00 \]

Now, let's add the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels to the new balance on her credit card:
\[ 70.00 + 16.00 + 27.00 = 113.00 \]

So, the new balance on her credit card is:
\[ 113.00 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say the total number of jellyfish in the tank is \( x \).
2. A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{x}{5} \).
3. A third of the large jellyfish change color under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{x}{5} = \frac{x}{15} \).
4. According to the problem, when the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color. So, \( \frac{x}{15} = 6 \).

Now, we need to solve for \( x \):

\[ \frac{x}{15} = 6 \]
\[ x = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ x = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

The final numerical answer is:
90"
"First, let's find out how old Ben is. Since Ben is two times older than Chris and Chris is 4 years old, we can calculate Ben's age as follows:

\[ \text{Ben's age} = 2 \times \text{Chris's age} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

Now, we know that Caroline is three times older than Ben. So, we can calculate Caroline's age as follows:

\[ \text{Caroline's age} = 3 \times \text{Ben's age} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 24."
"First, let's calculate how much Lauren saves each year. She saves 20% of her $100,000 salary each year. 

\[ \text{Annual savings} = 20\% \times \$100,000 = 0.20 \times \$100,000 = \$20,000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much Lauren will need to save for retirement. She plans to live with 40% of her current annual salary, so we calculate 40% of $100,000.

\[ \text{Annual living cost} = 40\% \times \$100,000 = 0.40 \times \$100,000 = \$40,000 \]

Since Lauren saves $20,000 each year, we need to find out how many years it will take her to save enough to cover her annual living cost of $40,000.

\[ \text{Number of years to save for living cost} = \frac{\text{Annual living cost}}{\text{Annual savings}} = \frac{\$40,000}{\$20,000} = 2 \text{ years} \]

Lauren plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years. Since she needs 2 years to save enough to cover her living cost, we can calculate the number of years she needs to work beyond the retirement period to save for her living cost.

\[ \text{Years to work beyond retirement} = 2 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, Lauren needs to work an additional 2 years beyond the 20-year retirement period to save enough for her living cost.

The final numerical answer is:
2"
"First, we need to find out how long each of the 4 equal parts of the ribbon will be. Since Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon and he wants to cut it into 4 equal parts, we divide 100 by 4.

\[ \frac{100}{4} = 25 \]

So, each of the 4 equal parts is 25 centimeters long.

Next, we need to divide each of these 25 centimeter parts into 5 equal parts. To find the length of each of these smaller parts, we divide 25 by 5.

\[ \frac{25}{5} = 5 \]

Therefore, each final cut will be 5 centimeters long."
"To find out how many girls are in the school, we first need to find out the total number of students in the school. We know that 40% of the students are boys and that number is 240 boys.

Let's denote the total number of students as \( T \).

Given that 40% of \( T \) is 240 boys, we can write this as:
\[ 0.40 \times T = 240 \]

To find \( T \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} \]

Now, let's calculate \( T \).
\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} = 600 \]

So, the total number of students in the school is 600.

Next, we need to find out how many girls are in the school. Since 40% of the students are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls.

Let's denote the number of girls as \( G \). We can write:
\[ G = 0.60 \times T \]

Substituting the value of \( T \) we found:
\[ G = 0.60 \times 600 \]

Now, let's calculate \( G \).
\[ G = 0.60 \times 600 = 360 \]

So, the number of girls in the school is 360."
"First, let's add the cost of the pots and the sack of garden soil:
- Pots cost $19
- Sack of garden soil costs $26

So, $19 + $26 = $45

- Total cost after coupon = $45 - $7 = $38

So, the final amount of money my mom spent at the gardening shop is $38."
"To find the average height of the heels, we need to add the heights of all the heels together and then divide by the total number of heels.

There are 3 heels that are 4 inches tall and 3 heels that are 2 inches tall. So, we add these together:

\(4 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 18\)

There are a total of 6 heels. So, we divide the total height by the number of heels:

\(18 \div 6 = 3\)

So, the average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches."
"First, let's find out how many miles Soledad plans to hike in a day if she walks twice a day, covering 125 miles each time.

Soledad walks twice a day, so:
\[ 125 \text{ miles/time} \times 2 \text{ times/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

Now, let's find out the total number of miles she plans to hike in June. June has 30 days, and she plans to hike 250 miles each day:
\[ 250 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 7500 \text{ miles} \]

Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in June. To find out how many more miles she needs to hike each day to reach her goal, we first find the difference between the total miles she wants to hike and the miles she plans to hike:
\[ 9300 \text{ miles} - 7500 \text{ miles} = 1800 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike to cover the remaining 1800 miles in June. Since there are 30 days in June, we divide the remaining miles by the number of days:
\[ \frac{1800 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad must hike 60 more miles per day to complete her journey on time."
"First, let's find out how many balls there are in total:
- Red balls: 3
- Blue balls: 11
- Green balls: 25

Total number of balls = 3 + 11 + 25 = 39 balls

Now, let's calculate the total cost for each color of balls:
- Cost of red balls = 3 balls * $9/ball = $27
- Cost of blue balls = 11 balls * $5/ball = $55
- Cost of green balls = 25 balls * $3/ball = $75

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the balls:
Total cost = $27 + $55 + $75 = $157

So, the store will have received $157 after all the balls are sold."
"First, let's find out how much apples each person wants.

Peter wants a quarter of 12 kg:
\[ \text{Peter's share} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg} \]

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg:
\[ \text{Paul's share} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg} \]

Now, let's add up the amounts that Peter and Paul want:
\[ \text{Total wanted by Peter and Paul} = 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg} \]

Since they bought 12 kg in total, the amount left for James is:
\[ \text{Amount left for James} = 12 \text{ kg} - 7 \text{ kg} = 5 \text{ kg} \]

So, James will have 5 kg of apples left."
"The temperature dropped by 8 degrees, so we subtract 8 from the initial temperature:
2 - 8 = -6 degrees Celsius.

Then it increased by 3 degrees in the morning, so we add 3 to the temperature after the drop:
-6 + 3 = -3 degrees Celsius.

The temperature in the morning was -3 degrees Celsius."
"First, let's add the money Raymond had initially to the money he saved from his allowance:
$21 + $11 = $32

$32 - $5 (comic book) - $19 (puzzle) = $32 - $24 = $8

So, Raymond has $8 left."
"First, let's find out how much money Anna has left after her purchases. She started with $16 and has $2 left, so she has spent:

\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \]

dollars in total.

She has already spent $4 on other things, so the amount she spent on the books is:

\[ 14 - 4 = 10 \]

dollars.

Since she bought 2 books and each book cost the same amount, we can find the cost of each book by dividing the total cost of the books by 2:

\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

So, each book cost Anna $5.

The final numerical answer is:
5"
"To find out how many students are enrolled this year, we first need to calculate the increase in enrollment, which is 20% of last year's enrollment. Last year, there were 50 students.

20% of 50 is calculated as:
\[ 20\% \times 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 0.2 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, the increase in enrollment is 10 students. To find the total enrollment this year, we add this increase to last year's enrollment:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class is 60."
"First, we need to find out how many times the light blinks in one minute. We know it blinks 255 times in 5 minutes, so we divide 255 by 5 to find the number of blinks per minute.

\[ \text{Blinks per minute} = \frac{255}{5} = 51 \]

Now, we want to know how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times. We can find this by dividing 459 by the number of blinks per minute.

\[ \text{Time in minutes} = \frac{459}{51} \]

Let's calculate this.
\[ \text{Time in minutes} = 9 \]

So, it will take 9 minutes for the light to blink 459 times. The final numerical answer is:

9"
"First, let's find out how many male and female guppies Tate has after buying more.

Initially, there are:
- 4 male guppies
- 7 female guppies

Then, Tate buys:
- 2 more male guppies
- 1 more female guppy

So, the total number of male guppies now is:
4 (initial) + 2 (bought) = 6 male guppies

And the total number of female guppies now is:
7 (initial) + 1 (bought) = 8 female guppies

Now, let's look at the goldfishes:
- Initially, there are 3 male goldfishes
- 5 female goldfishes

Then, Tate buys:
- 2 more male goldfishes
- 3 more female goldfishes

So, the total number of male goldfishes now is:
3 (initial) + 2 (bought) = 5 male goldfishes

And the total number of female goldfishes now is:
5 (initial) + 3 (bought) = 8 female goldfishes

Now, let's find out the total number of male and female fishes:
- Total male fishes = 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfishes) = 11 male fishes
- Total female fishes = 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfishes) = 16 female fishes

To find out how many more female fishes than male fishes Tate has, we subtract the total number of male fishes from the total number of female fishes:
16 (female fishes) - 11 (male fishes) = 5

So, Tate has 5 more female fishes than male fishes."
"First, let's determine how long each person took to do their chores.

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]
Megan took 6 hours to walk the dog.

Dior took over 4 hours longer than Amalia, so:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} + 5 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]
Dior took 9 hours to do the laundry.

Now, let's add up the total time they all took to do their chores:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} + 9 \text{ hours} = 19 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 19 hours."
"First, let's find out how many hours John spends driving to his parents each time he visits. Since it takes him 2 hours to drive one way, the round trip will take:

\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 2 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to find out how many miles he drives in those 4 hours. We know his speed is 70 mph. The formula to find distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

So, the distance for one round trip is:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 280 \text{ miles} \]

John visits his parents twice a month, so the total distance he drives in a month is:

\[ 280 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 560 \text{ miles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 560 \text{ miles} \]"
"If Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, in 7 days she will walk:
10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles

According to the question, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. So, if we let the distance Brian walks in 7 days be \( B \) miles, then:
\[ 2B = 70 \]
\[ B = \frac{70}{2} \]
\[ B = 35 \]

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days."
"First, let's calculate how many toys the first 4 workers can produce in an hour.

Two workers produce 6 toys an hour, so together they produce:
\[ 6 \text{ toys/hour} \times 2 = 12 \text{ toys/hour} \]

The other two workers produce 4 toys an hour, so together they produce:
\[ 4 \text{ toys/hour} \times 2 = 8 \text{ toys/hour} \]

So, all four workers together produce:
\[ 12 \text{ toys/hour} + 8 \text{ toys/hour} = 20 \text{ toys/hour} \]

Now, let's calculate how many toys they produce in a 10-hour shift:
\[ 20 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 200 \text{ toys} \]

The total order is 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, they have produced 200 toys. So, they still need:
\[ 400 \text{ toys} - 200 \text{ toys} = 200 \text{ toys} \]

But the problem states that they still need 20 toys to ship the order, which means they have actually produced:
\[ 400 \text{ toys} - 20 \text{ toys} = 380 \text{ toys} \]

So, the fifth worker must have produced:
\[ 380 \text{ toys} - 200 \text{ toys} = 180 \text{ toys} \]

Since the fifth worker works for 10 hours, the number of toys the fifth worker produces per hour is:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys/hour} \]

So, the fifth worker produces 18 toys per hour."
"First, let's find out the weight of Elijah's dogs.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah's dog that is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog would be:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's dog that is half the weight of Kory's dog would be:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add up the weights of Elijah's dogs:
\[ 15 + 30 = 45 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs:
\[ 45 + 60 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs altogether is 105 pounds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Kris gave 7 stickers to Rob. So, before giving to Rob, Kris had 7 + 9 = 16 stickers.
2. Luis gave half of his stickers to Kris. So, Luis had 16 * 2 = 32 stickers before giving to Kris.
3. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. So, Seth had 32 * 2 = 64 stickers in the beginning.

The final numerical answer is 64."
"First, we need to find out the total weight of the M&M's John has. He has 3 large bags, each weighing 10 ounces. So, the total weight is:

\[ 3 \times 10 = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many M&M's are in 30 ounces. We know that 1 ounce of M&M's has 30 M&M's. So, for 30 ounces, the total number of M&M's is:

\[ 30 \times 30 = 900 \text{ M&M's} \]

Now, John wants to put 10 M&M's in each small bag. To find out how many small bags he can make, we divide the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's per small bag:

\[ 900 \div 10 = 90 \text{ small bags} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 90 \]"
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we first need to calculate half of the earth's circumference.

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of this distance is:
\[ \frac{40,000}{2} = 20,000 \text{ kilometers} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:
\[ \frac{20,000}{400} = 50 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth."
"First, let's find out how fast the 2nd fastest car is. We know the average car can go 120 miles per hour, and the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car.

So, the speed of the 2nd fastest car is:
\[ 120 \text{ mph} \times 5 = 600 \text{ mph} \]

Now, we know the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. So, we multiply the speed of the 2nd fastest car by 1.25 to find the speed of the faster car.

The speed of the faster car is:
\[ 600 \text{ mph} \times 1.25 = 750 \text{ mph} \]

So, the faster car goes at a speed of 750 miles per hour."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how old Liam was two years ago. Since Liam is currently 16 years old, two years ago he was:
   \[
   16 - 2 = 14 \text{ years old}
   \]

2. According to the problem, two years ago Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. So, if we let Vince's age two years ago be \( V \), then:
   \[
   14 = 2V
   \]

3. To find \( V \), we divide both sides of the equation by 2:
   \[
   V = \frac{14}{2} = 7
   \]

4. Vince's age two years ago was 7, so to find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:
   \[
   7 + 2 = 9
   \]

So, Vince is now 9 years old."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs. Let's say they each painted \(x\) eggs.
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs. Let's say Sarah painted \(y\) eggs, so Camden painted \(y + 12\) eggs.
3. We know that \(y + (y + 12) = 30\). This simplifies to \(2y + 12 = 30\). Solving for \(y\), we get \(2y = 18\), so \(y = 9\). This means Sarah painted 9 eggs and Camden painted \(9 + 12 = 21\) eggs.
4. Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs and together with Camden and Sarah they painted 56 eggs, we can write the equation \(2x + 30 = 56\). Solving for \(x\), we get \(2x = 26\), so \(x = 13\). This means Arnold and Madeline each painted 13 eggs.
5. Now we know:
   - Arnold painted 13 eggs.
   - Madeline painted 13 eggs.
   - Camden painted 21 eggs.
   - Sarah painted 9 eggs.
6. To find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold, we subtract the number of eggs Arnold painted from the number of eggs Camden painted: \(21 - 13 = 8\).

So, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold. The final numerical answer is 8."
"First, let's find out how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons.

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{\text{Total number of crayons}}{\text{Crayons per group}} = \frac{200}{8} = 25 \]

So, Nik can make 25 groups of crayons.

Next, we need to find out the total weight of the crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the total weight of the crayons is:

\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = \text{Number of crayons} \times \text{Weight per crayon} = 200 \times 1 = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we need to find out the total weight of the boxes. Since each box weighs 8 ounces and there are 25 boxes, the total weight of the boxes is:

\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = \text{Number of boxes} \times \text{Weight per box} = 25 \times 8 = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes gives us the total weight in ounces:

\[ \text{Total weight} = \text{Total weight of crayons} + \text{Total weight of boxes} = 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Finally, we need to convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we divide the total weight in ounces by 16:

\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{\text{Total weight in ounces}}{16} = \frac{400}{16} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 25 pounds."
"First, let's find out how many 4-foot logs John can make from the 80-foot tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we calculate:

\[ 80\% \text{ of } 80 \text{ feet} = 0.80 \times 80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we need to find out how many 4-foot logs he can get from 64 feet:

\[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet per log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

Next, we need to find out how many planks he can get from these 16 logs. Since he cuts 5 planks from each log:

\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks per log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

Finally, if he sells each plank for $1.2, we calculate the total amount he makes:

\[ 80 \text{ planks} \times \$1.2 \text{ per plank} = \$96 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$96 \]"
"First, let's find out how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns half of what her brother earns, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Valerie's salary} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

Given that Valerie earns $5000 per month, we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[ 5000 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

To find the brother's salary, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ \text{Brother's salary} = 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

So, Valerie's brother earns $10000 per month.

Next, we need to find out how much their mother earns. The problem states that their mother earns twice their combined salary. First, we calculate their combined salary:

\[ \text{Combined salary} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} = 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Now, their mother earns twice this combined salary:

\[ \text{Mother's salary} = 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \]

Finally, to find the total amount of money they all have together, we add up their individual salaries:

\[ \text{Total amount} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} + \text{Mother's salary} = 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

So, the total amount of money they all have together is $45000."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the speed on the beach:**
   - Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes.
   - To find her speed on the beach, we divide the distance by the time: \( \text{Speed on beach} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} \).

2. **Determine the speed on the sidewalk:**
   - Grandma walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach.
   - So, her speed on the sidewalk is \( 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \).

3. **Calculate the time spent on the sidewalk:**
   - Grandma walks 1 mile on the sidewalk.
   - Using her speed on the sidewalk, the time spent is \( \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \).

4. **Calculate the total time spent walking:**
   - Time on the beach: 40 minutes
   - Time on the sidewalk: 10 minutes
   - Total time: \( 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \).

So, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is 50 minutes."
"First, let's find out how much Jane has saved so far. She has saved $4 every week for 8 weeks.

\[ \text{Total saved so far} = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Jane wants to save a total of $60. So, we need to find out how much more she needs to save:

\[ \text{Amount still needed} = 60 - 32 = 28 \]

Jane saves $4 every week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28, we divide the amount still needed by the amount she saves each week:

\[ \text{Number of weeks needed} = \frac{28}{4} = 7 \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60."
"First, let's calculate the total number of blue birds in the trees with 7 blue birds each. There are 3 such trees, so:

\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of blue birds in the trees with 4 blue birds each. There are 2 such trees, so:

\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

Finally, there is 1 tree with 3 blue birds.

Now, let's add all these numbers together to find the total number of blue birds:

\[ 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 \]

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"First, let's find out how many marbles Bob has initially. If he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12 marbles, 2 dozen equals 24 marbles. So, if he gets 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. This means he initially has:

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob initially has 36 marbles. If he loses 10 of the marbles he has, the number of marbles he will have is:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 26."
"First, let's understand the problem. Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees. He has two mugs of water. One mug is 33 degrees. The other mug is an unknown temperature, let's call it T degrees. Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle and 1 ounce from the other mug into his water bottle. After this, he is able to drink the water, which means the temperature of the water in his water bottle is at least 40 degrees.

Let's calculate the temperature of the water in his water bottle after the transfer. Initially, he has 4 ounces of 33-degree water and 1 ounce of T-degree water. After pouring, he has 3 ounces of 33-degree water and 1 ounce of T-degree water.

The temperature of the water in his water bottle after the transfer can be calculated using the weighted average of the temperatures of the water from both mugs. The formula for the weighted average temperature is:

\[ \text{Average Temperature} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{4 + 1} \]

This average temperature must be at least 40 degrees. So we set up the inequality:

\[ \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40 \]

Now, let's solve this inequality step by step.

First, calculate \(4 \times 33\):

\[ 4 \times 33 = 132 \]

So the inequality becomes:

\[ \frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40 \]

Next, multiply both sides of the inequality by 5 to clear the denominator:

\[ 132 + T \geq 200 \]

Now, subtract 132 from both sides to solve for T:

\[ T \geq 200 - 132 \]
\[ T \geq 68 \]

So, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{68} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of days in three weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so three weeks would be:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ days} \]

Now, let's calculate how many cows Melanie's father gets from Milkie Cows Limited in 21 days. Since he gets 20 cows per day, in 21 days he will get:
\[ 20 \times 21 = 420 \text{ cows} \]

Next, let's calculate how many chickens he gets from Broilers Limited in 21 days. Since he gets 10 chickens per day, in 21 days he will get:
\[ 10 \times 21 = 210 \text{ chickens} \]

Now, let's add the initial number of animals to the new animals brought in over the 21 days. Initially, there were 50 cows and 20 chickens. After 21 days, the total number of cows will be:
\[ 50 + 420 = 470 \text{ cows} \]

And the total number of chickens will be:
\[ 20 + 210 = 230 \text{ chickens} \]

To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we add the total number of cows and chickens:
\[ 470 + 230 = 700 \]

So, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is:
\[ 700 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount. Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs will cost:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Since he gets a 10% discount for ordering 4 packs, we need to calculate the discount amount:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell gets in 4 packs. Since each pack has 9 bagels, 4 packs will have:
\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

To find the cost per bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{36 \text{ bagels}} = 1 \text{ dollar per bagel} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 1 \]"
"First, let's find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. The question states that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops. So we calculate:

\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are needed to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. The number of scoops is 1 less than 3, which is:

\[ 3 - 1 = 2 \]

The question also states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. So we calculate:

\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \]

So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we can set up a proportion. Since 2 scoops require 3 potatoes, 18 scoops would require:

\[ \frac{18}{2} \times 3 = 9 \times 3 = 27 \]

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes."
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days.

Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the next 30 days.

Chester then eats 5 eggs a day for 30 days:
\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, let's add the total number of eggs from both periods to find the total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days:
\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

To find out how many dozens of eggs this is, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs):
\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozen} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"
"First, let's find out how many red jelly beans there are. Since there are twice as many red jelly beans as green jelly beans, and there are 17 green jelly beans, we can calculate the number of red jelly beans as follows:

Number of red jelly beans = 2 * Number of green jelly beans
Number of red jelly beans = 2 * 17
Number of red jelly beans = 34

Now, we know the total number of jelly beans is 60. We can find the number of blue jelly beans by subtracting the number of green and red jelly beans from the total number of jelly beans.

Number of blue jelly beans = Total number of jelly beans - (Number of green jelly beans + Number of red jelly beans)
Number of blue jelly beans = 60 - (17 + 34)
Number of blue jelly beans = 60 - 51
Number of blue jelly beans = 9

So, there are 9 blue jelly beans in the jar."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the total number of lemons Tim collects over a decade (10 years).

- Each tree gives 6 lemons per year.

Now, let's find out how many lemons he gets from all 5 trees in one year:
- 5 trees * 6 lemons/tree = 30 lemons per year.

Next, we need to find out how many lemons he gets in a decade (10 years):
- 30 lemons/year * 10 years = 300 lemons.

So, the final numerical answer is:
300"
"First, let's find out how many men and women are on the bus initially.

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, which means for every 5 men, there are 9 women. The total parts of the ratio are 5 + 9 = 14 parts.

If the total number of passengers is 84, we can divide this number by the total parts of the ratio to find out how many passengers each part represents:
\[ \text{Passengers per part} = \frac{84}{14} = 6 \]

Now, we can find out how many men and women are on the bus initially:
- Number of men = 5 parts * 6 passengers per part = 30 men
- Number of women = 9 parts * 6 passengers per part = 54 women

So, initially, there are 30 men and 54 women on the bus. If 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:
\[ 54 - 20 = 34 \]

Therefore, the number of women remaining on the bus is 34."
"First, let's find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold in one day. Since each sunflower costs $2, and he earned $26 from the sunflowers, we can calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day by dividing the total earnings by the price of one sunflower.

\[ \text{Number of sunflowers sold per day} = \frac{\text{Total earnings from sunflowers per day}}{\text{Price of one sunflower}} \]

\[ \text{Number of sunflowers sold per day} = \frac{26}{2} = 13 \]

So, Faraday sold 13 sunflowers each day.

Next, we need to find out how many sunflowers he sold in 3 days.

\[ \text{Number of sunflowers sold in 3 days} = \text{Number of sunflowers sold per day} \times 3 \]

\[ \text{Number of sunflowers sold in 3 days} = 13 \times 3 = 39 \]

So, after 3 days, Faraday was able to sell 39 sunflowers."
"First, let's find out how many rocks Adam can buy with his $100. Each rock costs $5.

\[ \text{Number of rocks} = \frac{\text{Total money}}{\text{Cost per rock}} = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Adam can buy 20 rocks. Now, he sells 60% of his inventory.

\[ \text{Number of rocks sold} = 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \]

He sells each rock for $7, so the total money he gets from selling 12 rocks is:

\[ \text{Total money from selling} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \]

Adam initially had $100, and he got $84 from selling the rocks. So, the money he loses is:

\[ \text{Money lost} = 100 - 84 = 16 \]

So, Adam loses $16."
"To solve this, we need to calculate how many days it will take Lauren to draw all the scenes based on her daily drawing rates.

For the large-sized scenes:
Lauren can draw 5 large-sized scenes per day.
She needs to draw 45 large-sized scenes.
So, the number of days needed for large-sized scenes is \( \frac{45}{5} = 9 \) days.

For the medium-sized scenes:
Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized scenes per day.
She needs to draw 36 medium-sized scenes.
So, the number of days needed for medium-sized scenes is \( \frac{36}{6} = 6 \) days.

For the small-sized scenes:
Lauren can draw 7 small-sized scenes per day.
She needs to draw 49 small-sized scenes.
So, the number of days needed for small-sized scenes is \( \frac{49}{7} = 7 \) days.

Now, we add up the days for all the scenes:
9 days (large-sized) + 6 days (medium-sized) + 7 days (small-sized) = 22 days.

So, it will take Lauren 22 days to create all of the picture scenes."
"Chatty has prepared 3 dozen eggs. Since one dozen equals 12, three dozen eggs equal 3 * 12 = 36 eggs. She has four children, and she wants to divide the eggs equally among them. So, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of children: 36 eggs ÷ 4 children = 9 eggs per child.

The final numerical answer is 9."

"Patricia originally had 30 roses. She gave 24 roses to her mother, so she had:
30 - 24 = 6 roses left.

Then she bought 15 more roses, so now she has:
6 + 15 = 21 roses.

The final numerical answer is 21."
"To find the average speed, we need to use the formula:

\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

First, let's calculate the total distance Sid traveled. He traveled 110 miles and then an additional 140 miles. So, the total distance is:

\[ 110 \text{ miles} + 140 \text{ miles} = 250 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the total time Sid spent traveling. He spent 2 hours and then an additional 3 hours. So, the total time is:

\[ 2 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can find the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:

\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{250 \text{ miles}}{5 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the average speed Sid was traveling is:

\[ 50 \text{ miles per hour} \]"
"First, let's understand the probabilities of each ticket winning.

For the first ticket, the probability of winning is 20%, which can be written as a decimal: 0.20.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. So, we need to find out what three times 20% is:
\[ 3 \times 20\% = 60\% \]
This means the probability of the second ticket winning is 60%, or 0.60 in decimal form.

Now, to find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning:
\[ 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we convert 0.12 back to a percentage by multiplying by 100:
\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"First, let's find out how many seashells each person collected.

We know that Jim collected 27 seashells. According to the problem, Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos. So, we can find out how many seashells Carlos collected by subtracting 5 from the number of seashells Jim collected:

\[ \text{Carlos's seashells} = 27 - 5 = 22 \]

Next, we know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. So, we can find out how many seashells Carrey collected by dividing the number of seashells Carlos collected by 2:

\[ \text{Carrey's seashells} = \frac{22}{2} = 11 \]

Now, let's find the total number of seashells collected by adding the seashells collected by Carlos, Jim, and Carrey:

\[ \text{Total seashells} = 27 + 22 + 11 = 59 \]

They divided the seashells equally among themselves. Since there are 3 people, we divide the total number of seashells by 3:

\[ \text{Seashells per person} = \frac{59}{3} = 19 \frac{2}{3} \]

So, each person got \( 19 \frac{2}{3} \) seashells. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 19 \frac{2}{3} \]"
"To find out how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the total for weekdays and the total for weekends separately, and then add them together.

For weekdays (Monday to Friday), he eats 4 carrots each day. There are 5 weekdays in a week.
So, the total for weekdays is \(4 \text{ carrots/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ carrots}\).

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. There are 2 days in the weekend.
So, the total for the weekend is \(5 \text{ carrots/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ carrots}\).

Now, we add the total for weekdays and the total for the weekend to get the total number of carrots he eats in a week.
So, the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week is \(20 \text{ carrots} + 10 \text{ carrots} = 30 \text{ carrots}\).

The final numerical answer is 30."
"First, we need to find out the length of the second song. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. The first song is 5 minutes long.

To find 60% of 5 minutes, we calculate:
\[ 60\% \times 5 = 0.60 \times 5 = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the second song is:
\[ 5 \text{ minutes} + 3 \text{ minutes} = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the lengths of both songs to find the total time of the cassette:
\[ 5 \text{ minutes} + 8 \text{ minutes} = 13 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time of the cassette is 13 minutes."
"First, let's find out how much Linus sold each mobile device for. He sold it for twice the original price, which was $20. So, the selling price is:

\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to calculate the profit from selling one mobile device. The profit is the selling price minus the buying price:

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's find out how many mobile devices Linus bought in total. He bought 2 devices last Monday and 4 devices last Tuesday, so the total number of devices is:

\[ 2 + 4 = 6 \text{ devices} \]

Since each device gives a profit of $20, the total profit from selling all 6 devices is:

\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 120 \]"
"First, let's find out how tall Ned is. Since Isabel is 7 feet tall and Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel, we can calculate Ned's height as follows:

Ned's height = Isabel's height - 2 feet
Ned's height = 7 feet - 2 feet
Ned's height = 5 feet

Now, we know that Carl is one foot taller than Ned. So, we can find Carl's height:

Carl's height = Ned's height + 1 foot
Carl's height = 5 feet + 1 foot
Carl's height = 6 feet

The cane is half as long as Carl is tall. So, we can find the length of Carl's cane:

Length of Carl's cane = Carl's height / 2
Length of Carl's cane = 6 feet / 2
Length of Carl's cane = 3 feet

So, the final numerical answer is 3 feet."
"First, let's find out how many bottles of juice are needed to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

Each person needs 20% of their daily energy demand covered by a bottle of juice. So, for 100% of the daily energy demand, we need 5 bottles per person (since 100% / 20% = 5).

Now, we calculate the total number of bottles needed for 2300 people:

\[ 2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles} \]

The Hortex company currently produces 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles they need to produce, we subtract the current production from the total needed:

\[ 11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles} \]

So, Hortex would have to produce 7300 more bottles of juices to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people."
"First, let's find out how many babies are dressed in purple and how many are dressed in blue.

Carla has 8 babies in total. She dresses 3/4 of them in purple:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \text{ babies in purple} \]

The remaining 1/4 are dressed in blue:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \text{ babies in blue} \]

Next, we need to find out how many of the babies wear bows. All the babies dressed in blue wear bows, so that's 2 babies. Also, 1/3 of the babies dressed in purple wear bows:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ babies in purple wearing bows} \]

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is:
\[ 2 \text{ (blue wearers)} + 2 \text{ (purple wearers wearing bows)} = 4 \text{ babies wearing bows} \]

Now, we need to find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. We know that 2 out of the 4 babies wearing bows are dressed in purple. So, the percentage is:
\[ \frac{2}{4} \times 100 = 50\% \]

The final numerical answer is:
50%"
"To find out how many reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and on Thursday and Friday, from the total number of reports received last week.

First, let's add the reports received on Monday and Tuesday:
1907 reports

Next, let's add the reports received on Thursday and Friday:
2136 reports

Now, let's add these two numbers together:
1907 + 2136 = 4043 reports

The total number of reports received last week was 5168. So, to find out how many reports were received on Wednesday, we subtract the total reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from the total reports received last week:
5168 - 4043 = 1125 reports

So, the number of reports received on Wednesday is 1125."
"First, let's find out how much land Abraham sold in the first two transactions.

He started with 80 square meters of land.

He sold half of it, which is:
\[ \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ square meters} \]

He sold this land for $50.

After a month, he sold another 1/4 of his land. The remaining land after the first sale is:
\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \text{ square meters} \]

1/4 of 40 square meters is:
\[ \frac{40}{4} = 10 \text{ square meters} \]

He sold this 10 square meters for $30.

Now, let's calculate the total money he earned from the first two transactions:
\[ 50 + 30 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much land he has left to sell. He started with 80 square meters and sold 40 + 10 = 50 square meters. So, the remaining land is:
\[ 80 - 50 = 30 \text{ square meters} \]

He sold this remaining land for $3 per square meter:
\[ 30 \times 3 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add up all the money he earned from selling the land:
\[ 50 + 30 + 90 = 170 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total money Abraham will be able to earn after selling all his unused land is:
\[ \boxed{170} \]"
"First, we need to find half the age of Haley. Since Haley is 26 years old, half of that would be:

\[ \frac{26}{2} = 13 \]

Now, Geb is 10 less than this half age. So we subtract 10 from 13:

\[ 13 - 10 = 3 \]

Therefore, Geb is 3 years old."
"Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out. If he goes out three times a day, then in one day he uses:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ face masks} \]

To find out how many face masks he uses every 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks he uses in one day by 2:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ face masks} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 12."
"First, let's find out how many eggs Cole hid. Since a dozen is 12, 3 dozen eggs would be:
3 dozen * 12 eggs/dozen = 36 eggs

Now let's find out how many eggs each person found:
- Lamar found 5 eggs.
- Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy found 5 * 2 = 10 eggs.
- Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie found 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
- Mei found half as many as Charlie, so Mei found 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now let's add up all the eggs that were found:
5 (Lamar) + 10 (Stacy) + 8 (Charlie) + 4 (Mei) = 27 eggs

Finally, to find out how many eggs are still hidden, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden:
36 (total hidden) - 27 (total found) = 9 eggs

So, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is 9."
"First, let's find out how many apartments are in the third apartment complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so together they have:

200 apartments + 200 apartments = 400 apartments

The third complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined. To find out how many apartments that is, we calculate 60% of 400 and add it to 400:

60% of 400 = 0.60 * 400 = 240 apartments

So, the third complex has:

400 apartments + 240 apartments = 640 apartments

Now, let's find out how many apartments John collects garbage from in one week. He collects garbage from 3 complexes, and each complex has 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 apartments. Since he collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, he collects garbage from:

1040 apartments * 3 times/week = 3120 apartments/week

John gets paid $0.40 per collection for each apartment. So, his weekly earnings are:

3120 apartments * $0.40 per apartment = $1248

So, the final numerical answer is $1248."
"Let's break down the information given and calculate the number of fruits produced by the avocado tree each year.

1. **5-year-old tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount, which is \(50 \times 3 = 150\) fruits.
3. **7-year-old tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount, which is \(50 \times 7 = 350\) fruits.
4. **8-year-old tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is \(50 \times 20 = 1000\) fruits. So, the 8-year-old tree produces \(1000 - 200 = 800\) fruits.
5. **9-year-old tree**: Produces 0 fruits.
6. **10-year-old tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount, which is \(50 \times 20 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, let's add up all the fruits produced over the 10 years:

- 5-year-old: 50 fruits
- 6-year-old: 150 fruits
- 7-year-old: 350 fruits
- 8-year-old: 800 fruits
- 9-year-old: 0 fruits
- 10-year-old: 1000 fruits

Total fruits = \(50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350\)

So, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is 2350."
"First, we need to find out how much money Sophia gave to Jack. Since Sophia gave Jack 1/5 of her $100, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 100 = 20 \]

So, Sophia gave Jack $20. Now, we add this amount to the $100 Jack originally had:

\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \]

Therefore, the final amount of money Jack has now is $120."
"Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters. According to the problem, the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the blue rope can be expressed as \( Y - 7 \) centimeters.

The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope can be expressed as \( 4 \times (Y - 7) \) centimeters.

The total length of the three ropes is given as 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ Y + (Y - 7) + 4 \times (Y - 7) = 37 \]

First, simplify the equation:

\[ Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]

Add 35 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 6Y = 72 \]

Divide both sides by 6:

\[ Y = 12 \]

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope is 12 centimeters, we can find the length of the blue rope:

\[ Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \]

And the length of the red rope:

\[ 4 \times (Y - 7) = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

The final numerical answer is:
20"
"First, let's find out how much money Rissa and Ronnie were given initially.

Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie. If Ronnie was given $5, then Rissa was given:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's denote the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister as \( x \). After giving \( x \) dollars each, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original amount. So, we can write the equation for Rissa's remaining money as:
\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Let's solve for \( x \):
\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]
\[ 15 - x = \frac{4 \times 15}{5} \]
\[ 15 - x = \frac{60}{5} \]
\[ 15 - x = 12 \]
\[ x = 15 - 12 \]
\[ x = 3 \]

So, each of them gave $3 to their little sister. Now, let's find out how much money Ronnie has left. Initially, Ronnie had $5, and he gave $3 to his little sister. So, the amount left with Ronnie is:
\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

Therefore, the final amount of money left in Ronnie's money is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know that the mural is made up of four different colors: red, white, purple, and yellow.
2. The red, white, and purple paint are in equal amounts. Let's say each of these colors uses \(x\) pints of paint.
3. The yellow paint makes up half of the mural, so it uses \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) pints of paint.
4. The total amount of paint used is 12 pints. So, the sum of the paint used for red, white, purple, and yellow should equal 12 pints.

Now, let's write the equation for the total paint used:
\[ x + x + x + 6 = 12 \]
\[ 3x + 6 = 12 \]

Next, we solve for \(x\):
\[ 3x = 12 - 6 \]
\[ 3x = 6 \]
\[ x = 2 \]

So, each of the red, white, and purple paint uses 2 pints. Since there are three colors (red, white, and purple) that use 2 pints each, the total amount of red paint used is:
\[ 2 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, the number of pints of red paint used is 2."
"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. The area of a rectangle is found by multiplying its length by its width. So, for one bedroom:

\[ \text{Area of one bedroom} = 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

\[ \text{Total area of bedrooms} = 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so:

\[ \text{Area of the living room} = 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

Now, we know the rest of the house is 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

\[ \text{Total area of the house} = 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

So, the total area of the house is 3160 square feet."
"To solve this, let's count the puffs of clouds Alice sees each day and then add them up.

- Monday: 3 puffs
- Tuesday: Double of Monday, so 3 * 2 = 6 puffs
- Wednesday: Double of Tuesday, so 6 * 2 = 12 puffs
- Thursday: Double of Wednesday, so 12 * 2 = 24 puffs
- Friday: Double of Thursday, so 24 * 2 = 48 puffs

Now, let's add them all up:
3 (Monday) + 6 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 24 (Thursday) + 48 (Friday) = 93 puffs

So, at the end of the week, Alice will have counted 93 puffs of clouds in the sky at lunch across all five days."
"First, let's find out how many pods are in the special size box. The special box has 20% more pods than the regular box. So, we need to calculate 20% of 100 pods and add that to 100 pods.

20% of 100 is calculated as:
\[ 100 \times \frac{20}{100} = 20 \]

So, the special size box has:
\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The special size box costs the same as the regular box, which is $12. We need to find out how many cycles we can run with $1 if we use 1 pod per cycle. To do this, we divide $1 by the cost per pod.

The cost per pod is:
\[ \frac{12}{100} = 0.12 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

So, with $1, we can run:
\[ \frac{1}{0.12} = \frac{100}{12} = \frac{25}{3} \approx 8.33 \]

Since we can only run full cycles, we can run 8 cycles with $1 if we use 1 pod per cycle.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"First, let's find out how many 20 dollar bills Thomas initially has. Since he withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills, we divide $1000 by $20:

\[ \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \]

So, Thomas has 50 twenty dollar bills.

Next, he loses 10 bills while getting home. So, the number of bills he has left is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Thomas then uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, he uses 20 bills, leaving him with:

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \]

Now, Thomas triples his money. Since each 20 dollar bill is worth $20, tripling the money means he has:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

Thomas then converts all his money to 5 dollar bills. Since each 20 dollar bill is worth 4 five dollar bills (because $20 = 4 \times 5$), 60 twenty dollar bills are worth:

\[ 60 \times 4 = 240 \]

So, Thomas has 240 five dollar bills. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 240 \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. In the first half, team A scores 4 goals.
2. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A in the first half, so team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals in the first half.
3. In the second half, team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half.
4. Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so team B scores \(2 \times 4 = 8\) goals in the second half.
5. Therefore, team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals in the second half.

Now, let's calculate the total goals scored by each team:

- Team A scores \(4 + 2 = 6\) goals in the match.
- Team B scores \(2 + 8 = 10\) goals in the match.

To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we add the goals scored by both teams:

\[6 + 10 = 16\]

So, the total number of goals scored in the match is 16."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Chalk Length**: The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk.

2. **Chalk Used on Monday**: The teacher used 45% of the chalk by the end of Monday. So, we calculate 45% of 5 inches:
   \[
   0.45 \times 5 = 2.25 \text{ inches}
   \]
   This means the teacher used 2.25 inches of chalk on Monday.

3. **Chalk Remaining After Monday**: Subtract the chalk used from the initial length:
   \[
   5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \text{ inches}
   \]
   So, after Monday, the teacher has 2.75 inches of chalk left.

4. **Chalk Usage Rate**: The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day. So, we need to find out how many days it will take for the teacher to use up the remaining 2.75 inches of chalk at a rate of 20% per day.

5. **Daily Usage Calculation**: Each day, the teacher uses 20% of the chalk, which means he is left with 80% of the chalk. We can set up the equation to find out how many days it will take to use up the remaining chalk:
   \[
   \text{Remaining chalk} = \text{Initial chalk} \times (0.8)^n
   \]
   Where \( n \) is the number of days. We know the remaining chalk is 2.75 inches, and the initial chalk is 5 inches. So we set up the equation:
   \[
   2.75 = 5 \times (0.8)^n
   \]
   To solve for \( n \), we divide both sides by 5:
   \[
   0.55 = (0.8)^n
   \]
   To solve for \( n \), we take the logarithm of both sides:
   \[
   \log(0.55) = \log((0.8)^n)
   \]
   Using the property of logarithms, \(\log(a^b) = b \log(a)\), we get:
   \[
   \log(0.55) = n \log(0.8)
   \]
   Solving for \( n \):
   \[
   n = \frac{\log(0.55)}{\log(0.8)}
   \]
   Using a calculator to find the values of the logarithms:
   \[
   \log(0.55) \approx -0.26826 \quad \text{and} \quad \log(0.8) \approx -0.09691
   \]
   So,
   \[
   n \approx \frac{-0.26826}{-0.09691} \approx 2.77
   \]
   Since the teacher can't use a fraction of a day, we round up to the next whole number. Therefore, it will take 3 days for the teacher to use up the remaining 2.75 inches of chalk.

So, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]"
"First, let's find out how many girls are on varsity. Since one-third of the girls are on varsity, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \]
So, 4 girls are on varsity.

Next, let's find out how many boys are on varsity. Since one-fourth of the boys are on varsity, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \]
So, 3 boys are on varsity.

Now, let's find out how many girls are not on varsity. Since there are 12 girls in total and 4 are on varsity, the number of girls not on varsity is:
\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \]

Similarly, let's find out how many boys are not on varsity. Since there are 12 boys in total and 3 are on varsity, the number of boys not on varsity is:
\[ 12 - 3 = 9 \]

To find the total number of students not on varsity, we add the number of girls not on varsity to the number of boys not on varsity:
\[ 8 + 9 = 17 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 17 \]"
"First, let's find out how many face masks Mike bought. Mike bought 5 face masks.

Now, we need to calculate how many face masks Johnny bought. The problem states that Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike. 

To find out how many masks Johnny bought, we can use the following calculation:
- Thrice as many as Mike means we multiply the number of masks Mike bought by 3.
- Then we add 2 to that number to get the total number of masks Johnny bought.

Let's do the math:
- Thrice as many as Mike: \(3 \times 5 = 15\)
- Adding 2 more: \(15 + 2 = 17\)

So, Johnny bought 17 face masks.

The final numerical answer is 17."
"First, let's find out how many teeth the dentist caps. The problem states that the dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills. Since he drills 4 teeth, we can calculate the number of teeth capped as follows:

Number of teeth capped = Number of teeth drilled + 7
Number of teeth capped = 4 + 7
Number of teeth capped = 11

Now, we know the dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 11 teeth. To find the total number of teeth fixed, we add the number of teeth drilled and the number of teeth capped:

Total number of teeth fixed = Number of teeth drilled + Number of teeth capped
Total number of teeth fixed = 4 + 11
Total number of teeth fixed = 15

To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we use the formula for percentage:

Percentage of teeth fixed = (Total number of teeth fixed / Total number of teeth) * 100
Percentage of teeth fixed = (15 / 30) * 100
Percentage of teeth fixed = 0.5 * 100
Percentage of teeth fixed = 50%

So, the final numerical answer is 50%."
"First, let's find out how much milk Mr. Marcellus originally bought. He bought 4000 gallons at $3.5 per gallon.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 4000 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5/\text{gallon} \]

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$14000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much milk had passed the expiry date. Mr. Marcellus returned 2/5 of the milk.

\[ \text{Milk returned} = 4000 \text{ gallons} \times \frac{2}{5} \]

\[ \text{Milk returned} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we calculate the refund amount. The refund is based on the cost of the milk returned.

\[ \text{Refund amount} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5/\text{gallon} \]

\[ \text{Refund amount} = \$5600 \]

So, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of $5600."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say Colin's current age is \( C \).
2. Wendy's age in seven years will be five times Colin's age in seven years. So, if Colin's age in seven years is \( C + 7 \), then Wendy's age in seven years will be \( 5(C + 7) \).
3. Wendy's current age is \( 5(C + 7) - 7 \).
4. In 25 years, Colin's age will be \( C + 25 \).
5. According to the problem, in 25 years, Colin's age will be a third of Wendy's current age. So, \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \times (5(C + 7) - 7) \).

Now, let's solve the equation:

\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \times (5C + 35 - 7) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \times (5C + 28) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5C + 28}{3} \]
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 28 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 28 \]
\[ 75 - 28 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 47 = 2C \]
\[ C = \frac{47}{2} \]
\[ C = 23.5 \]

So, Colin is currently 23.5 years old. Let's confirm this by checking the conditions of the problem with this age.

If Colin is 23.5 years old now:
- In seven years, Colin will be \( 23.5 + 7 = 30.5 \) years old.
- Wendy's age in seven years will be \( 5 \times 30.5 = 152.5 \) years.
- Wendy's current age will be \( 152.5 - 7 = 145.5 \) years.
- In 25 years, Colin will be \( 23.5 + 25 = 48.5 \) years old.
- Wendy's current age is 145.5 years, and 48.5 is indeed a third of 145.5.

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{23.5} \]"
"First, let's find out how many books Bob can buy with $27000. If he can buy 100 books for $500, then the cost per book is:

\[ \text{Cost per book} = \frac{\$500}{100 \text{ books}} = \$5 \text{ per book} \]

Now, with $27000, the number of books he can buy is:

\[ \text{Number of books} = \frac{\$27000}{\$5 \text{ per book}} = 5400 \text{ books} \]

Since he has to distribute this amount among 3 schools, the number of books he can buy per school is:

\[ \text{Books per school} = \frac{5400 \text{ books}}{3 \text{ schools}} = 1800 \text{ books per school} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1800 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Newton initially got 2 apples from the tree.
2. He picked up one apple and threw the other into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall. So, he now has 1 apple (the one he picked up) + 5 apples (the new ones that fell) = 6 apples.
3. He picked up these 6 apples, put all but one in his pocket, and threw the remaining one at the tree. This caused 6 more apples to fall. So, he now has 1 apple (the one he threw) + 6 apples (the new ones that fell) = 7 apples.
4. He picked up all 7 apples and went home to make a pie.

So, Newton brought home 7 apples."
"First, we need to find out how many bags of coal Ali ordered. Since each bag weighs 50 kg and he ordered 850 kg, we divide the total weight by the weight of one bag:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{850 \text{ kg}}{50 \text{ kg/bag}} = 17 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total cost. Each bag costs $18, so we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 17 \text{ bags} \times 18 \text{ dollars/bag} = 306 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 306 \]"
"First, let's find out how many cheese pizza slices Kate's friends eat in total. Since each of her 6 friends eats 6 slices, we multiply 6 by 6:

\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

So, Kate's friends eat 36 cheese pizza slices in total.

Next, let's find out how many pepperoni pizza slices they eat in total. Since each of her 6 friends eats 4 slices, we multiply 6 by 4:

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

So, Kate's friends eat 24 pepperoni pizza slices in total.

Now, we need to find out how many whole cheese pizzas Kate needs to buy. Since each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, we divide the total number of cheese slices by 12:

\[ \frac{36}{12} = 3 \]

So, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas.

Next, we need to find out how many whole pepperoni pizzas Kate needs to buy. Since each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we divide the total number of pepperoni slices by 8:

\[ \frac{24}{8} = 3 \]

So, Kate needs to buy 3 pepperoni pizzas.

Therefore, the total number of pizzas Kate needs to buy is the sum of the cheese pizzas and the pepperoni pizzas:

\[ 3 + 3 = 6 \]

So, Kate needs to buy 6 pizzas in total."
"To find out how many miles Sam ran this week, we need to add up all the miles he ran each day.

From the information given:
- Sam ran 3 miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. That's 3 miles * 3 days = 9 miles.
- Sam ran 5 miles on Tuesday and Thursday. That's 5 miles * 2 days = 10 miles.

Now, we add the miles from Monday, Wednesday, and Friday to the miles from Tuesday and Thursday:
9 miles + 10 miles = 19 miles

So, the total number of miles Sam ran this week is 19 miles."
"First, let's figure out how many snowballs Jay can make in an hour before any melt. He can make 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 melt every 15 minutes. So, in 15 minutes, 2 snowballs melt. This means that in 15 minutes, he actually makes 20 - 2 = 18 snowballs.

Now, let's find out how many 15-minute intervals are in an hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 / 15 = 4 intervals in an hour.

In one hour, he makes 18 snowballs. So, in 4 intervals, he makes 18 * 4 = 72 snowballs.

Jay needs 60 snowballs, and he makes 72 snowballs in an hour. So, he will have 60 snowballs in just one hour because he makes more than enough before the snowballs start melting.

The final numerical answer is 1 hour."
"If John is 28 years old now and he is twice as old as Jim when the Digimon came out, we can find Jim's age by dividing John's age by 2.

So, Jim's age is 28 / 2 = 14 years old."
"Doxa ate 1 slice.
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

To find out how many slices they all ate together, we add up the slices each of them ate:
1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

So, the final numerical answer is 6."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, at the end of the first day, they had:
   38 (used) + 50 (ordered) = 88 bandages.

2. On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used:
   38 - 10 = 28 bandages.
   At the end of the second day, they had:
   88 (from the first day) - 28 (used) = 60 bandages.

3. On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered:
   2 * 50 = 100 bandages.
   They used half a pack, which is:
   50 / 2 = 25 bandages.
   At the end of the third day, they had:
   60 (from the end of the second day) + 100 (ordered) - 25 (used) = 135 bandages.

However, the problem states that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means there was a discrepancy in the calculation. Let's correct it:

At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages, so the calculation should be:
   60 (from the end of the second day) + 100 (ordered) - 25 (used) = 135 - 78 = 57 bandages.

So, they started with 57 bandages on the first day."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the haircut. May's hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches, so she had 2 inches cut off. The cost for the haircut is $30 per inch, so for 2 inches, it would be:

\[ 2 \text{ inches} \times \$30 \text{ per inch} = \$60 \]

Now, we add the cost of the color, which is $40. So the total cost is:

\[ \$60 \text{ (haircut)} + \$40 \text{ (color)} = \$100 \]

The final numerical answer is:
100"
"First, let's calculate how many hours Jen works in a week:
Jen works 7.5 hours a day and she works 6 days a week.
So, the total hours she works in a week is:
7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week = 45 hours/week

Now, let's calculate how many hours she works in April:
Since there are 4 weeks in April and she works 45 hours each week, the total hours she works in April is:
45 hours/week * 4 weeks = 180 hours

Next, let's calculate her earnings from her hourly rate:
Her hourly rate is $1.5, so her earnings from working 180 hours is:
180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270

Since she did not incur any absences for April, she also receives the additional $10 for complete attendance.
So, her total earnings for April will be:
$270 + $10 = $280

The final numerical answer is:
280"
"First, let's calculate how much Jason earned for each task:

- For doing laundry: $3.00
- For cleaning his room: $1.50
- For taking the trash out: $0.75 per trip, and he did it twice, so 2 * $0.75 = $1.50
- For emptying the dishwasher: $0.50 per time, and he did it 6 times, so 6 * $0.50 = $3.00

Now, let's add up all the earnings:

$3.00 (laundry) + $1.50 (cleaning room) + $1.50 (taking trash) + $3.00 (emptying dishwasher) = $9.00

So, Jason earned $9.00 in a two week period."
"First, let's find out how much blood one shark has. Since a whale has 40 gallons of blood and a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, we can calculate the blood volume of one shark as follows:

\[ \text{Blood volume of one shark} = 3 \times 40 \text{ gallons} = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have together. We can do this by multiplying the blood volume of one shark by ten:

\[ \text{Total blood volume of ten sharks} = 120 \text{ gallons/shark} \times 10 \text{ sharks} = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is 1200 gallons."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant.
3. After that, twice the number of people who came in at 10:00 came in. So, \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people came in.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. So, \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people came in.

Now, let's add up all the people who entered the restaurant:

- Morning people: 50
- People at 10:00: 40
- People after 10:00: 80
- Evening people: 150

Total number of people = 50 + 40 + 80 + 150 = 320

So, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 320."
"Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, so that's 5 * 5 = 25 red pens.
She bought twice the amount of black pens, so she bought 5 * 2 = 10 packs of black pens.
Each pack has 5 pens, so she bought 10 * 5 = 50 black pens.
In total, Alain has 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens.
The final numerical answer is 75."
"First, let's find out how much each bottle of scotch costs. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for $600, so the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[ \text{Cost per scotch bottle} = \frac{\$600}{10 \text{ bottles}} = \$60 \text{ per bottle} \]

Now, let's find out the cost of one bottle of cognac. The cognac costs 50% more per bottle than the scotch, so:

\[ \text{Cost per cognac bottle} = \$60 + (0.5 \times \$60) = \$60 + \$30 = \$90 \text{ per bottle} \]

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the cognac:

\[ \text{Total cost for cognac} = 20 \text{ bottles} \times \$90 \text{ per bottle} = \$1800 \]

Finally, let's add the cost of the scotch and the cost of the cognac to find the total amount John spends:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$600 + \$1800 = \$2400 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$2400 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **First Day Planting:**
   - Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
   - He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees. So, he planted \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.
   - Total trees planted on the first day: \(20 + 40 = 60\).

2. **Second Day Planting:**
   - He planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day. So, he planted \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
   - He planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day. So, he planted \(\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10\) more Lodgepole Pine trees, which means he planted \(40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees.
   - Total trees planted on the second day: \(30 + 50 = 80\).

3. **Total Trees Planted:**
   - Total trees planted over the two days: \(60 + 80 = 140\).

So, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 140."
"First, let's calculate how much root beer Fred had at the start:

Fred made 24 gallons of root beer.

On the first day, his children drank 4 gallons:
24 gallons - 4 gallons = 20 gallons left.

On the second day, his wife spilled 7 gallons:
20 gallons - 7 gallons = 13 gallons left.

On the third day, Fred's friend Ronnie drank 5 gallons:
13 gallons - 5 gallons = 8 gallons left.

On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party, and the remaining root beer was shared equally among them. So, we divide the 8 gallons by 3:
8 gallons ÷ 3 = 2.6667 gallons.

So, the final numerical answer is 2.6667 gallons."
"Let's solve this step by step.

We are given the equation: 
\[ 4 \times \text{number of coffee mugs} + 8 = 40 \]

First, we need to isolate the term with the number of coffee mugs. We do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4 \times \text{number of coffee mugs} = 40 - 8 \]
\[ 4 \times \text{number of coffee mugs} = 32 \]

Next, we need to find out how many coffee mugs there are. We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ \text{number of coffee mugs} = \frac{32}{4} \]
\[ \text{number of coffee mugs} = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is 8.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"First, let's find out how many fish have red stripes. Since one-third of the fish have red stripes, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of fish with red stripes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

Next, we need to find out how many fish are left after removing the fish with red stripes. This is:

\[
\text{Remaining fish} = 66 - 22 = 44
\]

Now, we need to find out how many of these remaining fish have blue stripes. Since 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of fish with blue stripes} = \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
\]

To find the total number of fish that have either red or blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes to the number of fish with blue stripes:

\[
\text{Total number of fish with red or blue stripes} = 22 + 20 = 42
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
42

"First, let's calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy originally had.

She had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each, so:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ colors} \]

She also had three makeup sets with six colors each, so:
\[ 3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ colors} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy originally had:
\[ 8 + 18 = 26 \text{ colors} \]

Her sister steals one of the palettes, so now Amy has:
\[ 26 - 4 = 22 \text{ colors} \]

Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since each makeup set has six colors, half of that is:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ colors} \]

So, after using up half of the colors from one makeup set, the number of colors Amy has left is:
\[ 22 - 3 = 19 \text{ colors} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 19 \]"
"First, let's find out how tall Mattison's house is. Since his house is 7 times as high as he is, and he is 60 inches tall, we can calculate the height of the house as follows:

\[ \text{Height of the house} = 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to find out how high the first floor is. Since the first floor is 3 times as high as Mattison himself, we can calculate the height of the first floor as:

\[ \text{Height of the first floor} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Now, to find the height of the second floor, we subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the house:

\[ \text{Height of the second floor} = \text{Height of the house} - \text{Height of the first floor} = 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

So, the height of the roof from the floor of the second floor is 240 inches."
"First, let's find out how many shells team Alphas found. They found 40% of the 700 shells.

\[ \text{Shells found by Alphas} = 700 \times \frac{40}{100} = 700 \times 0.4 = 280 \]

Now, we subtract the shells found by Alphas from the total to find out how many shells are left.

\[ \text{Remaining shells} = 700 - 280 = 420 \]

Next, team The finders found 60% of the remaining shells.

\[ \text{Shells found by The finders} = 420 \times \frac{60}{100} = 420 \times 0.6 = 252 \]

Now, we subtract the shells found by The finders from the remaining shells to find out how many shells team Gogetters found.

\[ \text{Shells found by Gogetters} = 420 - 252 = 168 \]

So, team Gogetters found 168 shells."
"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we first need to add up the miles the other dogs need to walk and then subtract that total from the average.

The first dog needs to walk 1 mile.
The second dog needs to walk 4 miles.
The third dog needs to walk 3 miles.

So, the total miles for the first three dogs is:
1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles

The average they need to walk per day is 3 miles.

Since there are 4 dogs in total, the total miles all dogs need to walk per day is:
4 dogs * 3 miles/dog = 12 miles

Now, to find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the total miles the first three dogs need to walk from the total miles all dogs need to walk:
12 miles (total for all dogs) - 8 miles (total for the first three dogs) = 4 miles

So, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles."
"First, let's find out how much loan John got. His house is worth $250,000 and he got a loan worth 40% of that.

\[ \text{Loan amount} = 250,000 \times \frac{40}{100} = 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

John used 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts.

\[ \text{Amount used to pay off debts} = 100,000 \times \frac{60}{100} = 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

Now, let's find out how much money John has left after paying off his debts.

\[ \text{Money leftover} = \text{Loan amount} - \text{Amount used to pay off debts} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 40,000 \]"
"First, we need to find the total weight of the tunas Deandre caught. We do this by adding the weights of the three tunas:

56 kg + 46 kg + 26 kg = 128 kg

Now, we know that a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50. To find out how much Deandre will earn, we multiply the total weight of the tunas by the price per kilogram:

128 kg * $0.50/kg = $64

So, the final numerical answer is $64."
"First, let's find out how much Trinity sold each magazine for. She sold them at 11/8 of the price she bought them. So, we need to calculate 11/8 of $72.

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72 \]

Let's calculate this.
\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11 \times 72}{8} = \frac{792}{8} = 99 \]

So, Trinity sold each magazine for $99.

Now, to find out her profit, we subtract the cost price from the selling price.

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price} \]
\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 = 27 \]

Therefore, Trinity's profit is $27."
"First, let's calculate how much water the dehumidifier removes each day at each speed:

- Low setting: 1 liter per day
- Medium setting: 2 times the low setting = 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day
- High setting: 2 times the medium setting = 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water removed during each period:

- For the low setting over 3 days: 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters
- For the medium setting over 3 days: 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters
- For the high setting over 5 days: 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters

Now, let's add up all the liters removed:

3 liters (low setting) + 6 liters (medium setting) + 20 liters (high setting) = 29 liters

So, the total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in his basement is 29 liters."
"First, we need to find out how many balloons Jolene and her friends started with. They filled 10 packs of balloons, and each pack had 30 balloons. So, we multiply the number of packs by the number of balloons per pack:

\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 30 \text{ balloons per pack} = 300 \text{ balloons} \]

By the end of the afternoon, 12 balloons were left. To find out how many balloons were thrown, we subtract the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons they started with:

\[ 300 \text{ balloons} - 12 \text{ balloons left} = 288 \text{ balloons thrown} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 288 \]"
"First, let's find out how much medicine is in one dose.

Saanvi combined 14 mL of the first medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine. So, the amount of the second medicine is:
\[ 3 \times 14 \, \text{mL} = 42 \, \text{mL} \]

Now, the total amount of medicine in one dose is the sum of the first and second medicines:
\[ 14 \, \text{mL} + 42 \, \text{mL} = 56 \, \text{mL} \]

To find out how much medicine is in 8 doses, we multiply the amount of medicine in one dose by 8:
\[ 56 \, \text{mL} \times 8 = 448 \, \text{mL} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 448 \, \text{mL} \]"
"First, let's find out how many students Ali's class can hold. We are told that Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students.

Now, let's find out how many students John's classes can hold. We know that each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Capacity of John's class} = \frac{1}{8} \times 120 = 15 \text{ students} \]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity for John's classes is:

\[ \text{Total capacity for John's classes} = 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ students} \]

Now, to find the combined capacity of both schools, we add the capacity of Ali's class to the total capacity of John's classes:

\[ \text{Combined capacity} = 120 + 30 = 150 \]

So, the combined capacity of both schools is 150 students."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen will return to his sister. He borrowed $300 and promised to return it with an additional 2% interest. 

The interest amount is calculated as:
\[ \text{Interest} = 300 \times \frac{2}{100} = 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen will return is:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month. He will pay $25 per month for 11 months, so the total amount paid in the first 11 months is:
\[ \text{Amount Paid in 11 Months} = 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

The remaining amount to be paid in the twelfth month is:
\[ \text{Remaining Amount} = 306 - 275 = 31 \]

So, the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is:

"Each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, so for 2 children, it would be:
5 diaper changes/child/day * 2 children = 10 diaper changes per day.

Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, so she changes:
10 diaper changes/day / 2 = 5 diaper changes per day.

Therefore, Jordan changes the other half, which is also:
5 diaper changes per day.

So, the final numerical answer is 5."
"First, let's find out the volume of the jar. The jar is a square prism with a base of 6 inches by 6 inches and a height of 15 inches. The volume \( V \) of a prism is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{base area} \times \text{height} \]

So, the volume of the jar is:

\[ V = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we need to find out how many jelly beans fit into the jar based on the given efficiency. Since the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, we need to divide the volume of the jar by the volume of one jelly bean to find the theoretical number of jelly beans that could fit, and then multiply by the efficiency.

The volume of one jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches. So, the theoretical number of jelly beans that could fit is:

\[ \text{Theoretical number of jelly beans} = \frac{540}{0.15} = 3600 \]

Since the packing efficiency is 80%, the actual number of jelly beans that fit is:

\[ \text{Actual number of jelly beans} = 3600 \times 0.80 = 2880 \]

Now, we know that 30% of the jelly beans are red. So, the number of red jelly beans is:

\[ \text{Number of red jelly beans} = 2880 \times 0.30 = 864 \]

The true number of red jelly beans is given as 900. So, the difference between Tim's guess and the true number of red jelly beans is:

\[ \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36 \]

So, Tim was 36 jelly beans off in his guess."
"First, let's calculate the number of people on the bus after each stop.

Initially, the bus had 20 people.

On the first stop, 40 people entered the bus:
\[ 20 + 40 = 60 \]

On the second stop, 3/4 of the 40 people who entered at the first stop entered the bus:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30 \]
So, the number of people on the bus after the second stop is:
\[ 60 + 30 = 90 \]

At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \]

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find out how many more people can fit on the bus, we subtract the number of people currently on the bus from the bus's capacity:
\[ 200 - 180 = 20 \]

So, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is:
\[ 20 \]"
"First, let's find out how much Pauline spent in the first 5 years.

Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, so in one year she spends:
\[ 3 \text{ visits/year} \times \$2/\text{visit} = \$6/\text{year} \]

For 5 years, she spends:
\[ 5 \text{ years} \times \$6/\text{year} = \$30 \]

Now, the cost of one visit increased by 150%. To find the new cost, we calculate 150% of the original cost and add it to the original cost:
\[ 150\% \text{ of } \$2 = 1.5 \times \$2 = \$3 \]
\[ \text{New cost} = \$2 + \$3 = \$5 \]

For the next 3 years, Pauline continues to visit the museum 3 times a year at the new cost of $5 per visit. So, in one year she spends:
\[ 3 \text{ visits/year} \times \$5/\text{visit} = \$15/\text{year} \]

For 3 years, she spends:
\[ 3 \text{ years} \times \$15/\text{year} = \$45 \]

Now, we add the total amount spent in the first 5 years to the total amount spent in the next 3 years:
\[ \$30 + \$45 = \$75 \]

So, the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is:
\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"First, we need to find out how many students in total are eligible to try the escape room. Since there are 10 students in each of the 3 grades (4th, 5th, and 6th), we can calculate the total number of students as follows:

\[ 10 \text{ students/grade} \times 3 \text{ grades} = 30 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many groups of 8 students can be formed from these 30 students. We do this by dividing the total number of students by the number of students per group:

\[ 30 \text{ students} \div 8 \text{ students/group} = 3.75 \]

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we can only form 3 full groups of 8 students each. The 4th student in the 4th group will not be able to participate in the escape room this time. So, 24 students will be able to try the escape room.

Each group takes 45 minutes to try the escape room. Therefore, for 3 groups, the total time required is:

\[ 3 \text{ groups} \times 45 \text{ minutes/group} = 135 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take 135 minutes for everyone to try the escape room."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the wooden tables. John made 4 wooden tables and each table costs $20. So, the total cost for the tables is:
\[ 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the roof frames. John made 2 roof frames and each frame costs $10. So, the total cost for the frames is:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \]

Now, we add the cost of the tables and the cost of the frames to find out the total amount Ali has to pay:
\[ 80 + 20 = 100 \]

So, the final amount Ali has to pay John is:
\[ 100 \]"
"Let's call the length of the shorter piece ""x"" feet. Then the longer piece would be 4 times longer, so it would be ""4x"" feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, so we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms gives us:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find the value of \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So the shorter piece is 8 feet long. The longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, so:

\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the longer piece is 32 feet long.

The final numerical answer is 32."
"First, we need to find out how many pounds of meat Aiden needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound:

\[ \text{Pounds of meat} = \frac{\text{Total meatballs}}{\text{Meatballs per pound}} = \frac{80}{16} = 5 \text{ pounds of meat} \]

Now, we know that Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning for every pound of ground beef. So, for 5 pounds of meat, he will need:

\[ \text{Total seasoning} = \text{Pounds of meat} \times \text{Seasoning per pound} = 5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ tablespoons of seasoning} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 10 tablespoons."
"First, we need to find the total width of all the windows. Since there are five windows and each window is 35 inches wide, we can calculate the total width by multiplying 35 inches by 5.

\[ 35 \times 5 = 175 \text{ inches} \]

Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows. So, we multiply the total width by 2.

\[ 175 \times 2 = 350 \text{ inches} \]

So, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."
"To solve this, we need to break the call into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining minutes after that.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute. So, the cost for the first 16 minutes is:
\[ 16 \text{ minutes} \times \$0.25/\text{minute} = \$4.00 \]

After 16 minutes, the price drops to $0.2 per minute. We need to calculate the cost for the remaining minutes, which is \(36 - 16 = 20\) minutes. So, the cost for the remaining 20 minutes is:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes} \times \$0.2/\text{minute} = \$4.00 \]

Now, we add the costs of both parts to get the total cost of the 36-minute call:
\[ \$4.00 + \$4.00 = \$8.00 \]

So, the total cost for a 36-minute call is $8.00."
"To find out how much rain will fall on Tuesday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how much it rained on Monday.
2. Calculate twice the amount of rain that fell on Monday.
3. Add 1 inch to the result from step 2 to find out the expected rain for Tuesday.

Let's do the calculations:

1. It rained 2 inches on Monday.
2. Twice the amount of rain on Monday is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) inches.
3. Adding 1 inch to the result from step 2 gives us \(4 + 1 = 5\) inches.

So, the expected amount of rain on Tuesday is 5 inches."
"First, let's find out how many treats in total Carly needs to make. Since there are 5 people in her class and each person gets 2 treats, we multiply 5 by 2:

\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

So, Carly needs to make 10 treats in total.

Let's say Carly made \( C \) cupcakes. According to the problem, she made 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. So, if she made \( C \) cupcakes, she made \( 3C - 2 \) brownies.

The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies:

\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]

Now, let's solve this equation:

\[ C + 3C - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4C = 12 \]
\[ C = 3 \]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure before the discount. A basic manicure costs $35 and a basic pedicure costs $40. So, the total cost for both is:

\[ 35 + 40 = 75 \]

Next, the salon offers a 20% discount if you get both services. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $75:

\[ 0.20 \times 75 = 15 \]

So, the discount amount is $15. Subtracting this discount from the total cost gives:

\[ 75 - 15 = 60 \]

Now, Karen wants to add nail art on each of her fingers. Since she has 10 fingers (2 on each hand), and each nail art costs $3, the total cost for the nail art is:

\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \]

Finally, we add the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure to the cost of the nail art:

\[ 60 + 30 = 90 \]

So, Karen would pay a total of $90."
"First, let's calculate the total number of issues Susan gets from the magazines that send 12 issues a year. She orders 3 such magazines, so:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ issues} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of issues she gets from the magazine that sends 6 issues a year. She has 1 such magazine, so:
\[ 1 \times 6 = 6 \text{ issues} \]

Now, let's calculate the number of issues she gets from the last magazine. This magazine sends her 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, so:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ issues} \]

Now, we add up all the issues from all the magazines:
\[ 36 + 6 + 24 = 66 \text{ issues} \]

So, the total number of magazines Susan gets every year is:
\[ \boxed{66} \]"
"First, let's find out how many paintings Shelley has. Since Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley and Samantha has 27 paintings, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Shelley's paintings} = \text{Samantha's paintings} + 12 \]

Given that Samantha has 27 paintings:

\[ \text{Shelley's paintings} = 27 + 12 = 39 \]

Now, we know that Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. So, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Shelley's paintings} = \text{Kim's paintings} + 8 \]

Given that Shelley has 39 paintings:

\[ 39 = \text{Kim's paintings} + 8 \]

To find out how many paintings Kim has, we need to subtract 8 from 39:

\[ \text{Kim's paintings} = 39 - 8 = 31 \]

So, Kim has 31 paintings."
"First, let's find out the price of the toy in December after an 80% increase.

An 80% increase means the price becomes 180% of the original price. So, we calculate 180% of $40.

\[ 180\% \text{ of } \$40 = \frac{180}{100} \times 40 = 1.8 \times 40 = \$72 \]

So, the price of the toy in December is $72.

Next, in January, the price decreased by 50%. A 50% decrease means the price becomes 50% of the December price.

\[ 50\% \text{ of } \$72 = \frac{50}{100} \times 72 = 0.5 \times 72 = \$36 \]

So, the price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"First, let's calculate the standard fee for a lesson:
- The standard fee is $80 per hour.

Next, let's calculate the reduced fee for a lesson to a veteran:
- The reduced fee is 25% less than the standard fee.
- 25% of $80 is calculated as \( 0.25 \times 80 = 20 \).
- So, the reduced fee is \( 80 - 20 = 60 \) dollars per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total money made from the standard lessons:
- Charlie has 4 lessons at the standard rate of $80 each.
- Total for standard lessons: \( 4 \times 80 = 320 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total money made from the veteran lessons:
- Charlie has 2 lessons at the reduced rate of $60 each.
- Total for veteran lessons: \( 2 \times 60 = 120 \) dollars.

Finally, let's add the totals from both types of lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day:
- Total amount: \( 320 + 120 = 440 \) dollars.

So, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is 440 dollars."
"To find Sally's mean score, we need to add up all her scores and then divide by the number of quizzes she took.

First, let's add up all the scores:
50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 = 650

Now, we count the number of quizzes, which is 9.

To find the mean, we divide the total score by the number of quizzes:
650 ÷ 9 = 72.2222...

Rounded to two decimal places, the mean score is 72.22.

So, the final numerical answer is 72.22."
"Eve originally had 20 pomelos. After giving some away, she was left with 1/4 of the original amount. So, she has 20 / 4 = 5 pomelos left.

To find out how many she gave away, we subtract the number she has left from the original number:
20 - 5 = 15

Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

The final numerical answer is 15."
"First, let's find out how many apples Walter ate. He ate 2/5 of the 60 apples, so:

\[ \text{Apples eaten} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \]

Now, let's find out how many apples are left after he ate 24:

\[ \text{Remaining apples} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

Next, Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. So, we calculate 25% of 36:

\[ \text{Apples given to sister} = 0.25 \times 36 = 9 \]

Now, let's find out how many apples are left after giving 9 to his sister:

\[ \text{Remaining apples after giving to sister} = 36 - 9 = 27 \]

Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. So, the total money he received is:

\[ \text{Money received} = 27 \times 3 = 81 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 81 \]"
"If 9 novels is 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year, then one quarter of the number of novels she has written this year is 9 / 3 = 3 novels.

Since one quarter is 3 novels, the total number of novels she has written this year would be 3 * 4 = 12 novels.

So, the final answer is 12 novels."
"First, we need to calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days. We know he travels at an average speed of 50 km/hr. To find out how many hours he travels in 3 days, we need to convert days into hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so in 3 days, he travels for:

\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 72 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the total distance he travels in 72 hours at a speed of 50 km/hr:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 50 \text{ km/hr} \times 72 \text{ hours} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

The distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. To find out what percentage of this distance Michael has covered, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{\text{Distance covered}}{\text{Total distance}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 0.6 \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the distance Michael has covered is 60%."
"First, let's find out how many grapes Madeline's brother used. Since he used up 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, and Madeline ate 6 grapes, we can calculate the number of grapes her brother used as follows:

\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ grapes} \]

Now, let's add the grapes Madeline ate to the grapes her brother used:

\[ 6 + 30 = 36 \text{ grapes} \]

Their mother then used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. Since each pie recipe calls for 12 grapes, we can calculate the total number of grapes used for the pies:

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ grapes} \]

However, we only have 36 grapes left after Madeline and her brother ate theirs. This means that the 48 grapes needed for the pies cannot be used with the grapes available. Therefore, we need to find out how many grapes were there at the beginning by adding the grapes used for the pies to the grapes Madeline and her brother ate:

\[ 36 + 48 = 84 \text{ grapes} \]

So, the total number of grapes at the beginning was:

\[ \boxed{84} \]"
"To find out how many teachers were at school that day, we need to subtract the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers and then add the substitute teachers.

Total number of teachers = 82
Number of sick teachers = 13
Number of substitute teachers = 9

So, the number of teachers at school that day = Total number of teachers - Number of sick teachers + Number of substitute teachers

Let's do the calculation:

82 - 13 = 69
69 + 9 = 78

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 78."
"First, let's find out how much Bud spends on cheese each time he makes macaroni and cheese.

He spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese and twice that amount on gruyere cheese. So, the gruyere cheese costs:
\[ 2 \times 3.00 = 6.00 \]

Now, let's add the cost of the pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese to find out the total cost for one batch of macaroni and cheese:
\[ 1.00 + 3.00 + 6.00 = 10.00 \]

Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, so in one year (52 weeks), he makes it:
\[ 52 \times 1 = 52 \]

To find out how much Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we multiply the weekly cost by the number of weeks in a year:
\[ 10.00 \times 52 = 520.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 520.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time needed to clean all the classrooms.

There are 80 classrooms and it takes 15 minutes per classroom.
So, the total time needed is \( 80 \times 15 = 1200 \) minutes.

Next, we need to find out how many hours this total time is equivalent to. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide the total minutes by 60:
\[ 1200 \div 60 = 20 \] hours.

The custodian works 8 hours a day. To find out what percentage of their day is spent cleaning, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent cleaning}}{\text{Total hours in a day}} \right) \times 100 \]

So, the percentage of their day spent cleaning is:
\[ \left( \frac{20}{8} \right) \times 100 = 2.5 \times 100 = 250\% \]

However, this percentage seems unrealistic because it's more than a full day. Let's recheck the calculation to ensure there are no mistakes.

The total time needed is 20 hours, and the custodian works 8 hours a day. So, the percentage of their day spent cleaning is:
\[ \left( \frac{20}{8} \right) \times 100 = 2.5 \times 100 = 250\% \]

But since the custodian can't work more than 8 hours in a day, the correct interpretation is that they spend 250% of their working hours cleaning, which means they work 2.5 times their normal 8-hour day. So, the correct percentage of their day spent cleaning is:
\[ \left( \frac{20}{8} \right) \times 100 = 2.5 \times 100 = 250\% \]

But since the question asks for the percentage of their day, and they can't work more than 100% of a day, the correct answer should be:
\[ \left( \frac{20}{8} \right) \times 100 = 2.5 \times 100 = 250\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"First, let's find out how many books each shelf can hold:

- Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(10 \times 2 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's add up the total number of books that can be held by all the shelves:

- Middle shelves: \(10 + 10 = 20\) books
- Bottom shelf: 20 books
- Top shelf: 15 books

So, the total number of books that can be held by all the shelves is \(20 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books.

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the total number of books that can be held by the shelves:

\[ \frac{110}{55} = 2 \]

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books."
"First, let's find out how many eggs Rose bought. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens would be:

5 dozens * 12 eggs/dozen = 60 eggs

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs. Since the eggs cost $2.40 per dozen and she bought five dozens, the total cost is:

5 dozens * $2.40/dozen = $12.00

Now, let's find out how much Rose will sell the eggs for. She sells them at $1 for 3 eggs. Since she has 60 eggs, we can calculate the total selling price as follows:

60 eggs / 3 eggs per dollar = 20 dollars

Finally, to find out Rose's profit, we subtract the total cost from the total selling price:

$20.00 (selling price) - $12.00 (cost) = $8.00

So, Rose's profit is $8.00."
"First, let's find out how many red hats Skyler has. Since half of the hats are red, we can calculate this as:

\[ \text{Number of red hats} = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50 \]

Now, we subtract the number of red hats from the total number of hats to find out how many hats are left:

\[ \text{Remaining hats} = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining hats are blue. According to the problem, 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue:

\[ \text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Now, we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats to find out how many hats are white:

\[ \text{Number of white hats} = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

So, Skyler has 20 white hats."
"First, let's find out the regular price of the beef jerky bag. The regular price is $18.00.

Since there's a $3.00 discount, the price Archie will pay is:
\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

Now, we know that there are 30 sticks in a bag. To find out how much each stick costs, we divide the total price by the number of sticks:
\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

So, each stick of jerky costs $0.50. To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100 (since $1.00 = 100 cents):
\[ 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \]

Therefore, each stick of jerky costs 50 cents."
"First, let's calculate how many questions Audrey got right on the first test. The first test has 70 questions and she got 60% of them correct.

\[ \text{Questions correct on first test} = 70 \times \frac{60}{100} = 70 \times 0.6 = 42 \]

So, Audrey got 42 questions correct on the first test. To pass and move on to the 7th grade, she needs to get 70% of the total questions correct. The total number of questions in both tests is:

\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]

To find out how many questions she needs to get right in total to pass, we calculate 70% of 110:

\[ \text{Total questions to pass} = 110 \times \frac{70}{100} = 110 \times 0.7 = 77 \]

Since she already got 42 questions correct on the first test, we need to find out how many more questions she needs to get right on the second test to reach the total of 77 questions correct:

\[ \text{Questions needed on second test} = 77 - 42 = 35 \]

So, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 35 \]"
"Let's break this down step by step.

First, let's say the number of strawberry cubes Mary makes is \( S \).

The number of blueberry cubes she makes is \( 5S - 4 \).

The total number of ice cubes she makes is the sum of the strawberry cubes and the blueberry cubes, which is given as 116. So we can write the equation:

\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Now, let's solve this equation:

\[ S + 5S - 4 = 116 \]
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]
\[ 6S = 116 + 4 \]
\[ 6S = 120 \]
\[ S = \frac{120}{6} \]
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes.

Now, to find the number of blueberry cubes, we use the formula \( 5S - 4 \):

\[ 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

So, Mary makes 96 blueberry cubes.

The final numerical answer is 96."
"To find the total number of points Ara has scored, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of games Ara has played in four years.
2. Multiply the total number of games by her average score per game.

First, let's find the total number of games:
- Ara plays 40 games every year.
- She has been playing for 4 years.

So, the total number of games is:
\[ 40 \text{ games/year} \times 4 \text{ years} = 160 \text{ games} \]

Next, we calculate the total points:
- Her score per game is 21 points.
- She has played 160 games.

So, the total points is:
\[ 21 \text{ points/game} \times 160 \text{ games} = 3360 \text{ points} \]

Therefore, the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is:
\[ 3360 \]"
"Brendan started with 10 marbles. When he dropped half of them, he dropped 10 / 2 = 5 marbles. So, he had 10 - 5 = 5 marbles left. When he went back home, he found 3 marbles and got rid of the bead, so he added 3 marbles to the 5 he had left. Therefore, Brendan ended up with 5 + 3 - 1 = 7 marbles."
"To solve this, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps based on the given averages.

1. **Determine how many customers Jason needs to see to sell 15 cars:**
   - For every 2 cars sold, Jason needs 2 customers.
   - Therefore, for 15 cars, Jason needs \(15 \div 2 = 7.5\) customers. Since Jason can't have half a customer, we round up to 8 customers (because even if he doesn't get a customer, he still needs to make the calls).

2. **Determine how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to see 8 customers:**
   - For every 25 calls, Jason gets 1 customer.
   - To get 8 customers, Jason needs \(8 \times 25 = 200\) calls.

So, Jason needs to make 200 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

The final numerical answer is:
200"
"First, let's figure out how many flashlights they have. There are 4 people in the house, so they have 4 flashlights. Since there are 8 rooms and they have 2 flashlights for each room, that's 8 rooms * 2 flashlights/room = 16 flashlights. But we already know they have 4 flashlights, so the extra flashlights are for the rooms. 

Now, let's calculate the candles. There are 8 rooms in total. Half of the rooms have small candles and the other half have medium candles. So, 8 rooms / 2 = 4 rooms with small candles and 4 rooms with medium candles.

For the rooms with small candles, they have 4 small candles each. So, 4 rooms * 4 small candles/room = 16 small candles.

For the rooms with medium candles, they have 5 medium candles each. So, 4 rooms * 5 medium candles/room = 20 medium candles.

Now, let's add up all the flashlights and candles:
- Flashlights: 4 (for people) + 16 (for rooms) = 20 flashlights
- Candles: 16 (small) + 20 (medium) = 36 candles

So, the total number of candles and flashlights they are using is 20 flashlights + 36 candles = 56.

The final numerical answer is 56."
"First, let's find out how many chips Mitchell has in total. He bought two bags of chips, and each bag has 55 chips. So, we multiply the number of bags by the number of chips in each bag:

\[ 2 \times 55 = 110 \]

Now, Mitchell has 110 chips in total. His family has five members, and he wants to give each person the same number of chips. To find out how many chips each person gets, we divide the total number of chips by the number of family members:

\[ 110 \div 5 = 22 \]

So, each person gets 22 chips. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 22 \]"
"First, let's break down the time it takes John to solve each side of the Rubik's cube:

- The first side takes 5 minutes.
- The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so each takes \(5 \times 2 = 10\) minutes.
- The fourth and fifth sides each take half as long as the first side, so each takes \(5 \div 2 = 2.5\) minutes.

Now, let's add up the time for all sides:

- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes

Total time = 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes

So, the Rubik's cube takes 30 minutes to solve."
"If there were 20 helmets, and Dominick saw half as many robots as helmets, then there were 20 / 2 = 10 robots.

Also, Dominick saw half as many helmets as footballs, so there were 20 * 2 = 40 footballs.

To find the total number of items Dominick saw, we add the helmets, robots, and footballs together: 20 helmets + 10 robots + 40 footballs = 70 items.

So, the final numerical answer is 70."
"First, we need to find out how many minutes Tim works in a day. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply the number of hours he works by 60:

6 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour = 360 minutes/day

Now, we know that Tim spends 15 minutes dealing with each call. To find out how many calls he can handle in a day, we divide the total minutes he works in a day by the time it takes to handle one call:

360 minutes/day ÷ 15 minutes/call = 24 calls/day

Finally, to find out how many calls he deals with during a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of calls he handles in a day by the number of days in the week:

24 calls/day * 5 days/week = 120 calls/week

So, the final numerical answer is 120 calls."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total drying time for both the old varnish and the new varnish for 6 paintings.

For the old varnish:
- It takes 7 minutes for one painting to dry.
- For 6 paintings, it would take \(7 \times 6 = 42\) minutes.

For the new varnish:
- It takes 12 minutes for one painting to dry.
- For 6 paintings, it would take \(12 \times 6 = 72\) minutes.

Now, we need to find out how much longer it will take with the new varnish compared to the old varnish:
- The difference in time is \(72 - 42 = 30\) minutes.

So, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry as it would with the old varnish.

The final numerical answer is:
30"
"To solve this, let's break it down into parts:

1. Crista has 20 plants in total.
2. 4 plants need half a cup of water each day.
3. 8 plants need 1 cup of water each day.
4. The rest need a quarter of a cup of water each day.

First, let's find out how many plants need a quarter of a cup of water:
\[ 20 \text{ plants} - 4 \text{ plants} - 8 \text{ plants} = 8 \text{ plants} \]

Now, let's calculate the total water needed for each group of plants:

- For the 4 plants that need half a cup each:
\[ 4 \times \frac{1}{2} = 2 \text{ cups} \]

- For the 8 plants that need 1 cup each:
\[ 8 \times 1 = 8 \text{ cups} \]

- For the 8 plants that need a quarter of a cup each:
\[ 8 \times \frac{1}{4} = 2 \text{ cups} \]

Now, let's add up all the cups of water needed:
\[ 2 \text{ cups} + 8 \text{ cups} + 2 \text{ cups} = 12 \text{ cups} \]

So, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller parts and calculate the time Phineas spends hopping and swimming.

Phineas needs to travel a total of 200 yards. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, he will travel 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Phineas to hop 100 yards on land. He hops at a speed of 20 yards per minute, so the time taken to hop 100 yards is:
\[ \text{Time hopping} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Phineas to swim 100 yards in water. He swims at a speed of 10 yards per minute, so the time taken to swim 100 yards is:
\[ \text{Time swimming} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards/minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent hopping and swimming to get the total time:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time hopping} + \text{Time swimming} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it will take Phineas to return home is 15 minutes."
"First, we need to find out how many boxes of popsicle sticks Bob needs. Since each box contains 8 sticks and he needs 56 sticks, we divide the total number of sticks by the number of sticks per box:

\[ \text{Number of boxes} = \frac{56 \text{ sticks}}{8 \text{ sticks/box}} = 7 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total cost. Each box costs $2.00, so we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 7 \text{ boxes} \times 2 \text{ dollars/box} = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

14"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. The main phone costs $20.
2. Each additional phone costs half as much as the main phone. So, each additional phone costs $20 / 2 = $10.
3. There are five phones in total, and one of them is the main phone. So, there are 5 - 1 = 4 additional phones.
4. The cost of the 4 additional phones is 4 * $10 = $40.
5. The total cost of the whole phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones, which is $20 + $40 = $60.

So, the whole phone plan costs $60."
"First, let's find out how many doughnuts Derrick makes in a day. Since he makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day and one dozen equals 12 doughnuts, we can calculate the total number of doughnuts he makes in a day as follows:

\[ 10 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ doughnuts/dozen} = 120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how much money Derrick makes in a day by selling all the doughnuts. Since each doughnut is sold for $2, we can calculate the daily earnings as follows:

\[ 120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \times \$2/\text{doughnut} = \$240/\text{day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days are in June. June has 30 days. So, we can calculate the total earnings for the month of June by multiplying the daily earnings by the number of days in June:

\[ \$240/\text{day} \times 30 \text{ days} = \$7200 \]

So, the total amount of money Derrick makes in June if he sells all the doughnuts is:

\[ \$7200 \]"
"First, let's find out how many photos Jade can upload in one day. She uploads 7 photos in one batch and does 6 batches each day. So, the number of photos she uploads in one day is:

\[ 7 \text{ photos/batch} \times 6 \text{ batches/day} = 42 \text{ photos/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take her to upload all 210 photos. We do this by dividing the total number of photos by the number of photos she can upload in one day:

\[ \frac{210 \text{ photos}}{42 \text{ photos/day}} = 5 \text{ days} \]

So, Jade will need 5 days to upload all of her photos."
"First, let's calculate the cost for one week:

- Cost for 5 blouses: 5 blouses * $5.00/blouse = $25.00
- Cost for 1 skirt: 1 skirt * $6.00/skirt = $6.00
- Cost for 2 pairs of pants: 2 pairs * $8.00/pair = $16.00

Now, let's add these up to find the total cost for one week:

Total cost for one week = $25.00 + $6.00 + $16.00 = $47.00

Since Alicia needs to do this every week for 5 weeks, we multiply the weekly cost by 5:

Total cost for 5 weeks = $47.00/week * 5 weeks = $235.00

So, Alicia spends $235.00 on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks."
"First, let's find out John's new speaking speed after training. If his normal speed is 150 WPM (words per minute) and his new speed is 2.5 times faster, we calculate his new speed as follows:

\[ \text{New Speed} = 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

Next, we need to find out how many words are in 10 pages. Since each page has 450 words, 10 pages will have:

\[ \text{Total Words} = 10 \, \text{pages} \times 450 \, \text{words/page} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

Now, to find out how long it will take him to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total Words}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} \]

Let's calculate the time:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{4500}{375} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

So, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages at his new speed."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Day**: Conor saw 50 people.
2. **Second Day**: Conor saw 20 more people than on the first day. So, he saw \(50 + 20 = 70\) people.
3. **Third Day**: The number of people was twice the number from the second day. So, he saw \(2 \times 70 = 140\) people.
4. **Fourth Day to Sunday**: We need to find out how many people were at the beach each of these days to calculate the total for the week. We know the average number of people seen each day for the rest of the week is 60. Since there are 4 days left in the week (from the fourth day to the Sunday), the total number of people seen over these 4 days is \(4 \times 60 = 240\).

Now, let's add up all the people Conor saw over the week:
- First day: 50 people
- Second day: 70 people
- Third day: 140 people
- Fourth day to Sunday: 240 people

So, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is:
\[50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 500\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[500\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount pop. So, \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. In the next 30 seconds, four times the initial amount pop. So, \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. In the final 30 seconds, half the rate of the previous 30 seconds. So, \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) kernels pop.

Now, let's add up the total number of kernels that popped during the cooking process:
\[20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200\]

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds pop from the residual heat. So, \(\frac{40}{4} = 10\) kernels pop.

Adding these to the total from the cooking process:
\[200 + 10 = 210\]

So, the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat is 210."
"First, let's determine how many cups of lemon juice Tim needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade. Since 1 gallon is equal to 4 cups, 4 gallons would be:

\[ 4 \text{ gallons} \times 4 \text{ cups/gallon} = 16 \text{ cups of lemon juice} \]

Tim's recipe calls for 1 cup of fresh lemon juice for every gallon of lemonade. So, for 16 cups of lemon juice, he needs:

\[ 16 \text{ cups of lemon juice} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many lemons are needed to get 16 cups of lemon juice. We know that 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice. Therefore, to get 16 cups of juice, Tim needs:

\[ 16 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 96 \text{ lemons} \]

Allen wants an extra gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart. This means Tim needs to make an additional 1 cup of lemon juice. So, for the extra lemonade, he needs:

\[ 1 \text{ cup} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 6 \text{ lemons} \]

Adding the lemons needed for the 4 gallons and the extra gallon, the total number of lemons Tim needs is:

\[ 96 \text{ lemons} + 6 \text{ lemons} = 102 \text{ lemons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 102 \]"
"First, let's calculate the daily dog food consumption for the German Shepherds and Bulldogs.

- Each German Shepherd eats 5 kilograms of dog food per day. Since there are 3 German Shepherds, the total daily consumption for the German Shepherds is:
  \[
  3 \text{ German Shepherds} \times 5 \text{ kg/German Shepherd} = 15 \text{ kg}
  \]

- Each Bulldog eats 3 kilograms of dog food per day. Since there are 2 Bulldogs, the total daily consumption for the Bulldogs is:
  \[
  2 \text{ Bulldogs} \times 3 \text{ kg/Bulldog} = 6 \text{ kg}
  \]

- The total daily consumption for all the dogs is:
  \[
  15 \text{ kg} + 6 \text{ kg} = 21 \text{ kg}
  \]

Now, to find out how much dog food they will need in a week, we multiply the total daily consumption by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):
\[
21 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 147 \text{ kg}
\]

So, the Kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week."
"First, let's find out how many legs all the animals have in total.

The 10 2-legged animals have a total of:
10 animals * 2 legs/animal = 20 legs

The 15 4-legged animals have a total of:
15 animals * 4 legs/animal = 60 legs

Now, let's add the legs together:
20 legs + 60 legs = 80 legs

Since we need to find out how many pairs of legs there are, we divide the total number of legs by 2:
80 legs / 2 = 40 pairs

So, the final numerical answer is 40."
"First, let's figure out how many yellow blocks there are. We know there are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks. Since there are 4 blue blocks, we can calculate the number of yellow blocks as follows:

Number of yellow blocks = 2 * Number of blue blocks
Number of yellow blocks = 2 * 4
Number of yellow blocks = 8

Now we know there are 4 blue blocks and 8 yellow blocks. To find out how many red blocks there are, we need to subtract the number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks.

Total number of blocks = 32
Number of blue blocks = 4
Number of yellow blocks = 8

Number of red blocks = Total number of blocks - (Number of blue blocks + Number of yellow blocks)
Number of red blocks = 32 - (4 + 8)
Number of red blocks = 32 - 12
Number of red blocks = 20

So, there are 20 red blocks in the tower."
"First, let's calculate the distance Elvis traveled west.

He was driving at an average speed of 18 mph for 5 hours.
Distance = Speed × Time
Distance west = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles

Now, let's calculate the distance Elvis traveled east.

He was driving at an average speed of 18 mph for 8 hours.
Distance east = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles

Since Elvis traveled west first and then east, we need to find the net distance from his house. The net distance is the difference between the distance he traveled east and the distance he traveled west.

Net distance = Distance east - Distance west
Net distance = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

So, Elvis is 54 miles from his house now."
"To solve this, let's calculate the value of the boat year by year.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   - The boat originally costs $9000.
   - It depreciates 30% in the first year.
   - Depreciation amount = 30% of $9000 = 0.30 * $9000 = $2700.
   - Value after first year = Original value - Depreciation = $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

2. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   - The boat's value at the start of the second year is $6300.
   - It depreciates another 30% in the second year.
   - Depreciation amount = 30% of $6300 = 0.30 * $6300 = $1890.
   - Value after second year = Value at start of second year - Depreciation = $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

3. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   - The boat's value at the start of the third year is $4410.
   - It depreciates 20% in the third year.
   - Depreciation amount = 20% of $4410 = 0.20 * $4410 = $882.
   - Value after third year = Value at start of third year - Depreciation = $4410 - $882 = $3528.

So, the boat is worth $3528 after the three years."
"First, let's find out how many orange candies there are. Since there are twice as many orange candies as red candies, and there are 54 red candies, we can calculate the number of orange candies as follows:

Number of orange candies = 2 * Number of red candies
Number of orange candies = 2 * 54
Number of orange candies = 108

Next, let's find out how many yellow candies there are. Since there are half as many yellow candies as red candies, we can calculate the number of yellow candies as follows:

Number of yellow candies = 1/2 * Number of red candies
Number of yellow candies = 1/2 * 54
Number of yellow candies = 27

Now, let's add up all the candies we know the number of:

Total known candies = Number of red candies + Number of orange candies + Number of yellow candies
Total known candies = 54 + 108 + 27
Total known candies = 189

We know the bag has 232 pieces of Starbursts candy in total. To find out how many are pink, we subtract the total known candies from the total number of candies:

Number of pink candies = Total number of candies - Total known candies
Number of pink candies = 232 - 189
Number of pink candies = 43

So, the final numerical answer is 43."
"First, let's calculate the cost of one night at the hotel. It's given as $80.

Next, we need to find out the cost of one bus trip. The problem states that one bus trip costs 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. So, we calculate 10% of $80:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$80 = \frac{10}{100} \times 80 = \$8 \]

Now, we know that Helen rode the bus 7 times. So, the total cost for the bus trips is:

\[ 7 \times \$8 = \$56 \]

Helen stayed in the hotel for 3 nights, so the total cost for the hotel is:

\[ 3 \times \$80 = \$240 \]

To find the total cost for both the hotel and the bus trips, we add the two amounts together:

\[ \$240 + \$56 = \$296 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$296 \]"
"First, let's find out how many marbles Dallas had before dropping any. If Dallas ended up with 21 marbles after dropping 4, then before dropping the marbles, Dallas had:

\[ 21 + 4 = 25 \text{ marbles} \]

Mazie originally had 52 marbles. After giving some to Dallas and Darla, Dallas ended up with 25 marbles. So, the total number of marbles given to Dallas and Darla is:

\[ 52 - 25 = 27 \text{ marbles} \]

We know that Dallas received 25 marbles, so the number of marbles given to Darla is:

\[ 27 - 25 = 2 \text{ marbles} \]

So, the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla is:

\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the tickets:
- The cost of an adult ticket is $12, and there are 2 adults, so the total cost for the adult tickets is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) dollars.
- The cost of a child ticket is $8, and there is 1 child, so the total cost for the child ticket is \(8 \times 1 = 8\) dollars.
- Adding the cost of the adult and child tickets together, we get \(24 + 8 = 32\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the popcorns:
- Each popcorn costs $3, and they buy 2 popcorns, so the total cost for the popcorns is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the tickets and the cost of the popcorns to find the total amount they pay:
- The total cost is \(32 + 6 = 38\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is 38 dollars."
"First, we need to find the total weight of the car and the luggage and the children together.

The car weighs 1200 pounds.
The luggage weighs 250 pounds.
Each child weighs 75 pounds, and there are two children, so the total weight of the children is 75 * 2 = 150 pounds.

Now, we add all these weights together:
1200 (car) + 250 (luggage) + 150 (children) = 1600 pounds.

The force needed to move the car is 1% of the total weight. To find 1% of 1600 pounds, we calculate:
1% of 1600 = 0.01 * 1600 = 16 pounds.

So, the force John needs to push the car is 16 pounds."
"To figure out how many feet of crepe paper James needs, we need to calculate the perimeter of his backyard fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up all its sides. 

The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given:
- Length = 20 feet
- Width = 15 feet

Now, let's plug in the values:
\[ P = 2 \times (20 + 15) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 35 \]
\[ P = 70 \]

So, James needs to buy 70 feet of crepe paper."
"To find the average age of Mia and Emma, we first need to determine Emma's age. Since Mia is 40 years old and they are 16 years apart in age, we can calculate Emma's age as follows:

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16 years
Emma's age = 40 years + 16 years
Emma's age = 56 years

Now that we know both of their ages, we can calculate the average age. The formula for the average of two numbers is:

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2

Substituting the ages we have:

Average age = (40 years + 56 years) / 2
Average age = 96 years / 2
Average age = 48 years

So, the average of their ages is 48 years."
"First, we need to find out how many seashells they found in total. Tom found 214 seashells, Nancy found 432 seashells, and Benny found 86 seashells. So, we add these numbers together:

214 + 432 + 86 = 732 seashells

Next, we know that 67 of these seashells were cracked. To find out how many good seashells they found, we subtract the number of cracked seashells from the total number of seashells:

732 - 67 = 665 good seashells

So, the final numerical answer is 665."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Avery needs 3 pieces per place setting.
2. She's having 12 people, so she needs 12 place settings.
3. Each place setting includes:
   - 1 dinner plate
   - 1 salad plate
   - 1 bowl
4. The cost of each item:
   - Dinner plate: $6.00
   - Salad plate: $4.00
   - Bowl: $5.00

Now, let's calculate the cost for one place setting:
- Dinner plate: $6.00
- Salad plate: $4.00
- Bowl: $5.00

Total cost for one place setting = $6.00 + $4.00 + $5.00 = $15.00

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, calculate how much feed one pig eats in a day:
   - Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day.
   - So, one pig eats \(4 \times 2 = 8\) pounds of feed per day.

2. Now, calculate how much feed all five pigs eat in a day:
   - Since each pig eats 8 pounds a day, five pigs will eat \(8 \times 5 = 40\) pounds of feed per day.

3. Next, calculate how much feed all five pigs eat in a week:
   - There are 7 days in a week, so five pigs will eat \(40 \times 7 = 280\) pounds of feed in a week.

4. Finally, calculate how much feed is left after a week:
   - Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed.
   - After a week, 280 pounds of feed have been used.
   - So, the remaining feed is \(300 - 280 = 20\) pounds.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 20 pounds."
"First, let's find out how many hot dogs John needs in total. He invited 20 people and each person will eat 2 hot dogs, so:

\[ 20 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ hot dogs/person} = 40 \text{ hot dogs} \]

John already has 4 hot dogs from a previous party, so he needs to buy:

\[ 40 \text{ hot dogs} - 4 \text{ hot dogs} = 36 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Now, we need to find out how many packs of hot dogs he needs to buy. Each pack contains 6 hot dogs, so:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ hot dogs}}{6 \text{ hot dogs/pack}} = 6 \text{ packs} \]

She sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each, so:
\[ 20 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$2/\text{cupcake} = \$40 \]

She sells 40 cookies at $1 each, so:
\[ 40 \text{ cookies} \times \$1/\text{cookie} = \$40 \]

Now, let's add the money she makes from cupcakes and cookies:
\[ \$40 + \$40 = \$80 \]

Next, let's calculate how much money Frances spends on buying trays.

She buys five trays at $4 each, so:
\[ 5 \text{ trays} \times \$4/\text{tray} = \$20 \]

Now, let's find out how much money Frances has left after her expenses:
\[ \$80 - \$20 = \$60 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$60 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Street**: There are 5 children.
2. **Second Street**: Each of the 5 children is joined by another child. So, the number of children becomes \(5 + 5 = 10\).
3. **Third Street**: Each of the 10 children is joined by another 2 children. So, the number of children becomes \(10 + (10 \times 2) = 10 + 20 = 30\).

Now, the original 5 children give up and leave the group. So, we subtract these 5 children from the 30 children.

The final number of children following the truck is \(30 - 5 = 25\).

So, the final numerical answer is 25."
"To find out how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to add up the meals she has already given out and then subtract that number from the total number of meals she was supposed to distribute.

First, let's add up the meals given out:
- Meals given out on Friday: 64
- Meals given out on Saturday: 30
- Meals given out on Sunday: 48

Total meals given out = 64 + 30 + 48

Now, let's calculate the total:
64 + 30 = 94
94 + 48 = 142

So, Mamou has given out 142 meals in total.

Now, we subtract the total meals given out from the total meals she was supposed to distribute:
1,360 - 142 = 1,218

Therefore, the number of meals Mamou has left to distribute is 1,218."
"To solve this, let's convert each type of coin to cents and then add them up.

- A quarter is worth 25 cents.
- A nickel is worth 5 cents.
- A dime is worth 10 cents.

Now, let's calculate the total for each type of coin James found:

- For the quarters: \(25 \text{ cents} \times 1 = 25 \text{ cents}\)
- For the nickels: \(5 \text{ cents} \times 2 = 10 \text{ cents}\)
- For the dimes: \(10 \text{ cents} \times 7 = 70 \text{ cents}\)

Now, let's add these amounts together:

\(25 \text{ cents} + 10 \text{ cents} + 70 \text{ cents} = 105 \text{ cents}\)

So, James has 105 cents."
"To find the total age of all the siblings, we need to add up the ages of all the brothers and sisters.

We know:
- There are 3 sisters, each 16 years old.
- One brother is 12 years old.
- The older brother is twice the age of the 12-year-old brother, so he is 24 years old.

Now, let's calculate the total age:

The total age of the sisters is:
3 sisters * 16 years/sister = 48 years

The total age of the brothers is:
12 years + 24 years = 36 years

Adding the total ages of the sisters and brothers together:
48 years (sisters) + 36 years (brothers) = 84 years

So, the total age of all the siblings is 84 years."
"First, let's calculate the time Charisma spends meditating each day. She meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes at night, so that's 30 minutes per day.

Next, let's calculate the time she spends meditating in 4 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, in 4 weeks there are 4 * 7 = 28 days. So, the total time spent meditating in 4 weeks is 28 days * 30 minutes/day = 840 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time she spends on yoga. She practices yoga 5 days a week, and each session is 1 hour long. So, in one week, she spends 5 days * 1 hour/day = 5 hours on yoga. In 4 weeks, she spends 4 * 5 hours = 20 hours on yoga.

To find the total time spent on meditation and yoga in 4 weeks, we add the time spent on meditation and the time spent on yoga:
840 minutes (meditation) + 20 hours (yoga) = 840 minutes + 20 * 60 minutes = 840 + 1200 = 2040 minutes.

So, the total time spent on meditation/yoga practice in 4 weeks is 2040 minutes."
"To find out the total square feet of the quilt, we need to calculate the square feet from each type of shirt and then add them all together.

For the small shirts:
11 small shirts * 3 square feet per small shirt = 33 square feet

For the medium shirts:
8 medium shirts * 4 square feet per medium shirt = 32 square feet

For the large shirts:
6 large shirts * 6 square feet per large shirt = 36 square feet

Now, we add all the square feet together:
33 square feet (from small shirts) + 32 square feet (from medium shirts) + 36 square feet (from large shirts) = 101 square feet

So, the total square feet of the quilt is 101 square feet."
"First, let's find out how many seeds a large sunflower has. A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since one dozen equals 12, a small sunflower has:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds} \]

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find out how many more seeds that is, we calculate 50% of 36:

\[ 50\% \text{ of } 36 = \frac{50}{100} \times 36 = 0.5 \times 36 = 18 \text{ seeds} \]

So, a large sunflower has:

\[ 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds} \]

Now, to find out the total number of seeds in both a small and a large sunflower, we add the seeds from both:

\[ 36 + 54 = 90 \text{ seeds} \]

So, the total number of sunflower seeds altogether is:

\[ 90 \]"
"First, we need to find out how many pens Timothy has. Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, and George has 18 pens, we can calculate the number of pens Timothy has by multiplying 18 by 3.

\[ \text{Timothy's pens} = 18 \times 3 = 54 \]

Next, we need to find out how many pens Sarah has. Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, so we divide the number of pens Timothy has by 2.

\[ \text{Sarah's pens} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

So, Sarah has 27 pens. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 27 \]"
"First, let's find out how tall Anne is. Since Anne is twice the size of Albert and Albert is 36"" tall, we can calculate Anne's height as follows:

\[ \text{Anne's height} = 2 \times \text{Albert's height} = 2 \times 36 = 72 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we know that Jackie is now 2"" shorter than Anne. So, Jackie's current height is:

\[ \text{Jackie's current height} = \text{Anne's height} - 2 = 72 - 2 = 70 \text{ inches} \]

Jackie grew 3"" over the summer to reach her current height of 70 inches. To find out how tall she was before summer, we subtract the 3 inches she grew from her current height:

\[ \text{Jackie's height before summer} = \text{Jackie's current height} - 3 = 70 - 3 = 67 \text{ inches} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 67 inches."
"First, we need to find out how many bars the company produces in two weeks. Since the company produces 5000 bars in one day, we can calculate the total production for two weeks by multiplying the daily production by the number of days in two weeks.

There are 7 days in a week, so in two weeks, there are:
\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ days} \]

Now, we calculate the total production for two weeks:
\[ 5000 \text{ bars/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 70000 \text{ bars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much money the company will receive for selling these 70000 bars. The company sells each bar for $2, so we multiply the total number of bars by the price per bar:
\[ 70000 \text{ bars} \times 2 \text{ dollars/bar} = 140000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the company will receive $140000 for selling the produced chocolate bars during two weeks."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts with the buy one get one 50% off deal.

The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, he gets the second T-shirt at 50% off.

The price of the second T-shirt is:
\[ 8 \times 0.5 = 4 \]

So, the total cost for the 2 T-shirts is:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes after the 40% discount.

The original price of the shoes is $40. The discount is 40%, so the price Jake pays is:
\[ 40 \times (1 - 0.4) = 40 \times 0.6 = 24 \]

Now, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends:
\[ 12 + 24 = 36 \]

So, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is:
\[ 36 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much money Ryan has after doing his chores for 3 weeks. Since he gets $6 for each week he completes his chores, we multiply $6 by 3:

\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \]

So, Ryan has $18 after 3 weeks of doing his chores.

Next, let's find out how much money Ryan spent on ice cream cones. He bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends, so that's 4 ice cream cones. Each ice cream cone costs $1.25, so we multiply $1.25 by 4:

\[ 1.25 \times 4 = 5 \]

So, Ryan spent $5 on ice cream cones. Now, let's subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from the total money Ryan has:

\[ 18 - 5 = 13 \]

Now, Ryan wants to go to the movies and the tickets cost $6.50 each. To find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one movie ticket:

\[ 13 \div 6.50 = 2 \]

So, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Ellen spent. She bought leggings for $100 and a photo frame for $5. So, we add these amounts together:
\[ 100 + 5 = 105 \]
Ellen spent $105 in total.

Next, let's calculate how much Lani spent. She bought a pair of sunglasses for $30 and two bathrobes at $100 each. So, we add these amounts together:
\[ 30 + (100 \times 2) = 30 + 200 = 230 \]
Lani spent $230 in total.

Now, to find out how much they spent in all, we add Ellen's total spending to Lani's total spending:
\[ 105 + 230 = 335 \]

So, the total amount they spent is $335."
"First, let's calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar of the mixture.

For 1 jar:
- Passion fruit: 2 pounds at $6 per pound
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds at $8 per pound
- Special honey: 2 pounds at $10 per pound

Now, let's calculate the cost of each ingredient:
- Cost of passion fruit = 2 pounds * $6/pound = $12
- Cost of jackfruit = 1.5 pounds * $8/pound = $12
- Cost of honey = 2 pounds * $10/pound = $20

Now, let's add up the total cost for one jar:
- Total cost for one jar = $12 (passion fruit) + $12 (jackfruit) + $20 (honey) = $44

Tim sells each jar for $50. So, the profit for one jar is:
- Profit per jar = Selling price - Cost = $50 - $44 = $6

To find out the profit for 10 jars:
- Total profit for 10 jars = 10 jars * $6/jar = $60

So, the final numerical answer is:
$60"
"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and then add them all together.

1. Quarters: 32 quarters * $0.25 = $8.00
2. Dimes: 95 dimes * $0.10 = $9.50
3. Nickels: 120 nickels * $0.05 = $6.00
4. Pennies: 750 pennies * $0.01 = $7.50

Now, we add all these amounts together:

$8.00 + $9.50 + $6.00 + $7.50 = $31.00

So, the total dollar amount in the jar is $31.00."
"First, let's add up all the expenses Janet has:
- Ice cream: $3.50
- Movie tickets: $7.50 each, so for two tickets it's $7.50 * 2 = $15.00
- Bracelet: $8.50

Now, let's add these amounts together:
$3.50 + $15.00 + $8.50 = $27.00

Janet's parents gave her $40.00. To find out how much she has left, we subtract her total expenses from the money her parents gave her:
$40.00 - $27.00 = $13.00

So, Janet has $13.00 left."
"First, let's figure out how many days Josh works in a week. He is open every day of the week except Sunday and Wednesday. So, he works 7 days - 2 days = 5 days a week.

Next, we need to find out how many cars he services in a week. Since he services 3 cars a day and works 5 days a week, he services 3 cars/day * 5 days/week = 15 cars/week.

Now, we need to find out how much he makes in a week. Since he gets paid $4 per car, he makes 15 cars/week * $4/car = $60/week.

Finally, to find out how much he makes in 2 weeks, we multiply his weekly earnings by 2. So, $60/week * 2 weeks = $120.

The final numerical answer is $120."
"First, let's calculate how many cookies Randy had initially:
- Oatmeal cookies: 9
- Chocolate chip cookies: 4
- Sugar cookies: 5

Total cookies = 9 + 4 + 5 = 18 cookies

Next, Randy ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor:
- Oatmeal cookies: 9 - 1 = 8
- Chocolate chip cookies: 4 - 1 = 3
- Sugar cookies: 5 - 1 = 4

Then, he ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch:
- Oatmeal cookies: 8 - 2 = 6

He gave 2 sugar cookies to his friends:
- Sugar cookies: 4 - 2 = 2

Now, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner:
- Oatmeal cookies: 6 + 4 = 10
- Chocolate chip cookies: 3 + 4 = 7
- Sugar cookies: 2 + 4 = 6

Finally, let's calculate the total number of cookies Randy has now:
Total cookies = 10 + 7 + 6 = 23 cookies

"First, let's find out how many toy soldiers are in each half of Matthew's collection. Since he has 12 unique toy soldiers, half of his collection would be:

\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]

So, he has 6 toy soldiers that he can sell for $5 each and 6 toy soldiers that he can sell for $7 each.

Now, let's calculate the total money he would earn from selling the 6 toy soldiers at $5 each:

\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \]

Next, let's calculate the total money he would earn from selling the other 6 toy soldiers at $7 each:

\[ 6 \times 7 = 42 \]

Now, let's add the two amounts together to find the total money he would earn:

\[ 30 + 42 = 72 \]

So, Matthew would earn $72 if he agrees to the offer."
"First, let's calculate the total number of holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate gets home, he starts filling in 9 holes a day, but the dog continues to dig 6 holes every night. So, the net number of holes filled each day is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/day} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take to fill in all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

To find out how many weeks it takes, we divide the number of days by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes."
"First, we need to find out how many students Butler High School enrolls on average each year. Since Butler High School enrolls an average of 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can calculate this by multiplying the number of students at Norman High School by 3/4.

Number of students at Butler High School = 3/4 * 4000

Let's calculate that:
3/4 * 4000 = 3000

Butler High School enrolls 3000 students on average each year.

Now, to find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we subtract the number of students at Butler High School from the number of students at Norman High School.

Difference = Number of students at Norman High School - Number of students at Butler High School
Difference = 4000 - 3000

Let's calculate that:
Difference = 1000

So, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School.

The final numerical answer is 1000."
"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies the Adams family has made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.

Total cookies made = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies - Rainbow cookies - Oatmeal cookies
Chocolate chip cookies = 7995 - 2595 - 3075

Now let's do the math:
7995 - 2595 = 5400
5400 - 3075 = 2325

So, the Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies.

The final numerical answer is 2325."
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Dr. Grumpus asked for 16 test tubes, but Igor got half as many, which is 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.
- Dr. Grumpus asked for 14 Petri dishes, but Igor got 2 more than that, which is 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.
- Dr. Grumpus asked for 7 beakers, and Igor got the correct number, which is 7 beakers.
- The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench was 29.

Now, let's calculate the total number of items Igor should have placed on the lab bench:

- Test tubes: 8
- Beakers: 7
- Petri dishes: 16

Adding these up: 8 + 7 + 16 = 31

Igor actually placed 29 items on the lab bench. To find out how many beakers he lost, we need to see the difference between the total number of items he should have placed and the total number he actually placed:

31 (should have placed) - 29 (actually placed) = 2

So, Igor lost 2 beakers."
"First, let's find out how many legs there are in total. Since James is putting together 4 tables and each table has 4 legs, we multiply the number of tables by the number of legs per table:

\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 4 \text{ legs/table} = 16 \text{ legs} \]

Next, we need to find out how many screws are needed for all the legs. Since each leg needs 2 screws, we multiply the total number of legs by the number of screws per leg:

\[ 16 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the number of screws needed from the total number of screws he has:

\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

So, James will have 8 screws left over."
"If there are 10 eggs in the first basket, then the second basket has twice as many, which means:

The final numerical answer is 30."
"First, let's find out how much money each person raised.

Alexandra raised $430.

Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so:
Kim = Alexandra + $320
Kim = $430 + $320
Kim = $750

Sarah raised $300.

Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so:
Maryam = Sarah + $400
Maryam = $300 + $400
Maryam = $700

Now, let's add up all the money they raised:
Total = Alexandra + Kim + Sarah + Maryam
Total = $430 + $750 + $300 + $700
Total = $2180

So, the total amount of money they all raised is $2180."
"First, let's figure out how fast Aaron ran. If Aaron ran each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, and Vanessa ran 4 miles, then Aaron ran 4 miles too. Since Aaron took 16 minutes to run 4 miles, we can calculate his speed in miles per minute.

Aaron's speed = Distance / Time
Aaron's speed = 4 miles / 16 minutes
Aaron's speed = 1/4 miles per minute

Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, we can find Vanessa's speed by dividing Aaron's speed by 2.

Vanessa's speed = Aaron's speed / 2
Vanessa's speed = (1/4) miles per minute / 2
Vanessa's speed = 1/8 miles per minute

Now, we know Vanessa ran 4 miles. To find out how long it took her to run 4 miles, we use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Vanessa's time = 4 miles / (1/8 miles per minute)
Vanessa's time = 4 * 8 minutes
Vanessa's time = 32 minutes

So, Vanessa took 32 minutes to complete her part of the race."
"First, we need to find out how much line is needed for the entire dock. Since the caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we multiply the length of the dock by 3:

200 feet of dock * 3 = 600 feet of line needed

Next, we need to find out how much more line is needed by subtracting the line he already has from the total line needed:

600 feet of line needed - 6 feet of line he has = 594 feet of line to buy

So, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"First, let's calculate how much money Tom's restaurant makes in one night.

They get 6 reservations a night.
For each reservation, they order 2 meals and a bottle of wine.
Each meal costs $5, so 2 meals cost $5 * 2 = $10.
The bottle of wine costs $5.

So, the total cost for one reservation is $10 (meals) + $5 (wine) = $15.

Since they get 6 reservations a night, the total cost for one night is $15 * 6 = $90.

Now, they are open 2 days a week, so we need to calculate the total for 2 days.

The total cost for 2 days is $90 * 2 = $180.

So, the final numerical answer is $180."
"First, let's find out the total selling price of all the watermelons. The vendor made a 25% profit on the cost price. The cost price for 50 watermelons is $80.

To find the profit, we calculate 25% of $80:
\[ \text{Profit} = 25\% \times 80 = \frac{25}{100} \times 80 = 0.25 \times 80 = 20 \]

So, the total selling price for all the watermelons is:
\[ \text{Total Selling Price} = \text{Cost Price} + \text{Profit} = 80 + 20 = 100 \]

Now, to find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:
\[ \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{\text{Total Selling Price}}{\text{Number of Watermelons}} = \frac{100}{50} = 2 \]

So, each watermelon was sold for $2."
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. James is now twice as old as his sister Dora.
2. Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so Dora is currently 9 years old.
3. James is twice as old as Dora, so James is 2 * 9 = 18 years old now.
4. James is currently 18 years old, and he is 3 years older than Dora, so James is 3 years older than Dora (18 - 9 = 9 years).

Now, let's find out how old John is now. Since James was 19 when John was 19, John is now 19 + 18 = 37 years old.

Next, we need to find out how old John's youngest son is. The youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old now.

Finally, we need to find out how old John's youngest son will be in 3 years. If the youngest son is currently 5 years old, in 3 years he will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

So, the final numerical answer is 8."
"First, let's find out how many oranges each can peel in one minute. Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in one minute, she can peel 1/3 of an orange. Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in one minute, she can peel 1/4 of an orange.

Now, let's find out how many oranges each can peel in one hour (60 minutes).

For Ana:
\[ \text{Oranges peeled by Ana in 60 minutes} = 60 \times \frac{1}{3} = 20 \text{ oranges} \]

For Jane:
\[ \text{Oranges peeled by Jane in 60 minutes} = 60 \times \frac{1}{4} = 15 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, to find out how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour:
\[ \text{Difference} = 20 - 15 = 5 \text{ oranges} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"First, let's find out how much Mark paid for the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400, and he gets it at 80% off. So, he pays 20% of the original cost.

20% of $400 is calculated as:
\[ 0.20 \times 400 = 80 \]

So, Mark paid $80 for the radiator.

Next, he hires a mechanic to install the radiator. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours. So, the cost for the mechanic is:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic to find the total amount Mark paid:
\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, the total amount Mark paid is $230."
"To solve this, let's use a simple algebraic approach. We know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. Let's say the number of chickens is \(C\) and the number of cows is \(W\).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

We can write these as two equations:
1. \(C + W = 20\)
2. \(2C + 4W = 70\)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[C + 2W = 35\]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \(C + W = 20\)
2. \(C + 2W = 35\)

To find \(C\) and \(W\), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[(C + 2W) - (C + W) = 35 - 20\]
\[C + 2W - C - W = 15\]
\[W = 15\]

Now that we know \(W = 15\), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \(C\):
\[C + 15 = 20\]
\[C = 20 - 15\]
\[C = 5\]

So, there are 5 chickens. Let's check the answer:
- Number of chickens (\(C\)) = 5
- Number of cows (\(W\)) = 15
- Total number of animals = 5 + 15 = 20
- Total number of legs = \(5 \times 2 + 15 \times 4 = 10 + 60 = 70\)

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of chickens is 5.

The final numerical answer is:
5"
"First, we need to find out the total number of slices from the 7 pizzas. Since each pizza is cut into 8 slices, we multiply the number of pizzas by the number of slices per pizza:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we need to share these 56 slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends, which makes a total of 4 people. So, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

So, each of them can have 14 slices. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 14 \]"
