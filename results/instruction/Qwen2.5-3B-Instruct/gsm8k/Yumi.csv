"First, let's determine how many eggs Janet has left after eating and baking.

Janet starts with 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and bakes 4 eggs. So, the number of eggs she has left is:

\[ 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 \]

Janet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg. Therefore, the amount she makes every day is:

\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 18 \]"
"To solve this, we need to calculate the amount of white fiber required and then add it to the amount of blue fiber.

Given:
- The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.
- The robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber.

First, calculate the amount of white fiber:
- White fiber = 2 bolts (blue fiber) / 2 = 1 bolt.

Now, add the blue and white fiber together to find the total:
- Total bolts = 2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts.

So, the total number of bolts required is 3."
"First, let's calculate the increase in the value of the house due to the repairs. The original value of the house is $80,000. The repairs increased the value by 150%. To find the increase in value, we calculate 150% of $80,000:

\[ \text{Increase in value} = 80,000 \times \frac{150}{100} = 80,000 \times 1.5 = 120,000 \]

So, the total value of the house after the repairs is:

\[ \text{Total value after repairs} = 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Josh spent $50,000 on repairs, and the house was originally worth $80,000. Therefore, the total cost for Josh to buy and repair the house is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value of the house after repairs:

\[ \text{Profit} = 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 70,000 \]"
"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. **Calculate the total meters run in one sprint:**
   James runs 60 meters in each sprint.

2. **Calculate the total meters run in one week for one sprint:**
   James runs 3 sprints each time he runs, so in one week, he runs:
   \[
   3 \text{ sprints/week} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 180 \text{ meters/week}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total meters run in one week for all sprints:**
   Since he runs 3 sprints each time he runs, and he runs 3 times a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
   \[
   180 \text{ meters/week} \times 3 \text{ times/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week}
   \]

Therefore, the total meters James runs in a week is 540 meters."
"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she gives her flock in the morning and afternoon.

Wendi gives her flock 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. Therefore, the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
\[ 15 + 25 = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Since Wendi has a flock of 20 chickens and she feeds each chicken 3 cups of feed per day, the total amount of feed needed for the entire flock is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed in the final meal, we subtract the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total amount of feed needed for the day:
\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Thus, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:
\[ 20 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of 16 glasses, considering the pricing structure.

1. The first glass costs $5.
2. Every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $5 * 0.60 = $3.

So, for every pair of glasses, the cost is $5 + $3 = $8.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can divide the total number of glasses by 2 to find out how many pairs of glasses he is buying:
\[ \frac{16}{2} = 8 \text{ pairs} \]

Now, we multiply the number of pairs by the cost per pair:
\[ 8 \times 8 = 64 \]

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses.

The final numerical answer is:
64"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Seattle's Sheep**: We are given that Seattle has 20 sheep.
   \[
   \text{Sheep in Seattle} = 20
   \]

2. **Charleston's Sheep**: Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   \[
   \text{Sheep in Charleston} = 4 \times \text{Sheep in Seattle} = 4 \times 20 = 80
   \]

3. **Toulouse's Sheep**: Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   \[
   \text{Sheep in Toulouse} = 2 \times \text{Sheep in Charleston} = 2 \times 80 = 160
   \]

4. **Total Sheep**: To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we add the number of sheep in each city.
   \[
   \text{Total Sheep} = \text{Sheep in Seattle} + \text{Sheep in Charleston} + \text{Sheep in Toulouse} = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260
   \]

Therefore, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is 260."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the time taken for each part of the download.

1. **First 40% of the file:**
   - The file size is 200 GB.
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 0.40 \times 200 = 80 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) minutes.

2. **Windows update installation:**
   - This takes 20 minutes.

3. **Restarting the download:**
   - After the update, Carla has to start the download from the beginning.
   - The remaining 60% of the file is \( 0.60 \times 200 = 120 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 120 GB is \( \frac{120}{2} = 60 \) minutes.

Now, we sum up the time taken for each part:
- Time for the first 40%: 40 minutes
- Time for the update installation: 20 minutes
- Time for the restart and download of the remaining 60%: 60 minutes

Total time = \( 40 + 20 + 60 = 120 \) minutes.

The final numerical answer is 120 minutes."
"To determine how far John is from home at the end of 4 hours, we need to break down his journey into segments and calculate the distance for each segment.

1. **First Segment:**
   - Time: 3 hours
   - Speed: 60 mph
   - Distance: \(3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ mph} = 180 \text{ miles}\)

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Time: 2 hours (in traffic)
   - Speed: 0 mph
   - Distance: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 0 \text{ mph} = 0 \text{ miles}\)

3. **Third Segment:**
   - Time: 0.5 hours
   - Speed: 30 mph
   - Distance: \(0.5 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ miles}\)

4. **Fourth Segment:**
   - Time: 3.5 hours (since 4 hours total - 2 hours traffic - 0.5 hours at 30 mph = 3.5 hours)
   - Speed: 80 mph
   - Distance: \(3.5 \text{ hours} \times 80 \text{ mph} = 280 \text{ miles}\)

Now, we sum up the distances from all segments to find the total distance John has traveled:
- Distance from first segment: 180 miles
- Distance from second segment: 0 miles
- Distance from third segment: 15 miles
- Distance from fourth segment: 280 miles

Total distance traveled: \(180 + 0 + 15 + 280 = 475 \text{ miles}\)

Since John started 180 miles away from home and has traveled 475 miles, the distance he is from home at the end of 4 hours is:
\[ 475 - 180 = 295 \text{ miles} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 295 \]"
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break it down into regular hours and overtime hours.

First, we calculate the earnings for the first 40 hours at the regular rate:
\[ \text{Regular earnings} = 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \]

Next, we calculate the earnings for the 5 overtime hours at the overtime rate, which is 1.2 times the regular rate:
\[ \text{Overtime rate} = 1.2 \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$12/\text{hour} \]
\[ \text{Overtime earnings} = 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

Now, we add the regular earnings and the overtime earnings to get the total earnings for the week:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \]

So, Eliza's earnings for this week are:
\[ \$460 \]"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, let's calculate the number of downloads for each month step by step.

1. **First Month:**
   The number of downloads in the first month is given as 60.

2. **Second Month:**
   The number of downloads in the second month is three times the number of downloads in the first month.
   \[
   \text{Downloads in the second month} = 3 \times 60 = 180
   \]

3. **Third Month:**
   The number of downloads in the third month is 30% less than the number of downloads in the second month.
   \[
   \text{Downloads in the third month} = 180 - (0.30 \times 180) = 180 - 54 = 126
   \]

4. **Total Downloads Over Three Months:**
   To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we sum the downloads from each month.
   \[
   \text{Total downloads} = 60 + 180 + 126 = 366
   \]

The total number of downloads over the three months is 366."
"First, let's calculate the cost for each type of pastry:

1. Donuts: 3 dozen at $68 per dozen
   \[
   3 \times 68 = 204
   \]
   So, the cost for the donuts is $204.

2. Mini cupcakes: 2 dozen at $80 per dozen
   \[
   2 \times 80 = 160
   \]
   So, the cost for the mini cupcakes is $160.

3. Mini cheesecakes: 6 dozen at $55 per dozen
   \[
   6 \times 55 = 330
   \]
   So, the cost for the mini cheesecakes is $330.

Now, let's add up the total cost:
\[
204 + 160 + 330 = 694
\]

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find when it becomes positive.

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:
- Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons.
- Each lemon is sold for $1.5.
- Therefore, the annual revenue from lemons is \(7 \times 1.5 = 10.5\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the annual cost:
- The cost to plant the tree is $90.
- The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.
- Therefore, the total annual cost is \(90 + 3 = 93\) dollars.

Now, we can determine the net profit each year:
- Net profit per year = Annual revenue - Annual cost
- Net profit per year = \(10.5 - 93 = -82.5\) dollars.

Since the net profit is negative every year, Carlos will never start earning money on the lemon tree. He will always incur a loss.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{\text{never}}
\]"
"Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had as \( x \).

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

3. She then sold half of what was left at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]

4. According to the problem, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

Let's solve this equation step by step.

First, simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
\[
\frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
\]
\[
\frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2x}{3} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 = 5
\]
\[
\frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{x}{3} + 1 = 5
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
\frac{2x - x}{3} - 1 = 5
\]
\[
\frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5
\]
Add 1 to both sides:
\[
\frac{x}{3} = 6
\]
Multiply both sides by 3:
\[
x = 18
\]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners. Let's verify this by checking the steps:

1. She sold \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) vacuum cleaners at the green house, leaving her with \( 18 - 6 = 12 \) vacuum cleaners.
2. She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, leaving her with \( 12 - 2 = 10 \) vacuum cleaners.
3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) vacuum cleaners, leaving her with \( 10 - 5 = 5 \) vacuum cleaners.

Since the final number of vacuum cleaners left is indeed 5, the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had is correct. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{18}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we have:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after those who enrolled in contemporary dance have been accounted for:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Now, 25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

The rest of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance. To find out how many students that is, we subtract the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance from the remaining students:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of students in hip-hop dance}}{\text{Total number of students}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.60 \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the entire students that enrolled in hip-hop dance is 60%."
"To determine which purchase plan maximizes profit, we need to calculate the future value of each item based on the given market growth rates.

For the jewelry:
- Current value: $5,000
- Market growth rate: 2.5% or 0.025 in decimal form
- Future value of jewelry = Current value + (Current value * Market growth rate)
- Future value of jewelry = $5,000 + ($5,000 * 0.025) = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125

For the electronic gadgets:
- Current value: $8,000
- Market growth rate: 1.2% or 0.012 in decimal form
- Future value of electronic gadgets = Current value + (Current value * Market growth rate)
- Future value of electronic gadgets = $8,000 + ($8,000 * 0.012) = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096

Now, we calculate the profit for each option:
- Profit from jewelry = Future value of jewelry - Current value of jewelry
- Profit from jewelry = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets = Future value of electronic gadgets - Current value of electronic gadgets
- Profit from electronic gadgets = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Comparing the profits:
- Profit from jewelry: $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets: $96

The merchant would maximize profit by choosing to purchase the jewelry, which would result in a profit of $125."
"To find the total distance covered by each train in the two days, we need to add the distances covered in both directions.

First, the distance covered traveling westward is 80 miles.
Second, the distance covered traveling northward is 150 miles.

Adding these distances together:
\[ 80 \text{ miles} + 150 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles} \]

So, the total distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles."
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from both teaching and coaching separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her annual earnings from teaching:
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual teaching hours = 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year
Annual teaching earnings = 1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35000/year

Next, let's calculate her annual earnings from coaching:
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual coaching hours = 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year
Annual coaching earnings = 750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22500/year

Now, we sum up her annual earnings from both teaching and coaching:
Annual salary = Annual teaching earnings + Annual coaching earnings
Annual salary = $35000/year + $22500/year = $57500/year

The final numerical answer is $57500."
"To determine how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs Claire uses per day.
2. Calculate the number of eggs Claire uses per week.
3. Calculate the number of eggs Claire uses in 4 weeks.
4. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.

Step 1: Claire uses 3 eggs per day.

Step 2: There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Step 3: For 4 weeks:
\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Step 4: There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so:
\[ \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozen} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 7 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

First, let's calculate the total time Marissa has already spent hiking:
- She took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles.
- She took another 1 hour to walk the next 2 miles.
So, the total time spent hiking so far is 1 + 1 = 2 hours.

The total distance of the trail is 12 miles. Therefore, the remaining distance to be covered is:
12 miles - 4 miles - 2 miles = 6 miles.

Let's denote the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles as \( v \) miles per hour. The time taken to walk the remaining 6 miles at this speed is \( \frac{6}{v} \) hours.

The total time for the entire hike will be the sum of the time already spent and the time for the remaining distance:
2 hours + \( \frac{6}{v} \) hours.

Marissa wants her average speed for the entire 12-mile hike to be 4 miles per hour. The average speed is given by the total distance divided by the total time:
\[
\text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ hours} + \frac{6}{v} \text{ hours}} = 4 \text{ miles per hour}.
\]

We can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{12}{2 + \frac{6}{v}} = 4.
\]

To solve for \( v \), we first clear the fraction by multiplying both sides by \( 2 + \frac{6}{v} \):
\[
12 = 4 \left(2 + \frac{6}{v}\right).
\]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[
3 = 2 + \frac{6}{v}.
\]

Subtract 2 from both sides:
\[
1 = \frac{6}{v}.
\]

Now, solve for \( v \) by multiplying both sides by \( v \) and then dividing by 1:
\[
v = 6.
\]

Thus, Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles at a speed of 6 miles per hour to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{6}
\]"
"First, let's determine the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, we calculate:

\[ \text{Water in orange drink} = 10 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ liters} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, we calculate:

\[ \text{Water in pineapple drink} = 15 \times \frac{3}{5} = 9 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we add the water from both drinks before any spillage:

\[ \text{Total water before spillage} = \frac{20}{3} + 9 = \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3} \text{ liters} \]

After spilling one liter of the orange drink, the total volume of the mixture becomes:

\[ \text{Total volume after spillage} = 10 - 1 + 15 = 24 \text{ liters} \]

The total amount of water remains the same, so the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:

\[ \text{Water in remaining mixture} = \frac{47}{3} \text{ liters} \]

To express this as a numerical value:

\[ \frac{47}{3} \approx 15.67 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 15.67 \]"
"To determine how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Raymond's current age.
2. Calculate the age of Raymond when his son was born.
3. Determine how many years ago Raymond's son was born.

First, we know that Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. Since Samantha is now 31 years old, Raymond is currently:
\[ 31 - 6 = 25 \text{ years old} \]

Raymond had a son at the age of 23. Therefore, the age difference between Raymond and his son is:
\[ 25 - 23 = 2 \text{ years} \]

This means Raymond's son was born 2 years ago. Thus, the final answer is:

"To determine the total number of DVDs Billy sold on Tuesday, we can break down the sales by customer group:

- The first 3 customers each bought 1 DVD, so that's 3 DVDs.
- The next 2 customers each bought 2 DVDs, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 DVDs.
- The last 3 customers did not buy any DVDs, so that's 0 DVDs.

Adding these together: 3 + 4 + 0 = 7 DVDs.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 7."
"To determine how many centimeters shorter the candle will be after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, we need to calculate the total burning time and then find out how much the candle melts in that time.

The burning time from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is 4 hours.

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, the total melting over 4 hours is:
\[ 2 \text{ cm/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ cm} \]

Therefore, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"To find the original price of the book, we can set up an equation based on the information given. If the book was bought for $19.50 with a 25% discount, it means Kyle paid 75% of the original price (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \). According to the problem, 75% of \( P \) is $19.50. This can be written as:

\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we need to solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's calculate the value of \( P \).
```python
# Calculation
original_price = 19.50 / 0.75
original_price
```
```output
RuntimeError
```
It seems there was an error in the execution environment. Let me perform the calculation manually:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was \( \$26 \).

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{26}

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered except for the boxes of pizza.

The cost of one chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
The cost of 4 apples is \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Adding these costs together:
\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\] dollars.

Marie paid a total of $50. If we subtract the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples from the total amount paid, we can find out how much she spent on the boxes of pizza:
\[50 - 33 = 17\] dollars.

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, we can determine the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered by dividing the amount spent on pizza by the cost per box:
\[17 \div 8.50 = 2\] boxes.

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza. The final numerical answer is:
\[2\]"
"To find out how much Mishka spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of each type of clothing item and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the cost of the shorts:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts.
- Each pair of shorts costs $16.50.
- Total cost for shorts = 3 pairs * $16.50/pair = $59.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pants:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
- Each pair of pants costs $22.50.
- Total cost for pants = 3 pairs * $22.50/pair = $67.50.

Then, let's calculate the cost of the shoes:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
- Each pair of shoes costs $42.
- Total cost for shoes = 3 pairs * $42/pair = $126.

Finally, we sum up the total cost for all the clothing items:
- Total cost = Cost of shorts + Cost of pants + Cost of shoes
- Total cost = $59.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $253.

So, Mishka spent $253 on all the clothing items."
"To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of servings she will consume and then find out the total cost based on the price per carton.

First, calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will eat in 60 days:
\[ \text{Total servings} = 60 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ serving/day} = 60 \text{ servings} \]

Next, determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need. Since each carton contains 15 servings:
\[ \text{Number of cartons} = \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

Now, calculate the total cost for 4 cartons of ice cream, given that each carton costs $4.00:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 4 \text{ cartons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to calculate the distance from his first stop to his second stop.

Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, so the distance from the start to his first stop is 20 miles.

His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip is 60 miles, the distance to his second stop is:
\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \text{ miles} \]

Now, to find the distance between his first and second stops, we subtract the distance of his first stop from the distance of his second stop:
\[ 45 - 20 = 25 \text{ miles} \]

So, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops."
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

The cost of the first pair of high heels is $33. The cost of the second pair of high heels is twice the cost of the first pair, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ B = 99 + 5 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = 104 \]

So, the cost of the boots is \( 104 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:

104"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen based on the given ratio and total age.

Given:
- The ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11.
- The total age of Darrell and Allen is 162.

Let's denote Darrell's age as \(7x\) and Allen's age as \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The sum of their ages is:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]
\[18x = 162\]
\[x = \frac{162}{18}\]
\[x = 9\]

Now, we can find their current ages:
- Darrell's age: \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\)
- Allen's age: \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\)

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is:
\[109\]"
"To find the average guess, we first need to determine each friend's guess and then calculate the average.

1. The first friend's guess is 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60. So, the second friend's guess is 60 jelly beans.
3. The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, and adding this to 80 gives 100. So, the third friend's guess is 100 jelly beans.

Now, we calculate the average of these guesses:
- The first guess is 80.
- The second guess is 60.
- The third guess is 100.

The sum of the guesses is \(80 + 60 + 100 = 240\).

The average guess is the sum of the guesses divided by the number of guesses, which is 3:
\[
\text{Average guess} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:
80"
"To find out how many hours a week John spends taking care of the dogs, we can follow these steps:

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these as equations:
\[ G + S = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins \( S \) is 40, we can find the number of gold coins \( G \) using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins."

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, Aaron has:

\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \]

jewels.

Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Therefore, Siobhan has:

\[ 25 - 2 = 23 \]

jewels.

The final numerical answer is 23."
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points he scores in the second 20 minutes, we calculate 25% of 4 points and add it to the original 4 points.

25% of 4 points is \( 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \) point.

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) points.

Adding the points from both periods, the total points Mike scored is \( 4 + 5 = 9 \) points.

The final numerical answer is 9."
"To determine how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
2. Determine how many sets of 4 yogurts are needed to meet this number.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the price per set.

Step 1: Number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats:
\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Step 2: Determine how many sets of 4 yogurts are needed.
Since each set contains 4 yogurts, the number of sets needed for 60 yogurts is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total cost.
Each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, so for 15 sets, the total cost is:
\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times 5 \text{ dollars/set} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John makes from selling his lego sets. He has 13 lego sets and sells each for $15.

\[ \text{Total money from lego sets} = 13 \times 15 = 195 \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money John spends on the video games. He buys 8 video games for $20 each.

\[ \text{Total money spent on video games} = 8 \times 20 = 160 \]

Now, we can determine how much money John has left after buying the video games. We know he has $5 left after these purchases.

\[ \text{Money left} = 195 - 160 = 35 \]

Since the problem states that John has $5 left, we can verify that the calculation is consistent with the given information.

Finally, since John did not sell any lego sets after the initial sale, he still has all 13 lego sets.

\[ \text{Number of lego sets John still has} = 13 \]

"To find John's speed, we need to determine the total distance he runs and the total time he spends running.

John runs 60 miles a week over 3 days. The first day he runs 3 hours, and the other two days he runs half as much time as the first day, which is 1.5 hours each day.

So, the total time he runs in a week is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

The total distance he runs in a week is 60 miles.

To find his speed, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour.
   - The skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed.
   - Therefore, her running speed is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) miles per hour.

2. **Determine the time spent running and walking:**
   - Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking.
   - The total time is 6 hours.
   - Time spent running = \(\frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2\) hours.
   - Time spent walking = \(\frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4\) hours.

3. **Calculate the distance traveled while running and walking:**
   - Distance traveled while running = Running speed \(\times\) Time spent running = \(6 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles}\).
   - Distance traveled while walking = Walking speed \(\times\) Time spent walking. We need to find the walking speed.
   - Dana's walking speed is four times her skipping speed.
   - Since her skipping speed is 3 miles per hour, her walking speed is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled while walking = Walking speed \(\times\) Time spent walking = \(12 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 48 \text{ miles}\).

4. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**

"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to calculate how many calories are left in your daily calorie target.

Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories. Therefore, the remaining calories you can consume are:
\[ 2000 - 1800 = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories are in one serving of chips. According to the nutritional info, one serving of chips has 250 calories.

To find out how many servings of chips you can consume with the remaining 200 calories, we divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories/serving}} = 0.8 \text{ servings} \]

Since one serving is 300 grams, we can find out how many grams of chips you can eat by multiplying the number of servings by the grams per serving:

"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Given that each blue tie costs $40 and he spent a total of $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of each red tie. Since red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, the cost of each red tie is:

\[ \text{Cost per red tie} = \text{Cost per blue tie} + 0.5 \times \text{Cost per blue tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60 \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

Finally, the total amount John spent on ties is the sum of the cost of the blue ties and the cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total spent on ties} = \text{Total spent on blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800 \]

The time it takes to travel back is \( \frac{D}{6} \) hours. Since the question only provides the speed for the return trip and does not specify the distance, we cannot determine the exact time for the return trip.

Therefore, the information provided is insufficient to calculate the time it takes for Tom to get back."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes.

Each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound, and he removes 30 comic books.

Total weight of comic books = \( 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \) pounds.

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. So, the remaining weight to be removed from the toys is:

Remaining weight to be removed = 15 pounds - 7.5 pounds = 7.5 pounds.

Each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

Number of toys to be removed = \( \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \).

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

Cost of insurance = 0.10 * $1300
Cost of insurance = $130

Finally, we add the cost of insurance to the total cost before insurance to find the final amount Janet paid:

Total amount paid = Total cost before insurance + Cost of insurance
Total amount paid = $1300 + $130
Total amount paid = $1430

So, the final numerical answer is $1430."
"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of work, we need to consider the two different phases of her pension calculation:

1. For the first 20 years, her pension is a flat $50,000 per year.
2. After 20 years, her pension increases by 5% of the value of the pension each year.

Let's calculate her pension at the end of 20 years:
- Initial pension at year 0: $50,000
- Pension at year 20: $50,000 * (1 + 0.05) = $50,000 * 1.05 = $52,500

Now, we need to calculate her pension at the end of 30 years, which is 10 years after the 20-year mark. Her pension will increase by 5% each year from year 20 to year 30.

Let's calculate the pension at the end of year 30:
- Pension at year 20: $52,500
- Pension at year 21: $52,500 * 1.05
- Pension at year 22: ($52,500 * 1.05) * 1.05
- And so on...

The pension at the end of year 30 can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Pension at year 30} = \text{Pension at year 20} \times (1.05)^{10} \]
\[ \text{Pension at year 30} = 52,500 \times (1.05)^{10} \]

Now, let's calculate \( (1.05)^{10} \):
\[ (1.05)^{10} \approx 1.62889 \]

So,
\[ \text{Pension at year 30} = 52,500 \times 1.62889 \approx 85,714.03 \]

Therefore, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years will be approximately $85,714.03."
"To calculate the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payment into two halves of the year and then sum them up.

First, let's determine the monthly payment for the first half of the year. Since the streaming service charges $140 per month, the total for the first half of the year (6 months) is:
\[ 140 \times 6 = 840 \]

Next, we need to calculate the monthly payment for the second half of the year. The company charges 10% less than the initial amount, so the new monthly charge is:
\[ 140 - (140 \times 0.10) = 140 - 14 = 126 \]
The total for the second half of the year (6 months) is:
\[ 126 \times 6 = 756 \]

Now, we sum the payments from both halves of the year to get the total amount paid by the end of the year:
\[ 840 + 756 = 1596 \]

Therefore, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is:
\[ 1596 \]"
"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to calculate how much gas she has used and how much gas is left in the tank.

Sophia has used 4 gallons of gas to travel 100 miles. This means that the gas consumption rate is 100 miles per 4 gallons, or 25 miles per gallon.

The tank holds 12 gallons of gas. Since she has already used 4 gallons, the remaining gas in the tank is 12 - 4 = 8 gallons.

To find out how many miles she can drive on the remaining 8 gallons of gas, we multiply the remaining gallons by the miles per gallon rate:

\[ 8 \text{ gallons} \times 25 \text{ miles per gallon} = 200 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Sophia can drive 200 miles on a single tank of gas."
"First, let's determine how long Jim spends on TV and reading in one session.

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV. He then reads for half as long as he watches TV, which is:
\[ \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, in one session, he spends:
\[ 2 \text{ hours (TV)} + 1 \text{ hour (reading)} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total time spent on TV and reading in one week is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week} \]

To find out how many hours he spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly total by 4:
\[ 9 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 36 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

- 1 coach for the boys' team

So, for each school, the total number of people sent is:
\[ 5 \text{ (girls' players)} + 5 \text{ (boys' players)} + 1 \text{ (girls' coach)} + 1 \text{ (boys' coach)} = 12 \text{ people} \]

Since there are 4 schools, the total number of people sent by all the schools is:
\[ 4 \text{ (schools)} \times 12 \text{ (people per school)} = 48 \text{ people} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 48 \]"

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the five cell phones without interest:

\[ \text{Total cost without interest} = 5 \times \$150 = \$750 \]

Next, we need to calculate the interest on the total cost. The interest rate is 2% per unit:

\[ \text{Interest per unit} = 2\% \times \$150 = 0.02 \times \$150 = \$3 \]

Since Shiela bought five cell phones, the total interest is:

\[ \text{Total interest} = 5 \times \$3 = \$15 \]

Now, we add the total interest to the total cost without interest to get the total installment cost:

\[ \text{Total installment cost} = \$750 + \$15 = \$765 \]

Shiela will pay this total amount over 3 months, so we divide the total installment cost by 3 to find the monthly payment:

\[ \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{\$765}{3} = \$255 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \text{Monthly payment} = \$255 \]"

"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4 leveled sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level.

Given:
- The top level (level 4) has a square footage of 16.
- Each level below has half the square footage of the level above it.

Let's calculate the square footage for each level:

- Level 4 (top level): 16 square feet.
- Level 3: \(16 \div 2 = 8\) square feet.
- Level 2: \(8 \div 2 = 4\) square feet.
- Level 1: \(4 \div 2 = 2\) square feet.

Now, we have the square footage for each level:
- Level 1: 2 square feet.
- Level 2: 4 square feet.
- Level 3: 8 square feet.
- Level 4: 16 square feet.

To find the average square footage of a level, we sum the square footage of all levels and divide by the number of levels:

"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Sylvie's initial salary, which is $600.
2. Calculate the 10% increase for the first year of the 10% annual increase policy.
3. Apply the 10% increase for each of the next three years.

First, let's calculate the salary after the first year of the 10% increase:

\[ \text{Salary after 1 year} = \text{Initial Salary} + (\text{Initial Salary} \times 10\%) \]
\[ \text{Salary after 1 year} = 600 + (600 \times 0.10) \]
\[ \text{Salary after 1 year} = 600 + 60 \]
\[ \text{Salary after 1 year} = 660 \]

Next, we apply the 10% increase for the second year:

\[ \text{Salary after 2 years} = \text{Salary after 1 year} + (\text{Salary after 1 year} \times 10\%) \]
\[ \text{Salary after 2 years} = 660 + (660 \times 0.10) \]
\[ \text{Salary after 2 years} = 660 + 66 \]
\[ \text{Salary after 2 years} = 726 \]

Then, we apply the 10% increase for the third year:

\[ \text{Salary after 3 years} = \text{Salary after 2 years} + (\text{Salary after 2 years} \times 10\%) \]
\[ \text{Salary after 3 years} = 726 + (726 \times 0.10) \]
\[ \text{Salary after 3 years} = 726 + 72.6 \]
\[ \text{Salary after 3 years} = 798.6 \]

Finally, we apply the 10% increase for the fourth year:

\[ \text{Salary after 4 years} = \text{Salary after 3 years} + (\text{Salary after 3 years} \times 10\%) \]
\[ \text{Salary after 4 years} = 798.6 + (798.6 \times 0.10) \]
\[ \text{Salary after 4 years} = 798.6 + 79.86 \]
\[ \text{Salary after 4 years} = 878.46 \]

Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is $878.46."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Lee's original time:**
   - Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.

2. **Determine the original time for Gerald:**
   - Lee used to be able to run 2 seconds faster than Gerald.
   - Therefore, Gerald's original time was \(38 + 2 = 40\) seconds.

3. **Calculate Gerald's improved speed:**
   - Gerald's speed improved by 10% due to his diet.
   - To find the new time, we need to calculate 10% of Gerald's original time and subtract it from his original time.
   - 10% of 40 seconds is \(0.10 \times 40 = 4\) seconds.
   - Therefore, Gerald's new time is \(40 - 4 = 36\) seconds.

So, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.

Given that 2/5 of the 200 students are boys, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:
\[ \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

Since the total number of students is 200, the number of girls can be calculated by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. According to the problem, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout:
\[ \text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find the number of girls who are not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[ \text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 40 \]"
"To find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we first need to calculate how many hours James slept. Since James slept only 2/3 of what Harry slept, we can calculate the hours James slept as follows:

\[ \text{Hours James slept} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 \]

Let's calculate that:
\[ \text{Hours James slept} = \frac{2 \times 9}{3} = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \]

Now, to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we subtract the hours James slept from the hours Harry slept:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Harry's sleep} - \text{James's sleep} = 9 - 6 = 3 \]

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the volume of tomatoes before cooking:**
   - Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces.
   - The tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked.
   - Therefore, before cooking, the tomatoes must have been twice the volume of the sauce.
   - So, the volume of tomatoes before cooking is \( 32 \times 2 = 64 \) ounces.

2. **Determine the number of tomatoes used:**
   - Each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes.
   - To find out how many 16-ounce cans are needed to get 64 ounces of tomatoes, we divide the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of one can.
   - Number of cans needed = \( \frac{64}{16} = 4 \) cans.
   - Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes used is \( 4 \times 3 = 12 \).

Therefore, Freda used 12 tomatoes.

The final numerical answer is:
12"
"Let's break down the information given:

- There were originally 30 cars on the motorway.
- 5 cars exited the motorway before the traffic jam started, so there were 30 - 5 = 25 cars left.
- In the first 15 minutes, 20 cars drove through the traffic jam.
- After the first 15 minutes, 5 cars exited the motorway, so the number of cars remaining after the first 15 minutes is 25 - 5 = 20 cars.

Now, we need to find out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes. We know that 20 cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes, and there were 20 cars left after the first 15 minutes. Therefore, the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes is the total number of cars that drove through minus the number that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes.

So, the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes is 20 (total that drove through) - 20 (that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes) = 0.

However, this seems incorrect because it implies no cars drove through in the first 15 minutes, which contradicts the information given. Let's re-evaluate:

- Initially, there were 25 cars.
- 20 cars drove through in the first 15 minutes.
- After the first 15 minutes, 5 cars exited, leaving 20 cars.

So, the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes is 20.

The final numerical answer is:
20"
"Mary initially has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so she has a total of \(2 \times 40 = 80\) potted plants. She is giving away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges, which totals to \(1 \times 40 = 40\) potted plants. Therefore, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is \(80 - 40 = 40\).

The final numerical answer is:
40"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. So, the second friend pressed the doorbell \(20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25\) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. So, the third friend pressed the doorbell \(60 + 10 = 70\) times.

Now, let's sum up all the doorbell rings:

- First friend: 20 times
- Second friend: 25 times
- Third friend: 70 times
- Fourth friend: 60 times

Total doorbell rings = \(20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175\)

The final numerical answer is 175."
"To find out how many pages Solo needs to read in total, we first calculate the sum of the pages from all his textbooks:

- Science: 4 pages
- Social Studies: 20 pages
- History: 7 pages
- Geography: 8 pages

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday. Therefore, the remaining pages he needs to read are:

Remaining pages = Total pages - Pages read on Monday
Remaining pages = 39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read, on average, in one day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days left:

Pages per day = Remaining pages / Number of days left
Pages per day = 24 / 4 = 6 pages

So, Solo needs to read, on average, 6 pages per day."
"To determine how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to break down his water consumption by weekdays and weekends.

John drinks water with each meal on weekdays (Monday to Friday):
- Breakfast
- Lunch
- Dinner
- Before bed

That's 4 glasses of water per day on weekdays.

So, for 5 weekdays:
\[ 4 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ glasses} \]

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he drinks a soda with dinner instead of water:
- Dinner

That's 1 glass of water per day on weekends.

So, for 2 weekend days:
\[ 1 \text{ glass/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 2 \text{ glasses} \]

Adding the glasses of water from weekdays and weekends:
\[ 20 \text{ glasses} + 2 \text{ glasses} = 22 \text{ glasses} \]

Therefore, the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is 22."
"To determine how many minutes it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total distance the fog bank needs to cover:**
   The city is 42 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge.

2. **Determine the rate at which the fog bank covers the city:**
   The fog bank covers every 3 miles in 10 minutes.

3. **Calculate the number of 3-mile segments in the 42-mile city:**
   \[
   \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/segment}} = 14 \text{ segments}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total time required to cover all segments:**
   Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each 3-mile segment, the total time for 14 segments is:
   \[
   14 \text{ segments} \times 10 \text{ minutes/segment} = 140 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Therefore, the fog bank will take 140 minutes to cover the whole city."

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner volume of one box and then multiply it by 3.

The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, the inner dimensions of each box are:
- Length: 5 inches - 2 * 1 inch = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - 2 * 1 inch = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - 1 inch = 3 inches

The inner volume of one box is:
\[ \text{Inner Volume of one box} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} = 3 \times 4 \times 3 = 36 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:

"Let's break down the TV watching hours for each day:

- Monday and Tuesday: 1 hour each day, so \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours.
- Wednesday: 30 minutes, which is \(0.5\) hours.
- Thursday: 1 hour for a 1-hour episode and 0.5 hours for a 30-minute episode, so \(1 + 0.5 = 1.5\) hours.
- Friday: 2 hours for two 1-hour episodes, so \(2\) hours.

Now, let's sum up the hours watched from Monday to Friday:
\[2 \text{ (Monday and Tuesday)} + 0.5 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 1.5 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Friday)} = 6 \text{ hours}\]

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. The difference between the total hours watched and the hours calculated from the given information is the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday:
\[7 - 6 = 1 \text{ hour}\]

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is:
\[1 \div 0.5 = 2\]

So, the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday is 2."
"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry meant to bake as \( x \). According to the problem, he actually baked twice as many as he meant to, which is \( 2x \). However, he ended up baking 15 more cookies than he meant to, so the actual number of cookies he baked is \( 2x = x + 15 \).

From the equation \( 2x = x + 15 \), we can solve for \( x \):
\[
2x - x = 15 \implies x = 15
\]
So, Henry meant to bake 15 cookies. But he actually baked \( 2x = 2 \times 15 = 30 \) cookies.

After baking, he drops 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is:
\[
30 - 5 = 25
\]
But the problem states that he now has a total of 110 cookies. This means there must be an additional 85 cookies (110 - 25 = 85) that he must have found or added to his initial count. However, the question is only asking for the number of cookies he baked last year, which we have already determined to be 15.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the speed at which Julia rows the boat. It takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Therefore, her speed is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet per second} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes her to row the entire 64 seconds distance to the shore:

\[ \text{Time to row 64 seconds} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds per 20 feet}} = 4 \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. To find out how much water the boat took on during the 80 feet row, we can set up a proportion:

\[ \text{Water taken on} = \left( \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 80 \text{ feet} = \frac{2 \times 80}{10} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

So, the amount of water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore is:

\[ 16 \text{ liters} \]

Let's confirm this with a final numerical answer:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold:**
   - Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
   - Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
   - Let \( B \) be the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold.
   - Therefore, \( 6B = 1800 \).
   - Solving for \( B \):
     \[
     B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300
     \]
   - So, Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs.

2. **Determine the number of birds in Jamal's photograph:**
   - The maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold (300) is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph.
   - Let \( N \) be the number of birds in Jamal's photograph.
   - Therefore, \( 300 = 50N \).
   - Solving for \( N \):
     \[
     N = \frac{300}{50} = 6
     \]
   - So, there are 6 birds in Jamal's photograph.

3. **Determine the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph:**
   - Since the photograph is of ducks at the zoo, and we know there are 6 birds in the photograph, the number of ducks is the same as the number of birds.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the leftover lumber Sasha has:

- Ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards at $10 each: \(10 \times 10 = $100\)
- Five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at $16 each: \(5 \times 16 = $80\)

The total cost of the leftover lumber is \(100 + 80 = $180\).

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the leftover lumber:

- Ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards at $15 each (assuming the price has increased by 50% from $10 to $15): \(10 \times 15 = $150\)
- Five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at $24 each (assuming the price has increased by 50% from $16 to $24): \(5 \times 24 = $120\)

The total revenue from selling the leftover lumber is \(150 + 120 = $270\).

Finally, the profit Sasha makes is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = 270 - 180 = $90 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the ratio and the total amount used. The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total number of parts in the ratio is 7 + 13 = 20 parts.

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water. To find out how many teaspoons of sugar she used, we need to determine what fraction of the total 120 corresponds to the 7 parts of sugar.

The fraction of the total that is sugar is \(\frac{7}{20}\). Therefore, the number of teaspoons of sugar used is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Number of teaspoons of sugar} = \frac{7}{20} \times 120
\]

Now, let's perform the multiplication:

\[
\frac{7}{20} \times 120 = \frac{7 \times 120}{20} = \frac{840}{20} = 42

1. **Determine Adrien's initial salary:**
   Adrien's initial salary was $40000.

2. **Determine Lylah's initial salary:**
   Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. Let Lylah's initial salary be \( L \). Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   40000 = L + 0.3L = 1.3L
   \]
   Solving for \( L \):
   \[
   L = \frac{40000}{1.3} = 30769.23 \text{ (approximately)}

   An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs.
   \[
   \text{Cost of an orange} = \text{Cost of a watermelon} - 5 = 45 - 5 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost for the items Dillon is buying:**
   - **Watermelons:** 4 watermelons at $45 each.
     \[
     \text{Total cost for watermelons} = 4 \times 45 = 180 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - **Peppers:** 20 peppers at $15 each.
     \[
     \text{Total cost for peppers} = 20 \times 15 = 300 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - **Oranges:** 10 oranges at $40 each.
     \[
     \text{Total cost for oranges} = 10 \times 40 = 400 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total amount of money Dillon will spend:**
   \[
   \text{Total amount} = \text{Total cost for watermelons} + \text{Total cost for peppers} + \text{Total cost for oranges}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total amount} = 180 + 300 + 400 = 880 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is **880 dollars**."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours the hospital sees patients in a day. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can divide the total minutes per day by 60 to get the number of hours.

\[ \text{Total hours per day} = \frac{500 \text{ patients/day} \times 24 \text{ minutes/patient}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = \frac{12000 \text{ minutes/day}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 200 \text{ hours/day} \]

Next, we calculate the revenue generated by the hospital from the doctors' fees. The doctors charge $150 per hour.

\[ \text{Revenue from doctors} = 200 \text{ hours/day} \times \$150/\text{hour} = \$30000/\text{day} \]

Then, we calculate the revenue generated from the patients. The hospital charges $200 per hour.

\[ \text{Revenue from patients} = 200 \text{ hours/day} \times \$200/\text{hour} = \$40000/\text{day} \]

Finally, we calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost to find the profit. Since the cost is not specified, we assume it is zero for this calculation.

\[ \text{Total revenue} = \$30000 + \$40000 = \$70000/\text{day} \]

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Cost} = \$70000 - \$0 = \$70000/\text{day} \]

So, the hospital makes a profit of $70,000 per day."
"Initially, Nissa hires 60 seasonal workers. A third of them quit after children vomit on them, which means \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) elves quit. So, the number of elves remaining is \( 60 - 20 = 40 \).

Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. Therefore, the number of elves left is \( 40 - 10 = 30 \).

The final numerical answer is 30."

"First, let's calculate the number of tickets Pam used:

- Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times, so she used \(2 \times 6 = 12\) tickets for the roller coaster.
- Pam also rode the luge 2 times, so she used \(2 \times 6 = 12\) tickets for the luge.
- Therefore, Pam used a total of \(12 + 12 = 24\) tickets.

Next, let's calculate the number of tickets Fred used:

- Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times, so he used \(4 \times 6 = 24\) tickets for the roller coaster.
- Fred also rode the luge 2 times, so he used \(2 \times 6 = 12\) tickets for the luge.
- Therefore, Fred used a total of \(24 + 12 = 36\) tickets.

Now, let's add the tickets used by Pam and Fred:

- Pam used 24 tickets.
- Fred used 36 tickets.
- Together, they used \(24 + 36 = 60\) tickets.

The final numerical answer is 60."
"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, let's break down the information given:

- On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.
- On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, which is \(6 \times 4 = 24\) miles.
- The total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles.

To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we can subtract the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage:

\[ \text{Miles walked on Wednesday} = \text{Total mileage} - (\text{Miles on Monday} + \text{Miles on Tuesday}) \]

\[ \text{Miles walked on Wednesday} = 41 - (4 + 24) \]

\[ \text{Miles walked on Wednesday} = 41 - 28 \]

\[ \text{Miles walked on Wednesday} = 13 \]

So, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday."

"First, let's determine how many video games Brian has after losing 5 of them. Brian originally has 20 video games, but he lost 5, so:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Now, we know that Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian has. Since Brian now has 15 video games, we calculate 3 times that number:

\[ 3 \times 15 = 45 \]

Then, we subtract 5 from this number to find out how many video games Bobby has:

\[ 45 - 5 = 40 \]

So, Bobby has 40 video games. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 40 \]"

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 27 = 9 \]

Next, we know that two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female. Therefore, the number of female Scottish unicorns is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

So, the number of female Scottish unicorns is 6."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the subs:
\[ 2 \text{ subs} \times \$7.50 \text{ per sub} = \$15.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the chips:
\[ 2 \text{ bags of chips} \times \$1.50 \text{ per bag} = \$3.00 \]

Then, let's calculate the cost of the cookies:
\[ 2 \text{ cookies} \times \$1.00 \text{ per cookie} = \$2.00 \]

Now, let's add up the cost of the subs, chips, and cookies:
\[ \$15.00 + \$3.00 + \$2.00 = \$20.00 \]

Next, we need to add the 20% delivery fee. To find the delivery fee, we calculate 20% of the subtotal:
\[ 20\% \times \$20.00 = 0.20 \times \$20.00 = \$4.00 \]

Adding the delivery fee to the subtotal:
\[ \$20.00 + \$4.00 = \$24.00 \]

Finally, we add the $5.00 tip to the total:
\[ \$24.00 + \$5.00 = \$29.00 \]

So, the total cost of Rory's delivery order is:
\[ \$29.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate how many questions Mark completed on each test based on the time he had to complete them.

For the first test:
- Mark had 8 hours to complete the test.
- He completed 5 questions per hour.
- Therefore, the number of questions he completed on the first test is \(8 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ questions/hour} = 40 \text{ questions}\).
- Since the first test had 75 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete is \(75 - 40 = 35 \text{ questions}\).

For the second test:
- Mark had 6 hours to complete the test.
- He completed 5 questions per hour.
- Therefore, the number of questions he completed on the second test is \(6 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ questions/hour} = 30 \text{ questions}\).
- Since the second test had 100 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete is \(100 - 30 = 70 \text{ questions}\).

Now, let's add the incomplete questions from both tests:
- Incomplete questions from the first test: 35
- Incomplete questions from the second test: 70

- The number of pink gumballs is 22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs.

Let's denote the number of blue gumballs as \( B \) and the number of pink gumballs as \( P \).

Given:
\[ B = 12 \]
\[ P = 4B + 22 \]

Substitute the value of \( B \) into the equation for \( P \):

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine how many semi-automatic cars there are. We know there are 20 cars in total, 12 of which are automatic and 4 are manual. The rest are semi-automatic.

The number of semi-automatic cars is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = \text{Total cars} - \text{Automatic cars} - \text{Manual cars} \]
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 \]

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total cars}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of the cars that are semi-automatic is 20%."
"Let's denote the number of queens as \( Q \), the number of baby bees as \( B \), and the number of worker bees as \( W \).

According to the problem:
1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so \( W = 2B \).
2. There are twice as many baby bees as queens, so \( B = 2Q \).

We also know the total number of bees is 700:
\[ W + B + Q = 700 \]

Substituting \( W = 2B \) and \( B = 2Q \) into the total bees equation:
\[ 2B + B + Q = 700 \]
\[ 3B + Q = 700 \]

Since \( B = 2Q \), we can substitute \( B \) with \( 2Q \) in the equation:
\[ 3(2Q) + Q = 700 \]
\[ 6Q + Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now, we can find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]
\[ W = 2B = 2 \times 200 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is 400."

"First, let's calculate the total cost of nonfood items before tax:

- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

Total cost of nonfood items = $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $15

Next, we calculate the tax on the nonfood items. The tax rate is 10%, so the tax amount is:

Tax amount = 10% of $15 = 0.10 * $15 = $1.50

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of nonfood items to get the final cost:

Final cost of nonfood items = $15 + $1.50 = $16.50

The cost of food items (milk, eggs, light bulbs, cups, and roach traps) is already given without tax, so we don't need to add tax to these. The total cost of food items is:

Total cost of food items = $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $15

Finally, we add the total cost of food items to the final cost of nonfood items to get the overall total cost:

Overall total cost = $15 (food items) + $16.50 (nonfood items) = $31.50

So, the final numerical answer is $31.50."

"To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of harvests John can have in a year.
2. Determine the total number of pineapples harvested based on the number of harvests.

First, since John harvests his pineapples every 3 months, we need to find out how many 3-month periods there are in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so:

\[ \text{Number of harvests in a year} = \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests} \]

Next, we know that John has 100 pineapples per hectare and he has 10 hectares of pineapple field. Therefore, the total number of pineapples per harvest is:

\[ \text{Total pineapples per harvest} = 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} \times 10 \text{ hectares} = 1000 \text{ pineapples} \]

Since John can harvest 4 times in a year, the total number of pineapples he can harvest in a year is:

\[ \text{Total pineapples in a year} = 4 \text{ harvests} \times 1000 \text{ pineapples/harvest} = 4000 \text{ pineapples} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Bees leaving the hive in the first 6 hours:**
   Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.

2. **Bees returning in the next 6 hours:**
   Debra sees \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the 30 bees return, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \) bees.

3. **Bees leaving the hive in the next 6 hours:**
   Debra sees twice as many bees leave as the number that left in the first 6 hours. This is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees.

4. **Bee returns in the last 6 hours:**
   At the end of the first 12 hours, 15 bees have returned. In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left in the first 12 hours return to the hive. The number of bees that left in the first 12 hours is the sum of the bees that left in the first 6 hours and the bees that left in the next 6 hours, which is \( 30 + 60 = 90 \) bees.

Therefore, in the last 6 hours, Debra sees 90 bees return to the hive.

"To find out how many Facebook friends James has, we first need to determine how many friends Dorothy has. We know that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find the number of Dorothy's friends:

\[ \text{Number of Charlie's friends} = 3 \times \text{Number of Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ 12 = 3 \times \text{Number of Dorothy's friends} \]

To find the number of Dorothy's friends, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ \text{Number of Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can determine how many friends James has. We know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Number of James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Number of Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ \text{Number of James's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

So, James has 16 Facebook friends. The final numerical answer is:

Tim's distance in feet:
\[ 2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each to reach home.

Time for Steve to reach home:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

Time for Tim to reach home:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

The winner is Steve, who takes 36 minutes to reach home. The loser is Tim, who takes 40 minutes to reach home. The difference in their waiting times is:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race for 4 minutes. The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly class schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has three 1-hour classes each day. So, the total number of hours he spends on these days is:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ classes/day} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes each day. So, the total number of hours he spends on these days is:
\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ classes/day} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Adding the hours from both sets of days gives the total number of hours he spends on classes each week:

"First, let's convert all the lengths to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll use inches for this problem.

- Each roll is 4 inches long, and Bill bakes 300 rolls. So, the total length of the rolls is:
  \[
  300 \text{ rolls} \times 4 \text{ inches/roll} = 1200 \text{ inches}
  \]

- Each croissant is 6 inches long, and Bill bakes 120 croissants. So, the total length of the croissants is:
  \[
  120 \text{ croissants} \times 6 \text{ inches/croissant} = 720 \text{ inches}
  \]

- Each baguette is 2 feet long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is:
  \[
  2 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 24 \text{ inches}
  \]
  Bill bakes 60 baguettes, so the total length of the baguettes is:
  \[
  60 \text{ baguettes} \times 24 \text{ inches/baguette} = 1440 \text{ inches}
  \]

Now, we add up the total lengths of all the baked goods in inches:
\[
1200 \text{ inches} + 720 \text{ inches} + 1440 \text{ inches} = 3360 \text{ inches}
\]

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[
3360 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 280 \text{ feet}

The cost of the notebooks is:
2 notebooks * $4 per notebook = $8

The cost of the rim of bond paper is:
$20

Now, we add up all the costs:
$6 (pens) + $8 (notebooks) + $20 (bond paper) = $34

So, the total amount Raphael spent is $34."
"Initially, Finn sees 11 tadpoles swimming in the pond. Then, 6 tadpoles come out of hiding, so the number of tadpoles Finn can see increases to 11 + 6 = 17. After that, 2 tadpoles hide under a rock, so the number of tadpoles Finn can see decreases by 2. Therefore, the number of tadpoles Finn can see now is 17 - 2 = 15.

The final numerical answer is 15."
"On Tuesday, the depth of the water is 17 feet + 7 feet = 24 feet.

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of 24 feet, which is (2/3) * 24 = 16 feet.

Therefore, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet."
"First, let's calculate the number of each type of fish caught by Locsin:

- Starfish: Anakin caught 10 starfish, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.
- Sea horses: Anakin caught 6 sea horses, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
- Clownfish: Anakin caught 3 clownfish, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's add up the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin:

- Starfish: 10 (Anakin) + 5 (Locsin) = 15 starfish.
- Sea horses: 6 (Anakin) + 3 (Locsin) = 9 sea horses.
- Clownfish: 3 (Anakin) + 5 (Locsin) = 8 clownfish.

Finally, the total number of fish caught is the sum of the starfish, sea horses, and clownfish:

15 (starfish) + 9 (sea horses) + 8 (clownfish) = 32 fish.

So, the final numerical answer is 32."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the price increase step by step over the 36 months. The price increases by 20% every two months. Let's break it down:

1. **Initial Price**: $20
2. **Price after 2 months**: The price increases by 20% of $20.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 20 + 4 = 24
   \]
3. **Price after 4 months**: The price increases by 20% of $24.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 20\% \times 24 = 0.20 \times 24 = 4.80
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 24 + 4.80 = 28.80
   \]
4. **Price after 6 months**: The price increases by 20% of $28.80.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 20\% \times 28.80 = 0.20 \times 28.80 = 5.76
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 28.80 + 5.76 = 34.56
   \]
5. **Price after 8 months**: The price increases by 20% of $34.56.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 20\% \times 34.56 = 0.20 \times 34.56 = 6.912
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 34.56 + 6.912 = 41.472
   \]
6. **Price after 10 months**: The price increases by 20% of $41.472.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 20\% \times 41.472 = 0.20 \times 41.472 = 8.2944
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 41.472 + 8.2944 = 49.7664
   \]
7. **Price after 12 months**: The price increases by 20% of $49.7664.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 20\% \times 49.7664 = 0.20 \times 49.7664 = 9.95328
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 49.7664 + 9.95328 = 59.71968
   \]

We can see that the price increases by 20% every two months. To generalize this, we can use the formula for compound interest, where the price after \(n\) periods is given by:
\[
P_n = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n
\]
where \(P_0\) is the initial price, \(r\) is the rate of increase per period, and \(n\) is the number of periods.

Here, \(P_0 = 20\), \(r = 0.20\), and \(n = 18\) (since 36 months is 18 periods of 2 months each).

\[
P_{36} = 20 \times (1 + 0.20)^{18}
\]
\[
P_{36} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}
\]

Now, we calculate \((1.20)^{18}\):
\[
(1.20)^{18} \approx 10.488
\]

Thus,
\[
P_{36} = 20 \times 10.488 \approx 209.76
\]

Therefore, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is approximately $209.76."
"First, let's determine the cost of one red car. According to the information given, one red car costs $4.

Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and an action figure costs $5, the cost of 3 action figures is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]
Therefore, the doll costs $15.

Now, we know the cost of one red car is $4, and the doll costs $15. We need to find the total cost of all the toys:
- Red cars: 5 cars at $4 each = \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \)
- Action figures: 3 figures at $5 each = \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \)
- Doll: $15

Adding these together gives the total cost of all the toys:
\[ 20 + 15 + 15 = 50 \]

So, the total value of all the toys is $50."
"First, let's calculate the missed income if Jackie does her taxes herself. She loses 3 hours of freelance work, and she earns $35 per hour from freelance work.

Missed income = 3 hours * $35/hour = $105

Now, we need to determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant instead of doing her taxes herself. The accountant charges $90.

Therefore, the additional money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant is the missed income from doing her taxes herself, which is $105.

Final numerical answer:
105"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the computer accessories Elvira bought:

- Screen: €157
- Keyboard and mouse: €74
- Scanner: €102
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Total cost of accessories = €157 + €74 + €102 + €74 + €102 = €509

Elvira's total budget is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost of the accessories from her budget:

Money left for clothing = €1500 - €509 = €991

So, the final numerical answer is:
€991"
"To determine how many times Sandra has to babysit to make 15 Spanish flans, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs needed to make 15 flans.
2. Determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit to collect the required number of eggs.

First, Sandra needs 3 eggs to make one flan. Therefore, to make 15 flans, she needs:
\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, since Sandra receives 9 eggs each time she babysits, we need to find out how many times she needs to babysit to get 45 eggs. This can be calculated by dividing the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she receives per babysitting session:
\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysittings} \]

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit 5 times to collect the required 45 eggs for making 15 Spanish flans."
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write:
\[ S = 2B \]

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write:
\[ (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \]

Substituting \( S = 2B \) into the equation, we get:
\[ (B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28 \]
\[ B + 2 + 2B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ 3B + 4 = 28 \]

Subtract 4 from both sides:
\[ 3B = 24 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's current age is 8, we can find Seth's current age using \( S = 2B \):
\[ S = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 16 \]"
"If Ethel has $8, then twice the money Ethel has is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars. Jimmy has $2 more than this amount, so Jimmy has \(16 + 2 = 18\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is 18."
"To calculate the total miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to consider his daily walking distance and the fact that he walks 10 miles on weekends.

- From Monday to Friday, he walks 20 miles each day. So, for 5 days, he walks \(20 \times 5 = 100\) miles.
- On Saturday and Sunday, he walks 10 miles each day. So, for 2 days, he walks \(10 \times 2 = 20\) miles.

Adding these together, the total miles he walks in a week is \(100 + 20 = 120\) miles.

The final numerical answer is 120."
"First, let's determine the cost of each item:

- The cost of the hat is $25.
- The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat, so it is \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.
- The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket. The average is calculated as \(\frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50\) dollars.

Now, to find the total cost of each uniform, we add the cost of the hat, the jacket, and the pants:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \]

So, the total cost of each uniform is $150."
"To find the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to calculate the legs from each group of creatures separately and then sum them up.

For the spiders:
\[ 80 \text{ spiders} \times 8 \text{ legs per spider} = 640 \text{ legs} \]

For the insects:
\[ 90 \text{ insects} \times 6 \text{ legs per insect} = 540 \text{ legs} \]

For the rare mutant invertebrates:
\[ 3 \text{ invertebrates} \times 10 \text{ legs per invertebrate} = 30 \text{ legs} \]

Now, we add the legs from each group:
\[ 640 \text{ legs} + 540 \text{ legs} + 30 \text{ legs} = 1210 \text{ legs} \]

So, the total number of legs Jake sees is:
\[ 1210 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

1. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, we can calculate the total age of the four birds:

- Sally Two: 19 years
- Granny Red: 16 years
- Sally Four: 8 years
- Sally Thirtytwo: 8 years

Total age = \(19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 51\) years.

The final numerical answer is 51."
"First, let's calculate the amount Jessica needs to pay each month if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum.

For the student loans:
Minimum payment = $300
50% more than minimum = $300 * 0.50 = $150
Total payment = $300 + $150 = $450

For the credit card:
Minimum payment = $200
50% more than minimum = $200 * 0.50 = $100
Total payment = $200 + $100 = $300

For the mortgage:
Minimum payment = $500
50% more than minimum = $500 * 0.50 = $250
Total payment = $500 + $250 = $750

Now, let's add up the monthly payments:
Total monthly payment = $450 (student loans) + $300 (credit card) + $750 (mortgage) = $1500

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the total monthly payment by 12:
Total annual payment = $1500 * 12 = $18000

The final numerical answer is:
18000"
"To determine how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel and cut each potato and then multiply by the total number of potatoes.

First, let's calculate the time to peel and cut one potato:
- Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
- Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

Convert the time to peel one potato to seconds for easier calculation:
- 1.5 minutes = 1.5 * 60 seconds = 90 seconds

Now, add the time to peel and cut one potato:
- Total time for one potato = 90 seconds (peeling) + 5 seconds (cutting) = 95 seconds

Next, calculate the total time for 60 potatoes:
- Total time for 60 potatoes = 60 * 95 seconds

Perform the multiplication:
- 60 * 95 = 5700 seconds

Finally, convert the total time back to minutes:
- 5700 seconds = 5700 / 60 minutes = 95 minutes

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes."
"First, let's determine the total revenue from selling lemonade. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, so the revenue per gallon is:
\[ 20 \text{ glasses/gallon} \times \$0.50/\text{glass} = \$10/\text{gallon} \]

Given that their profit is $25, we can use the profit formula to find the total cost. The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. Let's denote the total cost as \( C \). The total revenue is \( 10 \) dollars per gallon, and they made a profit of \( 25 \) dollars. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} \]
\[ 25 = 10 - C \]
\[ C = 10 - 25 \]
\[ C = -15 \]

This negative value indicates an error in the interpretation. Let's re-evaluate the problem. The total cost \( C \) includes the cost of lemons and sugar. The cost of lemons and sugar per gallon is:
\[ \text{Cost of lemons and sugar per gallon} = \$3 + \$2 = \$5 \]

The profit equation should be:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} \]
\[ 25 = 10 - (5 + \text{Cost of lemons}) \]
\[ 25 = 10 - 5 - \text{Cost of lemons} \]
\[ 25 = 5 - \text{Cost of lemons} \]
\[ \text{Cost of lemons} = 5 - 25 \]
\[ \text{Cost of lemons} = -20 \]

This negative value indicates an error in the interpretation again. Let's correct it by solving for the cost of lemons directly. The total cost \( C \) is the sum of the cost of lemons and sugar:
\[ C = 5 + \text{Cost of lemons} \]
\[ 25 = 10 - C \]
\[ 25 = 10 - (5 + \text{Cost of lemons}) \]
\[ 25 = 10 - 5 - \text{Cost of lemons} \]
\[ 25 = 5 - \text{Cost of lemons} \]
\[ \text{Cost of lemons} = 5 - 25 \]
\[ \text{Cost of lemons} = -20 \]

This indicates an error in the problem setup. Let's re-evaluate the problem correctly:
\[ 25 = 10 - (5 + \text{Cost of lemons}) \]
\[ 25 = 10 - 5 - \text{Cost of lemons} \]
\[ 25 = 5 - \text{Cost of lemons} \]
\[ \text{Cost of lemons} = 5 - 25 \]
\[ \text{Cost of lemons} = -20 \]

The correct interpretation should be:
\[ 25 = 10 - (5 + \text{Cost of lemons}) \]
\[ 25 = 10 - 5 - \text{Cost of lemons} \]
\[ 25 = 5 - \text{Cost of lemons} \]
\[ \text{Cost of lemons} = 5 - 25 \]
\[ \text{Cost of lemons} = -20 \]

"To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we first need to determine the total number of Chinese participants. Given that there are 240 Asians in total and 80 of them are Japanese, the rest must be Chinese.

Total number of Asians = 240
Number of Japanese = 80

Number of Chinese = Total number of Asians - Number of Japanese
Number of Chinese = 240 - 80
Number of Chinese = 160

We know that the total number of participants on the Chinese team is 160, and the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Number of girls = Total number of Chinese - Number of boys
Number of girls = 160 - 60
Number of girls = 100

The final numerical answer is 100."
"First, let's calculate how much Zaid spends on rent, car fuel, and the remaining amount after these expenses.

Zaid's monthly salary is 6000$.

1. Rent: \( \frac{1}{4} \) of his salary
\[ \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \]

2. Car fuel: \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his salary
\[ \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \]

3. Total spent on rent and car fuel
\[ \text{Total spent} = 1500 + 2000 = 3500 \]

4. Remaining amount after rent and car fuel
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 6000 - 3500 = 2500 \]

5. Donation to charity: half of the remaining amount
\[ \text{Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \]

6. Remaining amount after donation
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \]

7. Expenses for his daughter and wife
\[ \text{Expenses for daughter} = 200 \]
\[ \text{Expenses for wife} = 700 \]
\[ \text{Total expenses} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

8. Remaining amount after expenses for daughter and wife
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 1250 - 900 = 350 \]

So, the final amount of money Zaid will still have after all these expenses and donations is 350$."
"First, let's determine the number of crabs each person has:

1. Bo has 40 crabs.
2. Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has \(40 - 4 = 36\) crabs.
3. Rani has ten more crabs than Monic, so Rani has \(36 + 10 = 46\) crabs.

Now, let's calculate the total number of crabs the three have together:

\[
\text{Total crabs} = \text{Bo's crabs} + \text{Monic's crabs} + \text{Rani's crabs} = 40 + 36 + 46

"To find the number of votes the loser got, we first need to determine the number of votes the winner received.

The winner got \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the votes. Given that the total number of votes cast was 80, we can calculate the number of votes the winner received as follows:

\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80
\]

\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = 60
\]

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser received is the total number of votes minus the number of votes the winner received:

\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60
\]

\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 20
\]

So, the number of votes the loser got is 20."
"Let's denote the number of white carnations Sandra ordered as \( w \).

From the information given:
1. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, so the number of red roses is \( 4w \).
2. Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which are five times the number of white carnations, so \( 5w = 200 \).

First, we solve for \( w \) using the equation \( 5w = 200 \):
\[ w = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Now that we know \( w = 40 \), we can find the number of red roses:
\[ \text{Number of red roses} = 4w = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find Jean's age, let's break down the information given:

1. Jan's current age is 30.
2. Two years ago, Mark's age was 5 years less than half of Jan's age at that time.

First, let's calculate Jan's age two years ago:
\[ \text{Jan's age two years ago} = 30 - 2 = 28 \]

Next, we calculate half of Jan's age two years ago:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 28 = 14 \]

According to the problem, two years ago Mark's age was 5 years less than this value:
\[ \text{Mark's age two years ago} = 14 - 5 = 9 \]

Now, we need to find Mark's current age:
\[ \text{Mark's current age} = 9 + 2 = 11 \]

Jean is two years older than Mark:
\[ \text{Jean's current age} = 11 + 2 = 13 \]

So, Jean is 13 years old.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total time for the faster team to complete the race. Since each member of the faster team runs their leg in 55 seconds, the total time for the race is:

\[ 55 \text{ seconds/runner} \times 4 \text{ runners} = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time for the slower team to complete the race. The first runner takes 60 seconds, the second runner takes 57 seconds (3 seconds faster than the first), the third runner takes 54 seconds (3 seconds faster than the second), and the fourth runner takes 51 seconds (3 seconds faster than the third). The total time for the race is:

\[ 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, to find out how many seconds the faster team will win by, we subtract the total time of the faster team from the total time of the slower team:

\[ 222 \text{ seconds} - 220 \text{ seconds} = 2 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then compare them.

First, let's determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

\[ P(\text{number greater than 3}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Next, let's determine the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:

\[ P(\text{even on first roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll, given that the first roll was even, is also:

\[ P(\text{even on second roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of both events happening (rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll) is:

\[ P(\text{even on first and second roll}) = P(\text{even on first roll}) \times P(\text{even on second roll}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25 \]

Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by calculating the difference in probabilities and then converting that difference to a percentage.

\[ \text{Difference in probabilities} = P(\text{number greater than 3}) - P(\text{even on first and second roll}) = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 \]

To express this difference as a percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage difference} = 0.25 \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, it is 25% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

The final numerical answer is:

The final numerical answer is 30."
"Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as \( r \).

From the information given:
- There are 3 cages of rats, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is \( 3r \times 6 = 18r \).
- There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \).
- There are 20 pieces of straw distributed among the rabbits.

The total number of pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents is the sum of the pieces of straw given to the rats, the hamsters, and the rabbits. According to the problem, this total is 160 pieces of straw. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 18r + 50 + 20 = 160 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 18r + 70 = 160 \]
\[ 18r = 160 - 70 \]
\[ 18r = 90 \]
\[ r = \frac{90}{18} \]
\[ r = 5 \]

So, the number of rats in each cage is \( 5 \).

"To calculate the amount Mandy should give Benedict after 3 months, we need to consider the initial amount and the monthly interest.

The initial amount Mandy owes is $100. The monthly interest rate is 2%, which can be expressed as a decimal: 0.02.

The interest for the first month is:
\[ 100 \times 0.02 = 2 \]

So, after the first month, the total amount Mandy owes is:
\[ 100 + 2 = 102 \]

For the second month, the interest is:
\[ 102 \times 0.02 = 2.04 \]

So, after the second month, the total amount Mandy owes is:
\[ 102 + 2.04 = 104.04 \]

For the third month, the interest is:
\[ 104.04 \times 0.02 = 2.0808 \]

So, after the third month, the total amount Mandy owes is:
\[ 104.04 + 2.0808 = 106.1208 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent (since currency is typically expressed to two decimal places), Mandy should give Benedict $106.12.

The final numerical answer is:

The selling price per bag is:
\[ \text{Selling price per bag} = \$30 \]

The total cost for \( n \) bags is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = n \times \$22 \]

The total revenue from selling \( n \) bags is:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = n \times \$30 \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} \]
\[ \$400 = n \times \$30 - n \times \$22 \]
\[ \$400 = n \times (\$30 - \$22) \]
\[ \$400 = n \times \$8 \]
\[ n = \frac{\$400}{\$8} \]
\[ n = 50 \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food:

- The cost of the tickets is $20.25.
- The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, so it is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

Now, let's add the cost of the tickets and the cost of the food to find the total cost of the tickets and food:

- Total cost of tickets and food = $20.25 + $15.75 = $36.00.

Next, let's calculate the total cost including the rides:

- The cost of the rides is $33 for each ride, and they went on 2 rides, so the total cost for the rides is $33 * 2 = $66.00.

Now, let's add the cost of the rides to the total cost of the tickets and food to find the overall total cost:

- Overall total cost = $36.00 + $66.00 = $102.00.

Since they agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the overall total cost by 3:

- Each person's share = $102.00 / 3 = $34.00.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ten ducks need per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of insects needed per day for one duck.
2. Multiply the daily amount needed for one duck by the number of ducks in the flock.

First, we know that the total amount of insects needed per week for one duck is 3.5 pounds. There are 7 days in a week, so the amount of insects needed per day for one duck is:
\[ \frac{3.5 \text{ pounds}}{7 \text{ days}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per day} \]

Now, for a flock of ten ducks, the total amount of insects needed per day is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.

2. **Trees planted each year**: Tom plants 10 trees each year.
3. **Trees chopped down each year**: Tom chops down 2 trees each year.
4. **Net increase in trees each year**: The net increase in trees each year is \(10 - 2 = 8\) trees.
5. **Number of years**: We are considering 10 years.

First, calculate the total number of trees after 10 years without considering the trees that die:

\[ \text{Total trees after 10 years} = \text{Initial trees} + (\text{Net increase per year} \times \text{Number of years}) \]
\[ \text{Total trees after 10 years} = 50 + (8 \times 10) \]
\[ \text{Total trees after 10 years} = 50 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total trees after 10 years} = 130 \]

Next, 30% of the trees die after 10 years:

\[ \text{Number of trees that die} = 0.30 \times 130 \]
\[ \text{Number of trees that die} = 39 \]

Finally, calculate the number of trees left after the trees die:

\[ \text{Number of trees left} = \text{Total trees after 10 years} - \text{Number of trees that die} \]
\[ \text{Number of trees left} = 130 - 39 \]
\[ \text{Number of trees left} = 91 \]

So, the final number of trees Tom has left after 10 years is 91."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of pink flamingos:** 18

2. **On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos and painted them white:**

   - So, 6 pink flamingos were taken back and painted white.

3. **After the neighbors took back and painted 6 flamingos:**
   - The number of pink flamingos left is \( 18 - 6 = 12 \)
   - The number of white flamingos added is 6

4. **On Sunday morning, they added another 18 pink flamingos:**
   - The total number of pink flamingos now is \( 12 + 18 = 30 \)

"First, let's determine how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher each week. Since he edits an equal number of sentences each week for both publishers and a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B.

Next, we know that Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, the amount Mark earns from Publisher A each week is:
\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays Mark:
\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10 \text{ cents/sentence} \]
Therefore, the amount Mark earns from Publisher B each week is:
\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

To find out how much Mark makes in a week in total, we add the amounts from both publishers:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total Sum of Six Tests}}{6} = 93 \]
\[ \text{Total Sum of Six Tests} = 93 \times 6 = 558 \]

Now, we can find the score required on the sixth test by subtracting the sum of the first five test scores from the total sum needed:
\[ \text{Score Needed on Sixth Test} = 558 - 440 = 118 \]

Therefore, Brinley needs a score of 118 on her sixth test to get an average of 93.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 118 \]"
"To calculate the total kilometers Micheal rode, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first four weeks and the next three weeks.

**First four weeks:**
- Micheal rode at least 5 times a week.
- Each time he rode, he covered 25 kilometers.
- Therefore, in one week, he rode \(5 \times 25 = 125\) kilometers.
- Over four weeks, he rode \(4 \times 125 = 500\) kilometers.

**Next three weeks:**
- Micheal decided to ride 2 times a week.
- Each time he rode, he covered 60 kilometers.
- Therefore, in one week, he rode \(2 \times 60 = 120\) kilometers.
- Over three weeks, he rode \(3 \times 120 = 360\) kilometers.

**Total kilometers:**
- Adding the kilometers from the first four weeks and the next three weeks, we get \(500 + 360 = 860\) kilometers.

The total kilometers Micheal rode is 860 kilometers."
"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we first need to determine the weight of each type of candy and then sum them up.

Given:
- Each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams.
- Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple.

First, let's find the weight of each candied apple:
\[ \text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{\text{Weight of each chocolate bar}}{2} = \frac{40 \text{ grams}}{2} = 20 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars:
\[ \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 \text{ grams} = 1000 \text{ grams} \]

Then, we calculate the total weight of the candied apples:
\[ \text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20 \text{ grams} = 1600 \text{ grams} \]

Finally, we sum the total weights of the chocolate bars and the candied apples to get the total weight of the bag of candy:
\[ \text{Total weight of the bag of candy} = 1000 \text{ grams} + 1600 \text{ grams} = 2600 \text{ grams} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 2600 \]"
"To find out how many cakes Rose bought in total after three days, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Monday**: Rose bought 4 cakes.
2. **Tuesday**: She bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. So, she bought \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes.
3. **Wednesday**: She bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. So, she bought \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

Now, we sum up the cakes bought over the three days:
- Monday: 4 cakes
- Tuesday: 12 cakes
- Wednesday: 60 cakes

Total cakes bought = \(4 + 12 + 60 = 76\)

The final numerical answer is 76."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates:

Half a dozen plates = 6 plates
Cost per plate = $6000
Total cost for half a dozen plates = 6 * $6000 = $36000

Now, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates, which is $36000. So, the cost of twenty dozen cups is:

Cost of twenty dozen cups = $36000 - $1200 = $34800

Now, we need to find the cost of each cup. Since there are twenty dozen cups, we need to calculate the cost of one dozen cups and then one cup.

Twenty dozen cups = 20 * 12 = 240 cups

Cost of each cup = $34800 / 240 = $145

So, the total cost of buying each cup is $145."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate how much money Sara earns from babysitting:
- She babysits 4 times, earning $5 each time, so she earns \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars from babysitting.

Now, let's calculate how much money Sara earns from mowing the lawn:
- She earns $4 each time she mows the lawn.

Let's denote the number of times Sara needs to mow the lawn as \(x\). The total amount of money Sara will have after mowing the lawn is her initial savings plus the money she earns from babysitting plus the money she earns from mowing the lawn. This can be expressed as:
\[10 + 20 + 4x\]

We need this total to be at least equal to the cost of the jacket and shoes, which is $70. So, we set up the inequality:
\[10 + 20 + 4x \geq 70\]

Simplifying the left side of the inequality:
\[30 + 4x \geq 70\]

Subtract 30 from both sides:
\[4x \geq 40\]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[x \geq 10\]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn at least 10 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes. The final numerical answer is:
\[10\]"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \). According to the problem, the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day. Additionally, it is given that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which can be expressed as:

\[ w = r + 2 \]

The total number of eggs collected each day can be expressed as:

\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Now, substitute \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation:

\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 8r = 32 \]

Divide both sides by 8:

\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens. To verify, we can calculate the number of white chickens and the total eggs collected:

\[ w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \]

The total number of eggs collected per day:

\[ 3r + 5w = 3(4) + 5(6) = 12 + 30 = 42 \]

The calculations confirm that the solution is correct. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park, as that's the distance he walks. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park are 1.5 miles by 6 miles, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (1.5 + 6) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we divide the total distance by his walking speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park."
"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of customers on the second day.
2. Calculate the total number of customers over the three days.
3. Find the number of customers on the third day by subtracting the total number of customers on the first and second days from the total number of customers over the three days.

First, we know that on the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than on the first day. Therefore, the number of customers on the second day is:
\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \]

Next, we know the total number of customers over the three days is 500. To find the number of customers on the third day, we subtract the number of customers on the first and second days from the total number of customers over the three days:
\[ 500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250 \]

So, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is:
\[ 250 \]"
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons.

From the information given, we know that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Since the pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons. According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
Simplifying this equation, we get:
\[ B + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ B = 2S + 16 \]

Now, we know that the current amount of water in the big pool is four times the current amount of water in the small pool. So, we can write the equation:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have two equations:
1. \( B = 2S + 16 \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

We can set these two equations equal to each other since they both equal \( B \):
\[ 2S + 16 = 4S \]
Solving for \( S \), we get:
\[ 16 = 2S \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool currently has 8 gallons of water. Let's verify this by finding the amount of water in the big pool. If \( S = 8 \), then:
\[ B = 4S = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( 8 + 16 = 24 \) gallons and the big pool had \( 32 + 16 = 48 \) gallons. Indeed, 48 is twice 24, which confirms our solution is correct.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to make her purchase, we first need to calculate the total cost of the pair of shoes and the matching belt.

Total cost = Cost of shoes + Cost of belt
Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00
Total cost = $352.00

Lori earns $8.00 per hour. To find out how many hours she needs to work, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage.

Hours needed = Total cost / Hourly wage
Hours needed = $352.00 / $8.00
Hours needed = 44

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She promised to return the original $2000 plus an additional 10% of that amount.

The additional amount is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she promised to return is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Janeth is paying $165 per month for 12 months. The total amount she will pay over 12 months is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she promised to return to find her remaining balance:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance by the end of 12 months will be:
\[ 220 \]"

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Harriet's current age:**
   Harriet is currently 21 years old.

2. **Determine Adrian's current age:**
   Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age.
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. **Determine Zack's current age:**
   Harriet is half the age of Zack.
   \[
   \text{Harriet's age} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Zack's age} \implies 21 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Zack's age} \implies \text{Zack's age} = 21 \times 2 = 42 \text{ years old}

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna, and then subtract the points scored by Naomi and Yuri from the total points.

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. So, Yuri's score is:
   \[
   \text{Yuri's score} = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44
   \]
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna's score is:
   \[
   \text{Brianna's score} = 68 + 17 = 85
   \]

Now, we add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[
\text{Total points by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna} = 68 + 44 + 85 = 197
\]

The total points scored by all four students is 251. Therefore, Jojo's score is:

"Initially, the tank has 120 liters of water. Celine used 90 liters, so the amount of water left in the tank is:

\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters} \]

Celine then collected rainwater that is twice the amount left in the tank. Since there are 30 liters left, the amount of rainwater collected is:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters} \]

Adding the collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank gives:

\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final amount of water in the tank is:

\[ 90 \text{ liters} \]"

"First, let's calculate the total number of cards James has after the changes:

- Initial fire type cards: 30
- Initial grass type cards: 20
- Initial water type cards: 40

After losing 8 water type cards:
- Water type cards left: 40 - 8 = 32

After buying 14 new grass type cards:
- Grass type cards now: 20 + 14 = 34

Now, the total number of cards James has is:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 34
- Water type: 32

So, the total number of cards is:
30 + 34 + 32 = 96

The number of water type cards left is 32. To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage chance} = 33.33\% \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33%.

"First, let's calculate the number of students who went out through exit A. Since 30% of the students went out through exit A, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Students through exit A} = 1000 \times \frac{30}{100} = 300 \]

After students went through exit A, the remaining number of students is:

\[ \text{Remaining students} = 1000 - 300 = 700 \]

Next, we calculate the number of students who went out through exit B. According to the problem, 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B:

\[ \text{Students through exit B} = 700 \times \frac{3}{5} = 420 \]

The number of students who went out through exit C is the rest of the students after those who went through exits A and B. So, we subtract the number of students who went through exits A and B from the total number of students:

\[ \text{Students through exit C} = 1000 - 300 - 420 = 280 \]

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is:

\[ 280 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's start by determining how many candies Robert has. We know that John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find out how many candies Robert has:

\[ \text{John's candies} = 2 \times \text{Robert's candies} \]
\[ 54 = 2 \times \text{Robert's candies} \]
\[ \text{Robert's candies} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Now that we know Robert has 27 candies, we can find out how many candies James has. We know that James has 6 more candies than Robert:

\[ \text{James's candies} = \text{Robert's candies} + 6 \]
\[ \text{James's candies} = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Next, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's candies} - \text{James's candies} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

So, John has 21 more candies than James. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 21 \]"
"Dolly has 2 books and reads them all. She also reads Pandora's book, so she reads 2 + 1 = 3 books in total. Pandora has 1 book and reads it all, and she also reads Dolly's book, so she reads 1 + 1 = 2 books in total. Together, Dolly and Pandora read 3 + 2 = 5 books by the end.

"First, let's determine the number of pen pals Mike has left after stopping being pen pals with 2 of them. Initially, he had 5 pen pals, so after stopping being pen pals with 2, he has:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals left} \]

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each pen pal sends:

\[ 2 \text{ letters/week} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 10 \text{ pages/week} \]

Since there are 3 pen pals, the total number of pages sent by all pen pals in a week is:

\[ 3 \text{ pen pals} \times 10 \text{ pages/pen pal/week} = 30 \text{ pages/week} \]

Mike responds in kind, so he also writes 30 pages a week. He can write a page every 6 minutes, so the total time he spends writing in minutes is:

\[ 30 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 180 \text{ minutes/week} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 3 \text{ hours/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"To determine how many minutes Jason has left on his phone plan, we need to calculate the total minutes he has used and subtract that from his plan's total minutes.

First, calculate the total minutes Jason has used:
- Jason uses 15 minutes per day for his boss.
- There are 30 days in the month.

So, the total minutes used for his boss calls is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Additionally, Jason has used 300 extra minutes for other people.

Therefore, the total minutes used in the month is:
\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Jason's phone plan allows for 1000 minutes per month. To find out how many minutes he has left, subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes allowed:
\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the number of minutes Jason has left is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin initially had 24 fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin had \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Now Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, so Colby took \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. Now Griffin has \(9 - 2 = 7\) fries left.
5. After receiving fries from Ginger, Griffin had 27 fries. So, the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin is \(27 - 7 = 20\).

Therefore, the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin is 20."
"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( F \).

Given:
- There are 4 snails in the first aquarium.
- There are 32 snails in the second aquarium.
- The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in both aquariums.
- Both aquariums have the same number of fish.

First, calculate the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums:
\[ 32 - 4 = 28 \]

According to the problem, this difference is twice the number of fish in both aquariums:
\[ 28 = 2 \times (2F) \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]

Now, solve for \( F \):
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ F = 7 \]

Therefore, the number of fish in each aquarium is 7.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist works for the movie:

- She works 6 hours each day.
- She needs the makeup done 4 times a week.
- The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.

Total hours worked = 6 hours/day * 4 days/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours.

Next, let's calculate the total cost before the discount:

- The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.
- She worked 120 hours.

Total cost before discount = 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000.

Now, let's calculate the discount:

- She gives a 10% discount.

Discount amount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.10 * $30,000 = $3,000.

Finally, let's calculate the total cost after the discount:

Total cost after discount = Total cost before discount - Discount amount = $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000.

So, Jean paid $27,000."

"First, let's determine how many cookies Sue's sister ate each day.

On Monday, her sister ate 5 cookies.

On Tuesday, her sister ate 13 cookies.

Next, we calculate the number of cookies Sue ate each day based on the information given.

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cookies} \]

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister:
\[ 2 \times 13 = 26 \text{ cookies} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of cookies Sue ate over the two days:
\[ 20 + 26 = 46 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of cookies her sister ate over the two days:
\[ 5 + 13 = 18 \text{ cookies} \]

Each cookie has 200 calories. Therefore, we calculate the total calories consumed by Sue and her sister.

Total calories consumed by Sue:
\[ 46 \times 200 = 9200 \text{ calories} \]

Total calories consumed by her sister:
\[ 18 \times 200 = 3600 \text{ calories} \]

"First, let's determine the total number of students in the school. Since each class has 20 students and there are 3 classes, the total number of students is:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

Given that the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the number of boys and girls in the school is:

\[ \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

For the first class, there are 15 girls, so the number of boys in the first class is:

\[ 20 - 15 = 5 \]

For the second class, there are 12 girls, so the number of boys in the second class is:

\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \]

Now, we need to find the number of boys in the third class. The total number of boys in the school is 30, and we already know the number of boys in the first and second classes. Therefore, the number of boys in the third class is:

\[ 30 - (5 + 8) = 30 - 13 = 17 \]

So, the number of boys in the third class is 17."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Previous Night's Kill:**
   - Wolves: 10
   - Cougars: 15

2. **Today's Kill:**
   - Let the number of cougars killed today be \( c \).
   - According to the problem, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, so the number of wolves killed today is \( 3c \).
   - Also, Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, so the number of cougars killed today is \( 15 - 3 = 12 \).

3. **Calculating Today's Wolves:**
   - Since today's number of cougars is 12, the number of wolves killed today is \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \).

4. **Total Animals Killed:**
   - Wolves killed: 10 (previous night) + 36 (today) = 46
   - Cougars killed: 15 (previous night) + 12 (today) = 27

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many times Anne went down the water slide.
2. Use the number of times Anne went down the water slide to find out how many times Robert went down the water slide.

First, we know that Mitchel went down the water slide 30 times. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. To find out how many times Anne went down the slide, we calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30:

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.30 \times 30 = 9 \]

So, Anne went down the slide:

\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \text{ times} \]

Next, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. Therefore, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4:

\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

So, Robert went down the water slide 84 times. The final numerical answer is:

"Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, which totals to:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows, so the total number of cows becomes:
\[ 200 + 40 = 240 \text{ cows} \]

These 40 new cows are then divided equally into the 20 stalls, meaning each stall gets:
\[ \frac{40}{20} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. Since each stall has 2 cows, 8 stalls will have:
\[ 8 \times 2 = 16 \text{ cows} \]

"First, we need to determine the total length of the redwood tree in feet, which is given as 200 feet.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before any damage. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can find the total weight by dividing the total length of the tree by the length of each section and then multiplying by the weight per section.

\[
\text{Total weight before damage} = \left(\frac{\text{Total length of the tree}}{\text{Length of each section}}\right) \times \text{Weight per section}
\]

\[
\text{Total weight before damage} = \left(\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}}\right) \times 400 \text{ pounds/section}
\]

\[
\text{Total weight before damage} = 20 \times 400 = 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to account for the damage caused by the termites. The termites ate 30% of the redwood's wood, which means 70% of the wood remains.

\[
\text{Weight after damage} = \text{Total weight before damage} \times (1 - \text{Percentage damaged})
\]

\[
\text{Weight after damage} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \times (1 - 0.30)

"Let's denote the number of apples Jamal has as \( J_a \) and the number of bananas Jamal has as \( J_b \).

From the information given:
1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, so if Andrea has 52 apples, then Jamal has \( 52 - 8 = 44 \) apples.
2. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so \( J_b = J_a + 4 \).
3. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so if Jamal has \( J_b \) bananas, then Andrea has \( \frac{J_b}{2} \) bananas. Since Andrea has 52 apples, we can use this to find the number of bananas Jamal has.

First, let's find the number of bananas Jamal has:
\[ J_b = J_a + 4 = 44 + 4 = 48 \]

Now, let's find the number of bananas Andrea has:
\[ \text{Andrea's bananas} = \frac{J_b}{2} = \frac{48}{2} = 24 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits:
- Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas.

"First, let's calculate the total price of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

The selling price of the house is $350,000.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price:
\[ \text{Brokerage fee} = 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500 \]

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price:
\[ \text{Transfer fee} = 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000 \]

Now, let's add the brokerage fee and the transfer fee to the selling price to get the total price of the house:

- The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body, which is \( \frac{900}{10} = 90 \) stitches.
- The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is \( 2 \times 90 = 180 \) stitches.

Now, let's add up the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette:

\[ 900 \text{ (body)} + 90 \text{ (collar)} + 180 \text{ (rosette)} = 1170 \text{ stitches} \]

The total number of stitches for the whole sweater is 1800. Therefore, the number of stitches for the two sleeves combined is:

\[ 1800 - 1170 = 630 \text{ stitches} \]

Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches for each sleeve is:

\[ \frac{630}{2} = 315 \text{ stitches} \]

So, each sleeve takes 315 stitches. The final numerical answer is:

315"
"To find out how much money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the total cost for the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately, and then add them together.

For the tomato seeds:
- Number of packets: 20
- Cost per packet: $40
- Total cost for tomato seeds = 20 packets * $40/packet = $800

For the celery seeds:
- Number of packets: 80
- Cost per packet: $30
- Total cost for celery seeds = 80 packets * $30/packet = $2400

Now, we add the total costs together:
- Total cost for tomato seeds + Total cost for celery seeds = $800 + $2400 = $3200

Therefore, Mrs. Rylan used $3200 to buy the seeds."
"First, let's calculate the number of lines Sean has to memorize for each part of his role.

1. **Solo Song:**
   The solo song has 54 lines, and Sean has to memorize all of them.
   \[
   \text{Lines for the solo song} = 54
   \]

2. **First Scene:**
   The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song.
   \[
   \text{Lines for the first scene} = 2 \times 54 = 108
   \]
   Only a third of the lines in the first scene are Sean's lines.
   \[
   \text{Sean's lines for the first scene} = \frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36
   \]

3. **Second Scene:**
   The second scene has six more lines than the solo song.
   \[
   \text{Lines for the second scene} = 54 + 6 = 60
   \]
   Four-fifths of the lines in the second scene are Sean's lines.
   \[
   \text{Sean's lines for the second scene} = \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48
   \]

Now, let's add up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
\[
\text{Total lines Sean has to memorize} = 54 + 36 + 48 = 138
\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
138

"First, let's find out how many cards had the letter A on them. Since 2/5 of the cards had the letter A, we calculate:

\[ \text{Cards with letter A} = \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \]

Next, we find out how many cards were left after removing the cards with letter A:

\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 80 - 32 = 48 \]

Then, we calculate how many of these remaining cards had the letter B on them. Since 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B, we calculate:

\[ \text{Cards with letter B} = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]

Now, we find out how many cards were left after removing the cards with letter B:

\[ \text{Remaining cards after B} = 48 - 24 = 24 \]

Next, we calculate how many of these remaining cards had the letter C on them. Since 5/8 of the remaining cards had the letter C, we calculate:

\[ \text{Cards with letter C} = \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \]

Finally, we find out how many cards had the letter D on them by subtracting the cards with letters A, B, and C from the total number of cards:

\[ \text{Cards with letter D} = 80 - 32 - 24 - 15 = 11 \]

So, the number of cards that had the letter D on them is 11."
"To calculate the total time Matthew will take to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we need to calculate the time for each type of hole separately and then sum them up.

For the small holes:
- Time to dig one small hole = 3 minutes
- Number of small holes = 30
- Total time for small holes = 3 minutes/hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes

For the large holes:
- Time to dig one large hole = 10 minutes
- Number of large holes = 15
- Total time for large holes = 10 minutes/hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes

Now, we add the total time for both types of holes:
- Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert the total time from minutes to hours:
- Total time in hours = 240 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours

So, the final numerical answer is 4 hours."
"If the sum of Mico and Marco's current ages is 20, then in 10 years, their ages will each increase by 10 years. Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

\[ 20 + 10 + 10 = 40 \]

The final numerical answer is 40."
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, which translates to \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. This can be written as \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

First, we substitute the expression for \( R \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Next, we expand and simplify the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old. To verify, we can find Ruby's current age:
\[ R = 6S = 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

In 9 years, Sam will be \( 6 + 9 = 15 \) years old, and Ruby will be \( 36 + 9 = 45 \) years old. Checking the condition that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
\[ 45 = 3 \times 15 \]
This is true, so our solution is correct.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the popsicles. Peter bought 20 popsicles at $0.25 each. The total cost for the popsicles is:
\[ 20 \times 0.25 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the ice cream bars. Peter bought 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each. The total cost for the ice cream bars is:
\[ 4 \times 0.50 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars to find the total amount Peter paid:
\[ 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Peter paid is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of spots a mamba has. Since a cobra has 70 spots and a mamba has half as many spots as a cobra, a mamba has:

\[ \text{Spots per mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, so the total number of spots for the cobras is:

\[ \text{Total spots for cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots, so the total number of spots for the mambas is:

\[ \text{Total spots for mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Now, we find the combined total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas:

\[ \text{Total spots} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of the total number of spots:

\[ \text{Half the total spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 2450 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people who will be eating the pizza.

- There are 12 team members.
- There are 3 coaches.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so \(12 \text{ team members} \times 2 \text{ guests/team member} = 24 \text{ guests}\).

Adding these together, the total number of people is:
\[ 12 \text{ team members} + 3 \text{ coaches} + 24 \text{ guests} = 39 \text{ people} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Each pizza serves 3 people, so we divide the total number of people by the number of people each pizza can serve:
\[ \frac{39 \text{ people}}{3 \text{ people/pizza}} = 13 \text{ pizzas} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Each pizza costs $15, so:
\[ 13 \text{ pizzas} \times 15 \text{ dollars/pizza} = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Maddy will spend \(\boxed{195}\) dollars."
"To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to calculate the total length used by the topaz gemstones and then find out how much space is left for the sterling silver beads.

First, calculate the total length used by the topaz gemstones:
- Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long.
- Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace.
- Therefore, the total length used by the topaz gemstones is \( 8 \times 1 = 8 \) inches.

Next, determine the remaining length for the sterling silver beads:
- The total length of the necklace is 25 inches.
- The length used by the topaz gemstones is 8 inches.
- Therefore, the remaining length for the sterling silver beads is \( 25 - 8 = 17 \) inches.

Now, calculate the number of sterling silver beads used:
- Each sterling silver bead is 0.25 inches long.
- The remaining length for the sterling silver beads is 17 inches.
- Therefore, the number of sterling silver beads used is \( \frac{17}{0.25} = 68 \).

"To find the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot altogether, we need to calculate the number of stories each wrote in both weeks and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of stories each wrote in the second week:
- Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week and doubled that in the second week, so she wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories in the second week.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week and doubled that in the second week, so he wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories in the second week.
- Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week and doubled that in the second week, so she wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories in the second week.

Next, we sum up the total number of stories written by each of them over the two weeks:
- Alani wrote \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories in total.
- Braylen wrote \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories in total.
- Margot wrote \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories in total.

Finally, we add up the total number of stories written by all three:
\[60 + 120 + 180 = 360\]

So, the total number of stories they wrote altogether is \(\boxed{360}\)."
"If Ann is 9 years old, her brother is twice her age, which means her brother is \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

"Kelly has 5 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents. Therefore, the total value of the quarters is:
\[ 5 \times 25 = 125 \text{ cents} \]

She also has 2 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents. Therefore, the total value of the dimes is:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Adding the value of the quarters and the dimes gives:
\[ 125 + 20 = 145 \text{ cents} \]

The can of pop costs 55 cents. Subtracting the cost of the can of pop from the total amount of money Kelly has:
\[ 145 - 55 = 90 \text{ cents} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 90 \]"
"To find out how many rows of 5 stars there are, we first need to determine how many stars are accounted for by the rows of 8 and 6 stars.

There are three rows of 8 stars, so that's \(3 \times 8 = 24\) stars.
There are two rows of 6 stars, so that's \(2 \times 6 = 12\) stars.

Adding these together, we have \(24 + 12 = 36\) stars accounted for by the rows of 8 and 6 stars.

The total number of stars on the flag is 76. So, the number of stars left for the rows of 5 stars is \(76 - 36 = 40\).

Since each row of 5 stars contains 5 stars, the number of rows of 5 stars is \(40 \div 5 = 8\).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 8."
"To determine how many trucks are needed, we first need to calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones.

Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight of 80 flagstones is:
\[ 80 \times 75 = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

The delivery trucks can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds. To find out how many trucks are needed to transport 6000 pounds, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:
\[ \frac{6000}{2000} = 3 \]

Therefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

The final numerical answer is:
3"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, the speed of the car in the slow lane is:

\[ \text{Speed of slow lane car} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it took the car in the fast lane to travel 480 miles. The time taken can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the fast lane:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{fast lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at a constant speed of 30 miles/hour and it needs to cover the same distance of 480 miles, the time taken by the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{slow lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

\[ 16 \text{ hours} \]"
"To find out how many medals have been given out for counting, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of medals Izzy has:
   - Ali has 22 medals.
   - Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has \(22 - 5 = 17\) medals.

2. Calculate the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:
   - Ali has 22 medals.
   - Izzy has 17 medals.
   - Together, they have \(22 + 17 = 39\) medals.

3. According to the problem, the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:
   - The total number of medals given out is \(39 \times 10 = 390\).

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 390."
"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available:

- Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars.
- There are 8 packets.

So, the total number of chocolate bars is:
\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars/packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Next, let's determine how many chocolate bars the adults will get:

- There are 4 adults.
- Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars.

So, the total number of chocolate bars for the adults is:
\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars/adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, we can find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children:

\[ 40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

There are 8 children, and we need to share the remaining 16 chocolate bars equally among them:

\[ \frac{16 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars/child} \]

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars."
"Susan works for a total of 3 hours (from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m.), which is equivalent to 180 minutes. She takes a 30-minute break, so she works for 150 minutes.

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we can calculate her earnings as follows:

\[ \text{Earnings per minute} = \frac{5}{10} = 0.5 \]

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 150 \times 0.5 = 75 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 75."
"First, let's determine the initial points for each player:

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Next, we check if any of the players get an extra point in the fourth round. According to the rules, a player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points.

- Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so Mike gets an extra point.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so Jim does not get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so Tony gets an extra point.

Now, we add the extra points to their initial points:

- Mike's new total is \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
- Jim's new total remains \(18\) points.
- Tony's new total is \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

Finally, we calculate the total points for all three players:

\[22 + 18 + 43 = 83\]

So, the total points for all three players after the extra points had been distributed is 83."

**Second Day:**
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, let's calculate the total for each activity over the two days:

- Total pushups: 100 (first day) + 120 (second day) = 220
- Total squats: 50 (first day) + 40 (second day) = 90
- Total dumbbell presses: 20 (first day) + 40 (second day) = 60

Total count of activities = Total pushups + Total squats + Total dumbbell presses
Total count of activities = 220 + 90 + 60 = 370

The final numerical answer is 370."
"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day by the household.
2. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week by the household.
3. Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

First, let's calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day by the household. There are 5 members, and each consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since they eat rice at lunch and dinner, each person consumes 0.4 kg of rice per day.

Total daily consumption = 5 members * 0.4 kg/member/day = 2 kg/day

Next, we calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week. There are 7 days in a week.

Total weekly consumption = 2 kg/day * 7 days/week = 14 kg/week

Now, we determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

Number of weeks the bag will last = 42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks

The final numerical answer is 3 weeks."
"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target.

First, let's calculate the total crates sold:
- He was closed on Monday and Friday, so he didn't sell any crates on those days.
- He sold 20 crates over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday).
- He sold 15 crates on Tuesday.
- He sold 12 crates on Wednesday.
- He sold 18 crates on Thursday.

Adding these together:
\[ 20 \text{ (weekend)} + 15 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 12 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 18 \text{ (Thursday)} = 65 \text{ crates} \]

Sam's target was to sell 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off by, we subtract the crates he sold from his target:

So, Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week."
"To determine the total cost of the antique desk to Carmen, we need to calculate the bids she placed and the bids placed by the other bidders.

Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so she bids 3 times. Each of her bids increases by $50. Therefore, her bids are:
1. $200 + $50 = $250
2. $250 + $50 = $300
3. $300 + $50 = $350

The other 3 bidders each bid once, and since they bid in sequence, their bids are:
1. $200 + $50 = $250
2. $250 + $50 = $300
3. $300 + $50 = $350

Carmen wins with her last bid of $350. To find out how much she spent, we sum up all her bids:
$250 + $300 + $350 = $900

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
900"
"To calculate the total amount John pays for driving a year, we need to consider the cost of miles driven and the monthly bonus.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven in a year:
- John drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back, so he drives 60 miles each day.
- He goes to work 5 days a week, so he drives 60 miles * 5 days = 300 miles per week.
- He works 50 weeks a year, so he drives 300 miles * 50 weeks = 15,000 miles per year.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the miles driven:
- He is charged $2 per mile, so the cost for the miles driven is 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000.

Now, let's calculate the total bonus he gives the driver in a year:
- He gives a $150 bonus per month, so the total bonus for the year is $150 * 12 months = $1,800.

Finally, let's add the cost of the miles driven and the total bonus to find the total amount he pays a year:
- Total cost = Cost of miles driven + Total bonus = $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

The final numerical answer is $31,800."

"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of books sold in the first year.
2. Determine the number of books sold in the current year.
3. Calculate the total number of books sold in the first and second years.
4. Calculate the total amount of money earned in the second year.

Given:
- Total books: 250
- Current year sales: 45 books
- Unsold books: 50
- First year sales: twice the current year sales

First, let's find the number of books sold in the first year:
\[ \text{First year sales} = 2 \times \text{Current year sales} = 2 \times 45 = 90 \]

Next, let's find the total number of books sold in the first and second years:
\[ \text{Total books sold} = \text{First year sales} + \text{Current year sales} = 90 + 45 = 135 \]

Now, let's find the number of books sold in the second year:
\[ \text{Books sold in the second year} = \text{Total books} - \text{Total books sold} - \text{Unsold books} = 250 - 135 - 50 = 65 \]

Finally, let's calculate the total amount of money earned in the second year:
\[ \text{Total money earned in the second year} = \text{Books sold in the second year} \times \text{Price per book} = 65 \times 20 = 1300 \]

The total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is:

"To determine how much money Watson made in April, we need to calculate his earnings from his hourly wage and his weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate Watson's daily earnings:
- Watson works 10 hours a day.
- He earns $10 per hour.

\[ \text{Daily earnings} = 10 \, \text{hours/day} \times 10 \, \text{\$/hour} = 100 \, \text{\$/day} \]

Next, let's calculate his weekly earnings:
- Watson works 5 days a week.
- He earns $100 per day.

\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 100 \, \text{\$/day} \times 5 \, \text{days/week} = 500 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Since Watson gets a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well, his total weekly earnings when the company performs well are:

\[ \text{Total weekly earnings} = 500 \, \text{\$/week} + 300 \, \text{\$/week} = 800 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Now, let's calculate his total earnings for the month of April. April has 30 days, and we need to determine how many weeks are in April. Since April has 30 days and each week has 7 days:

\[ \text{Number of weeks in April} = \left\lfloor \frac{30 \, \text{days}}{7 \, \text{days/week}} \right\rfloor = 4 \, \text{weeks} \]

With 4 weeks in April, his total earnings for the month are:

\[ \text{Total earnings for April} = 4 \, \text{weeks} \times 800 \, \text{\$/week} = 3200 \, \text{\$} \]

Therefore, Watson made $3200 in April if the company performed very well for the whole month."
"To determine how many people John lost to, we first need to calculate how many people he beat and then subtract that number from the total number of people he arm wrestled.

John beats 80% of the 20 people he arm wrestled. To find out how many people he beat, we calculate 80% of 20:

\[ 0.80 \times 20 = 16 \]

So, John beat 16 people. To find out how many people he lost to, we subtract the number of people he beat from the total number of people he arm wrestled:

\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, the number of people John lost to is 4."
"First, let's determine how many loaves of bread are sold in the morning. Since two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning, we calculate:

\[
\text{Morning sales} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
\]

Next, we find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales:

\[
\text{Loaves left after morning} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
\]

In the afternoon and evening, half of the remaining loaves are sold equally. Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening combined is:

\[
\text{Afternoon and evening sales combined} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
\]

Since the loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[
\text{Afternoon sales} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ loaves}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
5

"First, we need to determine how much weight Joey loses in one week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so we can calculate the weekly weight loss for Joey as follows:

\[ \text{Weekly weight loss for Joey} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Next, we need to find out how much weight Sandy needs to lose. Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week, we calculate the total weight Sandy needs to lose as follows:

\[ \text{Weight Sandy needs to lose} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 8 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to determine how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds. Since Sandy loses 2 pounds per week, we can calculate the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds as follows:

\[ \text{Weeks for Sandy} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds per week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the savings on the ice cream. The original price of one tub of ice cream is $13, and it is now sold at $11. The discount per tub of ice cream is:

\[ 13 - 11 = 2 \]

So, the savings on one tub of ice cream is $2. Therefore, the savings on two tubs of ice cream is:

\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \]

Next, let's calculate the savings on the milk. The discount on one packet of milk is $0.5. Therefore, the savings on one packet of milk is $0.5. Therefore, the savings on four packets of milk is:

\[ 0.5 \times 4 = 2 \]

Now, we add the savings from the ice cream and the milk to find the total savings:

\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \]

So, the total amount saved if you buy 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To determine the number of new limbs Helena's serum will cause a person to grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and extra legs that grow based on the given growth rates.

The serum makes a person grow an extra arm every three days. So, in fifteen days, the number of extra arms grown is:
\[ \frac{15}{3} = 5 \]

The serum makes a person grow an extra leg every five days. So, in fifteen days, the number of extra legs grown is:
\[ \frac{15}{5} = 3 \]

Therefore, the total number of new limbs grown after fifteen days is the sum of the extra arms and extra legs:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
6 business suits * $100 each = $600

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
3 suitcases * $50 each = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit:
5 * $100 (cost of one business suit) = $500
$700 more than $500 = $5700
So, the flight ticket costs $5700.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
Cost of business suits: $600
Cost of suitcases: $150
Cost of flight ticket: $5700
Total cost: $600 + $150 + $5700 = $6450

Theo wishes to save $2000 for the trip, so the amount he has spent so far is:
Total cost - Savings = $6450 - $2000 = $4450

Since Theo has $6000 to spend on the trip, the amount he can spend on buying gifts for his business partners is:
Total amount - Amount spent on other items = $6000 - $4450 = $1550

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum up the results.

First, let's identify the number of people in the family:
- There are 5 people in the family.

Next, we know that three people eat 3 eggs each day:
- Number of people eating 3 eggs each day = 3
- Eggs consumed by these 3 people per day = 3 people * 3 eggs/person = 9 eggs/day

The remaining two people eat 2 eggs each day:
- Number of people eating 2 eggs each day = 2
- Eggs consumed by these 2 people per day = 2 people * 2 eggs/person = 4 eggs/day

Now, we calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the family per day:
- Total eggs consumed per day = Eggs consumed by the first group + Eggs consumed by the second group
- Total eggs consumed per day = 9 eggs/day + 4 eggs/day = 13 eggs/day

To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week (7 days), we multiply the daily consumption by 7:
- Total eggs consumed in a week = Total eggs consumed per day * 7 days
- Total eggs consumed in a week = 13 eggs/day * 7 days = 91 eggs

Therefore, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old six years ago.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since six years have passed, Noah is now \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Let the current population of Chile be \(P\).
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was \(P / 2\).

4. **Relate the population of Chile six years ago to Noah's age:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age.
   - Therefore, \(P / 2 = 3000 \times 20\).
   - Simplifying, \(P / 2 = 60000\).
   - Multiplying both sides by 2, we get \(P = 120000\).

So, the population of Chile now is 120000."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so it is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players in the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve for \( D \), we first combine the terms on the left side of the equation:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 3D + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{6D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{7D}{2} \]

So the equation becomes:
\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

To isolate \( D \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Then we divide both sides by 7:
\[ D = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 30 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha initially invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we need to account for the people who couldn't come due to illness and those with previous commitments:

- 8 people couldn't come due to illness.
- 1/4 of the 8 people with illness had previous commitments, which is \(8 \div 4 = 2\) people.

Therefore, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Finally, the number of people who show up for the party is the total number of people invited minus the number who couldn't come:

\[24 - 10 = 14\]

So, the final numerical answer is 14."
"First, let's calculate the number of marbles Solomon received from his father. Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, and his father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Therefore, the number of marbles Solomon received from his father is:

"First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Height (or depth) = 5 feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 5 = 120 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is given as $0.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The number of girls is 3 times the number of boys.
2. The number of nongendered children is 1/10 the number of boys.
3. The classroom has 30 boys.

First, calculate the number of girls:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 3 \times \text{Number of boys} = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

Next, calculate the number of nongendered children:
\[ \text{Number of nongendered children} = \frac{1}{10} \times \text{Number of boys} = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3 \]

Now, add up all the children in the classroom:
\[ \text{Total number of children} = \text{Number of boys} + \text{Number of girls} + \text{Number of nongendered children} \]
\[ \text{Total number of children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 \]

"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and there are 45 electric wires, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles.

Let \( P \) be the number of electric poles and \( W \) be the number of electric wires. According to the ratio, we have:
\[ \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Given \( W = 45 \), we can substitute this value into the proportion:
\[ \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \]

To find \( P \), we can solve the equation by cross-multiplying:
\[ P \times 3 = 45 \times 1 \]
\[ 3P = 45 \]
\[ P = \frac{45}{3} \]
\[ P = 15 \]

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15."
"At the beginning, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 25 + 15 = 40 people.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left, which means 1/4 * 40 = 10 people left.

If 22 men stayed at the party, this means that 22 - 10 = 12 men left the party.

Since 12 men left, 25 - 12 = 13 men are left at the party.

Since the total number of people left is 10, and 13 men are left, the number of women left must be 10 - 13 + 15 = 12 women.

Therefore, the number of women left at the party is 12."
"First, let's determine the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as a book and the book costs $4, we can calculate the cost of the magazine as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of magazine} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cost of book} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of the pen. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so:

\[ \text{Cost of pen} = \text{Cost of magazine} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 \]

Therefore, the pen costs $1."
"First, let's determine the total number of pencils Jam has. We know that Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. So, the number of pencils in the three boxes is:

\[ 26 - 2 = 24 \]

This means Jam has 24 pencils in the boxes and 2 loose pencils, making a total of 26 pencils. Now, we need to find out how many boxes are needed to store all the pencils if Meg also has 46 pencils. The total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together is:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Since we don't know the number of pencils per box, we assume each box can hold the same number of pencils as the average number of pencils per box Jam has. Since Jam has 26 pencils in total (24 in boxes and 2 loose), we can assume each box holds:

\[ \frac{24}{3} = 8 \text{ pencils per box} \]

Now, we need to find out how many boxes are needed to store 72 pencils if each box holds 8 pencils:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the weakening of the coffee due to the cooling and the addition of cream.

First, let's determine how many ice cubes are used to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we can calculate the number of ice cubes used as follows:

\[ \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \]

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, the total weakening due to the ice cubes is:

\[ \text{Total weakening due to ice cubes} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters} \]

Next, we need to consider the weakening due to the addition of cream. The problem states that any added liquid weakens the coffee, and we are given that adding 15 milliliters of cream weakens the coffee. Therefore, the weakening due to the cream is:

\[ \text{Weakening due to cream} = 15 \text{ milliliters} \]

To find the total weakening of the coffee, we add the weakening due to the ice cubes and the weakening due to the cream:

\[ \text{Total weakening} = 60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters} \]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 75 \]"
"If 5 people leave with 7 new records between them, and each person can trade 2 old records for 1 new record, then the total number of new records traded out is 7. Since each new record traded out requires 2 old records to be traded in, the total number of old records traded in is \(7 \times 2 = 14\).

So, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records."
"First, let's determine the number of junior and senior programmers.

Given that the total number of employees is 100 and the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:
\[ \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers is:
\[ \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Next, we know that each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total amount paid to junior programmers per month is:
\[ \text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

The senior programmers are paid $400 more than the junior programmers, so each senior programmer is paid:
\[ \text{Payment to each senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400 \]

Therefore, the total amount paid to senior programmers per month is:
\[ \text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

Finally, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers:
\[ \text{Total payment to all programmers} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 224000 \]"
"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the number of people on the bus becomes \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on, so the number of people on the bus becomes \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).

We are given that there were a total of 20 people heading to the third stop, which means that at the second bus stop, there were 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( 14 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the final amount the customer paid, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip:**
   - The customer spent $80.
   - For every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase.
   - Therefore, the rewards earned from the $80 spent is:
     \[
     \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ rewards}
     \]

2. **Apply the rewards to the current shopping trip:**
   - The customer used their $4 rewards on the current shopping trip.
   - The current shopping trip cost $43.

"First, let's calculate the total cost for each offer.

For Furniture United:
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 installments of $350 each

Total cost for Furniture United = Advance payment + (Number of installments * Monthly installment amount)
Total cost for Furniture United = $1,350 + (6 * $350)
Total cost for Furniture United = $1,350 + $2,100
Total cost for Furniture United = $3,450

For Cozy Homes:
- Advance payment: $1,100

"To determine the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we can break down the problem into two parts: the sugar needed for the suckers and the sugar needed for the fudge.

First, calculate the sugar needed for the suckers:
- Each batch of suckers requires 30 ounces of sugar.
- Mason needs to make 8 batches of suckers.
- Therefore, the total sugar needed for the suckers is \( 30 \text{ ounces/batch} \times 8 \text{ batches} = 240 \text{ ounces} \).

Next, calculate the sugar needed for the fudge:
- Each batch of fudge requires 70 ounces of sugar.
- Mason needs to make 1 batch of fudge.
- Therefore, the total sugar needed for the fudge is \( 70 \text{ ounces/batch} \times 1 \text{ batch} = 70 \text{ ounces} \).

Now, add the sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge to find the total amount of sugar Mason needs:
- Total sugar needed = sugar for suckers + sugar for fudge
- Total sugar needed = 240 ounces + 70 ounces = 310 ounces.

"First, let's determine how many hot dogs Thomas ate. Since Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, we can calculate the number of hot dogs Thomas ate as follows:

\[ \text{Thomas's hot dogs} = 3 \times \text{Luke's hot dogs} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Next, we need to find out how many hot dogs John ate. John ate half the amount that Thomas ate, so:

\[ \text{John's hot dogs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Thomas's hot dogs} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \]

Now, to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's hot dogs} - \text{Luke's hot dogs} = 3 - 2 = 1 \]

So, John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 1 \]"
"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The number of students in the smallest group would then be \( x - 10 \).

Given that the total number of students is 200, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two equal groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60."
"Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \) and the number of chickens as \( H \). According to the problem, the total number of animals is 60, and there are twice as many chickens as cows. This gives us the following equations:

\[ H + C = 60 \]
\[ H = 2C \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( C \):

\[ 2C + C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:

\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of legs. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:

\[ \text{Total legs} = (2 \times H) + (4 \times C) = (2 \times 40) + (4 \times 20) = 80 + 80 = 160 \]

So, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is 160."
"Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week. After 4 weeks, he would have added:

\[ 1 \text{ ball/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 4 \text{ balls} \]

So, before the incident, he would have:

\[ 3 \text{ initial balls} + 4 \text{ added balls} = 7 \text{ balls} \]

However, when he walks on stage, he slips and drops 3 balls. Therefore, the number of balls he has left to juggle is:

\[ 7 \text{ balls} - 3 \text{ dropped balls} = 4 \text{ balls} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's first establish the weights of each animal based on the information given:

1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. A pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, so a blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
3. A pink frog weighs the same as a green toad, so a green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
4. A pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, so a yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
5. A pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than a red bird, so a red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, including the container itself:

- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

Adding these weights together:

\[ 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 \]

So, the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is 260 pounds."

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the additional distance Tyson should run each day.
2. Determine the total distance Tyson runs each day after taking the coach's advice.
3. Calculate the total distance Tyson runs in a month.
4. Since June has 30 days, we will multiply the daily distance by 30.

Step 1: Calculate the additional distance Tyson should run each day.
The additional distance is 1/5 times the original distance of 5000 meters.
\[ \text{Additional distance} = \frac{1}{5} \times 5000 = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

Step 2: Determine the total distance Tyson runs each day after taking the coach's advice.
\[ \text{New daily distance} = 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total distance Tyson runs in a month.
\[ \text{Total distance in a month} = 6000 \text{ meters/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 180000 \text{ meters} \]

Step 4: The total distance Tyson covered in June is 180000 meters.

"First, let's determine the cost of each juice box:

- Juice Box A costs 4 dollars.
- Juice Box B costs 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, so Juice Box B costs \(4 + 5 = 9\) dollars.
- Juice Box C costs 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, so Juice Box C costs \(4 + 7 = 11\) dollars.

Now, to find out how much more Juice Box C costs than Juice Box B, we subtract the cost of Juice Box B from the cost of Juice Box C:

\[11 - 9 = 2\]

So, Juice Box C costs 2 dollars more than Juice Box B. The final numerical answer is:

So, the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is 310."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Jenny buys in a week:
\[ 1 \text{ bag} \times 36 \text{ cookies per bag} = 36 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, let's determine how many cookies Jenny puts in her son's lunch box over the week:
\[ 4 \text{ cookies/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 20 \text{ cookies} \]

Now, let's calculate how many cookies her husband eats over the week:
\[ 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ cookies} \]

Now, we can find out how many cookies are left for Jenny to eat by subtracting the cookies put in the son's lunch box and the cookies eaten by her husband from the total number of cookies:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the shirts without any discount. Davos bought 2 shirts, each costing $30.

Total cost without discount = 2 shirts * $30/shirt = $60

Now, let's calculate the discount amount. The discount is 40%, so we need to find 40% of $60.

Discount amount = 40% of $60 = 0.40 * $60 = $24

Finally, we subtract the discount amount from the total cost without discount to find out how much Davos paid.

Amount paid = Total cost without discount - Discount amount
Amount paid = $60 - $24 = $36

So, the final numerical answer is $36."
"First, let's calculate the daily earnings from tractors when they made them:

- They sold 10 tractors a day.
- They made $100 per tractor.

So, the daily earnings from tractors were:
\[ 10 \text{ tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate the daily earnings from silos now that they make them:

- They sell 5 silos a day.
- They make $220 per silo.

So, the daily earnings from silos are:
\[ 5 \text{ silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day} \]

Now, we need to find the percentage increase in daily earnings from making silos compared to making tractors:

\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New daily earnings} - \text{Old daily earnings}}{\text{Old daily earnings}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\$1100 - \$1000}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{\$100}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage more they are making per day now is:

\[ 10\% \]"

"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming.

Boating time: 6 hours
Swimming time: 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours

Total time for boating and swimming: 6 hours + 3 hours = 9 hours

Next, let's calculate the total time he spent watching the shows.

Number of shows: 3
Duration of each show: 2 hours
Total show time: 3 shows * 2 hours/show = 6 hours

The 6 hours of watching shows is 30% of the total time he spent. Let's denote the total time he spent as \( T \).

So, 30% of \( T \) is 6 hours:
\[ 0.30 \times T = 6 \]
\[ T = \frac{6}{0.30} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we know the total time \( T \) is 20 hours. John spent 40% of his time sightseeing. Let's calculate the time spent sightseeing.

Time spent sightseeing: 40% of 20 hours
\[ 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time John spent sightseeing is 8 hours."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Annabelle will earn from her first job. She earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours, so:

\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 20 \, \text{hours} = 200 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money she will earn from her second job. She earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours, so:

\[ 5 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours} = 75 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, let's add the money she already has in her savings to the money she will earn from both jobs:

\[ 80 \, \text{dollars} + 200 \, \text{dollars} + 75 \, \text{dollars} = 355 \, \text{dollars} \]

The phone costs $400, so the amount of money Annabelle still needs to save is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost for the mini-golf and go-karts rides.

- Cost for one round of mini-golf: $5
- Cost for two rides on go-karts: $10 * 2 = $20

So, the total cost for these activities is:
$5 (mini-golf) + $20 (go-karts) = $25

Now, we subtract this total cost from the budgeted amount to find out how much money is left for arcade tokens and for Morgan herself.

- Budgeted amount: $90
- Total cost for mini-golf and go-karts: $25

Money left for arcade tokens and Morgan:
$90 - $25 = $65

Morgan wants to have $5 in arcade tokens, so we subtract this amount from the remaining money to find out how much is left for Morgan.

- Money left after mini-golf and go-karts: $65
- Amount for arcade tokens: $5

Money left for Morgan:
$65 - $5 = $60

Since each friend gets to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice, the cost for each friend is the same as the total cost for Morgan (excluding the $5 for arcade tokens).

- Cost for each friend: $25

Now, we divide the money left for Morgan by the cost for each friend to find out how many friends can be invited.

- Money left for Morgan: $60
- Cost for each friend: $25

Number of friends that can be invited:
$60 / $25 = 2.4

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, she can invite 2 friends.

The final numerical answer is 2."
"First, let's calculate how much Marisa spends on lollipops each day. Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and she buys 4 lollipops each day. So, the cost per day is:

\[ 4 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 100 \text{ cents} \]

Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar, Marisa spends $1 each day on lollipops.

Next, let's determine how much pocket money Marisa receives each day. She gets $5 every day from her parents.

Now, we need to find out how much money Marisa saves each day. This is the difference between the pocket money she receives and the amount she spends on lollipops:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars} - 1 \text{ dollar} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Marisa saves $4 each day. To find out how much she saves over 5 days, we multiply the daily savings by 5:

Since he spent half of his change on gumballs, the total amount of money he had initially was twice the amount he spent on gumballs:

\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Billy started with $10, so the amount of money he spent on candy is:

\[ 10 - 4 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of candy is $1.5 per pound. To find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we divide the total amount spent on candy by the cost per pound:

"First, let's calculate the distance of the entire trip from the first city to the third city and back to the first city.

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city back to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the second and third city trip, which is \(100 - 50 = 50\) miles.

So, the total distance for one complete round trip (first to second, second to third, and third to first) is:
\[75 + 100 + 50 = 225 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[225 \times 3 = 675 \text{ miles}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance traveled in one day by the service interval:
\[675 \div 18000 = 0.0375\]

Since the train needs service every 18,000 miles, and it travels 675 miles in one day, it will go between services after traveling 18,000 miles. Therefore, the number of days between services is:
\[18000 \div 675 = 26.6667\]

Since the train cannot go between services for a fraction of a day, we round up to the next whole number. Thus, the train goes between services every 27 days.

The final numerical answer is:
\[27\]"

"First, let's calculate the time John spent driving to his friend's house. The distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, and he drives at a speed of 70 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time taken to drive to his friend's house is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} = \frac{200 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{200}{70} \text{ hours} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 2.857 \text{ hours} \]

Next, John took a detour that added 10 miles to his trip, making the total distance to his friend's house 210 miles. The time taken for this detour is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{210}{70} \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the time John spent driving back home. The distance home is 240 miles, and he drives at a speed of 80 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{back home}} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = \frac{240}{80} \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, the total time for the trip is the sum of the time taken to drive to his friend's house, the time taken for the detour, and the time taken to drive back home:

\[ \text{Total Time} = \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} + \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} + \text{Time}_{\text{back home}} \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{20}{7} + 3 + 3 \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{20}{7} + 6 \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{20}{7} + \frac{42}{7} \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{62}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 8.857 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total trip time is:

\[ \frac{62}{7} \text{ hours} \]

Let's convert this to a decimal for a more precise answer:

\[ \frac{62}{7} \approx 8.857 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 8.857 \text{ hours} \]"

The total points required to pass are at least 42 points. To find out how many points Jane needs on her third test, we subtract the points she has already scored from the total points required.

Points needed on the third test: 42 - 33 = 9 points

Therefore, the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass is 9 points."
"Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as \( C \). According to the problem, \( C = 3 \).

The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is four times the number of customers minus 5, which can be expressed as \( 4C - 5 \). Substituting \( C = 3 \) into this equation, we get:
\[ 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]
So, 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting.

The number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is three times the number of shoplifters, which can be expressed as \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \).

Now, we know the total number of customers and shoplifters:
\[ C + 7 = 3 + 7 = 10 \]

The total number of people kicked out of the Walmart is 50. Therefore, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:
\[ 50 - (C + 7) = 50 - 10 = 40 \]

So, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is 40."
"To determine how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we need to first find out how many points Erin had after scoring 14 points.

Sara scored 8 points. After Erin scored 14 points, Erin has three times more points than Sara. So, we calculate Erin's points after scoring 14 points as follows:

\[ \text{Erin's points after scoring 14} = 3 \times \text{Sara's points} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Since Erin scored 14 points after already having some points, we can find out how many points Erin had before by subtracting the 14 points she scored from her total points after scoring:

\[ \text{Erin's points before scoring 14} = \text{Erin's points after scoring 14} - 14 = 24 - 14 = 10 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 10 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames without the additional logo cost:
- Each picture frame costs $20.
- There are 44 seniors, so the total cost for the picture frames is \( 44 \times 20 = 880 \) dollars.

Next, we calculate the additional cost for etching the logo on each picture frame:
- The additional cost is 20% of the original cost, which is \( 20 \times 0.20 = 4 \) dollars per frame.
- The total additional cost for etching is \( 44 \times 4 = 176 \) dollars.

Now, we add the additional cost to the original cost to get the total cost for the picture frames:
- Total cost for picture frames with logo etching is \( 880 + 176 = 1056 \) dollars.

Next, we calculate the cost of the pins:
- Each pin costs $5.
- 2 seniors will receive pins, so the total cost for the pins is \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) dollars.

Then, we calculate the cost of the cords for the officers:
- Each cord costs $12.
- 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so there are \( \frac{44}{4} = 11 \) officers.
- The total cost for the cords is \( 11 \times 12 = 132 \) dollars.

Finally, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent on the senior gifts:
- Total cost for picture frames: 1056 dollars.
- Total cost for pins: 10 dollars.
- Total cost for cords: 132 dollars.

Adding these together:
- Total cost = 1056 + 10 + 132 = 1198 dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
1198"
"To determine the total cost for Ethan if he makes his own hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the savings from the DIY option and then subtract that from the original cost.

The original cost of the wallpaper is $400. The DIY option saves 20% of this cost. First, we calculate 20% of $400:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.20 \times 400 = 80 \]

This means Ethan saves $80 by making his own wallpaper. Therefore, the total cost for Ethan if he makes his own wallpaper is:

\[ 400 - 80 = 320 \]

So, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"To find the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale, let's break down the sales day by day:

1. **Friday**: The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.
2. **Saturday**: The store sold double the number of pairs sold on Friday. Therefore, they sold \(14 \times 2 = 28\) pairs.
3. **Sunday**: The store sold one-half the number of pairs sold on Saturday. Therefore, they sold \(28 \div 2 = 14\) pairs.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pairs sold before accounting for returns:

\[ 14 \text{ (Friday)} + 28 \text{ (Saturday)} + 14 \text{ (Sunday)} = 56 \text{ pairs} \]

However, 6 pairs were returned, so we need to subtract these from the total:

\[ 56 - 6 = 50 \]

Therefore, the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale is 50 pairs."
"To find out how many hours a week Hallie had dance practice, we need to calculate the total hours for each day she had practice and then sum them up.

- On Tuesdays, she had 1 hour of practice.
- On Thursdays, she had 2 hours of practice.
- On Saturdays, she had practice that lasted twice as long as Tuesday's, which means she had 2 * 1 = 2 hours of practice on Saturdays.

1 hour (Tuesday) + 2 hours (Thursday) + 2 hours (Saturday) = 5 hours.

So, the total number of hours Hallie had dance practice in a week is 5 hours."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of pieces of equipment and then calculate the cost of the functioning pieces.

1. Let's denote the total number of pieces of equipment as \( N \).
2. According to the problem, 40% of the total number of pieces were faulty. Therefore, the number of faulty pieces is \( 0.4N \).
3. Consequently, the number of functioning pieces is \( N - 0.4N = 0.6N \).

The total cost of the equipment is $400,000. Since the faulty pieces are returned, the company only pays for the functioning pieces. The cost of the functioning pieces is therefore \( 0.6N \) times the cost per piece. However, since we don't have the cost per piece, we can directly calculate the total cost of the functioning pieces as a fraction of the total cost.

The cost of the functioning pieces is:
\[ 0.6 \times 400000 = 240000 \]

So, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $240,000.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 240000 \]"
"Mary gets 1 kg of milk from half of her 30 sheep, which is 15 sheep. So, she gets 15 sheep * 1 kg/sheep = 15 kg of milk from these sheep. From the other half of the sheep, which is also 15 sheep, she gets 15 sheep * 2 kg/sheep = 30 kg of milk. Therefore, the total amount of milk she collects every day is 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

She then broke each of the remaining 6 rolls into 8 pieces. Therefore, the total number of pieces of rolls she fed to the chickens is 6 rolls * 8 pieces per roll = 48 pieces. 

The final numerical answer is 48."
"First, let's determine how many pupils like blue. Since half of the class likes blue, we calculate:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

So, 20 pupils like blue. This leaves us with:

\[
40 - 20 = 20
\]

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining 20 pupils like green. One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green, so we calculate:

\[
\frac{20}{4} = 5
\]

This means 5 pupils like green. The rest of the pupils like yellow. To find out how many pupils like yellow, we subtract the number of pupils who like green from the remaining pupils:

\[
20 - 5 = 15
\]

Therefore, the number of pupils who like the color yellow is:

\[
15

"First, let's determine how many apples Lucy sold on Monday. Given that she sold all the apples she picked on Monday and received $56 from selling them at $4 per piece, we can calculate the number of apples sold on Monday as follows:

\[ \text{Number of apples sold on Monday} = \frac{\$56}{\$4/\text{apple}} = 14 \text{ apples} \]

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples. On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday, which means she picked:

\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ apples} \]

To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we add the apples picked on each day:

\[ 14 \text{ (Monday)} + 12 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 24 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 50 \text{ apples} \]

So, the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days is:

"To determine how many socks Lindsay has missed, we first need to calculate the total number of socks she has washed.

A pair of socks consists of 2 socks. Lindsay washes 10 pairs, so the number of socks from the pairs is:
\[ 10 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ socks per pair} = 20 \text{ socks} \]

She also washes 15 loose socks. So, the total number of socks she has washed is:
\[ 20 \text{ socks from pairs} + 15 \text{ loose socks} = 35 \text{ socks} \]

Lindsay started with 50 socks. To find out how many socks she has missed, we subtract the number of socks she has washed from the total number of socks:
\[ 50 \text{ socks} - 35 \text{ socks} = 15 \text{ socks} \]

Therefore, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is:

"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she will have to pay back including the interest and then divide that by the number of months.

The formula to calculate the total amount to be paid back is:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} \times (1 + \text{Interest Rate})^{\text{Number of Months}} \]

Given:
- Principal (P) = $3,650
- Interest Rate (r) = 10% = 0.10
- Number of Months (n) = 5

First, we calculate the total amount to be paid back:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 \times (1 + 0.10)^5 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 \times (1.10)^5 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 \times 1.61051 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 5884.4115 \]

Now, we divide the total amount by the number of months to find the monthly payment:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{5884.4115}{5} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 1176.8823 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is $1176.88.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of silver and gold pesos Anna has.

Axel has 50 silver pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Axel has 80 gold pesos. Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so:
\[ 80 + 40 = 120 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of silver pesos they have together:
\[ 50 \text{ (Axel's silver pesos)} + 100 \text{ (Anna's silver pesos)} = 150 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of gold pesos they have together:
\[ 80 \text{ (Axel's gold pesos)} + 120 \text{ (Anna's gold pesos)} = 200 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Finally, let's find the total number of pesos they have together by adding the total silver pesos and the total gold pesos:

"First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make with the supplies she bought. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she has 3 pitchers, the total number of cups is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups/pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to determine the revenue from selling all 36 cups of lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue is:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1/\text{cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to find out how much it costs her to make the lemonade. She spent $18 to buy the supplies, so the cost is:

\[ \$18 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Millie sells all of the lemonade, and she sells an average of 4 cups per hour. To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours the lemonade stand is open:

\[ \frac{\$18}{4 \text{ hours}} = \$4.50/\text{hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$4.50 \]"
"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we need to determine the total amount of land he had before selling 3/5 of it. If he had 12.8 hectares left after selling 3/5 of his land, then 2/5 of his land is equal to 12.8 hectares (since 1 - 3/5 = 2/5).

Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had at first as \( L \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5}L = 12.8
\]

To find \( L \), we need to solve for \( L \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
L = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, let's calculate the value of \( L \).

"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 50\% \times 52 = 0.50 \times 52 = 26 \]

Since the choir is evenly split between boys and girls, the number of boys is also 26.

Next, we need to find out how many female members are performing. Since all female members are performing, the number of female members is equal to the number of girls, which is 26.

On the day of the performance, half of the female members can't make it to the show because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of female members who can't make it is:

\[ \frac{26}{2} = 13 \]

This means that the number of female members who can make it to the show is:

\[ 26 - 13 = 13 \]

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. So, the total number of people who sang in the performance is the sum of the female members who can make it and the 3 teachers:

\[ 13 + 3 = 16 \]

"First, let's calculate the cost for David if he buys a ride bracelet. The ride bracelet costs $30 and gives him 9 rides.

Next, let's calculate the cost for Dasha if she buys tickets. Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2. Therefore, each ride costs $4. For 9 rides, the total cost would be $4 * 9 = $36. Since she buys tickets, she needs 9 tickets, and the cost for 9 tickets would be $2 * 9 = $18.

Now, let's determine how much money David saves by buying the ride bracelet instead of buying tickets. The cost for Dasha is $18, and the cost for David with the ride bracelet is $30. The difference between these two costs is the amount David saves.

Let's calculate the savings:
\[ \text{Savings} = \text{Cost for Dasha} - \text{Cost for David} = \$18 - \$30 = -\$12 \]

Since the result is negative, it indicates that David actually spends $12 more by buying the ride bracelet. Therefore, David does not save any money, but rather spends $12 more. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{-12} \]"
"To determine how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to follow these steps:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many popsicles Betty and Sam each have based on the given ratio and total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. The total parts of the ratio are 5 + 6 = 11 parts.

Given that the total number of popsicles is 165, we can find out how many popsicles each part of the ratio represents by dividing the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts in the ratio:
\[ \text{Number of popsicles per part} = \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can find out how many popsicles Betty and Sam have:
- Betty has \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \) popsicles.
- Sam has \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

"First, let's calculate the monthly cost of the streaming services Tim will use after the discount:

- Netflix costs $10 a month.
- Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 each, but he saves 20% on bundling, which means they cost 80% of their normal price.
- The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus after the discount is $10 * 0.80 = $8 a month each.

Now, let's calculate the total monthly cost for the streaming services:
- Netflix: $10
- Hulu: $8
- Disney Plus: $8

Total monthly cost for streaming services = $10 + $8 + $8 = $26

Tim's cable package costs $60 a month. By cancelling his cable package and subscribing to the streaming services, he saves:

"First, let's convert all the time spent into the same unit. We'll use minutes for this calculation.

- Time spent writing a song: 4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes
- Time spent recording: half of the time spent writing = 240 / 2 = 120 minutes
- Time spent editing: 90 minutes

Now, let's calculate the total work time in minutes:
- Total work time = Time spent writing + Time spent recording + Time spent editing
- Total work time = 240 + 120 + 90 = 450 minutes

Next, we calculate the percentage of the total work time spent editing:
- Percentage spent editing = (Time spent editing / Total work time) * 100
- Percentage spent editing = (90 / 450) * 100 = 0.2 * 100 = 20%

The final numerical answer is 20%."

- \( \frac{12 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups per bag}} = 6 \text{ bags} \)

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles:
- \( \frac{4 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups per bottle}} = 2 \text{ bottles} \)

Finally, to find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:
- \( 6 \text{ bags} - 2 \text{ bottles} = 4 \)

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the energy saved by Mel, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the energy consumption of the air conditioner per hour.
2. Determine the daily energy consumption after the reduction.
3. Calculate the total energy saved in 30 days.

First, the air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour. Reducing the usage by 5 hours a day means the new usage is 8 - 5 = 3 hours a day.

The daily energy consumption after the reduction is:
\[ 900 \text{ watts/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 2700 \text{ watt-hours/day} \]

To convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours, we divide by 1000:
\[ 2700 \text{ watt-hours/day} = 2.7 \text{ kilowatt-hours/day} \]

Now, to find the total energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the daily energy saved by 30:
\[ 2.7 \text{ kilowatt-hours/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 81 \text{ kilowatt-hours} \]

So, the total kilowatt-hours of electric energy saved in 30 days is 81 kilowatt-hours. The final numerical answer is:

81"
"First, let's calculate the total number of stripes on all the zebras Jane counted.

- Two zebras with 17 stripes each: \(2 \times 17 = 34\) stripes
- One zebra with 36 stripes: \(36\) stripes
- One zebra with half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes: \(36 / 2 = 18\) stripes

Now, let's add up all the stripes:
\[34 + 36 + 18 = 88\]

To find the average number of stripes, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras:
\[88 \div 4 = 22\]

So, the zebras have on average 22 stripes."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of meat and cheese required and then calculate the cost based on the given prices.

First, let's find out how many sandwiches are needed to serve 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each sandwich serves:
\[ \text{Number of sandwiches} = \frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people/sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of meat and cheese needed. Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese:
\[ \text{Total meat needed} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound/sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]
\[ \text{Total cheese needed} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound/sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the meat and cheese. The meat costs $7.00 per pound and the cheese costs $3.00 per pound:
\[ \text{Cost of meat} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times \$7.00/\text{pound} = \$35.00 \]
\[ \text{Cost of cheese} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times \$3.00/\text{pound} = \$15.00 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese to find the total amount spent:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$35.00 + \$15.00 = \$50.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of cannolis**: Allan initially has 40 cannolis.
2. **Corn to cannolis ratio**: There is twice as much corn as cannolis. Therefore, initially, Allan has \(2 \times 40 = 80\) corns.
3. **Cannolis after buying more**: Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new total of cannolis is \(40 + 60 = 100\).
4. **Corn after buying fewer**: Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought, so he bought \(60 - 40 = 20\) fewer corns. Therefore, the new total of corns is \(80 - 20 = 60\).

Now, to find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house, we add the new totals of corns and cannolis:

\[ 100 \text{ (cannolis)} + 60 \text{ (corns)} = 160 \]

So, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 160."
"Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day. He has already completed half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which means he has taken 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps so far. He also took an additional 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. Therefore, before his jog, he had taken 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps. This means that during his jog, he took 10,000 - 6,000 = 4,000 steps.

So, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is 4,000."
"First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:

\[ \text{Total words} = \text{Number of pages} \times \text{Words per page} = 45 \times 200 = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, let's determine how long it will take Toby to read the entire book:

\[ \text{Time to read the book} = \frac{\text{Total words}}{\text{Words per minute}} = \frac{9000}{300} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby plans to leave the airport in 60 minutes and it takes 10 minutes to get there. Therefore, he needs to start reading 70 minutes before he needs to be at the airport:

\[ \text{Time to start reading} = 60 - 10 = 50 \text{ minutes before the airport} \]

Since it takes 30 minutes to read the book, Toby will finish reading 30 minutes before he needs to be at the airport. Therefore, he will be:

\[ 50 - 30 = 20 \text{ minutes early} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

   - Weeks in May: 4 (assuming May has 4 weeks)
   - Total hours worked by employees in May: \( 40 \text{ employees} \times 40 \text{ hours/employee/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 6400 \text{ hours} \)

2. **Calculate the total amount of money paid to employees in May:**
   - Hourly wage: $15
   - Total amount paid in May: \( 6400 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 96000 \text{ dollars} \)

3. **Calculate the number of employees whose contracts expired in June:**
   - Number of employees whose contracts expired: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \)

4. **Calculate the total number of employees remaining in June:**
   - Number of employees remaining: \( 40 - 10 = 30 \)

5. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by employees in June:**
   - Hours worked per employee per week: 40
   - Weeks in June: 4 (assuming June has 4 weeks)
   - Total hours worked by employees in June: \( 30 \text{ employees} \times 40 \text{ hours/employee/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 4800 \text{ hours} \)

6. **Calculate the total amount of money paid to employees in June:**
   - Hourly wage: $15
   - Total amount paid in June: \( 4800 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 72000 \text{ dollars} \)

"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is sold in a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. Sally bought 2 pounds of taffy.

For the first pound, the cost is $3.
For the second pound, the cost is $3 - $1.50 = $1.50 (since it's half off).

So, the total cost for the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50 and the magnets cost $0.25 each. Sally bought 4 magnets.

The total cost for the seashells and magnets is $1.50 + 4 * $0.25 = $1.50 + $1.00 = $2.50.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items Sally bought:
Total cost = Cost of taffy + Cost of seashells and magnets
Total cost = $4.50 + $2.50 = $7.00.

Sally's parents gave her $10 to spend. So, the amount of money Sally has left is:
Money left = Initial amount - Total cost
Money left = $10 - $7.00 = $3.00.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the two packs of fireworks. The first pack costs $400, and the second pack costs twice as much, which is $800. So, the total cost for the two packs before the discount is:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Next, Tim gets a 20% discount on these fireworks. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $1200:

\[ 0.20 \times 1200 = 240 \]

Subtracting the discount from the total cost of the fireworks gives:

\[ 1200 - 240 = 960 \]

Now, Tim also buys a finale firework that costs $150. Adding this to the discounted cost of the fireworks gives the total amount spent:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

So, the total amount Tim spent is:

\[ 1110 \]"
"Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies a night. Over 30 days, she will eat:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. We know that 5% of the candles are dangerous and have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. Additionally, 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode. Therefore, 1% of the candles are dangerous and do not have the defect.

First, let's find out how many candles are dangerous:
\[ \text{Number of dangerous candles} = 5\% \text{ of } 50000 = 0.05 \times 50000 = 2500 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these dangerous candles also have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. Since 5% of the candles are dangerous and have the defect, we calculate:
\[ \text{Number of dangerous candles with the defect} = 5\% \text{ of } 2500 = 0.05 \times 2500 = 125 \]

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is:

"Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees as \( A \).

From the problem, we know:
- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples.
- Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
- Joanne's sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
- Joanne's sister doesn't take any apples from the average trees, so she contributes 0 apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is:
\[ 30 + 15 + A \]

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne's sister is:
\[ 60 + 45 + 0 = 105 \]

The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500:
\[ (30 + 15 + A) + (60 + 45 + 0) = 500 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 30 + 15 + A + 60 + 45 = 500 \]
\[ 150 + A = 500 \]

Solving for \( A \):
\[ A = 500 - 150 \]
\[ A = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees."
"Let's denote the number of camels as \( C \) and the number of dromedaries as \( D \).

From the problem, we have two equations:
1. The total number of heads: \( C + D = 180 \)
2. The total number of humps: \( 2C + D = 304 \)

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, we can express \( C \) in terms of \( D \) from the first equation:
\[ C = 180 - D \]

Next, we substitute \( C = 180 - D \) into the second equation:
\[ 2(180 - D) + D = 304 \]
\[ 360 - 2D + D = 304 \]
\[ 360 - D = 304 \]
\[ -D = 304 - 360 \]
\[ -D = -56 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

To find the number of camels, we substitute \( D = 56 \) back into the equation \( C = 180 - D \):
\[ C = 180 - 56 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

To verify, we check the total number of humps:
\[ 2C + D = 2(124) + 56 = 248 + 56 = 304 \]

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we need to break down the distances traveled each day and then sum them up.

1. **First 4 days:**
   - Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day.
   - Total distance for the first 4 days = 4 days * 200 km/day = 800 km.

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - Tom traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days.
   - Distance traveled in the next 2 days = 30% of 800 km = 0.30 * 800 km = 240 km.

3. **The next day:**
   - Tom didn't travel at all.
   - Distance traveled on the next day = 0 km.

4. **Second week:**
   - Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day.
   - Total distance for the second week = 7 days * 300 km/day = 2100 km.

Now, we sum up all the distances:
- Total distance = Distance for the first 4 days + Distance for the next 2 days + Distance for the next day + Distance for the second week
- Total distance = 800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km.

The total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is 3140 kilometers."
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, let's start by determining the size of Zack's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Peter's locker size} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Zack's locker size} \]

Given that Peter's locker size is 5 cubic inches, we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[ 5 = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Zack's locker size} \]

To find Zack's locker size, we multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Now, we know that Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. Let's denote the size of Timothy's locker as \( T \). Therefore, we have:

\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = \frac{1}{2} \times T \]

Since we already know Zack's locker size is 20 cubic inches, we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[ 20 = \frac{1}{2} \times T \]

To find \( T \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ T = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches} \]

So, the size of Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches."

"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service with the given pricing structure, we need to break down the cost into segments based on the different rates.

1. **First 6 months**: The cost is $8 per month.
   - Total cost for the first 6 months = 6 months * $8/month = $48.

2. **Next 2 months (months 7 and 8)**: The cost is the normal rate of $12 per month.
   - Total cost for the next 2 months = 2 months * $12/month = $24.

3. **Next 8 months (months 9 to 16)**: The cost is the increased rate of $14 per month.
   - Total cost for the next 8 months = 8 months * $14/month = $112.

4. **Remaining 4 months (months 17 to 20)**: The cost is the increased rate of $14 per month.
   - Total cost for the remaining 4 months = 4 months * $14/month = $56.

Now, we sum up all the costs to get the total cost for 2 years:
- Total cost = $48 (first 6 months) + $24 (next 2 months) + $112 (next 8 months) + $56 (remaining 4 months) = $236.

\[ \text{Gas per container} = \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5 \text{ containers}} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Josey needed \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a container, so we calculate the amount of gas she needed:

\[ \text{Gas needed by Josey} = \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to convert gallons to pints. Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we can convert \( \frac{3}{4} \) gallons to pints as follows:

\[ \text{Gas needed by Josey in pints} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints per gallon} = \frac{3 \times 8}{4} = \frac{24}{4} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount of money George spent:**
   George spent $5.

2. **Determine the amount of money George had left:**
   Since he had 1% of his money left, the amount he had left is:
   \[
   0.01 \times 5 = 0.05 \text{ dollars} = 5 \text{ cents}
   \]

3. **Determine the amount of money George spent on chips:**
   Since he spent $5 in total and had 5 cents left, the amount spent on chips is:
   \[
   5 - 0.05 = 4.95 \text{ dollars} = 495 \text{ cents}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of bags of chips George bought:**
   Each bag of chips costs 40 cents, so the number of bags of chips he bought is:
   \[
   \frac{495}{40} = 12.375
   \]
   Since George can only buy whole bags of chips, he bought 12 bags of chips.

5. **Calculate the total cost of the chips George bought:**
   The cost of 12 bags of chips is:
   \[
   12 \times 40 = 480 \text{ cents}
   \]

6. **Determine the amount of money George spent on candy bars:**
   The total amount spent on chips is 480 cents, so the amount spent on candy bars is:
   \[
   495 - 480 = 15 \text{ cents}
   \]

7. **Determine the number of candy bars George bought:**
   Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so the number of candy bars he bought is:
   \[
   \frac{15}{75} = 0.2
   \]
   Since George can only buy whole candy bars, he bought 0 candy bars.

Therefore, the number of candy bars George bought is:
\[
\boxed{0}

"Rory and her mom each have a piece, which means they have 2 pieces in total. The cake weighs 20 ounces, and Rory cuts it into 8 pieces. Therefore, the weight of the remaining cake is:

\[ 20 \text{ ounces} - 2 \text{ pieces} \times \frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ pieces}} = 20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces} \]

So, the remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"First, we need to find the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have together. Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges, so the total number of oranges is:

\[ 34 + 22 = 56 \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of people sharing the oranges. Sitti and Juris are sharing with their 6 other friends, so the total number of people is:

\[ 2 + 6 = 8 \]

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people:

\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

So, everyone will get 7 oranges. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 7 \]"
"First, let's determine the amount of onions Antoine uses. The recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, and he doubles that amount:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00 \text{ per pound} = \$8.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box is $2.00:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00 \text{ per box} = \$4.00 \]

The total cost for the ingredients is the sum of the cost of the onions and the beef stock:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

\[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00 \text{ per serving} \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is:

\[ \$2.00 \]

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's determine the time it takes for Wayne to drive to the theater. According to the information provided, Wayne's drive takes 4 minutes.

Since the drive from Bernadette’s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne’s hotel, we can calculate the time it takes for Bernadette to drive to the theater as follows:
\[ \text{Time for Bernadette's drive} = 4 \times \text{Time for Wayne's drive} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Therefore, Bernadette should leave 5 minutes earlier than the time Wayne will arrive at the theater.

Since Wayne's drive takes 4 minutes and he will arrive 5 minutes later than Bernadette, we need to add the 4 minutes of Wayne's drive to the 5 minutes Bernadette needs to arrive early:
\[ \text{Total time Bernadette needs to leave} = 4 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, Bernadette should leave 9 minutes before Wayne to get to the theater first.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 9 \]"
"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to determine the width of the room. We know the area of the room and the length, so we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

Given:
- Area = 360 square feet
- Length = 3 yards

First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Now we can use the area formula to find the width:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{Width} \]

Solving for the width:

\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can calculate the perimeter of the rectangle using the formula:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

So, the perimeter of the room is 98 feet."
"First, let's calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

So, the total number of beads Elizabeth bought is:
\[ 1 \text{ pack of red} + 2 \text{ packs of clear} = 1 \times 20 + 2 \times 20 = 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ beads} \]

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

So, the total number of beads Margareth bought is:
\[ 3 \text{ packs of blue} + 4 \text{ packs of red} = 3 \times 20 + 4 \times 20 = 60 + 80 = 140 \text{ beads} \]

Now, let's find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:
\[ 140 \text{ beads} - 60 \text{ beads} = 80 \text{ beads} \]

So, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven being on for 3 hours. Since the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour, the total increase in temperature is:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees} \]

Adding this to the initial temperature of 40 degrees, we get:

\[ 40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} = 55 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, let's calculate the temperature decrease due to the window being open for 30 minutes. Since the window cools the house by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes it is open, the total decrease in temperature is:

\[ \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 3 \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 6 \text{ degrees} \]

Subtracting this from the temperature after the oven was on, we get:

\[ 55 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the house's final temperature is:

\[ 49 \text{ degrees} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 49 \]"
"First, let's convert all times to minutes for easier calculation:
- Jon's swim time: 40 minutes
- Jon's bike ride time: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 60 + 20 = 80 minutes
- Jon's run time: 50 minutes

Now, let's calculate James's times:
- James's swim time: Jon's swim time minus 10% of Jon's swim time
  \[
  \text{James's swim time} = 40 - (0.10 \times 40) = 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ minutes}
  \]
- James's bike ride time: Jon's bike ride time plus 5 minutes
  \[
  \text{James's bike ride time} = 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes}
  \]
- James's run time: We need to find this.

The total time for Jon is:
\[
\text{Jon's total time} = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes}
\]

Let James's run time be \( x \) minutes. Then James's total time is:
\[
\text{James's total time} = 36 + 85 + x = 121 + x \text{ minutes}
\]

We know that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[
121 + x = 170 + 10
\]
\[
121 + x = 180
\]
\[
x = 180 - 121
\]
\[
x = 59
\]

So, James's run time is 59 minutes. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{59}

"First, let's convert the length of Movie C from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the length of Movie C in minutes as follows:

\[ 1.25 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, the length of Movie B in minutes is:

\[ 75 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, we can find the length of Movie A by dividing the length of Movie B by 4:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ minutes}}{4} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine how many miles the horse runs. The horse runs at a speed of 32 miles per hour for 30 minutes, which is half an hour. Therefore, the distance the horse runs is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 32 \text{ miles/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate how much hay the horse eats. For every mile the horse runs, it eats 1/2 a bail of hay. So for 16 miles, the horse eats:

\[ \text{Hay eaten} = 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail/mile} = 8 \text{ bails} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the hay. Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost for 8 bails is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars/bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which means he has:

\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the hay, the change Michael has is:

\[ \text{Change} = 30 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

"First, let's determine the total number of eggs Rozanne has:

- She uses 4 dozen eggs. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen equals \(4 \times 12 = 48\) eggs.
- She also has 2 loose eggs.

So, the total number of eggs is \(48 + 2 = 50\) eggs.

Next, we need to find out how many glasses of eggnog she can make. Each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs. Therefore, the number of glasses she can make is:

\[
\frac{50 \text{ eggs}}{5 \text{ eggs/glass}} = 10 \text{ glasses}
\]

Now, we need to determine how many trays she can put out. Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog. Therefore, the number of trays she can put out is:

"Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as \( P \).

The cost of the super ticket is $20, and it includes one popcorn and one soda for an extra $1. So, the total cost for the super ticket is $20 + $1 = $21.

The cost of buying a movie ticket for $12 and a popcorn and a soda at regular prices is $12 + \( P \) + $3 = $15 + \( P \).

According to the problem, you saved $2 by buying the super ticket instead of buying the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda separately. Therefore, the cost of buying the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda separately is $2 more than the cost of the super ticket. This can be expressed as:

\[ 15 + P = 21 + 2 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 15 + P = 23 \]

To find \( P \), we subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ P = 23 - 15 \]
\[ P = 8 \]

So, the regular price of popcorn is $8."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the initial cost per balloon and then calculate the new cost per balloon after the price increase. Finally, we will use this new cost to find out how much Bentley paid for 170 balloons.

First, let's find the initial cost per balloon. The total cost for 20 balloons was $900. Therefore, the cost per balloon initially is:
\[ \text{Initial cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. So, the new cost per balloon is:
\[ \text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons at the new cost per balloon:
\[ \text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = 170 \times 65 \]

Let's calculate this:
\[ 170 \times 65 = 170 \times (60 + 5) = 170 \times 60 + 170 \times 5 = 10200 + 850 = 11050 \]

So, the total amount Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons is:

"To find the average speed of the car during the entire trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance for each segment of the trip:
- For the first segment, the car drives at 60 mph for 2 hours. The distance is \(60 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles}\).
- For the second segment, the car drives at 30 mph for 1 hour. The distance is \(30 \text{ mph} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 30 \text{ miles}\).

The total distance traveled is \(120 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 150 \text{ miles}\).

The total time taken for the trip is \(2 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} = 3 \text{ hours}\).

The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time:
\[ \text{Average speed} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ mph} \]

So, the car's average speed during the trip is 50 mph."
"First, let's calculate the value of the sapphires Jenna has left after the trade. Jenna started with 8 sapphires and traded 3 of them. So, she has 5 sapphires left.

The value of the sapphires she has left is:
\[ 5 \text{ sapphires} \times \$800 \text{ per sapphire} = \$4000 \]

Next, let's calculate the value of the rubies Jenna received from the trade. She traded 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. Since the rubies are worth $1200 each, the total value of the 2 rubies is:
\[ 2 \text{ rubies} \times \$1200 \text{ per ruby} = \$2400 \]

Now, we add the value of the sapphires she has left to the value of the rubies she received:

"First, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the raised bed) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

For one raised bed, the volume is:

\[ V = 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:

\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 \, \text{cubic feet} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet per bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{dollars per bag} = 1920 \, \text{dollars} \]

Thus, the total cost for the potting soil is:

"First, let's determine the number of green cards. We know there are 15 red cards and 60% more green cards than red cards.

The number of green cards is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Number of green cards} = \text{Number of red cards} + 0.60 \times \text{Number of red cards} \]
\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + 0.60 \times 15 \]
\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + 9 \]
\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 24 \]

Next, we calculate the number of yellow cards. The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards:
\[ \text{Number of yellow cards} = \text{Number of red cards} + \text{Number of green cards} \]
\[ \text{Number of yellow cards} = 15 + 24 \]
\[ \text{Number of yellow cards} = 39 \]

Now, we can find the total number of cards by adding the number of red, green, and yellow cards:
\[ \text{Total number of cards} = \text{Number of red cards} + \text{Number of green cards} + \text{Number of yellow cards} \]
\[ \text{Total number of cards} = 15 + 24 + 39 \]

- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
- Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
- Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, let's sum up the total weight of all the feed:

Total weight = 2 pounds (sugar cubes) + 48 pounds (carrots) + 3150 pounds (hay) + 1300 pounds (oats)
Total weight = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300
Total weight = 4500 pounds

The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips are needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:

Therefore, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To determine how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate her weekly earnings and then multiply by four.

First, let's calculate her weekly earnings from aluminum cans:
- Each aluminum can is worth 2 cents.
- She drinks 3 aluminum cans a week.

Weekly earnings from aluminum cans = 3 cans/week * 2 cents/can = 6 cents/week.

Next, let's calculate her weekly earnings from plastic bottles:
- Each plastic bottle is worth 3 cents.
- She drinks 5 plastic bottles a week.

Weekly earnings from plastic bottles = 5 bottles/week * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents/week.

Now, let's find her total weekly earnings:
- Total weekly earnings = Weekly earnings from aluminum cans + Weekly earnings from plastic bottles
- Total weekly earnings = 6 cents/week + 15 cents/week = 21 cents/week.

Finally, let's calculate her total earnings for a four-week month:
- Total earnings for four weeks = Total weekly earnings * 4 weeks
- Total earnings for four weeks = 21 cents/week * 4 weeks = 84 cents.

The final numerical answer is 84 cents."

"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll use inches.

1 foot = 12 inches

The shark's length is 10 feet, which is:
\[ 10 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 120 \text{ inches} \]

Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is:
\[ 2 \times 6 \text{ inches} = 12 \text{ inches} \]

To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Length of remoras}}{\text{Length of shark}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{120 \text{ inches}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{10} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

"To find out how many kids are not allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion. First, we need to find out how many kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both.

The number of kids allergic to dairy is 9.
The number of kids allergic to peanuts is 6.
The number of kids allergic to both is 3.

Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion, the number of kids allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Allergic to dairy or peanuts} = \text{Allergic to dairy} + \text{Allergic to peanuts} - \text{Allergic to both} \]
\[ \text{Allergic to dairy or peanuts} = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both. Since there are 32 kids in total, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:
\[ \text{Not allergic to anything} = \text{Total kids} - \text{Allergic to dairy or peanuts} \]
\[ \text{Not allergic to anything} = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is 20."

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, let's add the total number of oranges brought by both Brianne and Ashley:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Each Greek orange pie requires three oranges. To find out how many pies they can make, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed per pie:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ oranges}}{3 \text{ oranges/pie}} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 40 \]"
"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let's denote the number of guests by \( n \).

**Cost at the first venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Cost of food per guest: $5
- Total cost at the first venue: \( 200 + 5n \)

**Cost at the second venue:**
- Cost per guest: $25
- Cost of food per guest: $5 (already included in the price)
- Total cost at the second venue: \( 25n \)

We need to find the value of \( n \) for which the costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5n = 25n \]

Now, solve for \( n \):
\[ 200 + 5n = 25n \]
\[ 200 = 25n - 5n \]
\[ 200 = 20n \]
\[ n = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ n = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \( D \). According to the problem, Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects. Additionally, David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.

The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides to isolate the term with \( D \):

\[ 4D = 36 \]

Now, divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( D \):

\[ D = 9 \]

Since Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects, we substitute \( D = 9 \) into the expression:

\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Therefore, Lily found 16 insects. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 16 \]"
"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to calculate the total amount of yarn used by both of them and then convert that into yards.

Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein, and her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein. Together, they used:

\[ \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ of a skein} \]

Since there are 364 yards in a skein, the total yards of yarn used is:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 364 \]

Let's calculate this:
```python
# Given values
yards_per_skein = 364
fraction_used = 3/4

# Total yards used
total_yards_used = fraction_used * yards_per_skein
total_yards_used

"First, let's determine the width of the rug. Since the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair and the chair is 3 feet wide, the rug's width is:

\[ \text{Rug's width} = \text{Chair's width} + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the length of the couch. The problem states that the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Since the rug's width is 8 feet, twice the width of the rug is:

\[ 2 \times \text{Rug's width} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ feet} \]

Adding 2 feet to this value gives us the length of the couch:

\[ \text{Couch's length} = 16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet} \]

So, the length of the couch is 18 feet."
"Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( S \). Suzie bought four packs of gum in total, with two packs being strawberry. She also bought one pack of grape gum for $2 and a small pack of green apple gum for half the price of the grape gum, which is $1.

The total cost of the gum can be expressed as:
\[ 2S + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2S = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2."
"First, let's determine how many 2 x 4 pieces Frederick can buy with $24. Each 2 x 4 costs $4.

\[ \text{Number of 2 x 4 pieces} = \frac{\$24}{\$4} = 6 \]

Next, let's determine how many 2 x 8 pieces Frederick can buy with $24. Each 2 x 8 costs $6.

\[ \text{Number of 2 x 8 pieces} = \frac{\$24}{\$6} = 4 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of popsicle sticks he can get from each type of wood.

For 2 x 4 pieces:
\[ \text{Total sticks from 2 x 4} = 6 \times 200 = 1200 \]

For 2 x 8 pieces:
\[ \text{Total sticks from 2 x 8} = 4 \times 400 = 1600 \]

Since Frederick wants to buy the cheapest lumber, he should buy the 2 x 4 pieces. Therefore, the most popsicle sticks he can make is from the 2 x 4 pieces.

The final numerical answer is:
1200"
"To determine the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his sled dogs, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
2. Determine the number of pairs of legs (since each pair of snowshoes is for one pair of legs).
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of pairs of legs.

First, we know that each dog has 4 legs and there are 6 dogs:
\[ 4 \text{ legs/dog} \times 6 \text{ dogs} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Since each pair of snowshoes covers one pair of legs, we need to find out how many pairs of legs there are:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs/pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs of legs} \]

Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, so the total cost for 12 pairs of snowshoes is:
\[ 12 \text{ pairs} \times 12 \text{ dollars/pair} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is:
\[ 144 \text{ dollars} \]"
"To determine how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her current bus trips and compare it to the cost of the weekly bus pass.

First, let's calculate the total cost of her current bus trips:
- Janet takes two bus trips each day.
- She takes these trips five days a week.
- Each bus trip costs $2.20.

The total number of bus trips she takes in a week is:
\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 10 \text{ trips/week} \]

The total cost of her current bus trips in a week is:
\[ 10 \text{ trips/week} \times \$2.20 \text{ per trip} = \$22.00 \text{ per week} \]

Next, we compare this to the cost of the weekly bus pass:
- The weekly bus pass costs $20.

The amount Janet would save by buying the weekly bus pass instead of her current trips is:
\[ \$22.00 - \$20.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, Janet would save \(\boxed{2}\) dollars by buying the weekly bus pass."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Farm's Cows and Sheep:**
   - The farm has 30 cows.
   - The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has \(2 \times 30 = 60\) cows.

2. **Zoo's Cows and Sheep:**
   - The zoo has 20 sheep.
   - The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has \(\frac{20}{2} = 10\) sheep.

3. **Total Animals:**
   - The farm has 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.
   - The zoo has 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.
   - Combined, the farm and zoo have 40 + 80 = 120 animals.

"To find out how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we first need to determine the number of onions and potatoes she bought based on the information given about Rose.

Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought. Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as \( S_o \) and the number of potatoes Sophia bought as \( S_p \).

From the information given:
\[ 4 \times (S_o + S_p) = 12 + 4 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[ 4 \times (S_o + S_p) = 16 \]

Dividing both sides by 4:
\[ S_o + S_p = 4 \]

So, Sophia bought a total of 4 onions and potatoes. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we first need to calculate the total number of calories he needs to burn to lose 30 pounds. Given that he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose one pound, the total calories he needs to burn to lose 30 pounds is:

\[ 3500 \text{ calories/pound} \times 30 \text{ pounds} = 105000 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to determine the number of days from December 31st to July 19th. We can break this down into months:

- December: 31 days
- January: 31 days
- February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
- March: 31 days
- April: 30 days
- May: 31 days

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, the house cost three times as much as the lot, so we can write:

\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]

Combining like terms, we have:

\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

To find \( L \), we divide both sides by 4:

\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000 \]

Now that we know the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):

\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000 \]

So, the cost of the house is $90,000."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the canvas bags that Tara bought. She bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each, and each pack costs $4.

Total cost = Number of packs × Number of bags per pack × Cost per pack
Total cost = 8 × 5 × $4
Total cost = 40 × $4
Total cost = $160

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the canvas bags. She sold each of the 40 bags for $8.

Total revenue = Number of bags sold × Price per bag
Total revenue = 40 × $8
Total revenue = $320

"First, let's calculate Ada's daily electric consumption before and after adding the new device.

**Before adding the new device:**
- Daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour
- Cost per kilowatt per hour: $1.50

Daily cost before:
\[ 12 \, \text{kWh/day} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$18.00/\text{day} \]

**After adding the new device:**
- Daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour + 2 kilowatts per hour = 14 kilowatts per hour
- Cost per kilowatt per hour: $1.50

Daily cost after:
\[ 14 \, \text{kWh/day} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$21.00/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate the weekly cost for both scenarios.

**Weekly cost before:**

The difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is \$21.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which the people can paint the house and then scale it up for 5 people.

First, let's find out how much one person can paint in one day. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then in one day, one person can paint:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \text{ house} \div 5 \text{ days} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ house per day}
\]

This means that one person can paint \(\frac{1}{10}\) of a house in one day. Therefore, in one day, 5 people can paint:

\[
5 \times \frac{1}{10} \text{ house} = \frac{5}{10} \text{ house} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ house}
\]

So, 5 people can paint half a house in one day. To paint a whole house, it would take:

\[
\frac{1 \text{ house}}{\frac{1}{2} \text{ house per day}} = 2 \text{ days}
\]

Since we need the answer in hours, and there are 24 hours in a day, it would take:

\[
2 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 48 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. Therefore, Ophelia has \(20 + 2 = 22\) chairs.
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. So, Jenna has \(3 \times 22 = 66\) chairs.
4. Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, Ophelia also has 22 sofas (as calculated earlier).
5. Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so Jenna has \(66 - 2 = 64\) sofas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have together:

- Ophelia's total: \(20\) sofas + \(22\) chairs = \(42\)
- Jenna's total: \(64\) sofas + \(66\) chairs = \(130\)

Adding their totals together:

\[42 + 130 = 172\]

"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had not bought the headphone set, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the cost of the headphone set.
2. Subtract the cost of the headphone set from the total amount Tom paid to find out how much he spent on CDs.
3. Divide the amount spent on CDs by the cost of one CD to find out how many CDs he could have bought.

Let's start with the first step:

1. The total amount Tom paid is $48, and he spent $4 on a CD. So, the cost of the headphone set is:
   \[
   48 - 4 = 44
   \]
   Therefore, the cost of the headphone set is $44.

2. Now, we subtract the cost of the headphone set from the total amount to find out how much he spent on CDs:
   \[
   48 - 44 = 4
   \]
   So, Tom spent $4 on CDs.

3. Since each CD costs $4, the number of CDs he could have bought with the $4 is:
   \[
   \frac{4}{4} = 1
   \]

Therefore, if Tom had not bought the headphone set, he would have been able to buy 1 more CD. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \text{ hours/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to account for the additional hours he worked out in the two weeks where he worked out 5 hours each week:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

Then, we need to account for the additional hour he worked out in the week where he worked out 6 hours:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/week} \times 1 \text{ week} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add all these hours together:
\[ 32 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:
\[ 48 \text{ hours} \]"
"Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 people get off. Then, 5 times as many people as those who got off get on. So, \(5 \times 8 = 40\) people get on the bus. The number of people on the bus after the first stop is:
\[48 - 8 + 40 = 80\]

At the second stop, 21 people get off. Then, 3 times fewer people get on compared to those who got off. So, \(21 \div 3 = 7\) people get on the bus. The number of people on the bus after the second stop is:
\[80 - 21 + 7 = 66\]

The final numerical answer is 66."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, Jame's current age is \( 27 - 5 = 22 \) years.

2. **Determine the cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 22 + 8 = 30 \) years old.
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \).
   - Therefore, Jame's cousin will be \( 60 - 5 = 55 \) years old in 8 years.

3. **Determine the cousin's current age:**
   - If Jame's cousin will be 55 in 8 years, then the cousin's current age is \( 55 - 8 = 47 \) years.

4. **Calculate the age difference between Jame and his cousin:**
   - Jame is currently 22 years old.
   - His cousin is currently 47 years old.
   - The age difference is \( 47 - 22 = 25 \) years.

The final numerical answer is 25."
"Let's break down the information given:

- The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400.
- The computer costs $1,100.
- The printer costs $400 less than the computer, so the printer costs $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the computer and the printer:
- Cost of the computer: $1,100
- Cost of the printer: $700
- Total cost of the computer and the printer: $1,100 + $700 = $1,800

Since the total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400, we can find the total cost of the 2 monitors by subtracting the total cost of the computer and the printer from the total cost:
- Total cost of the computer and the printer: $1,800
- Total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer: $2,400
- Total cost of the 2 monitors: $2,400 - $1,800 = $600

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the total cost of the 2 monitors by 2:
- Total cost of the 2 monitors: $600
- Cost of one monitor: $600 / 2 = $300

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is $300."
"To find out how many seashells each girl brought, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of boys and girls.
2. Calculate the total number of seashells brought by the boys.
3. Calculate the total number of seashells brought by the girls.

First, since there are 20 kids in total and they are divided into two equal groups of girls and boys, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

Next, each boy brought back 60 seashells. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is:
\[ 10 \text{ boys} \times 60 \text{ seashells/boy} = 600 \text{ seashells} \]

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. So, the total number of seashells brought by the girls is:
\[ 600 \text{ seashells} + 4 \times 600 \text{ seashells} = 600 \text{ seashells} + 2400 \text{ seashells} = 3000 \text{ seashells} \]

Since there are 10 girls, the number of seashells each girl brought is:
\[ \frac{3000 \text{ seashells}}{10 \text{ girls}} = 300 \text{ seashells/girl} \]

Thus, the number of seashells brought by each girl is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"If George has 3 candies left after eating 5, it means George originally had 3 + 5 = 8 candies.

"First, let's determine Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, we can calculate Alyana's age as follows:

Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4
Alyana's age = 10 - 4
Alyana's age = 6

Next, we need to find Anne's age. Since Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, we can calculate Anne's age as follows:

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2
Anne's age = 6 + 2
Anne's age = 8

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 8."
"To find the total thickness of the four books, let's calculate the thickness of each book step by step:

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so it is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm thick.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm thick.

Now, let's add the thicknesses of all four books together:

\[31 + 50 + 45 + 62\]

First, add 31 and 50:

\[31 + 50 = 81\]

Next, add 45 to the result:

\[81 + 45 = 126\]

Finally, add 62 to the result:

\[126 + 62 = 188\]

So, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."

"To calculate the total amount you ended up paying, we need to first calculate the tip and then add it to the original dinner bill.

The tip is 20% of the $50 dinner bill. 

\[ \text{Tip} = 50 \times \frac{20}{100} = 50 \times 0.20 = 10 \]

So, the total amount you paid is the original bill plus the tip:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 50 + 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 60."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Sharing:**
   - The total amount is $18.
   - It is shared among 3 boys.
   - Each boy's initial share is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, each boy gets $6 initially.

2. **Eldest Boy's Actions:**
   - The eldest boy adds $5 to his share.
   - His new share becomes \( 6 + 5 = 11 \) dollars.
   - The following day, he adds another $10.
   - His total becomes \( 11 + 10 = 21 \) dollars.

3. **Spending:**
   - The eldest boy spends $8.
   - His remaining amount is \( 21 - 8 = 13 \) dollars.

4. **Tripling the Remaining Amount:**
   - He triples the remaining amount.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and use the information given.

First, let's determine the total number of days in April. April has 30 days.

Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half of the month as he does in the first half. This means the first half of the month (15 days) and the second half of the month (15 days) will have different daily savings amounts.

Let's denote the daily savings in the first half of the month as \( x \). Therefore, the daily savings in the second half of the month will be \( 2x \).

The total savings for the first half of the month will be:
\[ 15x \]

The total savings for the second half of the month will be:
\[ 15 \times 2x = 30x \]

The total savings for the entire month will be the sum of the savings from both halves:
\[ 15x + 30x = 45x \]

We know that Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 45:
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Elvis has to save $25 for each day in the first half of the month. For the second half of the month, he has to save:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save $50 for each day in the second half of the month.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 50 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the apples:
- Verna bought 3 apples at $1.50 each.
- Total cost for apples = 3 * $1.50 = $4.50

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the oranges:
- Verna bought 5 oranges at $0.80 each.
- Total cost for oranges = 5 * $0.80 = $4.00

Then, let's calculate the total cost of the peaches:
- Verna bought 6 peaches at $0.75 each.
- Total cost for peaches = 6 * $0.75 = $4.50

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the fruits:
- Total cost = Cost of apples + Cost of oranges + Cost of peaches
- Total cost = $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

Verna gave $20 to the seller. To find out the change she received, we subtract the total cost of the fruits from the amount she gave:
- Change received = Amount given - Total cost
- Change received = $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

The final numerical answer is $7.00."
"First, let's calculate how much Jairus earns for completing 20 tasks. Jairus earns $0.8 for each task, so for 20 tasks, he earns:

\[ 0.8 \times 20 = 16 \]

Next, let's calculate how much Jenny earns for completing 20 tasks. Jenny earns $0.5 for each task, so for 20 tasks, she earns:

\[ 0.5 \times 20 = 10 \]

Now, to find out how much more Jairus earns than Jenny, we subtract Jenny's earnings from Jairus's earnings:

\[ 16 - 10 = 6 \]

So, Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny."
"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars. The total amount of money they have to divide is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's amount as:

\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars.

The final numerical answer is 80."
"Jeff walks 3 miles to work and 3 miles back home each day, so he walks a total of 3 + 3 = 6 miles each day. If he has to work 5 times a week, then the total miles he walks in a week is 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week. 

The final numerical answer is 30."
"To determine the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Rewriting**: Elise writes the entire alphabet twice.
   - The alphabet has 26 letters.
   - Therefore, writing it twice means \(26 \times 2 = 52\) letters.

2. **Second Rewriting**: Elise writes half of the alphabet once.
   - Half of the alphabet is \(26 / 2 = 13\) letters.
   - Therefore, writing half of the alphabet once means \(13\) letters.

3. **Third Rewriting**: Elise rewrites everything she has already written.
   - This includes the two full alphabets and the half alphabet.
   - The total number of letters already written is \(52 + 13 = 65\).
   - Rewriting everything means writing \(65\) letters again.

Now, we sum up all the letters written:
- First rewriting: \(52\) letters.
- Second rewriting: \(13\) letters.
- Third rewriting: \(65\) letters.

Adding these together:
\[ 52 + 13 + 65 = 130 \]

Therefore, the total number of letters Elise has written is:
\[ 130 \]"

"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break down the commission structure:

1. For the first $1000 of sales, she earns a 30% commission.
2. For sales over $1000, she earns an additional 10% commission on the amount over $1000.

First, let's calculate the commission for the first $1000:
\[ \text{Commission for first } \$1000 = 1000 \times 0.30 = \$300 \]

Next, we calculate the additional commission for the sales over $1000. Antonella sold $2500 worth of goods, so the amount over $1000 is:
\[ 2500 - 1000 = \$1500 \]

The additional commission for the $1500 is:
\[ \text{Additional commission} = 1500 \times 0.10 = \$150 \]

"First, let's determine the daily recommended cups of coffee for Octavia. Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, if we denote the daily recommended cups of coffee as \( R \), then Octavia drinks \( \frac{R}{2} \) cups of coffee.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks. Therefore, Juan drinks \( 10 \times \frac{R}{2} = 5R \) cups of coffee.

According to Juan's doctor, Juan's coffee intake should be reduced to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. This means Juan needs to reduce his coffee intake from \( 5R \) cups to 4 cups.

To find out by how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we calculate the difference between his current intake and the recommended intake:
\[ 5R - 4 \]

Since \( R \) is the daily recommended cups of coffee, the reduction Juan needs to make is:
\[ 5R - 4 \]

However, without the specific value of \( R \), we can't provide a numerical answer. If we assume \( R \) is the standard daily recommended cups of coffee, which is typically 4 cups, then:
\[ 5 \times 4 - 4 = 20 - 4 = 16 \]

Therefore, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups. The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the pages she read in the first week and then add the pages she read in the second week.

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. Assuming she read every night, she read for 7 nights. So, the total minutes she read in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert the minutes into pages. Judy reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she reads in 1 minute, we divide 2 pages by 1.5 minutes:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Now, we can find out how many pages she read in 105 minutes:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages. So, the total number of pages she read in two weeks is:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 240 \]"
"Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \) sandwiches.

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equation based on the information given.

Let \( S \) be Shiloh's current age, and let \( N \) be his nephew's current age.

From the problem, we know:
1. Shiloh is currently 44 years old, so \( S = 44 \).
2. In 7 years, Shiloh will be \( S + 7 \) years old.
3. In 7 years, his nephew will be \( N + 7 \) years old.
4. In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew, so \( S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \).

Now, substitute \( S = 44 \) into the equation:
\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3N + 21 \]
Subtract 21 from both sides:
\[ 30 = 3N \]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[ N = 10 \]

So, his nephew is currently 10 years old. The final numerical answer is:
10"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Tooth:**
   - The tooth fairy left $5.00.

2. **Next Three Teeth:**
   - For each of these teeth, the tooth fairy gave $1.00.
   - Total for these three teeth: \(3 \times 1.00 = 3.00\).

3. **Last Two Teeth:**
   - For the first of these last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of the previous three teeth, which is \( \frac{1.00}{2} = 0.50 \).
   - For the second of these last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of the previous two teeth, which is \( \frac{1.00}{2} = 0.50 \).
   - Total for these two teeth: \(0.50 + 0.50 = 1.00\).

Now, let's sum up all the amounts:

- First tooth: $5.00
- Next three teeth: $3.00
- Last two teeth: $1.00

Total amount: \(5.00 + 3.00 + 1.00 = 9.00\).

The tooth fairy left Sharon $9.00 in total."
"To find out how many goals all three teenagers scored, we need to determine the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna based on the information given.

First, we know that Richie scored 80 goals. According to the problem, Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. Therefore, we can calculate the number of goals Mark scored as follows:
\[ \text{Goals scored by Mark} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 20 = 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Next, we know that Richie also scored 45 more goals than Anna. Therefore, we can calculate the number of goals Anna scored as follows:
\[ \text{Goals scored by Anna} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 45 = 80 - 45 = 35 \]

Now, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers by adding the goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna:
\[ \text{Total goals} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} + \text{Goals scored by Mark} + \text{Goals scored by Anna} = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 \]

"First, let's determine how much money Peter spends on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. He buys one wooden action figure each day, and each wooden action figure costs $5.

The total cost for wooden action figures from Sunday to Wednesday is:
\[ 5 \text{ dollars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Peter started with $70, so after buying the wooden action figures, he has:
\[ 70 \text{ dollars} - 20 \text{ dollars} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Sunday), he will buy plastic action figures. Each plastic action figure costs $2. The number of plastic action figures he can buy with the remaining $50 is:
\[ \frac{50 \text{ dollars}}{2 \text{ dollars/figure}} = 25 \text{ figures} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week. He bought 4 wooden action figures and 25 plastic action figures:
\[ 4 + 25 = 29 \]

The total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is:
\[ \boxed{29} \]"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to add up all the expenses:

1. Cost of spaying the kitten: $200
2. Cost of 3 vaccines: $20 each, so 3 vaccines cost $20 * 3 = $60

Now, we add these amounts together:

$200 (spaying) + $60 (vaccines) + $48 (repairing vases) = $308

So, the total cost so far is $308."
"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses he grows in a month and compare it to the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops.

First, let's calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a week:
- Ford grows 40 roses every week.

Next, let's calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a month. Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks:
- Total roses grown in a month = 40 roses/week * 4 weeks = 160 roses.

Now, let's calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops in a week:
- First flower shop orders 20 roses.
- Second flower shop orders 15 roses.
- Third flower shop orders 30 roses.
- Total roses ordered by the flower shops in a week = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.

Next, let's calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops in a month:
- Total roses ordered by the flower shops in a month = 65 roses/week * 4 weeks = 260 roses.

Finally, let's determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage error in Maggie's oven and then apply that same percentage error to the 520 degrees she needs for her recipe.

First, let's calculate the percentage error for the 450 degrees setting:

\[
\text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{\text{Actual Temperature} - \text{Set Temperature}}{\text{Set Temperature}} \right) \times 100
\]

\[
\text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{468 - 450}{450} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 = 4\%
\]

Now, we apply this 4% error to the 520 degrees required for her recipe:

\[
\text{Error} = 520 \times \frac{4}{100} = 520 \times 0.04 = 20
\]

\[
\text{Adjusted Temperature} = 520 - 20 = 500
\]

So, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees to achieve the desired temperature for her recipe."
"To find the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to add the duration of the first movie to the duration of the second movie.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Converting this to minutes:
1 hour = 60 minutes
So, 1 hour and 30 minutes = 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting this to minutes:
2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes
So, 2 hours and 5 minutes = 120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes.

Now, we add the durations of the two movies:
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is 215 minutes."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we first need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and then subtract that from Herb's price.

Herb's house price = $76,000

30% of Herb's house price = 0.30 * $76,000 = $22,800

Juan's house price = Herb's house price - 30% of Herb's house price
Juan's house price = $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

Now, we add the prices of both houses to find the combined value:

Combined value = Herb's house price + Juan's house price
Combined value = $76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200

The final numerical answer is $129,200."
"First, let's determine the number of cups and dishes Judy initially bought.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups.

She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.

At the event, her friend brought 40 cups. Since Judy initially bought 12 cups, her friend brought \(40 - 12 = 28\) more cups than Judy bought.

Her friend also brought 20 more dishes than Judy bought. Since Judy bought 24 dishes, her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend.

Total cups brought:
- Judy brought 12 cups.
- Her friend brought 40 cups.
- Total cups = \(12 + 40 = 52\).

Total dishes brought:
- Judy brought 24 dishes.
- Her friend brought 44 dishes.
- Total dishes = \(24 + 44 = 68\).

Finally, the total number of utensils (cups and dishes) brought by the two is:
- Total utensils = Total cups + Total dishes = \(52 + 68 = 120\).

"First, let's calculate the discounted price of one box of contacts. The original price of one box is $100.00, and it is currently 10% off. 

To find the discount amount:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 100.00 \times \frac{10}{100} = 10.00 \]

So, the discounted price of one box is:
\[ \text{Discounted Price} = 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

Since Pete is buying 2 boxes, the total cost for 2 boxes is:
\[ \text{Total Cost for 2 Boxes} = 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost per pair of contacts. Since each box contains 90 single use contacts, 2 boxes will contain:
\[ \text{Total Contacts} = 90 \times 2 = 180 \]

Therefore, the cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ \text{Cost per Pair} = \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 1.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total hours Jill worked.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so:
\[ \text{Total hours Jill worked} = 2 + 1 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total hours John worked. John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday and three times as long as Jill on Sunday.

On Saturday, John worked:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

On Sunday, John worked:
\[ 3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total hours John worked is:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the earnings for both Jill and John. They both earn $10 per hour.

Jill's earnings:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

John's earnings:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 70 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings:
\[ 70 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

So, John earned $40 more than Jill. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total calories burned from doing aerobics and running.

For aerobics:
- Hannah spends 2 hours doing aerobics.
- Aerobics burn 500 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from aerobics = 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.

For running:
- Hannah spends 1 hour running.
- Running burns 600 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from running = 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.

Now, let's add the calories burned from both activities:
- Total calories burned = calories from aerobics + calories from running
- Total calories burned = 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories.

Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. To find out how many ml of water she needs to drink for 1600 calories, we can set up a proportion:

\[ \frac{100 \text{ ml}}{200 \text{ calories}} = \frac{x \text{ ml}}{1600 \text{ calories}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{100 \text{ ml} \times 1600 \text{ calories}}{200 \text{ calories}} \]
\[ x = \frac{160000 \text{ ml-calories}}{200 \text{ calories}} \]
\[ x = 800 \text{ ml} \]

So, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \).

According to the note, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans. Therefore, the number of red jelly beans \( R \) can be expressed as:
\[ R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B \]

Similarly, the number of green jelly beans \( G \) is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans:
\[ G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B \]

The total number of jelly beans is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
\[ R = 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]
\[ G = 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans:
\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, we can write the equation:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
\[ J - 2J = -10 \]
\[ -J = -10 \]
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 13."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

George needs 2 implants, and each implant has a base price of $2000. So, the cost for the implants is:
\[ 2 \times 2000 = 4000 \]

For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. So, the additional cost for the porcelain crown is:
\[ 500 \]

The total cost for the dental work is:
\[ 4000 + 500 = 4500 \]

George has already put down a deposit of $600. Therefore, the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
\[ 4500 - 600 = 3900 \]

George makes $15 per hour at work. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
\[ \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \]

So, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 260 \]"
"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees, and the other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees. The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees and \( 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees. The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The measure of the largest angle in the triangle is \(\boxed{90}\) degrees."
"First, let's determine the total amount of money Colby has in cents.

- Quarters: 8 quarters * 25 cents = 200 cents
- Dimes: 6 dimes * 10 cents = 60 cents
- Nickels: 14 nickels * 5 cents = 70 cents
- Pennies: 15 pennies * 1 cent = 15 cents

Now, let's add up all the cents:
200 cents (from quarters) + 60 cents (from dimes) + 70 cents (from nickels) + 15 cents (from pennies) = 345 cents

Each gumball costs 5 cents. To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of one gumball:
345 cents / 5 cents per gumball = 69 gumballs

The final numerical answer is 69."
"To determine the total number of legs in the pet store, we need to consider the number of legs each type of pet has and then multiply by the number of each type of pet.

- Dogs have 4 legs each.
- Cats have 4 legs each.
- Birds have 2 legs each.

Given:
- There are 5 dogs.
- There are 2 cats.
- There are 10 birds.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet:
- Total legs from dogs: \(5 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 20 \text{ legs}\)

"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we can calculate the hourly rate for Ruiz as follows:

\[ \text{Ruiz's hourly rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. According to the problem, Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we can calculate the amount Marissa makes in one hour as follows:

\[ \text{Marissa's hourly rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 60 \text{ pounds per hour} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of chocolates Ruiz and Marissa make together in 12 hours. First, we calculate the total amount Ruiz makes in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Ruiz's total in 12 hours} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Marissa makes in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Marissa's total in 12 hours} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the totals together to find the combined amount of chocolates made by Ruiz and Marissa in 12 hours:

"To calculate the total earnings from selling lemonade, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first four hours and the next two hours.

For the first four hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.
- Total cups sold in four hours = 15 cups/hour * 4 hours = 60 cups.
- Total earnings from the first four hours = 60 cups * $0.50/cup = $30.

For the next two hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.
- Total cups sold in two hours = 10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups.
- Total earnings from the next two hours = 20 cups * $0.60/cup = $12.

Now, we add the earnings from both parts to find the total earnings:
- Total earnings = $30 (from the first four hours) + $12 (from the next two hours) = $42.

So, the total money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours is $42."
"First, let's calculate the total number of rotations the tires make in a month.

Given that the car rotates its tires 725 times for every 2 miles driven, we can find the number of rotations per mile:
\[ \text{Rotations per mile} = \frac{725}{2} = 362.5 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of rotations for 400 miles:
\[ \text{Total rotations per month} = 400 \times 362.5 = 145,000 \]

Next, we need to find out how many months it takes for the tires to reach 10,440,000 rotations:
\[ \text{Months} = \frac{10,440,000}{145,000} = 72 \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can now calculate the number of years:

"To find out how much each pump costs, we first need to determine the total number of washes Jackie can get from one bottle of shampoo. Since the directions say 2 pumps give 120 washes, we can calculate the number of washes per pump:

\[ \text{Washes per pump} = \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washes per pump} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pumps are in the bottle. Since the bottle gives 120 washes and each pump gives 60 washes, the number of pumps in the bottle is:

\[ \text{Number of pumps} = \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{60 \text{ washes per pump}} = 2 \text{ pumps} \]

The total cost of the bottle is $24.00. To find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the number of pumps:

\[ \text{Cost per pump} = \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 12.00 \text{ dollars per pump} \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert dollars to cents (1 dollar = 100 cents):

\[ 12.00 \text{ dollars} = 12.00 \times 100 \text{ cents} = 1200 \text{ cents} \]

So, the cost per pump is 1200 cents."
"First, let's calculate the discount on the shirt and the shorts.

The shirt originally costs $25, and there is a 30% off sale.
The discount on the shirt is \( 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \).

So, the shirt will cost \( 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \) after the discount.

The shorts originally cost $35, and there is a 30% off sale.
The discount on the shorts is \( 35 \times 0.30 = 10.50 \).

So, the shorts will cost \( 35 - 10.50 = 24.50 \) after the discount.

Now, let's add the discounted prices of the shirt and the shorts to find the total cost of the outfit.
The total cost is \( 17.50 + 24.50 = 42.00 \).

"To determine how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a week.
2. Determine the total amount of butter needed based on the number of dozens.

Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week. A week has 7 days.

So, the total number of dozens of croissants he wants to make in a week is:
\[ 4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozen} \]

It takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. Therefore, to find out how many pounds of butter are needed for 28 dozen croissants, we multiply the number of dozens by the amount of butter needed per dozen:
\[ 28 \text{ dozen} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the funding into two parts: the initial 5 months and the extended 5 months.

1. **Initial 5 months funding:**
   - John receives $100,000 for the first 5 months.

2. **Extended 5 months funding:**
   - The research takes 10 times longer than the initial 5 months, so it takes \(5 \times 10 = 50\) months in total.
   - The first 5 months cost $100,000.
   - The remaining 45 months (50 months - 5 months) cost 50% more per month than the initial 5 months.
   - The cost per month for the extended period is \(100,000 \times 1.5 = 150,000\) dollars.

Now, calculate the total cost for the extended 45 months:

\[ 20 \text{ kb/s} = \frac{20}{1000} \text{ Mb/s} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \]

Next, we convert the speed from Mb per second to Mb per hour:
\[ 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \times 3600 \text{ s/h} = 72 \text{ Mb/h} \]

So, Ashley’s internet connection speed in Mb per hour is 72 Mb/h."
"To calculate the total number of cars towed by the tow truck over the week, we can break down the problem into two parts: the first three days and the last four days.

For the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day. So, the total number of cars pulled in the first three days is:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

For the remaining four days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day than it did on the first three days. Therefore, the number of cars pulled each day for the last four days is:
\[ 10 \text{ cars} - 4 \text{ cars} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]
So, the total number of cars pulled in the last four days is:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Adding the number of cars pulled over the first three days and the last four days gives us the total number of cars towed that week:
\[ 30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 54 \]"
"First, we need to convert Adam's current height from inches to feet to compare it with the required height. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, Adam's height in feet is:

\[ 40 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{40}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The minimum height required to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. Therefore, Adam needs to grow:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Adam grows 2 inches per year, which is equivalent to \(\frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6}\) feet per year. To find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet, we divide \(\frac{2}{3}\) by \(\frac{1}{6}\):

\[ \frac{2}{3} \div \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = \frac{2 \times 6}{3 \times 1} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Therefore, Adam will be tall enough to ride the roller coaster in 4 years. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 cars James sold:
\[ 10 \text{ cars} \times \$25,000 \text{ per car} = \$250,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount the company paid to acquire these cars:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } \$250,000 = 0.30 \times \$250,000 = \$75,000 \]

Now, we find the total profit James made from selling the cars:
\[ \$250,000 - \$75,000 = \$175,000 \]

James received a 10% commission on the profits:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$175,000 = 0.10 \times \$175,000 = \$17,500 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$17,500 \]"
"First, let's determine how many riders can stay upright on the wave. Since only 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright, we calculate:

\[ 100 \times 0.25 = 25 \]

So, 25 riders can stay upright on the wave.

Next, we need to find out how many of these 25 riders are women. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we calculate:

\[ 25 \times 0.60 = 15 \]

So, 15 riders are women who can stay upright on the wave.

To find out how many of these 25 riders are men, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is 10.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 10 \]"
"First, let's find the price of the gold jewel. Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000 and the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond jewel, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

\[ \text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600 \]

Next, we need to find the price of the silver jewel. The problem states that the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of the gold jewel. Therefore:

\[ \text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200 \]

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond jewel, the gold jewel, and the silver jewel:

\[ \text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800 \]

So, the total price for all three jewels is $4800."
"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to calculate the number of each type of stamp and then sum them up.

1. Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.
2. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. Therefore, the number of truck stamps is:
   \[
   16 + 3 = 19
   \]
3. He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. Therefore, the number of rose stamps is:
   \[
   19 - 9 = 10
   \]

Now, we sum the number of each type of stamp to find the total number of stamps Max bought:
\[
16 \text{ (snowflake)} + 19 \text{ (truck)} + 10 \text{ (rose)} = 45
\]

So, the total number of stamps Max bought is 45."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between him and Bob.

First, let's calculate the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap. Since Bob is driving at 55 mph and Tom is driving at 70 mph, Tom is gaining on Bob at a rate of:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is closing the 75-mile gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. To find out how long it will take Tom to close this gap, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"First, let's determine how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate the number of fish Darren caught as follows:

\[ \text{Darren's fish} = \text{Naomi's fish} - 6 = 17 - 6 = 11 \]

Next, we need to find out how many fish Tommy caught. According to the problem, Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. Since Darren caught 11 fish, we can calculate the number of fish Tommy caught as follows:

\[ \text{Tommy's fish} = \text{Darren's fish} + 3 = 11 + 3 = 14 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 14 \]"
"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the maximum cost per class and then find out how many classes he can attend without exceeding this cost.

First, let's denote the total cost of the 10 classes as \( C \). The total cost is given as $60. If the cost per class exceeds $10, they won't sign him up again. Therefore, we need to find the maximum number of classes \( n \) such that the cost per class is not more than $10.

The cost per class if he misses \( m \) classes is:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60 - \text{cost of missed classes}}{10 - m} \]

We need to find the maximum \( m \) such that:
\[ \frac{60 - \text{cost of missed classes}}{10 - m} \leq 10 \]

Let's assume Manny misses \( m \) classes. Then the number of classes he attends is \( 10 - m \). The cost per class he pays for the attended classes is:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60 - \text{cost of missed classes}}{10 - m} \]

To ensure the cost per class is not more than $10, we set up the inequality:
\[ \frac{60 - \text{cost of missed classes}}{10 - m} \leq 10 \]

Since the cost of the missed classes is the cost of the classes he didn't attend, we can simplify this to:
\[ \frac{60 - \text{cost of missed classes}}{10 - m} \leq 10 \]

Let's assume the cost of the missed classes is \( x \). Then:
\[ \frac{60 - x}{10 - m} \leq 10 \]

To find the maximum \( m \), we need to solve for \( m \) when the cost per class is exactly $10:
\[ \frac{60 - x}{10 - m} = 10 \]

Solving for \( m \):
\[ 60 - x = 10(10 - m) \]
\[ 60 - x = 100 - 10m \]
\[ 10m = 100 - 60 + x \]
\[ 10m = 40 + x \]
\[ m = \frac{40 + x}{10} \]

Since \( x \) is the cost of the missed classes, and the maximum cost per class is $10, the maximum \( m \) is when \( x \) is minimized. The minimum \( x \) is 0 (if he misses no classes), so:
\[ m = \frac{40 + 0}{10} = 4 \]

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10, and his parents will not sign him up again.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we first need to find out how many customers each of them processes in a day.

Given:
- Jewel processes 50 customers per day.
- Julie processes twice as many customers as Jewel per day.

First, calculate the number of customers Julie processes per day:
\[ \text{Julie's daily customers} = 2 \times \text{Jewel's daily customers} = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Next, calculate the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel in one day:
\[ \text{Total daily customers} = \text{Jewel's daily customers} + \text{Julie's daily customers} = 50 + 100 = 150 \]

Now, to find the total weekly production, we multiply the total daily customers by the number of days in a week (7 days):
\[ \text{Total weekly customers} = \text{Total daily customers} \times 7 = 150 \times 7 = 1050 \]

The total weekly production for the two is:
\[ 1050 \]"
"First, let's determine how many miles Reggie ran. Since Paisley ran 4 miles and Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, we calculate:

\[ \text{Reggie's distance} = 5 \times \text{Paisley's distance} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. So, to find out how many miles Lynn ran, we subtract 3 miles from Reggie's distance:

\[ \text{Lynn's distance} = \text{Reggie's distance} - 3 = 20 - 3 = 17 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 17 \]"
"First, let's find the cost of one apple and one orange.

The cost of four apples is $5.20, so the cost of one apple is:
\[ \text{Cost of one apple} = \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \]

The cost of three oranges is $3.30, so the cost of one orange is:
\[ \text{Cost of one orange} = \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \]

Now, we need to find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

The cost of 5 apples is:
\[ \text{Cost of 5 apples} = 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \]

The cost of 5 oranges is:
\[ \text{Cost of 5 oranges} = 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 12.00 \]"
"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the hole:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel one cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) it will take him to dig the hole is:

\[ T = \text{volume} \times \text{time per cubic foot} \]
\[ T = 72 \times 3 = 216 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of each additional feature:

1. King cab upgrade: $7,500
2. Leather seats: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so $7,500 / 3 = $2,500
3. Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats, so $2,500 - $500 = $2,000
4. Upgraded exterior light package: $1,500

Now, let's add up all the extra costs:
- King cab upgrade: $7,500
- Leather seats: $2,500
- Running boards: $2,000
- Upgraded exterior light package: $1,500

Total extra cost = $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1,500 = $13,500

Now, let's add the base price of the truck to the total extra cost:
- Base price of the truck: $30,000
- Total extra cost: $13,500

Total cost = $30,000 + $13,500 = $43,500

The final numerical answer is $43,500."
"To calculate Tim's annual salary after the raise and bonus, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the raise amount.
2. Calculate the bonus amount.
3. Add the raise and bonus to the original salary to get the new monthly salary.
4. Multiply the new monthly salary by 12 to get the annual salary.

Let's start with the raise amount:
- Tim's original monthly salary is $20000.
- The raise is 5% of $20000.
- Raise amount = 5% of $20000 = 0.05 * $20000 = $1000.

Next, the bonus amount:
- The bonus is half a month's salary.
- Bonus amount = 1/2 * $20000 = $10000.

Now, add the raise and bonus to the original salary to get the new monthly salary:
- New monthly salary = $20000 + $1000 + $10000 = $31000.

Finally, calculate the annual salary:
- Annual salary = $31000 * 12 = $372000.

"First, let's calculate the cost of the wardrobe components:

1. **Cost of suits:**
   - James buys 10 suits.
   - Each suit costs $750.
   - Total cost for suits = 10 * $750 = $7500.

2. **Cost of dress pants:**
   - The cost of each dress pant is 1/5 of the cost of a suit.
   - Cost of each dress pant = $750 / 5 = $150.
   - James buys 10 dress pants.
   - Total cost for dress pants = 10 * $150 = $1500.

3. **Cost of dress shirts:**

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the sales from green hats in the first month:**
   - The sales from red hats in the first month were $400.
   - The sales from green hats in the first month were twice the sales from red hats.
   - Therefore, the sales from green hats in the first month = $400 * 2 = $800.

2. **Calculate the total sales for the first month:**
   - Total sales in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
   - Total sales in the first month = $400 + $800 = $1200.

3. **Determine the sales from green hats in the second month:**
   - The sales from green hats in the second month were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month.
   - Therefore, the sales from green hats in the second month = $1200 * 3/4 = $900.

4. **Calculate the total sales for the second month:**
   - Total sales in the second month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
   - Sales from red hats in the second month = 1/2 of the sales from red hats in the first month = $400 * 1/2 = $200.
   - Total sales in the second month = $200 + $900 = $1100.

5. **Calculate the total sales for the two months:**
   - Total sales for the two months = Total sales in the first month + Total sales in the second month
   - Total sales for the two months = $1200 + $1100 = $2300.

The final numerical answer is $2300."

Since the assignment is to be completed within 30 days, we can find out how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading by subtracting the total days required from the deadline:
\[ \text{Days before deadline} = 30 \text{ days} - 20 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ days} \]

So, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline."
"To calculate the total cost for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane, the monthly rent for the hanger, and the monthly cost for fuel.

1. **Initial cost of the plane:** $150,000
2. **Monthly rent for the hanger:** $5000
3. **Monthly cost for fuel:** $5000 * 2 = $10,000
4. **Total monthly cost:** $5000 (rent) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000
5. **Total cost for the first year:** $15,000 * 12 months = $180,000

Now, we add the initial cost of the plane to the total cost for the first year:

**Total cost for the first year:** $150,000 (plane) + $180,000 (maintenance) = $330,000

So, the final numerical answer is $330,000."
"First, let's determine the cooking times for each item:

1. **Rice**: It took Finley 30 minutes to cook the rice.
2. **Pork**: It took her 20 more minutes to cook the pork than the rice. Therefore, the cooking time for pork is:
   \[
   30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
   \]
3. **Beans**: It took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is:
   \[
   30 \text{ minutes} + 50 \text{ minutes} = 80 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   Therefore, the cooking time for beans is:
   \[
   \frac{80 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 40 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Now, let's sum up the cooking times for all the items:
\[

"To find the difference in cost between the two mixtures, we first need to calculate the cost of each mixture separately.

For the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the first mixture is \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars.

For the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the second mixture is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars.

"Let's denote the number of sheep as \( S \) and the number of geese as \( G \).

We know that:
1. Sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs.
2. Sheep have 1 head and geese have 1 head.
3. The total number of animal legs is 70.
4. The total number of animal heads is 20.

From the information given, we can set up the following equations:
\[ 4S + 2G = 70 \]
\[ S + G = 20 \]

We can solve these equations step by step. First, let's solve the second equation for \( G \):
\[ G = 20 - S \]

Next, substitute \( G \) in the first equation:
\[ 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]
\[ 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ 2S + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2S = 30 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep is 15. To verify, we can find the number of geese:
\[ G = 20 - S = 20 - 15 = 5 \]

Let's check the total number of legs:
\[ 4S + 2G = 4(15) + 2(5) = 60 + 10 = 70 \]

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is:

"First, let's determine the number of toys James needs initially. He currently has 4 toys for 4 dogs, so he needs 4 more toys for the 8 new dogs that have arrived. This means he needs 4 toys for the 8 new dogs.

\[ \text{Toys needed for 8 new dogs} = 4 \]

After buying the toys for the 8 new dogs, the number of dogs in the shelter is now 4 (original dogs) + 8 (new dogs) = 12 dogs. James then finds that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left, which means there are now 24 dogs in the shelter. This means he needs to buy toys for 24 - 12 = 12 more dogs.

\[ \text{Toys needed for 12 more dogs} = 12 \]

So far, James has bought toys for 4 dogs and then for 12 more dogs, which totals:

\[ 4 + 12 = 16 \]

When James came back again, 3 dogs were gone, so he no longer needed the toys for those 3 dogs. Therefore, he no longer needs the 3 toys.

\[ \text{Final total of toys needed} = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20.

\[ \text{Cost of vaccines} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, let's denote the cost of the heartworm check as \( H \). According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as \( T \). Therefore, we have:

\[ H = 0.60 \times T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:

\[ T = 40 + H \]

Since \( H = 0.60 \times T \), we can substitute \( H \) in the total bill equation:

\[ T = 40 + 0.60 \times T \]

To solve for \( T \), we rearrange the equation:

\[ T - 0.60 \times T = 40 \]
\[ 0.40 \times T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.40} \]

"First, let's determine the price of each type of fruit:

- The price of one apple is $0.5.
- The price of one banana is twice the price of one apple, so it is \(2 \times 0.5 = $1.0\).
- The price of one orange is three times the price of one banana, so it is \(3 \times 1.0 = $3.0\).

Next, we calculate the total cost for one crate of fruit, which contains 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges:

- The cost for 5 bananas is \(5 \times 1.0 = $5.0\).
- The cost for 12 apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = $6.0\).
- The cost for 7 oranges is \(7 \times 3.0 = $21.0\).

Adding these costs together gives the total price for one crate of fruit:

\[
5.0 + 6.0 + 21.0 = $32.0
\]

So, the price for such a crate of fruit is $32.0."
"First, let's determine the number of each colored square on the comforter:

- Red squares: 14
- Blue squares: 14 + 4 = 18
- Green squares: 18 + 6 = 24
- White squares: 24 - 12 = 12

Now, let's find the total number of squares:

Total squares = Red squares + Blue squares + Green squares + White squares
Total squares = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12
Total squares = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is equal to the total number of squares. Therefore, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

"First, let's determine the capacity of Gordy's truck. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, we can calculate Gordy's truck capacity as follows:

\[ \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = \text{Gissela's truck capacity} + 800 \]
\[ \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = 4000 + 800 \]
\[ \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = 4800 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that the combined capacity of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks is 11,600 pounds. Let's denote Gary's truck capacity as \( G \). Therefore, we can write the equation for the total capacity as:

\[ \text{Gissela's truck capacity} + \text{Gordy's truck capacity} + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11600 \]
\[ 4000 + 4800 + G = 11600 \]

Now, we solve for \( G \):

\[ 8800 + G = 11600 \]
\[ G = 11600 - 8800 \]
\[ G = 2800 \]

So, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel. The final numerical answer is:

"If each female ate 3 dumplings and there are 6 females, then the total number of dumplings eaten by the females is:

\[ 6 \text{ females} \times 3 \text{ dumplings/female} = 18 \text{ dumplings} \]

Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, each male ate:

\[ 3 \text{ dumplings/female} + 1 \text{ dumpling} = 4 \text{ dumplings/male} \]

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is:

\[ 8 \text{ males} \times 4 \text{ dumplings/male} = 32 \text{ dumplings} \]

Adding the dumplings eaten by the males and the females gives the total number of dumplings cooked:

"To find the percent of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the percentage of water used by the city for industrial purposes.
2. Subtract the industrial usage percentage from 100% to find the non-industrial usage percentage.

First, we know that Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. Out of this 40%, 80% is used for industrial purposes. Therefore, the percentage of water used by the city for industrial purposes is:
\[ 40\% \times 80\% = 40\% \times 0.80 = 32\% \]

Next, to find the percentage of water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the industrial usage percentage from 100%:
\[ 100\% - 32\% = 68\% \]

So, the percent of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is 68%."

"First, let's calculate the number of windows in the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars.
- Each student's car has 4 windows.
- Therefore, the total number of windows in the students' cars is \(64 \times 4 = 256\) windows.

Next, let's calculate the number of windows in the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each teacher's car has 2 windows.
- Therefore, the total number of windows in the teachers' cars is \(32 \times 2 = 64\) windows.

Now, let's calculate the number of windows Hannah smashes in the students' cars:
- She smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.
- Therefore, the number of windows she smashes in the students' cars is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64\) windows.

Next, let's calculate the number of windows Hannah smashes in the teachers' cars:
- She smashes three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows.
- Therefore, the number of windows she smashes in the teachers' cars is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48\) windows.

Finally, let's add the number of windows smashed in both the students' and teachers' cars:
- The total number of windows smashed is \(64 + 48 = 112\).

"To find the percentage of blue spools, we first need to calculate the total number of spools and the number of blue spools.

Candy has:
- 15 light blue spools
- 45 dark blue spools
- 40 light green spools
- 50 dark green spools

The total number of spools is:
\[ 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150 \]

The total number of blue spools (light blue and dark blue) is:
\[ 15 + 45 = 60 \]

To find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplifying the fraction:
\[ \frac{60}{150} = \frac{2}{5} \]

Now, calculate the percentage:
\[ \left( \frac{2}{5} \right) \times 100 = 40\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 40 \]"
"To find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we can break down the problem into steps.

1. **Initial number of people**: 5000 people lined up at the polling station.

2. **People who voted by midday**: 
   - \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the people had voted by midday.
   - Number of people who voted by midday = \( \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000 \).

3. **Remaining people by midday**: 
   - Number of people remaining = \( 5000 - 2000 = 3000 \).

4. **People who voted by 16:00**: 
   - \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the remaining people had voted by 16:00.
   - Number of people who voted by 16:00 = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000 \).

5. **People who had not voted by 16:00**: 
   - Number of people who had not voted by 16:00 = Remaining people by midday - People who voted by 16:00.
   - Number of people who had not voted by 16:00 = \( 3000 - 2000 = 1000 \).

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000."
"To determine how many packs of gum Parker will need for 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will chew in 30 days.
2. Determine how many packs of gum are needed based on the total number of pieces of gum and the number of pieces per pack.

First, let's calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will chew in 30 days:
\[ \text{Total pieces of gum} = \text{Pieces per day} \times \text{Number of days} \]
\[ \text{Total pieces of gum} = 4 \times 30 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of gum are required to get 120 pieces of gum. Since each pack contains 15 pieces of gum:
\[ \text{Number of packs} = \frac{\text{Total pieces of gum}}{\text{Pieces per pack}} \]
\[ \text{Number of packs} = \frac{120}{15} = 8 \]

Therefore, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

"First, let's calculate the total number of smores needed:

- There are 9 kids, and each wants 2 smores, so the kids will need \(9 \times 2 = 18\) smores.
- There are 6 adults, and each will eat 1 smore, so the adults will need \(6 \times 1 = 6\) smores.
- Therefore, the total number of smores needed is \(18 + 6 = 24\) smores.

Next, we need to determine how many graham cracker bases are required to make 24 smores. Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large smores, we need to find out how many sleeves are required for 24 smores:

- Each sleeve makes 8 smores, so for 24 smores, they will need \(\frac{24}{8} = 3\) sleeves.

Since each box contains 3 sleeves, they will need 1 box to have 3 sleeves.

"To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Dora's father's age.
2. Determine Dora's mother's age.
3. Sum the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother.

First, we know Dora is 15 years old. According to the problem, Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. So, we calculate Dora's father's age as follows:
\[
\text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8 = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38
\]

Next, we know Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. So, we calculate Dora's mother's age as follows:
\[
\text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4 = 38 - 4 = 34
\]

Now, we sum the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother:
\[
\text{Total age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87

"First, let's calculate the total weight of Cindy's math and science books. Since each of these books weighs 2 pounds and there are two of them, the total weight for the math and science books is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds/book} \times 2 \text{ books} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know the weight of her French book is 4 pounds and her English book is 3 pounds. So, the total weight of her French and English books is:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} + 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Her history book weighs twice as much as her English book. Since her English book weighs 3 pounds, the weight of her history book is:
\[ 2 \times 3 \text{ pounds} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add up the weights of all her books to find the total weight:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds (math and science)} + 7 \text{ pounds (French and English)} + 6 \text{ pounds (history)} = 17 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is:
\[ 17 \text{ pounds} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of votes candidate B received. Candidate A got 20% of the votes, and candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes.

Candidate A's votes:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ votes} \]

Candidate B's votes:
\[ 50\% \text{ more than candidate A's votes} = 20 + (0.50 \times 20) = 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ votes} \]

Now, let's find out how many votes candidate C received. The total number of votes is 100. The votes for candidate C are the remaining votes after accounting for candidate A and candidate B.

Votes for candidate C:
\[ 100 - (\text{votes for candidate A} + \text{votes for candidate B}) = 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \text{ votes} \]

So, candidate C received 50 votes."
"First, let's determine how many apples Beck has initially. Since Boris has 100 apples and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, we can calculate the number of apples Beck has as follows:

\[ \text{Beck's initial apples} = \text{Boris's apples} - 23 = 100 - 23 = 77 \]

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. So, we need to update the number of apples each person has after this transaction:

\[ \text{Boris's apples after giving 10 to Beck} = 100 - 10 = 90 \]
\[ \text{Beck's apples after receiving 10 from Boris} = 77 + 10 = 87 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after this transaction:

\[ \text{Difference in apples} = \text{Boris's apples} - \text{Beck's apples} = 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of water used for each type of ice cube:

- For the giant cubes: 3 giant cubes * 4 ounces per cube = 12 ounces
- For the medium cubes: 7 medium cubes * 2 ounces per cube = 14 ounces
- For the small cubes: 8 small cubes * 0.5 ounces per cube = 4 ounces

Now, let's add up the total amount of water used:

Total water used = 12 ounces (giant cubes) + 14 ounces (medium cubes) + 4 ounces (small cubes) = 30 ounces

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. To find out how much water he has left, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount:

Water left = 32 ounces - 30 ounces = 2 ounces

So, the final numerical answer is 2 ounces."
"If Clara has 20 books and Clara has two times as many books as Steven, then Steven has half the number of books Clara has. Therefore, Steven has \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) books.

Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so Alice has \( 10 + 6 = 16 \) books.

To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has: \( 20 - 16 = 4 \).

So, Clara has 4 more books than Alice. The final numerical answer is 4."
"First, let's determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. Since a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar and a gallon jar costs $5, we can calculate the cost of a half-gallon jar as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of gallon jar} - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars:

\[ \text{Total cost for 10 gallon jars} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \]

Then, we calculate the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars:

\[ \text{Total cost for 16 half-gallon jars} = 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

"To find the number of boys in each class, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of students in each class.
2. Calculate the number of girls in each class.
3. Subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class to find the number of boys.

First, since the total number of students in both classes is 80 and each class has the same number of students, we can find the number of students in each class by dividing the total number of students by 2:

\[ \text{Number of students in each class} = \frac{80}{2} = 40 \]

Next, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. Therefore, the number of girls in each class is:

\[ \text{Number of girls in each class} = 40 \times \frac{40}{100} = 40 \times 0.4 = 16 \]

Now, to find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class:

\[ \text{Number of boys in each class} = 40 - 16 = 24 \]

So, the number of boys in each class is 24."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many students would be in each group if the activity is divided into 12 groups.

First, we find out how many students would be in each group if there are 12 groups:
\[ \text{Number of students per group} = \frac{54 \text{ students}}{12 \text{ groups}} = 4.5 \text{ students per group} \]

Since the number of students per group must be a whole number, it is not possible to divide 54 students into 12 groups of equal size. Therefore, the question is asking for the number of additional groups needed to form, but since the division is not possible, the number of additional groups needed is not a whole number.

However, if we interpret the question as asking how many more groups are needed to form a whole number of students per group, we need to find the smallest number of groups that can divide 54 students into equal groups. The smallest number of groups that can do this is 6, as given in the original problem.

So, if we are to form 12 groups, we need to find out how many more groups are needed beyond the original 6 groups:
\[ 12 \text{ groups} - 6 \text{ groups} = 6 \text{ more groups} \]

Thus, the number of additional groups needed is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To calculate the total number of chairs Candy can rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during a single weekday and a single weekend day:
- Weekdays: 60 chairs per day
- Weekends: 100 chairs per day

Next, we need to determine the number of weekdays and weekend days in a 4-week month:
- There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a single week.
- Therefore, in a 4-week month, there are \(5 \times 4 = 20\) weekdays and \(2 \times 4 = 8\) weekend days.

Now, we can calculate the total number of chairs rented during a 4-week month:
- Chairs rented during weekdays: \(60 \times 20 = 1200\)
- Chairs rented during weekends: \(100 \times 8 = 800\)
- Total chairs rented in one 4-week month: \(1200 + 800 = 2000\)

Finally, we need to find out the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months:
- Total chairs rented in two 4-week months: \(2000 \times 2 = 4000\)

So, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is 4000."

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - Number of small stickers traded: \( 30 \times 0.90 = 27 \)
   - Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she trades 27 small stickers for 27 large buttons.

3. **Remaining Small Stickers:**
   - Remaining small stickers: \( 30 - 27 = 3 \)

4. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - Number of large stickers traded: \( 40 \times 0.50 = 20 \)
   - Since each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons, trading 20 large stickers for large buttons gives her 20 large buttons.

5. **Remaining Large Stickers:**
   - Remaining large stickers: \( 40 - 20 = 20 \)

6. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons.

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, so it is \( 2x \).

The total number of votes cast is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is \( x + 2x = 3x \).

We know the total number of people on the council is 33, so:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x \):
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Thus, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Extra-small (XS) shirts**: 11 students need size extra-small.
2. **Small (S) shirts**: Twice as many students need size small as extra small. Therefore, the number of students needing size small is \(2 \times 11 = 22\).
3. **Medium (M) shirts**: Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size medium is \(22 - 4 = 18\).
4. **Large (L) shirts**: Half as many students need size large as size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size large is \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\).
5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts**: Six more students need size extra-large than large. Therefore, the number of students needing size extra-large is \(9 + 6 = 15\).

Now, we sum up the number of students needing each size to find the total number of shirts ordered:

\[
11 \text{ (XS)} + 22 \text{ (S)} + 18 \text{ (M)} + 9 \text{ (L)} + 15 \text{ (XL)} = 75

Total number of songs = 300 × 20
Total number of songs = 6000

Next, let's calculate the total number of hours:
- Each song is 10 hours long.

Total number of hours = Total number of songs × Length of each song
Total number of hours = 6000 × 10
Total number of hours = 60000

So, the 20 playlists will last a total of 60,000 hours."
"First, let's find out how many people think horse #2 will win. 

20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win:
\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \text{ people} \]

Next, we need to find out how many people are left after those who think horse #2 will win:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ people} \]

Now, 60% of the remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win:
\[ 0.60 \times 40 = 24 \text{ people} \]

The rest of the people think horse #12 will win. To find out how many people that is, we subtract the number of people who think horse #7 will win from the remaining people:
\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \text{ people} \]

So, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is 16."
"To find the total number of puppies Jana has, we can work backwards from the information given.

We know that one third of the Pomeranian puppies are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. Therefore, the total number of Pomeranian puppies (let's call this number \( P \)) can be found by solving the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{3}P = 6 \]

Multiplying both sides by 3 gives:
\[ P = 6 \times 3 \]
\[ P = 18 \]

So, Jana has 18 Pomeranian puppies. Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can find the total number of puppies (let's call this number \( T \)) by solving the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{3}T = 18 \]

To find \( T \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{3}{2} \):
\[ T = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} \]
\[ T = 27 \]

Therefore, Jana has 27 puppies in total."
"First, let's determine how much money Jayden has after his sister gives him half of her allowance.

Ava's allowance is $90, so half of that is:
\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

Jayden initially had $70, and his sister gave him $45, so now Jayden has:
\[ 70 + 45 = 115 \]

The camera costs $200, so the amount of money Jayden still needs is:
\[ 200 - 115 = 85 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 85 \]"
"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The first house needs \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the second house, so the first house needs \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases.
- The third house needs double the first house, so the third house needs \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) cases.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{5}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{5} \):
\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{5} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. The third house needs double the first house, which is:
\[ 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = 2 \times \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

The final numerical answer is:
100"

"To find out how many fruits George has, we first need to calculate the number of pears he has. Given that George has 45% more pears than bananas, and he has 200 bananas, we can calculate the number of pears as follows:

Number of pears = Number of bananas + 45% of the number of bananas
Number of pears = 200 + 0.45 * 200
Number of pears = 200 + 90
Number of pears = 290

Now, to find the total number of fruits, we add the number of bananas and the number of pears:

Total number of fruits = Number of bananas + Number of pears
Total number of fruits = 200 + 290
Total number of fruits = 490

So, the final numerical answer is 490."

"To calculate Tanya's earnings for the two days, we need to break down her earnings for each day and then sum them up.

**Monday:**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She also earns an additional $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Monday:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} \times 5 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 20 \times 5 \times 15 = \$1500 \]

Next, calculate the additional earnings for Monday:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} > 3 \text{ classes} \]
\[ 4 \text{ classes} - 3 \text{ classes} = 1 \text{ extra class} \]
\[ 1 \text{ extra class} \times \$5 = \$5 \]

So, the total earnings for Monday are:
\[ \$1500 + \$5 = \$1505 \]

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She does not earn the additional $5 per day since she does not teach more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Wednesday:
\[ 2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 2 \times 2 \times 15 = \$60 \]

Since she does not teach more than 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5 per day.

So, the total earnings for Wednesday are:
\[ \$60 \]

Now, sum up the earnings for both days:
\[ \$1505 + \$60 = \$1565 \]

Therefore, Tanya earned a total of \$1565 for these two days of teaching."
"To find out how many more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total sales for both vanilla and fruity scents and then find the difference.

The company sold 5 vanilla scents and 2 fruity scents each by the end of the day.

Total vanilla scents sold = 5
Total fruity scents sold = 2

Difference in sales = Total vanilla scents sold - Total fruity scents sold
Difference in sales = 5 - 2

So, 3 more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Bennet makes from selling the eggplants.

He sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total from the eggplants is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

Bennet wants to make a total of $135. To find out how much more he needs to make from selling the corn, we subtract the amount he already has from the total he wants to make:
\[ 135 - 60 = 75 \]

Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for to make the remaining $75, we divide the remaining amount by the number of ears of corn:
\[ \frac{75}{25} = 3 \]

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

"To determine how long Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time he spends driving to the museum and the time he spends driving back home, and then add the time he spends at the museum.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to drive to the museum. The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and Jack drives at a speed of 75 mph. The time taken to drive to the museum is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time to drive to the museum is:

\[ \text{Time to museum} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Since the trip back home is the same distance and speed, the time to drive back home is also 2 hours.

Now, we add the time spent driving to the museum, the time spent driving back home, and the time spent at the museum:

\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time to museum} + \text{Time back home} + \text{Time at museum} \]
\[ \text{Total time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Total time} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

So, Jack is gone from home for a total of 10 hours."

"First, let's break down the information given:

- Mike has 600 movies in total.
- A third of the movies are in various series, which means \( \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \) movies are in series.
- The remaining movies are \( 600 - 200 = 400 \) movies.
- 40% of the remaining 400 movies are older movies, which means \( 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \) movies are older.
- The remaining movies are \( 400 - 160 = 240 \) movies, which are not in series and not older.
- A third of the series movies can be bought for $6, so the cost for the series movies is $6.
- The cost of a normal movie is $10.
- The cost of older movies is $5 each.

Now, let's calculate the cost for the older movies:
- There are 160 older movies, and each costs $5.
- The total cost for the older movies is \( 160 \times 5 = 800 \).

Next, let's calculate the cost for the normal movies:
- There are 240 normal movies, and each costs $10.
- The total cost for the normal movies is \( 240 \times 10 = 2400 \).

Finally, we add the cost of the series movies, the older movies, and the normal movies to get the total cost:

"First, let's calculate the distance the Llesis family drove. They drove for 6 hours at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.

\[ \text{Distance driven} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 50 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, let's determine the hiking speed. The hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half the driving speed.

\[ \text{Hiking speed} = \frac{50}{2} - 5 = 25 - 5 = 20 \, \text{miles/hour} \]

They hiked for 1.5 hours at this speed.

\[ \text{Distance hiked} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 20 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we can find the total distance to their vacation spot by adding the distance driven and the distance hiked.

\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance driven} + \text{Distance hiked} = 300 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 330 \, \text{miles} \]

"Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as \( w \) and the number of orange fish he bought as \( o \). We know that the total number of fish he bought from the pet store is \( o + w = 17 \).

After adding these fish to his pond, the total number of orange fish became \( 3 + o \) and the total number of white fish became \( 4 + w \). According to the problem, after adding the new fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish. This gives us the equation:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( o + w = 17 \)
2. \( 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \)

Let's solve the second equation first:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]
\[ 3 + o = 8 + 2w \]
\[ o - 2w = 5 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( o + w = 17 \)
2. \( o - 2w = 5 \)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use elimination. First, we'll eliminate \( o \) by subtracting the second equation from the first:
\[ (o + w) - (o - 2w) = 17 - 5 \]
\[ o + w - o + 2w = 12 \]
\[ 3w = 12 \]
\[ w = 4 \]

Now that we have \( w = 4 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( o \):
\[ o + 4 = 17 \]
\[ o = 13 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish and 13 orange fish. The number of white fish Bob bought at the store is \( 4 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine the temperature difference that needs to be prevented for the pipes to freeze. The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. The temperature during the night is 33 degrees colder than during the day, so the night temperature is:

\[ 45 \text{ degrees} - 33 \text{ degrees} = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

Since the night temperature is 12 degrees, we need to increase the temperature by at least 10 degrees to prevent the pipes from freezing (since 12 degrees is 10 degrees below 32 degrees):

\[ 32 \text{ degrees} - 12 \text{ degrees} = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn to increase the temperature by 20 degrees, we divide the required temperature increase by the temperature increase per log:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ degrees}}{5 \text{ degrees/log}} = 4 \text{ logs} \]

So, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing. The final numerical answer is:

"Initially, the train has 172 people. At the first stop, 47 people get off and 13 people get on. So the number of people on the train after the first stop is:

\[ 172 - 47 + 13 = 138 + 13 = 151 \]

At the next stop, 38 people get off. So the number of people on the train after the second stop is:

\[ 151 - 38 = 113 \]

Therefore, the final number of people on the train is 113."
"To calculate how much money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many bottle caps Damien finds in a day.
2. Calculate the value of those bottle caps in dollars.
3. Multiply the daily value by the number of days in the month.

Step 1: Damien finds 10 bottle caps a day.
Step 2: Each bottle cap is worth $0.25, so the value of 10 bottle caps is:
\[ 10 \text{ bottle caps/day} \times \$0.25/\text{bottle cap} = \$2.50/\text{day} \]

Step 3: To find out how much he makes in a 30-day month, we multiply the daily value by 30:
\[ \$2.50/\text{day} \times 30 \text{ days} = \$75.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$75.00 \]"
"First, let's determine Jamie's regular hourly rate and her special hourly rate.

Jamie's regular hourly rate is $20 per hour.

Her special hourly rate is 150% of her regular hourly rate. To find this, we calculate:
\[ 150\% = 1.5 \]
\[ \text{Special hourly rate} = 1.5 \times 20 = 30 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Jamie earns for her regular 8 hours of work:
\[ \text{Regular earnings} = 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Jamie worked 11 hours in total, which includes her regular 8 hours and the additional 3 hours. We need to calculate the earnings for the additional 3 hours at the special hourly rate:
\[ \text{Special earnings} = 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the regular earnings and the special earnings to find her total earnings for the day:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = 160 + 90 = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Jamie was paid \(\boxed{250}\) dollars for her work on last Tuesday."

"To find out how much money Mike will have left over after buying the jeans, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discount amount on the jeans.
2. Subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the sale price.
3. Subtract the sale price from the $50.00 bill to find out how much money Mike will have left over.

First, let's calculate the discount amount:
\[ \text{Discount amount} = \text{Original price} \times \text{Discount percentage} \]
\[ \text{Discount amount} = \$40 \times 25\% = \$40 \times 0.25 = \$10 \]

Next, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the sale price:
\[ \text{Sale price} = \text{Original price} - \text{Discount amount} \]
\[ \text{Sale price} = \$40 - \$10 = \$30 \]

Finally, we subtract the sale price from the $50.00 bill to find out how much money Mike will have left over:
\[ \text{Money left over} = \$50 - \$30 = \$20 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$20 \]"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of employees after three months.
2. Calculate the total salary paid to all employees each month.
3. Multiply the total salary per month by the number of months (three months).

**Step 1: Determine the number of employees after three months.**

The company hires 20 new employees every month. After three months, the number of new employees hired is:
\[ 20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees} \]

The initial number of employees is 200. Therefore, the total number of employees after three months is:
\[ 200 \text{ initial employees} + 60 \text{ new employees} = 260 \text{ employees} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total salary paid to all employees each month.**

Each employee is paid $4000 per month. The total salary paid to all employees each month is:
\[ 260 \text{ employees} \times 4000 \text{ dollars/employee} = 1040000 \text{ dollars/month} \]

**Step 3: Multiply the total salary per month by the number of months (three months).**

The total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is:
\[ 1040000 \text{ dollars/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 3120000 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's first determine Billy's starting salary and his salary after the raises.

1. **Billy's Starting Salary:**
   - Initially, Billy was paid $10 per hour.
   - After 2 months, he received a raise of $0.50 per hour, so his new hourly rate became $10.50.
   - On his first anniversary, he received another raise of $1.00 per hour, so his final hourly rate became $11.50.

2. **Billy's Salary Calculation:**
   - Billy works 20 hours a week.
   - His weekly earnings are $11.50 * 20 = $230.
   - Assuming he works 52 weeks a year, his annual earnings are $230 * 52 = $11,960.

3. **Sally's Starting Salary:**
   - Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary.
   - Billy's starting salary was $10 per hour, so Sally's starting salary is $10.50 per hour.

4. **Sally's Salary Calculation:**
   - Sally works 20 hours a week.
   - Her weekly earnings are $10.50 * 20 = $210.
   - Assuming she works 52 weeks a year, her annual earnings are $210 * 52 = $10,920.

5. **Difference in Annual Earnings:**
   - The difference in their annual earnings is $11,960 - $10,920 = $1,040.

Therefore, Billy will earn $1,040 more than Sally in a year."
"First, let's calculate the cost of 3 loaves of bread:
- The cost of one loaf of bread is $2.
- Therefore, the cost of 3 loaves of bread is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of 2 bagels:
- The cost of one bagel is $1.
- Therefore, the cost of 2 bagels is \(2 \times 1 = 2\) dollars.

Now, to find out how much more 3 loaves of bread cost than 2 bagels, we subtract the cost of 2 bagels from the cost of 3 loaves of bread:
- The difference is \(6 - 2 = 4\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita, we first need to determine how many points Nikita scored.

Pierson scored 278 points. Half of Pierson's score is:
\[ \frac{278}{2} = 139 \]

Nikita scored 11 more than half of Pierson's score, so:
\[ 139 + 11 = 150 \]

Now, we add the points scored by Pierson and Nikita to find the total:
\[ 278 + 150 = 428 \]

The total points scored by Pierson and Nikita is:
\[ 428 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of students and teachers in the school.

The school has 40 classes, with an average of 25 students per class:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 25 \text{ students/class} = 1000 \text{ students} \]

The school also has 40 classes, with an average of 3 teachers per class:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 3 \text{ teachers/class} = 120 \text{ teachers} \]

Each child plants 1 tree, so the total number of trees planted by the students is:
\[ 1000 \text{ students} \times 1 \text{ tree/student} = 1000 \text{ trees} \]

Each teacher plants 2 trees, so the total number of trees planted by the teachers is:
\[ 120 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ trees/teacher} = 240 \text{ trees} \]

Adding the trees planted by the students and the teachers gives the total number of trees planted:
\[ 1000 \text{ trees} + 240 \text{ trees} = 1240 \text{ trees} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1240 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:

- Puppies: 3
- Koalas: 5
- Zebras: 2
- Frogs: 4

Total stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Let's denote the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy as \( x \).

After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30%. Therefore, the equation representing this situation is:

\[ \frac{x}{14 + x} = 0.30 \]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by \( 14 + x \):

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Expanding the right side:

\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Subtract \( 0.30x \) from both sides to isolate \( x \):

\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]

\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Divide both sides by 0.70 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]

\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats. The final numerical answer is:

6"
"First, let's calculate the total hours Kris has already played.

For the first 2 weeks (14 days), Kris plays for half an hour every day:
\[ 14 \text{ days} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/day} = 7 \text{ hours} \]

For the next week (7 days), Kris plays for 2 hours every day:
\[ 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/day} = 14 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's add the hours from both periods to find the total hours played so far:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} + 14 \text{ hours} = 21 \text{ hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. To find out how many more hours she needs to play, we subtract the hours she has already played from the total required hours:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} - 21 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

So, Kris still needs to play 9 more hours to earn the achievement."
"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled by the first car:
- The first car travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance traveled by the first car is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled by the second car:
- The second car travels at an average speed of 70 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance traveled by the second car is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed}_2 \times \text{Time} = 70 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled by the two cars:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_2 - \text{Distance}_1 = 140 \, \text{miles} - 120 \, \text{miles} = 20 \, \text{miles}
\]

Therefore, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car. The final numerical answer is:
\[
20

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the ring before the premium:

Cost of diamond = $600
Cost of gold = $300

Total cost before premium = Cost of diamond + Cost of gold
Total cost before premium = $600 + $300
Total cost before premium = $900

Now, let's calculate the premium:

Premium = 30% of the total cost before premium
Premium = 0.30 * $900
Premium = $270

Finally, let's calculate the total cost including the premium:

Total cost including premium = Total cost before premium + Premium
Total cost including premium = $900 + $270
Total cost including premium = $1170

So, the final numerical answer is $1170."
"First, let's calculate the pass rates for each grade:

- For third graders: \( \frac{340}{500} = 0.68 \) or 68%
- For fourth graders: \( \frac{40}{100} = 0.40 \) or 40%
- For fifth graders: The pass rate is twice that of fourth graders, so \( 2 \times 0.40 = 0.80 \) or 80%

Next, we calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students:

- Third graders: 340
- Fourth graders: 40
- Fifth graders: 400

Total number of students: \( 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 \)

Total number of students who passed: \( 340 + 40 + 400 = 780 \)

Finally, the overall pass rate is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{\text{Total number of students who passed}}{\text{Total number of students}} = \frac{780}{1000} = 0.78 \]

So, the school's overall pass rate is 78%."
"To determine how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has.
2. Determine the total area of the mosaic he can make with the chips he has.
3. Calculate the length of the mosaic based on the area and the height.

First, let's find out how many glass chips Milo has:
- Each bag contains 72 chips.
- Milo has two bags.
- Therefore, the total number of chips is \( 72 \times 2 = 144 \) chips.

Next, we need to find out how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips:
- It takes 12 chips to make every square inch.
- Therefore, the total area in square inches is \( \frac{144}{12} = 12 \) square inches.

Now, we know the height of the mosaic is 3 inches. To find the length, we use the area formula for a rectangle (Area = Length × Height):
- The area is 12 square inches.
- The height is 3 inches.
- Therefore, the length is \( \frac{12}{3} = 4 \) inches.

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

16 students each drank 2 quarts of tea:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Now, let's add the quarts of tea consumed by all the students:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

We know that there are 10 quarts of tea left from the party. Therefore, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we convert the total quarts to gallons:
\[ \frac{48}{4} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"Dale initially had 100 candies and sold 150, which means he is short by 50 candies (150 - 100 = 50). After ordering 100 more candies, he now has 100 (initial) + 100 (new order) = 200 candies. To find out how many candies he still needs to sell, we subtract the number of candies he has from the total number of candies he ordered, which is 200 - 150 = 50.

So, the final numerical answer is 50."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students on campus at the end of each month and then find the difference from the initial number of students.

Starting with 10 students at the beginning of the year, the number of students doubles every month.

- At the end of January: \(10 \times 2 = 20\) students
- At the end of February: \(20 \times 2 = 40\) students
- At the end of March: \(40 \times 2 = 80\) students
- At the end of April: \(80 \times 2 = 160\) students
- At the end of May: \(160 \times 2 = 320\) students

Now, we calculate the total number of additional students who joined by the end of May:

- Additional students in January: \(20 - 10 = 10\)
- Additional students in February: \(40 - 20 = 20\)
- Additional students in March: \(80 - 40 = 40\)
- Additional students in April: \(160 - 80 = 80\)
- Additional students in May: \(320 - 160 = 160\)

Summing these additional students:

\(10 + 20 + 40 + 80 + 160 = 310\)

So, the number of additional students who would have joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year, is 310."
"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we first need to determine the total number of branches he climbed during the week.

Given that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs and he made $105 during the week, we can calculate the total number of branches he climbed by dividing the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\text{Total money made}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} \]

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = 420 \]

Since he made this amount of money during the week, and there are 7 days in a week, we can find the average number of branches he climbed per day by dividing the total branches climbed by the number of days in the week:

\[ \text{Branches climbed per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches climbed}}{\text{Number of days in a week}} = \frac{420}{7} \]

\[ \text{Branches climbed per day} = 60 \]

So, the average number of branches Felix climbed per day is 60."
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose initially picks:

- For the first 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals.
- For the next 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals.
- For the next 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals.
- For the last 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals.

Adding these together gives the total number of petals before any are dropped:
\[15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\] petals.

Rose drops 1 of each type of flower, so she drops:
- 1 flower with 5 petals,
- 1 flower with 6 petals,
- 1 flower with 4 petals,
- 1 flower with 7 petals.

The total number of petals dropped is:
\[5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\] petals.

Subtracting the dropped petals from the initial total gives the number of petals remaining in the vase:

"First, let's determine the total play time for each person in minutes. Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter. His two friends who are significantly worse can play for 10 minutes each (half of 20 minutes), and the one friend who is significantly better can play for 30 minutes (1.5 times 20 minutes).

The total play time for all four friends is:
- Jack: 20 minutes
- Friend 1 (worse): 10 minutes
- Friend 2 (worse): 10 minutes
- Friend 3 (better): 30 minutes

Adding these up, the total play time is:
20 + 10 + 10 + 30 = 70 minutes

They play for 4 hours, which is equivalent to 240 minutes. To find out how many 20-minute intervals fit into 240 minutes, we divide 240 by 20:

"Let's denote the amount of each ingredient Tanya uses as follows:
- Let \( S \) be the amount of salt.
- Let \( O \) be the amount of oil.
- Let \( F \) be the amount of fragrance.
- Let \( C \) be the amount of citrus zest.
- Let \( G \) be the amount of sugar.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S = G \) (same amount of salt as sugar)
2. \( O = 2S \) (twice as much oil as salt)
3. \( F = C \) (same amount of fragrance as citrus zest)
4. \( S = C \) (same amount of salt as citrus zest)

Since \( S = C \) and \( F = C \), we can say \( S = F = C \).

The total amount of ingredients in the jar is 10 ounces. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total amount of ingredients as:
\[ S + O + F + C + G = 10 \]

Substituting the relationships into the equation:
\[ S + 2S + S + S + S = 10 \]
\[ 6S = 10 \]
\[ S = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \]

Since \( O = 2S \):
\[ O = 2 \times \frac{5}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \]

Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \( \frac{10}{3} \) ounces. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many cars Joe initially has. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find out how many cars he sells, we calculate 20% of 40:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

After selling 8 cars, Joe has:

\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \text{ cars} \]

Then, Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

After giving away 16 cars, Joe has:

\[ 32 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, the final number of cars Joe remains with is:

"First, let's determine the points scored by Sasha and Julie in the first game.

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, so:
\[ \text{Julie's points in the first game} = 14 - 4 = 10 \]

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie did in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored:
\[ \text{Sasha's points in the second game} = 10 - 6 = 4 \]

Now, let's calculate the total points Sasha scored during both games:
\[ \text{Total points scored by Sasha} = 14 + 4 = 18 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 18 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of tins of cat food Kimberly bought. She bought 8 packages of cat food, and each package contains 11 tins.

\[ \text{Total tins of cat food} = 8 \times 11 = 88 \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of tins of dog food Kimberly bought. She bought 6 packages of dog food, and each package contains 6 tins.

\[ \text{Total tins of dog food} = 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

Now, to find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we subtract the total number of tins of dog food from the total number of tins of cat food.

\[ \text{Difference} = 88 - 36 = 52 \]

So, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \).

According to the problem:
- Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards.
- Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.
- The total number of cards is 341.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of cards:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides to isolate the term with \( P \):
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7 to solve for \( P \):
\[ P = 47 \]

Now we can find out how many cards Becca has:
\[ \text{Becca's cards} = 3P + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

So, Becca has 153 cards."
"First, let's determine the number of each color of eggs Cindy has:

- Blue eggs: twice as many as green eggs, so \(2 \times 5 = 10\)
- Pink eggs: one fewer than blue eggs, so \(10 - 1 = 9\)
- Yellow eggs: one-third as many as pink eggs, so \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\)

Now, let's add up all the eggs:

- Total eggs = Green eggs + Blue eggs + Pink eggs + Yellow eggs
- Total eggs = 5 + 10 + 9 + 3

Let's calculate the total:

\[ 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27 \]

So, the total number of eggs Cindy had is 27."
"First, let's calculate the shipping cost. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound plus $0.08 per mile.

The cost for the weight of the book is:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.35/\text{pound} = \$1.40 \]

The cost for the distance is:
\[ 20 \text{ miles} \times \$0.08/\text{mile} = \$1.60 \]

So, the total shipping cost is:
\[ \$1.40 + \$1.60 = \$3.00 \]

Next, we calculate the refundable amount from Amazon. Since Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, the refundable amount is:
\[ 32 \text{ dollars} \times 0.75 = \$24.00 \]

Now, we calculate the total cost Milly will incur:
\[ \text{Cost of the book} + \text{Shipping cost} = 32 \text{ dollars} + 3 \text{ dollars} = \$35.00 \]

Finally, the amount of money Milly will lose is the total cost minus the refundable amount:
\[ 35 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = \$11.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"

So, the final numerical answer is $60."
"To find out how many bars of chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to first calculate the total production for the first three weeks and then subtract that from the total monthly production.

First week production: 8,000 bars

Second week production: Half of the first week, so \( \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \) bars

Third week production: Three times the first week, so \( 8,000 \times 3 = 24,000 \) bars

Total production for the first three weeks: \( 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \) bars

Monthly production: 50,000 bars

Fourth week production: Total monthly production minus the first three weeks' production, so \( 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \) bars

The number of bars of chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week is 14,000."
"To find out how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends on each activity and then sum them up.

1. **Time spent on TikTok videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week.
   - Each video is 4 minutes long.
   - Therefore, the time spent on TikTok videos each week is \(18 \times 4 = 72\) minutes.
   - In a month with four weeks, the time spent on TikTok videos is \(72 \times 4 = 288\) minutes.

2. **Time spent writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 2 hours is \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes.
   - In a month with four weeks, the time spent writing songs is \(120 \times 4 = 480\) minutes.

3. **Time spent on makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup.
   - In a week, the time spent on makeup is \(15 \times 6 = 90\) minutes.
   - In a month with four weeks, the time spent on makeup is \(90 \times 4 = 360\) minutes.

Now, we sum up the time spent on TikTok videos, writing songs, and doing makeup:
\[ 288 + 480 + 360 = 1128 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from Pompei's lifting capacity to Naruto's.

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain \(12 \times 1 = 12\) inches high.
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain \(4 \times 12 = 48\) inches high.
4. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain \(10 \times 48 = 480\) inches high.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert 480 inches to feet:

\[ 480 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's first establish the relationship between the number of kangaroos, their speed, and the time it takes for them to cross the highway.

Given:
- 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway.

Let's denote:
- The speed of one kangaroo as \( v \).
- The time taken by 3 kangaroos to cross the highway as \( t = 18 \) hours.

The distance \( D \) across the highway can be calculated using the formula:
\[ D = \text{speed} \times \text{time} \]
\[ D = v \times 18 \]

Now, we need to find out how long it will take for 4 turtles to cross the same distance. Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).

Let \( t' \) be the time it takes for 4 turtles to cross the highway. Using the distance formula again:
\[ D = \text{speed of one turtle} \times t' \]
\[ D = \left(\frac{v}{2}\right) \times t' \]

Since the distance \( D \) is the same for both the kangaroos and the turtles, we can set the two expressions for \( D \) equal to each other:
\[ v \times 18 = \left(\frac{v}{2}\right) \times t' \]

Solving for \( t' \):
\[ 18 = \frac{t'}{2} \]
\[ t' = 18 \times 2 \]
\[ t' = 36 \]

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 36 hours to cross the highway. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 36 \]"
"If Kora made 20 dishes, and Rory makes 20 more clay dishes than Kora, then Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.

Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

To find the total number of clay dishes they all made together, we add the number of dishes each person made: 20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140 dishes.

The final numerical answer is 140."
"First, let's determine the final price of the laptop after the trade-in discount. The original price of the laptop is $600, and the trade-in discount is $200. So, the final price is:

\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means she currently has:

\[ 400 - 50 = 350 \]

Erika has received money from three sources: her part-time job, her mom, and her savings in her purse. Let's denote the amount of money she has in her purse as \( x \). The total amount of money she has is the sum of her part-time job earnings, her mom's contribution, and her savings:

\[ 150 + 80 + x = 350 \]

Now, we can solve for \( x \):

\[ 230 + x = 350 \]
\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

So, Erika has $120 in her purse. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of slices from the large apples:
- Each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces.
- Adam decides to slice 3 large apples.
- Therefore, the total number of slices from the large apples is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) slices.

Next, let's calculate the total number of slices from the small apples:
- Each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces.
- Adam decides to slice 5 small apples.
- Therefore, the total number of slices from the small apples is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) slices.

Now, let's find the total number of slices Adam has:
- Total slices from large apples: 15
- Total slices from small apples: 15
- Therefore, the total number of slices Adam has is \(15 + 15 = 30\) slices.

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:
- Total slices Adam has: 30
- Slices Adam eats: 15
- Therefore, the number of slices left is \(30 - 15 = 15\) slices.

"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to have to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to calculate the current daily milk production and then find out how much additional milk is needed.

The current daily milk production from 3 cows is:
\[ 5 \text{ liters/cow/day} \times 3 \text{ cows} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The additional milk needed is:
\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed to produce the additional 10 liters of milk is:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow/day}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

"To determine how many students are good at math, we need to consider the information given:

- There are 20 students in total.
- 5 students are good at math only.
- 8 students perform well in English only.
- The rest are good at both math and English.

First, we calculate the number of students who are good at both math and English. Since the total number of students is 20, and we know the number of students who are good at math only and those who perform well in English only, we can find the number of students who are good at both by subtracting the sum of students who are good at math only and those who perform well in English only from the total number of students.

Let's denote:
- \( M \) as the number of students good at math.
- \( E \) as the number of students good at English.
- \( B \) as the number of students good at both math and English.

From the problem, we know:
- \( M = 5 \) (students good at math only)
- \( E = 8 \) (students good at English only)
- The total number of students is 20.

The number of students good at both math and English is:
\[ B = 20 - (5 + 8) = 20 - 13 = 7 \]

"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first calculate the total number of glue sticks required for the 27 students. Since each student needs 2 glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks needed is:

\[ 27 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ glue sticks/student} = 54 \text{ glue sticks} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of glue sticks are required to get at least 54 glue sticks, given that each pack contains 8 glue sticks. We do this by dividing the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:

\[ \frac{54 \text{ glue sticks}}{8 \text{ glue sticks/pack}} = 6.75 \text{ packs} \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs and he needs to have some extra glue sticks left over, he must round up to the next whole number. Therefore, he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 7 \]"
"To find the total amount of water passing through the river at that point after the third day, we need to follow the changes in the amount of water day by day.

1. **Initial amount of water on the first day:** 4000 gallons.
2. **Amount of water on the second day:** The amount doubles from the first day, so it becomes \(4000 \times 2 = 8000\) gallons.
3. **Amount of water on the third day:** The amount increases by 6000 gallons from the second day, so it becomes \(8000 + 6000 = 14000\) gallons.

Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point after the third day is 14000 gallons.

\[
\boxed{14000}

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of new infections each day and add them to the total number of infected people.

- **Day 0**: Initially, there are 10 infected people.
- **Day 1**: Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others, so the number of new infections is \(10 \times 6 = 60\). Therefore, the total number of infected people after Day 1 is \(10 + 60 = 70\).
- **Day 2**: Now there are 70 infected people, and each of them infects 6 others. So, the number of new infections is \(70 \times 6 = 420\). Therefore, the total number of infected people after Day 2 is \(70 + 420 = 490\).
- **Day 3**: Now there are 490 infected people, and each of them infects 6 others. So, the number of new infections is \(490 \times 6 = 2940\). Therefore, the total number of infected people after Day 3 is \(490 + 2940 = 3430\).

So, the total number of people infected after three days is 3430."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Rafaela received as tips. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate the total as follows:

\[ \text{Total tips for Rafaela} = 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Julieta received as tips. Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To find out how much less, we calculate 10% of Rafaela's total tips:

\[ \text{10% of Rafaela's tips} = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]

So, Julieta received:

\[ \text{Total tips for Julieta} = 800 - 80 = 720 \]

Now, to find out how much money Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether, we add their individual totals:

\[ \text{Total tips for both} = 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1520 \]"

"First, let's determine the number of green cars. Since there are 12 red cars and 2 fewer green cars than red cars:

\[ \text{Number of green cars} = 12 - 2 = 10 \]

Next, we calculate the number of blue cars. The number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars:

\[ \text{Number of blue cars} = 3 \times 10 = 30 \]

Now, we can find the total number of red, green, and blue cars:

\[ \text{Total of red, green, and blue cars} = 12 + 10 + 30 = 52 \]

Given that the total number of cars in the rink is 75, we can find the number of yellow cars by subtracting the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:

\[ \text{Number of yellow cars} = 75 - 52 = 23 \]

So, the number of yellow cars is 23."
"Let's denote the number of books Anne has as \( A \), the number of books Sofie has as \( S \), and the number of books Fawn has as \( F \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S = A + 25 \)
2. \( A = F - 12 \)
3. \( S + A + F = 85 \)

We can substitute the expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \) into the third equation. First, we express \( A \) and \( S \) in terms of \( F \):
- From \( A = F - 12 \), we get \( S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \).

Now, substitute \( S \) and \( A \) in the total books equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books. The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to determine how much Madeline and Keenan each pay per month.

Given that Madeline pays 60% of the $400 per month, we can calculate her monthly payment as follows:
\[ \text{Madeline's monthly payment} = 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the total monthly cost is $400, Keenan's monthly payment is:
\[ \text{Keenan's monthly payment} = 400 - 240 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much Keenan spends per week, we divide his monthly payment by the number of weeks in a month:
\[ \text{Keenan's weekly payment} = \frac{160}{4} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Keenan spends 40 dollars per week."
"First, let's calculate how many pieces Tobias ate on the first day. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 pieces:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ pieces}
\]

So, after the first day, the number of pieces remaining is:

\[
60 - 24 = 36 \text{ pieces}
\]

On the second day, Tobias ate 10 pieces, so the number of pieces remaining after the second day is:

\[
36 - 10 = 26 \text{ pieces}
\]

On the third day, Tobias ate \( \frac{7}{13} \) of the remaining 26 pieces:

\[
\frac{7}{13} \times 26 = 14 \text{ pieces}
\]

So, after the third day, the number of pieces remaining is:

\[
26 - 14 = 12 \text{ pieces}

"To determine how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Use the total revenue to find the cost of the chickens.

First, let's calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell. He plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his 300 chickens:
\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \text{ chickens}
\]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling these 180 chickens at $50 per chicken:
\[
180 \times 50 = 9000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. Therefore, the total cost of the chickens is the total revenue minus the profit:

"To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we first need to determine how many glasses Micah sold.

The total number of glasses sold by Julie, Micah, and Mitchell is 32. Julie sold 14 glasses. Since the boys sold an equal number of glasses, we can denote the number of glasses sold by each boy as \( x \).

The equation representing the total number of glasses sold is:
\[ 14 + x + x = 32 \]
\[ 14 + 2x = 32 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ 2x = 32 - 14 \]
\[ 2x = 18 \]
\[ x = 9 \]

So, each boy sold 9 glasses. Since Micah sold 9 glasses, we now need to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the rope Sarah has for her friend. The rope is 20 meters long and costs $2 per meter.

\[
\text{Total cost of the rope} = 20 \text{ meters} \times 2 \text{ dollars/meter} = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to determine how much money Sarah will have left after selling the rope. Since she sells the rope for $2 per meter, the total revenue from selling the rope is:

\[
\text{Total revenue} = 20 \text{ meters} \times 2 \text{ dollars/meter} = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

Sarah will use this $40 to buy a new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter. To find out how many meters of the new rope she can buy, we divide the total money she has by the cost per meter of the new rope:

\[
\text{Number of meters of new rope} = \frac{40 \text{ dollars}}{1.5 \text{ dollars/meter}} = \frac{40}{1.5} = \frac{400}{15} = \frac{80}{3} \approx 26.67 \text{ meters}
\]

Since she can only buy whole meters of the new rope, she can buy 26 meters of the new rope. The cost for 26 meters of the new rope is:

\[
\text{Cost of 26 meters of new rope} = 26 \text{ meters} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars/meter} = 39 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we calculate how much money Sarah will have left after buying the new rope:

\[
\text{Money left} = 40 \text{ dollars} - 39 \text{ dollars} = 1 \text{ dollar}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1}

"First, let's calculate the cost of each item Kelly is buying:

1. **Bacon:**
   - 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total.
   - Cost per pack of bacon = $10 / 5 = $2.

2. **Chicken:**
   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - Cost per packet of chicken = 2 * $2 = $4.
   - 6 packets of chicken cost = 6 * $4 = $24.

3. **Strawberries:**
   - Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   - 3 packs of strawberries cost = 3 * $4 = $12.

4. **Apples:**
   - Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   - Cost per pack of apples = $4 / 2 = $2.
   - 7 packs of apples cost = 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's sum up the total cost of all the items:
- Total cost of bacon = $10.
- Total cost of chicken = $24.
- Total cost of strawberries = $12.
- Total cost of apples = $14.

Total cost of all items = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60.

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget:

\[ \text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants, so we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. We find the number of flowering plants by subtracting the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:

\[ \text{Number of flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25 \]

To find what percent of the total plants are flowering plants, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how fast a whirligig spins, we first need to determine the speed of the thingamabob. We know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, we can calculate the speed of the thingamabob as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{\text{Speed of whatchamacallit}}{11} = \frac{121 \text{ meters/second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters/second} \]

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can determine the speed of the whirligig. We know that a whirligig spins five times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of the whirligig is:

\[ \text{Speed of whirligig} = 5 \times \text{Speed of thingamabob} = 5 \times 11 \text{ meters/second} = 55 \text{ meters/second} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 55 \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the yogurt. Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, and the salad costs $6, the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the salad and the yogurt:
- Salad: $6
- Yogurt: $3

The total cost for the salad and the yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.

Ellen pays a total of $11 for her goods every day. Therefore, the cost for the two carrots she eats every day is $11 - $9 = $2.

Since she eats two carrots every day, the cost for one carrot is $2 / 2 = $1.

"To solve this, let's first determine how much Tasha earned from mowing lawns.

Given:
- Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's lawn.
- Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's lawn.
- Joe paid Tasha $6 for mowing his lawn.

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( x \).

Then:
- Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times.
- Tasha mowed Alba's lawn \( 5x \) times.

The total earnings from mowing lawns can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Total earnings from mowing lawns} = 6x + 6(3x) + 6(5x) \]
\[ = 6x + 18x + 30x \]
\[ = 54x \]

Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. Therefore, the earnings from mowing lawns alone is $54x. To find \( x \), we set up the equation:
\[ 54x = 54 \]
\[ x = 1 \]

Now, we can calculate the earnings from mowing lawns:
\[ \text{Earnings from mowing lawns} = 54 \times 1 = 54 \]

Finally, to find out how much Tasha made from lemonade sales, we subtract the earnings from mowing lawns from her total earnings:
\[ \text{Earnings from lemonade sales} = 80 - 54 = 26 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 26 \]"
"First, let's find Carl's weight. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, we can calculate Carl's weight as follows:

Carl's weight = Martin's weight + 16 kg
Carl's weight = 55 kg + 16 kg
Carl's weight = 71 kg

Next, we find Christian's weight. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight:

Christian's weight = Carl's weight + 8 kg
Christian's weight = 71 kg + 8 kg
Christian's weight = 79 kg

Finally, we find Harry's weight. Harry is 5 kg less than Christian's weight:

Harry's weight = Christian's weight - 5 kg
Harry's weight = 79 kg - 5 kg
Harry's weight = 74 kg

So, the weight of Harry is 74 kg."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours John rents his car out in a month. He rents his car 10 times a month, and each time it's rented for 3 hours. So, the total number of hours rented in a month is:

\[ 10 \text{ times/month} \times 3 \text{ hours/time} = 30 \text{ hours/month} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money John earns from renting his car in a month. He gets paid $25 per hour, so:

\[ 30 \text{ hours/month} \times 25 \text{ dollars/hour} = 750 \text{ dollars/month} \]

Now, we need to find out the profit John makes. To do this, we subtract his monthly car payment from the total amount he earns from renting his car:

\[ 750 \text{ dollars/month} - 500 \text{ dollars/month} = 250 \text{ dollars/month} \]

So, the profit John makes on his car is:

\[ 250 \text{ dollars/month} \]

"To find the total distance Dijana and Anis rowed on that Sunday, we first need to determine how far Anis rowed.

Dijana rowed 50 miles.

Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. To find out how much more Anis rowed, we calculate 1/5 of Dijana's distance:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles} \]

So, Anis rowed 10 miles more than Dijana. Therefore, the total distance Anis rowed is:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis to find the total distance they rowed together:
\[ 50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles} \]

The total distance the two of them rowed on that day is:
\[ \boxed{110} \]"

"First, let's determine how many pages each person read over the two days.

Yesterday:
- Denise read 10 pages.
- Daniel read 13 pages.

Today:
- Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.
- Daniel was not able to read any pages today, so he read 0 pages today.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages each person read over the two days:
- Denise's total: \(10 + 18 = 28\) pages.
- Daniel's total: \(13 + 0 = 13\) pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total number of pages Daniel read from the total number of pages Denise read:
\[ 28 - 13 = 15 \]

So, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to first understand the capacity of the pot and how it is divided among the family members.

1. The pot can fill four adult's bowls.
2. The pot can also fill eight child's bowls.

Since Calvin is an adult, he will have one bowl of soup. His wife is also an adult, so she will have one bowl of soup. This accounts for 2 adult bowls.

This leaves us with 2 bowls of soup for the two children. Since each child can have one bowl of soup, the two children will each have one bowl of soup.

Therefore, each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, and since there are two children, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch once.

\[ 5 \times 1.50 = 7.50 \]

The cost of one ballpen is $0.50, and William bought one ballpen. So, the total cost for the ballpen is:
\[ 1 \times 0.50 = 0.50 \]

Now, we add the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen to find the total amount William spent:
\[ 7.50 + 0.50 = 8.00 \]

Therefore, William spent a total of $8.00."
"To determine the amount of material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate the material required for each type of mask separately.

First, let's calculate the material needed for the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4} = 0.5 \text{ yards} \).
- For 20 small masks, the material needed is \( 20 \times 0.5 \text{ yards} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

Next, let's calculate the material needed for the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3} = 0.75 \text{ yards} \).
- For 8 large masks, the material needed is \( 8 \times 0.75 \text{ yards} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

Now, we add the material needed for the small and large masks together:
- Total material needed = material for small masks + material for large masks
- Total material needed = 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards

Therefore, the total amount of material Jo would need to make 20 small and 8 large masks is 16 yards."
"To find the average price per ticket, we first need to determine the total number of tickets Fast and the Furious movies Deepa has seen. Since there are 9 movies and she has seen each one three times, the total number of tickets is:

\[ 9 \text{ movies} \times 3 \text{ times per movie} = 27 \text{ tickets} \]

Deepa has spent $216 in total for these 27 tickets. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets:

\[ \text{Average price per ticket} = \frac{216}{27} \]

Now, let's calculate this:

\[ \frac{216}{27} = 8 \]

So, the average price Deepa paid per ticket is $8."
"To determine Harold's free time, we need to calculate the total time he spends on activities and then subtract that from the total hours in a day.

1. Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. He works for 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.
3. He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, let's add up the time spent on these activities:
- Sleep: 10 hours
- Work: 8 hours
- Dog walking: 1 hour

Total time spent on activities = 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 hours.

There are 24 hours in a day, so the free time Harold has left is:

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( D \) be Duncan's age eight years ago and \( A \) be Adam's age four years ago.

From the problem, we know:
1. Duncan's current age is 60.
2. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( 60 - 8 = 52 \).
3. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was two times Adam's age four years ago.

So, we can write the equation:
\[ D = 2A \]
\[ 52 = 2A \]

From this equation, we can solve for \( A \):
\[ A = \frac{52}{2} = 26 \]

This means Adam's age four years ago was 26. To find Adam's current age, we add 4 years to 26:
\[ \text{Adam's current age} = 26 + 4 = 30 \]

To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 years to his current age:
\[ \text{Adam's age in 8 years} = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the size of Farmer Smith's farm. Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

So, twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm is:
\[ 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ acres} \]

Adding 100 acres to this amount gives the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \text{ acres} \]

Now, to find the total number of acres for both farms, we add the size of Farmer Brown's farm to the size of Farmer Smith's farm:

"Let's denote the number of red balloons as \( R \) and the number of yellow balloons as \( Y \). According to the problem, \( R = 20 \).

Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon, so the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is \( 2R \). Given that \( R = 20 \), the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \).

The total number of pieces of bologna thrown at all balloons is 58. Therefore, the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons is \( 58 - 40 = 18 \).

Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, the number of yellow balloons \( Y \) can be found by dividing the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons by 3. So, \( Y = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).

Thus, the number of yellow balloons is 6.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total cups of tea**: Lana has 27 cups of tea.
2. **Rows of tea cups**: She divides these cups into 3 rows, so each row has \( \frac{27}{3} = 9 \) cups.
3. **Tea types in each row**: In each row, she brews an equal amount of chamomile and mint tea. Therefore, each row has \( \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \) cups of chamomile tea and \( \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \) cups of mint tea.
4. **Cups of cinnamon tea**: She uses the remaining cups to brew 15 cups of cinnamon tea. Since she has 27 cups in total, the remaining cups after dividing into rows are \( 27 - (3 \times 9) = 27 - 27 = 0 \) cups. This means there are no remaining cups to brew cinnamon tea, which is consistent with the problem statement.

Since each row has 4.5 cups of mint tea, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground, given that he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

First, let's break down the time spent on each trip:
- The sloth takes 4 hours to make the trip down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up into his tree.

Since the sloth needs to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we need to find out how many trips he can make in 8 hours.

The time for one complete trip is 4 hours. Therefore, in 8 hours, the number of trips he can make is:
\[ \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips} \]

Since he needs to collect 24 berries in 8 hours and he can make 2 trips in that time, the number of berries he needs to pick up per trip is:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip} \]

Thus, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip down to the ground is:

"First, let's determine the amount of water in the tank. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons of water, the tank will have:

\[ \text{Tank capacity} = \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much water will be left in the tank after 6 days, given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. The total amount of water removed from the tank over 6 days is:

\[ \text{Total water removed} = 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we subtract the total amount of water removed from the initial capacity of the tank to find the remaining water:

\[ \text{Remaining water} = 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 13 \times 10 = 130 \text{ dollars} \]

Since he has already spent $130 on tickets, he cannot afford any more tickets with his remaining $126. Therefore, the number of additional movies he can see is:
\[ \frac{126}{10} = 12.6 \]

Since he can only see whole movies, he can see 12 more movies.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"First, let's calculate the calories for the mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins.

For the mini cinnamon rolls:
- A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
- A mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll.
- Therefore, a mini cinnamon roll has \( \frac{600}{3} = 200 \) calories.
- Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls.
- So, the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls are \( 200 \times 200 = 40000 \) calories.

For the mini blueberry muffins:
- A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
- A mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin.
- Therefore, a mini blueberry muffin has \( \frac{450}{3} = 150 \) calories.
- Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins.
- So, the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins are \( 300 \times 150 = 45000 \) calories.

Now, let's add the total calories from both the mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins:
- Total calories = calories from mini cinnamon rolls + calories from mini blueberry muffins
- Total calories = 40000 + 45000 = 85000

The final numerical answer is 85000."
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the five days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, which means she removed \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs each day.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days:
\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

First, add the Junebugs removed on Monday and Tuesday:
\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]

Next, add the Junebugs removed on Wednesday:
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]

Then, add the Junebugs removed on Thursday:
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]

Finally, add the Junebugs removed on Friday:
\[
243 + 57 = 300
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days is 300.

To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days (5):
\[
\frac{300}{5} = 60
\]

Thus, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is 60."
"To find out how much farther the bus traveled than the car, we first need to calculate the distance each traveled.

The distance traveled by the bus can be calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For the bus:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

For the car:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find out how much farther the bus traveled than the car:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to subtract the total number of other toys from the total number of toys Sophie has for her nephew.

The total number of other toys is the sum of the building blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings:
\[ 31 \text{ (building blocks)} + 8 \text{ (stuffed animals)} + 9 \text{ (stacking rings)} = 48 \]

Sophie's total number of toys for her nephew is 62. Therefore, the number of bouncy balls is:
\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

So, the number of bouncy balls that came in the tube is 14."
"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old: \( P + Pa + J = 100 \).
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean: \( Pa = J + 10 \).
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: \( P = Pa + J \).

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[ P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10. \]

Now we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100. \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100, \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100. \]
Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 4J = 80. \]
Divide both sides by 4:
\[ J = 20. \]

Now that we have \( J \), we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[ Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30, \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50. \]

So, the age of Peter is \( 50 \) years old. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Initially, Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons, so that's 4 friends * 2 balloons/friend = 8 balloons. Maria also received 2 balloons, so the total number of balloons at this point is 8 (for her friends) + 2 (for Maria) = 10 balloons.

Then, her mom gave each person 3 more balloons. There are 4 friends + 1 Maria = 5 people in total. So, 5 people * 3 balloons/person = 15 additional balloons.

Adding the additional balloons to the initial total, we get 10 (initial total) + 15 (additional balloons) = 25 balloons.

The final numerical answer is 25."
"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes of stuff they have:

- 10 people donate 5 boxes each: \(10 \times 5 = 50\) boxes
- They already have 10 boxes of stuff
- Total boxes of stuff: \(50 + 10 = 60\) boxes

Next, let's determine how many tables they can fit with the total number of boxes:

- They can fit 2 boxes per table
- Total tables they can fit: \(60 \div 2 = 30\) tables

They already own 15 tables, so we need to find out how many more tables they need:

- Tables needed: \(30 - 15 = 15\) tables

The final numerical answer is 15."
"First, let's calculate the total distance Zoey spits her seeds. Zoey has 40 seeds and spits each one 10 feet. So, the total distance Zoey spits is:

\[ 40 \text{ seeds} \times 10 \text{ feet/seed} = 400 \text{ feet} \]

Next, let's calculate the total distance Sydney spits her seeds. Sydney has 35 seeds and spits each one 12 feet. So, the total distance Sydney spits is:

\[ 35 \text{ seeds} \times 12 \text{ feet/seed} = 420 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we need to find the average total distance spat by both Zoey and Sydney. To do this, we add the total distances and divide by the number of people (which is 2):

\[ \text{Average total distance} = \frac{400 \text{ feet} + 420 \text{ feet}}{2} = \frac{820 \text{ feet}}{2} = 410 \text{ feet} \]

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the daily, monthly, and total widget production for each machine and then find the difference in revenue.

First, let's calculate the daily widget production for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1440 widgets/day
- WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1080 widgets/day

Next, let's calculate the monthly widget production for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: 1440 widgets/day * 30 days/month = 43200 widgets/month
- WidgetMaster 9000: 1080 widgets/day * 30 days/month = 32400 widgets/month

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling each machine's monthly production:
- Widgeteer 3000: 43200 widgets * $6/widget = $259200
- WidgetMaster 9000: 32400 widgets * $6/widget = $194400

Finally, let's find the difference in revenue:
- Difference: $259200 - $194400 = $64800

So, Fern will make $64800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000."
"To determine how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the total cost of his stay under both options and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost if Cameron pays for a 24-hour stay:
- The initial 12-hour stay costs 1600 pesos.
- The additional 12 hours cost 12 * 70 pesos = 840 pesos.
- Therefore, the total cost for a 24-hour stay is 1600 + 840 = 2440 pesos.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Cameron pays for the additional hours after the initial 12 hours:
- The initial 12-hour stay costs 1600 pesos.
- The additional hours from 12 pm to 10 am the next morning is 10 pm - 12 pm = 10 hours.
- The cost for these additional hours is 10 * 70 pesos = 700 pesos.
- Therefore, the total cost for the additional hours is 1600 + 700 = 2300 pesos.

Now, we find the difference between the two costs to determine how much Cameron would save:
- The savings would be the cost of a 24-hour stay minus the cost of the additional hours: 2440 - 2300 = 140 pesos.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. So, we calculate twice the amount each goat needs and then subtract 3 pounds:

\[ \text{Hay per sheep} = 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep. There are 15 goats, and each needs 5 pounds of hay:

\[ \text{Hay for goats} = 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

There are 12 sheep, and each needs 7 pounds of hay:

\[ \text{Hay for sheep} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the hay needed for the goats and the sheep gives us the total amount of hay Nate needs:

\[ \text{Total hay} = 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 159 \]"
"First, let's calculate John's total earnings for the week:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Hourly wage} \times \text{Hours worked} = 50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the gas:
\[ \text{Cost of gas} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the remaining money after spending on gas:
\[ \text{Remaining money after gas} = \text{Total earnings} - \text{Cost of gas} = 300 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so we subtract that from the remaining money:
\[ \text{Money left after deposit} = \text{Remaining money after gas} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of 5 pencils:
\[ \text{Cost of 5 pencils} = 5 \times 10 \text{ dollars/pencil} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the cost of the pencils from the money left after the deposit:
\[ \text{Money left after buying pencils} = \text{Money left after deposit} - \text{Cost of 5 pencils} = 150 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, let's determine how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with the remaining money:
\[ \text{Number of pens} = \frac{\text{Money left after buying pencils}}{\text{Cost of one pen}} = \frac{100 \text{ dollars}}{25 \text{ dollars/pen}} = 4 \text{ pens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount. James gets 10 new CDs, and each CD costs $15.

\[ \text{Total cost before discount} = 10 \times 15 = 150 \]

Next, we apply the 40% discount to the total cost.

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 150 \times 0.40 = 60 \]

\[ \text{Total cost after discount} = 150 - 60 = 90 \]

James decides to sell 5 of the CDs he doesn't like for $40. The cost of these 5 CDs is:

\[ \text{Cost of 5 CDs} = 5 \times 15 = 75 \]

So, the money James is out is the cost of the 5 CDs minus the money he got from selling them.

\[ \text{Money out} = 75 - 40 = 35 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 35 \]"

"First, let's calculate the distance James swims. He swims 60% of the 20-mile lake, which is:

\[ 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes for James to swim 12 miles at a pace of 2 miles per hour:

\[ \text{Time to swim 12 miles} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

James then rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is:

\[ \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

After resting, James swims the remaining 8 miles (20 miles - 12 miles) at half the speed, which is:

\[ \text{Speed for the remaining distance} = \frac{2 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile/hour} \]

The time it takes for James to swim the remaining 8 miles at 1 mile per hour is:

\[ \text{Time to swim remaining 8 miles} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, the total time it took James to get across the lake is the sum of the swimming time, the resting time, and the swimming time for the remaining distance:

\[ \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours} \]

- 15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes.

Now, determine how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:
- 900 minutes / 15 minutes/interval = 60 intervals.

Since Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes, we can calculate the total number of reports he stapled:
- 60 intervals * 30 reports/interval = 1800 reports.

Therefore, the total number of reports Vince stapled is 1800."
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up early.

1. **Total sleep time**: Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Converting this to minutes:
   \[
   8 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes}

\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Next, Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. Therefore, Shawna's father's age is:
\[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 45 \]"
"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate the number that is 20% less than the number Courtney reported.

Courtney reported 48 people attended the concert. If this number is 20% more than the actual number, we can set up the following equation to find the actual number of attendees (let's call it \( x \)):

\[ 48 = x + 0.20x \]
\[ 48 = 1.20x \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.20:

\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \). According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls. Therefore, we can set \( 2J = 2 \), which means \( J = 1 \). So, Jeffrey carried 1 ball, Jason carried \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) balls, and Jordan carried \( 4 \times 1 = 4 \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey:
\[ 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 7."
"To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the number of holes at the end of the first day.
3. Calculate the number of holes at the end of the third day.
4. Find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
- First day: 10 holes
- Second day: 13 holes
- Third day: 8 holes (but they filled in 2 holes, so they actually dug 8 - 2 = 6 holes)

Total holes by the end of the third day = 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 holes.

The island had four times as many holes by the end of the third day as it did at the end of the first day. So, the number of holes at the end of the first day is:
\[ \text{Holes at the end of the first day} = \frac{29}{4} = 7.25 \]

Since the number of holes must be a whole number, and considering the context of digging holes, it seems there might be a slight discrepancy in the interpretation. However, for the purpose of this problem, we'll assume the number of holes at the end of the first day is 7 (as it's the closest whole number).

Now, let's find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day. The number of holes at the end of the third day is 29, and the number of holes at the end of the fourth day is:
\[ \text{Holes at the end of the fourth day} = 4 \times 7 = 28 \]

So, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[ \text{Holes dug on the fourth day} = 29 - 28 = 1 \]

Therefore, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of corn chips given the conditions.

1. Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips.
2. Collins received 15 more corn chips than the number Amora and Lainey received.

First, calculate the number of corn chips Collins received:
\[ \text{Collins' chips} = 70 + 15 = 85 \]

Next, calculate the total number of corn chips by summing the chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:
\[ \text{Total chips} = 70 + 70 + 85 \]

Now, perform the addition:
\[ 70 + 70 = 140 \]
\[ 140 + 85 = 225 \]

Therefore, the total number of corn chips is:
\[ 225 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{225} \]"
"To find the cost of the travel tickets, we first need to calculate 50% more than the cost of the supplies. The supplies cost $400 in total.

50% of $400 is calculated as:
\[ 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the cost of the travel tickets is:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Therefore, the travel cost is $600."
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( X = S + 5 \)
2. \( S = 4A - 13 \)
3. \( X + S + A = 339 \)

First, we substitute the expressions for \( X \) and \( S \) from the first two equations into the third equation.

Substituting \( X = S + 5 \) and \( S = 4A - 13 \) into \( X + S + A = 339 \):

\[ (4A - 13) + 5 + (4A - 13) + A = 339 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 4A - 13 + 5 + 4A - 13 + A = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Add 21 to both sides:

\[ 9A = 360 \]

Divide both sides by 9:

\[ A = 40 \]

Now, we can find \( S \) using \( S = 4A - 13 \):

\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

The final numerical answer is:
147"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Each episode is 20 minutes long.
2. Let the number of episodes be \( E \).
3. According to the problem, the number of episodes \( E \) is half as many as the minutes per episode. Since each episode is 20 minutes long, we can write:
   \[
   E = \frac{20}{2} = 10
   \]
4. To find the total time John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = E \times 20 = 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show is 200 minutes."
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance the bird traveled in each leg of the journey and then sum these distances.

1. **First Leg:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Second Leg:**
   - Direction: Norttherly
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \)

3. **Third Leg:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \)

Now, we sum the distances of all three legs to find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes:

\[ 300 \text{ miles} + 36 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 446 \text{ miles} \]

The distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is **446 miles**."
"First, let's determine the total number of brownies Greta had initially.

- For her birthday, she made 1 dozen brownies: \(1 \times 12 = 12\) brownies.
- At her office party, she received 1/2 dozen brownies: \(1/2 \times 12 = 6\) brownies.
- At her friend's surprise party, she received 4 dozen brownies: \(4 \times 12 = 48\) brownies.
- During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten: \(1.5 \times 12 = 18\) brownies.

Now, let's add up all the brownies she received:
\[12 + 6 + 48 = 66\]

Next, we subtract the number of brownies eaten during the party:
\[66 - 18 = 48\]

So, the total number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is:

"To find the total age of Nani, his brother, and his sister, we need to calculate the ages of each family member and then sum them up.

1. Nani's age is given as 8 years.
2. Nani's brother is twice Nani's age, so his brother's age is \( 8 \times 2 = 16 \) years.
3. Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. So, her age is \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \) years.

Now, we sum up the ages of Nani, his brother, and his sister:
\[ 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 \]

The total age of all three family members is 30."
"To find the total time Andy will take to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of racquet and then sum them up.

For synthetic gut:
3 racquets * 15 minutes per racquet = 45 minutes

The final numerical answer is 227 minutes."
"To solve this, let's break down the cost:

1. The first two phones cost $600 each.
2. The third phone is half the price of the first phone, so it costs $600 / 2 = $300.
3. The fourth phone is also half the price of the first phone, so it also costs $300.

Now, let's calculate the total cost:

- Cost of the first phone: $600
- Cost of the second phone: $600
- Cost of the third phone: $300
- Cost of the fourth phone: $300

Total cost = $600 + $600 + $300 + $300 = $1800

"To find the total number of players in both teams combined, we first need to determine the number of players on Zeke's team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team as follows:

Number of players on Zeke's team = Number of players on Carlton's team + 7
Number of players on Zeke's team = 13 + 7
Number of players on Zeke's team = 20

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams combined, we add the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team:

Total number of players = Number of players on Zeke's team + Number of players on Carlton's team
Total number of players = 20 + 13
Total number of players = 33

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 33."
"To determine the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the total length of the fence he is building. The fence is a rectangular shape with a length of 15 feet and a width of 10 feet. The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Robert needs 2 wooden slats for every foot of fencing. Therefore, the total number of wooden slats required is:

\[ \text{Total slats} = 50 \times 2 = 100 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington initially had and how many she gave away:

- Total boxes bought: 12
- Boxes given to mom: 2
- Boxes given to sister: 2

Total boxes given away = 2 + 2 = 4

So, the number of boxes Mrs. Harrington kept is:
12 - 4 = 8 boxes

Each box contains 20 oranges, so the total number of oranges is:
12 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 240 oranges

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges, so the number of oranges she kept is:
1/4 * 240 oranges = 60 oranges

Therefore, the number of oranges she sold is:
240 oranges - 60 oranges = 180 oranges

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's first determine the number of states in the USA. According to the latest data, the United States has 50 states.

Given that India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, we can calculate the number of states in India as follows:
- Half the number of states in the USA is \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \).
- India has 4 more than this, so the number of states in India is \( 25 + 4 = 29 \).

Now, to find the total number of states in both countries together, we add the number of states in India and the number of states in the USA:
- Total number of states = Number of states in India + Number of states in the USA
- Total number of states = 29 + 50 = 79

The final numerical answer is 79."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Tyler wants to buy:
- Dictionary: $18
- Dinosaur book: $13
- Children's cookbook: $8

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Tyler has already saved $14. So, the additional amount he needs to earn is:
Additional amount needed = Total cost - Amount saved
Additional amount needed = $39 - $14 = $25

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn the additional $25, we divide the additional amount needed by his hourly wage:
Hours needed = Additional amount needed / Hourly wage
Hours needed = $25 / $5 = 5 hours

"First, let's determine how many cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 30 cherries and has 10 more than Richard, we can calculate Richard's cherries as follows:

\[ \text{Richard's cherries} = \text{Robert's cherries} - 10 = 30 - 10 = 20 \]

Now, we know the total number of cherries is 60. We can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting the number of cherries Richard and Robert have from the total:

\[ \text{Jerry's cherries} = \text{Total cherries} - (\text{Richard's cherries} + \text{Robert's cherries}) = 60 - (20 + 30) = 60 - 50 = 10 \]

Now, to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Robert's cherries} - \text{Jerry's cherries} = 30 - 10 = 20 \]

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's define the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother as \(D\) and \(B\) respectively.

Given:
- Emil is currently 19 years old.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.

First, let's determine how many years it will be until Emil turns 24:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \text{ years} \]

In 5 years, Emil will be 24 years old. At that time, his dad will be:
\[ D + 5 \]
And Emil will be half the age of his dad:
\[ 24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5) \]
Solving for \(D\):
\[ 24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5) \]
\[ 48 = D + 5 \]
\[ D = 43 \]
So, Emil's dad is currently 43 years old.

Next, in 5 years, Emil will be 24 years old. At that time, his brother will be:
\[ B + 5 \]
And Emil will be twice as old as his brother:
\[ 24 = 2 (B + 5) \]
Solving for \(B\):
\[ 24 = 2 (B + 5) \]
\[ 24 = 2B + 10 \]
\[ 14 = 2B \]
\[ B = 7 \]
So, Emil's brother is currently 7 years old.

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother:
\[ D + B = 43 + 7 = 50 \]

The sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is:

The total amount of crawfish caught over the three days is \(3 + 12 + 6 = 21\) pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, the number of servings Joe has is \(21 \div 3 = 7\).

The final numerical answer is 7."
"First, let's find out how many students are football players. Since 20% of the class are football players, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 30 = \frac{20}{100} \times 30 = 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are football players. This means the remaining number of students is:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining 24 students are either cheerleaders or part of the band. Since 25% of the remaining students are cheerleaders or part of the band, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 24 = \frac{25}{100} \times 24 = 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are either cheerleaders or part of the band. Adding the football players to these students, we get the total number of students leaving early:

"First, let's convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches to match the units of the flower width. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

\[ 111 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 1332 \text{ inches} \]

Each flower is 12 inches wide, and there needs to be 1.5 feet (which is 18 inches) between every plant. So, the total space taken by one plant and the space between it and the next plant is:

\[ 12 \text{ inches} + 18 \text{ inches} = 30 \text{ inches} \]

To find out how many plants can fit in the flower bed, we divide the total length of the flower bed by the space taken by one plant and the space between it and the next plant:

\[ \frac{1332 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/plant}} = 44.4 \]

Since Pat can't plant a fraction of a plant, she can plant 44 plants. Pat already owns 17 plants, so she needs to buy:

\[ 44 - 17 = 27 \text{ plants} \]

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for the new plants is:

\[ 27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 162 \]"

\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of soil they have is 30 pounds. So, the remaining soil for roses is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. Therefore, the number of roses they can plant is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"First, let's determine how much Jessica sets aside each month for fancy shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly paycheck.

\[ \text{Amount set aside per month} = 25\% \times \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times \$2,000.00 = \$500.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how much she can spend on shoes in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the monthly amount by 12.

\[ \text{Amount set aside per year} = \$500.00 \times 12 = \$6,000.00 \]

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. To find out how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we divide the total amount she can spend by the cost of one pair of shoes.

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes} = \frac{\$6,000.00}{\$1,000.00} = 6 \]

So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, we divide the total number of shrimp by the number of shrimp she can peel per minute:

\[ \text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to saute 30 shrimp. Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we need to determine how many sets of 30 shrimp are in 90 shrimp:

\[ \text{Number of sets of 30 shrimp in 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/set}} = 3 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 30 shrimp takes 10 minutes to saute, the total time to saute 90 shrimp is:

\[ \text{Total time to saute 90 shrimp} = 3 \text{ sets} \times 10 \text{ minutes/set} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time it takes to peel the shrimp and the time it takes to saute the shrimp:

\[ \text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

   - Total change: +2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = +4 degrees

Now, we sum up all the temperature changes:
- Total change = -6 degrees + (-12 degrees) + 4 degrees = -14 degrees

The room was 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature after the air conditioner was turned off.

**Final numerical answer:**

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's father when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Bill's father saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Since his father was 30 years old when he saw the comet, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet for the second time.

3. **Determine the age difference between the first and second sightings:**
   - The comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, so the second sighting is 75 years after the first sighting.
   - Therefore, Bill was 90 - 75 = 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

So, the final numerical answer is:
15"
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, let's break down the information given:

1. He writes a check for the electric bill once per month.
2. He writes a check for the gas bill once per month.
3. He writes a check to the church twice per month.
4. He writes a check to the pest and lawn service quarterly (which is 4 times per year).

First, let's calculate the number of checks he writes for the electric and gas bills:
- Electric bill: 12 checks per year (once per month)
- Gas bill: 12 checks per year (once per month)

Next, let's calculate the number of checks he writes for the church:
- Church: 24 checks per year (twice per month)

Finally, let's calculate the number of checks he writes for the pest and lawn service:
- Pest and lawn service: 4 checks per year (quarterly)

Now, we sum up all the checks:
- Electric bill: 12 checks
- Gas bill: 12 checks
- Church: 24 checks
- Pest and lawn service: 4 checks

Total number of checks per year = 12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52 checks

The final numerical answer is 52."
"Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as \( F \). According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4}F \). The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany, so the number of flights to France is \( \frac{1}{4}F \) and the number of flights to Germany is also \( \frac{1}{4}F \).

The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and this is half the number of flights the first plane makes in a day. Therefore, the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day is \( 2 \times 44 = 88 \). So, \( F = 88 \).

Now, we can calculate the number of flights to France by the first plane:
\[ \text{Flights to France} = \frac{1}{4}F = \frac{1}{4} \times 88 = 22. \]

The final numerical answer is:
22"
"First, let's determine the duration of each wolf's howl.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so:
\[ \text{Chikote's howl duration} = 2 \times 20 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Igneous howls for as long as Tobias and Chikote combined, so:
\[ \text{Igneous's howl duration} = 20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} = 60 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, let's find the combined duration of all three wolves' howls in seconds:
\[ \text{Combined duration} = 20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} + 60 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ seconds} \]

To convert the combined duration from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):
\[ \text{Combined duration in minutes} = \frac{120 \text{ seconds}}{60} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much money Adam's father gave him. Since his father gave him twice as much as his mother, and his mother gave him $6, his father gave him:

\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Now, let's add the money given by his mother and father:

\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \]

Adam spent $30 on the trousers. To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount given by his parents from the cost of the trousers:

\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

So, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"To find Wilfred's age, we first need to determine the average age of the group. The total age of the children is given as 20 years. Since there are four children, the average age is:

\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Total age of the children}}{\text{Number of children}} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \text{ years}
\]

Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. Therefore, Helene's age is:

\[
\text{Helene's age} = 2 \times \text{Average age} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ years}
\]

Now, we know the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene. We can use the total age of the children to find Wilfred's age. Let's denote Wilfred's age by \( W \). The total age of the children is the sum of the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred:

\[
\text{Total age} = \text{Akbar's age} + \text{Alessandro's age} + \text{Helene's age} + \text{Wilfred's age}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
20 = 3 + 4 + 10 + W
\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[
20 = 17 + W
\]

Solving for \( W \):

\[
W = 20 - 17 = 3
\]

Therefore, Wilfred's age is:

\[
\boxed{3}

"First, let's calculate the total amount Walter has collected from his neighbors and the online fund:

- From neighbors: $500
- From online fund: $1500

Total collected so far: $500 + $1500 = $2000

Next, we need to determine how much Walter's lawyer will donate. The lawyer will donate three times as much as everyone else donates. To find out how much everyone else donates, we need to add the $200 that Walter's friend is going to give:

Total amount from everyone else: $2000 + $200 = $2200

Now, we calculate the lawyer's donation:

Lawyer's donation: 3 * $2200 = $6600

So, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6600."
"First, we need to calculate the total number of cookies. Since there were 100 guests and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies/guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies} \]

The bride decided to give half of the cookies to the church next door. Therefore, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500 \text{ cookies}}{2} = 750 \text{ cookies} \]

Each person in the church next door got 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church next door, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people} \]

So, the number of people in the church next door is:

\[ 50 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 50 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the distribution of the watermelon slices among the family members. Let's denote the total volume of the watermelon as \( V \).

Given that there are 2 adults and 4 kids, and each adult's slice is twice as big as each kid's slice, we can represent the volume of each adult's slice as \( 2x \) and the volume of each kid's slice as \( x \).

The total volume of the watermelon is the sum of the volumes of all the slices:
\[ 2(2x) + 4(x) = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

Since the total volume of the watermelon is \( V \), we have:
\[ 8x = V \]

Now, we need to find out what percentage of the watermelon each adult gets. Each adult gets \( 2x \) of the watermelon, and since \( 8x = V \), each adult's share is:
\[ \frac{2x}{V} = \frac{2x}{8x} = \frac{1}{4} \]

To convert this fraction to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon."
"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones will spend on checking on the inpatients. He has 9 inpatients and it takes him 20 minutes per inpatient.

\[ 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes per inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's convert the 180 minutes into hours since the clinic hours are given in hours.

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the total time he will spend on his appointments. He has 10 appointments, each taking 30 minutes.

\[ 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes per appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's convert the 300 minutes into hours.

\[ 300 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's add up all the time he will spend on the clinic, the inpatient rounds, and the appointments.

\[ 9 \text{ hours (clinic)} + 3 \text{ hours (inpatient rounds)} + 5 \text{ hours (appointments)} = 17 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we need to find out how much time he will have left to update his records. He is working for 9 hours on Monday.

\[ 9 \text{ hours (total work time)} - 17 \text{ hours (time spent)} = -8 \text{ hours} \]

Since the result is negative, it means Doctor Jones will not have any time left to update his records and will actually be over his scheduled work time by 8 hours. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{-8}

"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to complete all the steps and then subtract this total from the desired serving time of 5:00 pm.

1. Time to make the cake batter: 20 minutes
2. Time to bake the cake: 30 minutes
3. Time to cool the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
4. Time to frost the cake: 10 minutes

Now, let's add up all these times:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Convert 180 minutes into hours and minutes:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Jordan needs 3 hours to complete all the steps. If she wants the cake to be ready by 5:00 pm, we subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm:
\[ 5:00 \text{ pm} - 3 \text{ hours} = 2:00 \text{ pm} \]

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we first need to determine the total number of boxes sold by Lisa and Peter.

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. Together, they sold:
\[ 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 \text{ boxes} \]

They sold a total of 64 chocolate bars. To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes:
\[ \frac{64 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ boxes}} = 8 \text{ chocolate bars per box} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider the fixed cost of renting the studio and the variable cost based on the number of students and the number of sessions per week.

1. **Fixed Cost**: The cost to rent the studio per session is $25.
2. **Variable Cost**: The cost per student per session is $1.50. With 10 students, the variable cost per session is $1.50 * 10 = $15.
3. **Total Cost per Session**: The total cost per session is the sum of the fixed and variable costs, which is $25 + $15 = $40.
4. **Sessions per Week**: The studio is rented 3 days a week.
5. **Sessions per Month**: Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks, the studio is rented for 3 * 4 = 12 sessions in a month.

Now, we can calculate the total earnings for the month:
- Total earnings per session = $40
- Total sessions per month = 12
- Total earnings per month = $40 * 12 = $480

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"To find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we first need to determine how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes.

Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars. Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes is:
\[ \text{Chocolate bars per box (Peter)} = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]

Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars. Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes is:
\[ \text{Chocolate bars per box (Martha)} = \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

Now, to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we subtract the number of chocolate bars per box for Martha from the number of chocolate bars per box for Peter:
\[ \text{Difference} = 16 - 8 = 8 \]

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"First, let's find the number of female porcupines in the park. Given that the number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the number of babies born each month is:

\[ \text{Number of babies per month} = 30 \times 4 = 120 \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[ \text{Total number of babies in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440 \]

The total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be the original population plus the total number of babies born in a year:

\[ \text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1490 \]"
"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet.
2. Multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons needed.
3. Calculate the cost by multiplying the number of gallons by $0.10 per gallon.

First, let's calculate the volume of the pool. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

So, the volume \( V \) is:

\[ V = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

Let's calculate this volume.
```python
# Dimensions of the pool
length = 25  # in feet
width = 14   # in feet
depth = 4    # in feet

# Calculate the volume in cubic feet
volume_cubic_feet = length * width * depth
volume_cubic_feet
```
```output
1400
```
The volume of the pool is 1400 cubic feet.

Next, we need to convert this volume into gallons. We know that 1 cubic foot is approximately equal to 7.48 gallons. So, we multiply the volume in cubic feet by 7.48 to get the volume in gallons.

\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = \text{Volume in cubic feet} \times 7.48 \]

Let's calculate the volume in gallons.
```python
# Conversion factor from cubic feet to gallons
gallons_per_cubic_foot = 7.48

# Calculate the volume in gallons
volume_gallons = volume_cubic_feet * gallons_per_cubic_foot
volume_gallons
```
```output
NameError: name 'volume_cubic_feet' is not defined
```
It seems there was an issue with the variable reference. Let me re-calculate the volume in gallons directly using the previously calculated volume in cubic feet.

\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = 1400 \times 7.48 \]

Let's perform this calculation.
```python
# Recalculate the volume in gallons using the previously calculated volume in cubic feet
volume_gallons = 1400 * 7.48
volume_gallons
```
```output
python
10472.0
```
The volume of the pool in gallons is 10472 gallons.

Finally, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon. So, we multiply the number of gallons by $0.10.

\[ \text{Cost} = \text{Volume in gallons} \times 0.10 \]

Let's calculate the cost.
```python
# Cost per gallon
cost_per_gallon = 0.10

# Calculate the cost
cost = volume_gallons * cost_per_gallon
cost
```
```output
NameError: name 'volume_gallons' is not defined
```
It seems there was an issue with the variable reference again. Let me re-calculate the cost directly using the previously calculated volume in gallons.

\[ \text{Cost} = 10472 \times 0.10 \]

Let's perform this calculation.
```python
# Recalculate the cost using the previously calculated volume in gallons
cost = 10472 * 0.10

"First, let's determine the number of blue sticks. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, and there are 9 red sticks, we can calculate the number of blue sticks as follows:

Number of blue sticks = Number of red sticks + 5
Number of blue sticks = 9 + 5
Number of blue sticks = 14

Next, we need to find the number of yellow sticks. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks:

Number of yellow sticks = Number of blue sticks - 3
Number of yellow sticks = 14 - 3
Number of yellow sticks = 11

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks:

Total number of sticks = Number of red sticks + Number of blue sticks + Number of yellow sticks
Total number of sticks = 9 + 14 + 11
Total number of sticks = 34

So, the total number of sticks they have is 34."
"First, we calculate the distance Matteo traveled. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Matteo:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 55 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance Shandy traveled:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} = 45 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the distance Matteo traveled from the distance Shandy traveled:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo. The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. **Total number of students**: 3000

2. **Students over 16 years old**: Half of the total students.
   \[
   \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
   \]

3. **Students under 16 years old**: The other half of the total students.
   \[
   \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
   \]

4. **Male students over 16 years old**: One-fourth of the students over 16 years old.
   \[
   \frac{1500}{4} = 375
   \]

5. **Female students over 16 years old**: The remaining students over 16 years old.
   \[
   1500 - 375 = 1125
   \]

6. **Male students under 16 years old**: One-half of the students under 16 years old.
   \[
   \frac{1500}{2} = 750
   \]

7. **Female students under 16 years old**: The remaining students under 16 years old.
   \[
   1500 - 750 = 750
   \]

8. **Total female students**: Sum of female students over 16 and under 16.
   \[
   1125 + 750 = 1875

Therefore, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is 1875."
"First, let's determine how many laps each person can run:

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run \(14 / 2 = 7\) laps.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps.

Now, to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run:

\[10 - 5 = 5\]

So, Bethany can run 5 more laps than Quinn. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days and then subtract that from the tank's total capacity.

First, let's determine the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day:

- Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity on the first day.
- The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, so Wanda pumped \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons on the first day.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda, so she pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons on the first day.

Next, let's determine the amount of water pumped on the second day:

- Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day, so she pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons on the second day.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day, so she pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons on the second day.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank over the two days:

- Total water pumped by Wanda: \( 4500 + 3000 = 7500 \) gallons.
- Total water pumped by Ms. B: \( 3375 + 1125 = 4500 \) gallons.
- Total water pumped into the tank: \( 7500 + 4500 = 12000 \) gallons.

Finally, we subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity to find out how many gallons are remaining:

- Remaining gallons: \( 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \) gallons.

The final numerical answer is 6000 gallons."
"Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as \( C \).

First, we know that the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour for 5 hours. This means that after 5 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ C \times (1 - 0.09)^5 = C \times 0.91^5 \]

Calculating \( 0.91^5 \):
\[ 0.91^5 \approx 0.652 \]

So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is approximately:
\[ C \times 0.652 \]

Next, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour for 3 hours. This means that after another 3 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ C \times 0.652 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = C \times 0.652 \times 0.93^3 \]

Calculating \( 0.93^3 \):
\[ 0.93^3 \approx 0.812 \]

So, after 8 hours, the charge remaining is approximately:
\[ C \times 0.652 \times 0.812 \approx C \times 0.530 \]

We know that after 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%, so:
\[ C \times 0.530 = 0.28 \]

To find the initial charge \( C \):
\[ C = \frac{0.28}{0.530} \approx 0.528 \]

Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 52.8%."
"First, let's calculate Janet's total weekly earnings. She earns $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, so her total weekly earnings are:

\[ 10 + 15 = 25 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are:

\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ dollars per week} \]

Next, we need to determine how much she needs to save to buy the car. The downpayment for the car is $10000. She wants to save 20% of this amount:

\[ 10000 \times 0.20 = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take for her to save $2000 at a rate of $1000 per week. We do this by dividing the total amount she needs to save by her weekly savings:

\[ \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

So, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment for the car. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased:

- Peaches: 3 peaches * $0.50/peach = $1.50
- Pears: 4 pears * $0.50/pear = $2.00
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00/kiwi = $2.00
- Apples: 5 apples * $0.75/apple = $3.75

Now, let's add up the cost of these fruits:

Total cost of purchased fruits = $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar has $10 to spend, so the remaining amount he can spend on plums is:

Remaining amount = $10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums he can buy is:

Number of plums = $0.75 / $0.25/plum = 3 plums

So, the final numerical answer is 3."
"First, let's calculate the total number of pieces of sweets Anne purchased:

\[ \text{Total pieces} = \text{Number of packs} \times \text{Pieces per pack} \]
\[ \text{Total pieces} = 15 \times 60 \]
\[ \text{Total pieces} = 900 \]

Anne kept 2 packs, so the number of packs given to her friends is:

\[ \text{Packs given to friends} = \text{Total packs} - \text{Packs kept} \]
\[ \text{Packs given to friends} = 15 - 2 \]
\[ \text{Packs given to friends} = 13 \]

Now, we need to find out how many pieces of sweets each of her 10 friends received:

\[ \text{Pieces per friend} = \frac{\text{Packs given to friends} \times \text{Pieces per pack}}{\text{Number of friends}} \]
\[ \text{Pieces per friend} = \frac{13 \times 60}{10} \]
\[ \text{Pieces per friend} = \frac{780}{10} \]

"To find the price of carrots after three years, given that the price increases by 5% each year, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating the price increase over time. The formula is:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the price after \( n \) years.
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price.
- \( r \) is the annual increase rate (expressed as a decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) dollars
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% increase)
- \( n = 3 \) years

Now, let's calculate \( P \):

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]

First, calculate \( (1.05)^3 \):

\[ (1.05)^3 = 1.157625 \]

Now, multiply this by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ P = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ P \approx 139 \]

So, the price of carrots after three years would be approximately $139."
"To solve this, we first need to determine how many pictures were put into each album. Since Olivia uploaded 72 pictures and divided them equally into 8 albums, we can calculate the number of pictures per album by dividing 72 by 8.

\[ \text{Pictures per album} = \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these pictures were selfies and how many were portraits. We know that 3 of the albums were selfies only and 2 of the albums were portraits. Since each album contains 9 pictures, we can calculate the number of selfies and portraits as follows:

\[ \text{Number of selfies} = 3 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures/album} = 27 \]
\[ \text{Number of portraits} = 2 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures/album} = 18 \]

To find the total number of selfies and portraits, we add the number of selfies and portraits together:

\[ \text{Total number of selfies and portraits} = 27 + 18 = 45 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 45 \]"
"To determine how long James spends reading, we first need to find out how many minutes it takes him to read one page. Since it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can calculate the time it takes to read one page by dividing 10 minutes by 3 pages:

\[ \text{Time per page} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages. We do this by multiplying the time it takes to read one page by 18:

\[ \text{Time to read 18 pages} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes} \]

Let's perform the multiplication:

\[ 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, James spends 60 minutes reading. The final numerical answer is:

"To find the final number of guests in the hotel, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.
2. 24 guests checked out early, so the number of guests decreased by 24:
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76
   \]
3. 15 guests checked out late, so the number of guests decreased by 15:
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61
   \]
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, twice that number is:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30
   \]
   So, 30 new guests checked in:
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91
   \]
5. After dinner was served, 7 more people checked in:
   \[
   91 + 7 = 98

"First, let's determine the number of easy, average, and difficult questions in the quiz.

- Total number of questions: 60
- Easy questions: 40% of 60 = 0.40 * 60 = 24 questions
- Average and difficult questions combined: 60 - 24 = 36 questions
- Since the average and difficult questions are equally divided, there are 36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct. So, the number of easy questions she is sure to get correct is:
\[ 75\% \text{ of } 24 = 0.75 \times 24 = 18 \]

Aries is sure to get half of the average and difficult questions correct. So, the number of average and difficult questions she is sure to get correct is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \text{ of } 18 = 9 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:
\[ 18 \text{ (easy)} + 9 \text{ (average)} + 9 \text{ (difficult)} = 36 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the price of a large stuffed animal. Since each small stuffed animal costs $4 and large stuffed animals cost three times as much, the price of a large stuffed animal is:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( L \). According to the problem, the number of small stuffed animals sold is twice the number of large stuffed animals sold, so the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2L \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as the sum of the earnings from the large stuffed animals and the small stuffed animals. The earnings from the large stuffed animals are \( 12L \) dollars, and the earnings from the small stuffed animals are \( 4 \times 2L = 8L \) dollars. The total earnings are given as $120, so we can set up the following equation:
\[ 12L + 8L = 120 \]
\[ 20L = 120 \]
\[ L = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ L = 6 \]

Since the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2L \), we have:
\[ 2L = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the ore mining rate with a steel pickaxe:**
   - A dwarf with an iron pickaxe mines 12 pounds per day.
   - A dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 50% more than a dwarf with an iron pickaxe.
   - 50% of 12 pounds is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6\) pounds.
   - Therefore, a dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines \(12 + 6 = 18\) pounds per day.

2. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in one day:**
   - Each dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 18 pounds per day.
   - 40 dwarves would mine \(18 \times 40 = 720\) pounds per day.

3. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month:**
   - There are 30 days in the month.

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to use the information that the prices are proportional. Let's denote the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches as \( x \).

First, we calculate the cost per sandwich for each package:
- For the first package with 2 sandwiches for $3, the cost per sandwich is:
  \[
  \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
  \]
- For the second package with 4 sandwiches for $6, the cost per sandwich is:
  \[
  \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
  \]

Since the prices are proportional, the cost per sandwich for the third package (8 sandwiches) should also be $1.5. Therefore, we can find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches by multiplying the cost per sandwich by 8:
\[
1.5 \times 8 = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost \(\boxed{12}\) dollars."

"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst due to the gust of wind. Sally initially had 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst.

\[ \text{Red balloons that burst} = 25 \times \frac{40}{100} = 25 \times 0.4 = 10 \]

So, the number of red balloons remaining is:

\[ \text{Remaining red balloons} = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Next, Sally accidentally released half of the yellow balloons. She initially had 12 yellow balloons.

\[ \text{Yellow balloons released} = 12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons remaining is:

\[ \text{Remaining yellow balloons} = 12 - 6 = 6 \]

Sally found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining balloons.

\[ \text{Blue balloons added} = 8 \times \frac{75}{100} = 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \]

So, the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school is the sum of the remaining red, yellow, and the added blue balloons.

\[ \text{Total balloons} = \text{Remaining red balloons} + \text{Remaining yellow balloons} + \text{Blue balloons added} \]
\[ \text{Total balloons} = 15 + 6 + 6 = 27 \]

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of the substitute teacher collecting the homework: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of having to turn in the homework: 50% or 0.50

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having the normal teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of getting an extension from the normal teacher: 40% or 0.40
   - Probability of not getting an extension from the normal teacher: 60% or 0.60
   - Probability of convincing the teacher to give a personal extension: 20% or 0.20
   - Probability of not convincing the teacher: 80% or 0.80

Now, let's calculate the overall probability of having to turn in the homework:

- **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
  - Probability of having to turn in the homework = 50% or 0.50

- **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
  - Probability of not getting an extension and not convincing the teacher: 60% * 80% = 0.60 * 0.80 = 0.48
  - Probability of having to turn in the homework: 100% - 48% = 52% or 0.52

Now, we combine the probabilities of both scenarios:

- Probability of having to turn in the homework = Probability of substitute teacher * Probability of having to turn in the homework (substitute teacher) + Probability of normal teacher * Probability of having to turn in the homework (normal teacher)
- Probability of having to turn in the homework = 0.50 * 0.50 + 0.50 * 0.52
- Probability of having to turn in the homework = 0.25 + 0.26
- Probability of having to turn in the homework = 0.51

"First, we need to determine the total number of seats that are not occupied by graduates and faculty. The total capacity of the Fine Arts Center is 6000 seats. After accounting for 950 seats for graduates and 300 seats for faculty, the number of seats available for distribution to graduates' friends and family is:

\[ 6000 - 950 - 300 = 5750 \]

Next, we need to find out how many tickets each graduate will receive if the 5750 seats are split equally among the 950 graduates. We do this by dividing the number of available seats by the number of graduates:

\[ \frac{5750}{950} = 6.052631578947368 \]

Since the number of tickets must be a whole number, we round 6.052631578947368 to the nearest whole number, which is 6. Therefore, each graduate would receive 6 tickets to give to their friends and family.

"First, let's calculate the total amount Jim borrowed during his college years. He borrowed $50,000 per year for 4 years, so the total amount borrowed is:

\[ 50,000 \times 4 = 200,000 \]

Next, let's determine his income after college. His original income was $25,000 per year, and his income tripled after college, so his new income is:

\[ 25,000 \times 3 = 75,000 \]

Now, let's calculate the total income he would have earned if he had not gone to college. He would have earned $25,000 per year for 4 years, so the total income he would have earned is:

\[ 25,000 \times 4 = 100,000 \]

The money lost from not working while in school is the difference between the total income he would have earned and the total income he actually earned:

\[ 100,000 - 75,000 = 25,000 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost of his loans and the money lost from not working while in school. The total cost of his loans is $200,000, and the money lost from not working is $25,000, so the total cost is:

\[ 200,000 + 25,000 = 225,000 \]

Finally, we need to determine how long it would take for Jim to earn $225,000 at his new income of $75,000 per year. We do this by dividing the total cost by his new income:

\[ \frac{225,000}{75,000} = 3 \]

So, it would take Jim 3 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total square feet of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of each piece of fabric he requires.

The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each piece of fabric is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the dimensions of each piece of fabric are:
- Length: \(6 + 2 = 8\) feet
- Width: \(8 + 2 = 10\) feet

Next, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
\[
\text{Area of one piece} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 8 \, \text{feet} \times 10 \, \text{feet} = 80 \, \text{square feet}
\]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[
\text{Total area} = 2 \times 80 \, \text{square feet} = 160 \, \text{square feet}
\]

Thus, the total square feet of fabric Jim needs to buy is:
\[

"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then sum them up.

First, let's determine the number of letters delivered on Tuesday. According to the problem, Tuesday's delivery is 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery. Monday's delivery was 425 letters.

\[
\text{Tuesday's delivery} = \frac{1}{5} \times 425 + 17
\]

Calculating \(\frac{1}{5} \times 425\):

\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 425 = 85
\]

Adding 17 to 85:

\[
85 + 17 = 102
\]

So, Tuesday's delivery was 102 letters.

Next, we calculate the number of letters delivered on Wednesday. According to the problem, Wednesday's delivery is 5 more than twice Tuesday's delivery.

\[
\text{Wednesday's delivery} = 2 \times 102 + 5
\]

Calculating \(2 \times 102\):

\[
2 \times 102 = 204
\]

Adding 5 to 204:

\[
204 + 5 = 209
\]

So, Wednesday's delivery was 209 letters.

Now, we sum the deliveries from Monday to Wednesday:

\[
\text{Total delivery} = \text{Monday's delivery} + \text{Tuesday's delivery} + \text{Wednesday's delivery}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total delivery} = 425 + 102 + 209

"To find out how much Johnny's dad lost on average that day, we need to calculate the total amount lost and then divide it by the number of races.

1. **First Race:**
   - Johnny's dad lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost.
   - Amount lost in the first race = $5.
   - Twice the amount lost in the first race = $5 * 2 = $10.
   - Amount won in the second race = $10 + $1 = $11.
   - Since he won, this is a positive amount, but for the purpose of calculating loss, we consider the negative of this amount.
   - Amount lost in the second race = -$11.

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Amount won in the second race = $11.
   - 1.5 times the amount won in the second race = $11 * 1.5 = $16.5.
   - Amount lost in the third race = $16.5.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost:
- Total amount lost = Amount lost in the first race + Amount lost in the second race + Amount lost in the third race.
- Total amount lost = $5 + (-$11) + $16.5 = $5 - $11 + $16.5 = $10.5.

To find the average amount lost per race, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races:
- Number of races = 3.
- Average amount lost per race = Total amount lost / Number of races = $10.5 / 3 = $3.5.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( 420 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 420 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps:

1. **Determine the total number of days the painters worked:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - The painters worked for 3 weeks.
   - Therefore, the total number of days they worked is \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \) days.

2. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by the team:**
   - Each day, the team worked \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day.
   - Therefore, the total number of hours worked by the team in 21 days is \( 21 \times \frac{3}{8} \).

3. **Perform the multiplication:**
   \[
   21 \times \frac{3}{8} = \frac{21 \times 3}{8} = \frac{63}{8} = 7.875 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of hours each painter worked:**
   - There are 4 painters.
   - Therefore, each painter worked \( \frac{7.875}{4} \) hours.

5. **Perform the division:**
   \[
   \frac{7.875}{4} = 1.96875 \text{ hours}
   \]

So, each painter put in approximately 1.96875 hours of work. The final numerical answer is:

1.96875"
"Let's denote the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, Rory retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2}) = 2 \cdot 19 \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now that we know \( x = 6 \), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

So, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation year by year from 2007 to 2010.

The formula for depreciation is:
\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^{\text{Number of Years}} \]

Given:
- Initial Price = $20000
- Depreciation Rate = 21% = 0.21
- Number of Years from 2007 to 2010 = 3

Now, we can plug these values into the formula:
\[ \text{Final Price} = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]

Calculating \( (0.79)^3 \):
\[ (0.79)^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.493039 \]

Now, multiply this by the initial price:
\[ \text{Final Price} = 20000 \times 0.493039 = 9860.78 \]

Therefore, the price of the car in the year 2010 is approximately $9860.78."
"First, let's determine the number of English books. Since half of the 50 books are written in English:

\[ \text{Number of English books} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

Next, we calculate the number of German books. 10% of the 50 books are written in German:

\[ \text{Number of German books} = 50 \times \frac{10}{100} = 5 \]

Now, to find the number of Spanish books, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:

\[ \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - \text{Number of English books} - \text{Number of German books} \]
\[ \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - 25 - 5 = 20 \]

So, the number of Spanish books is 20."
"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we first need to determine how far she has already driven. According to the information provided, Bernice drove 325 kilometers over 4 days.

The total distance from San Diego to New York City is approximately 1955 kilometers. To find out how much distance Bernice still needs to cover, we subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance.

\[ \text{Distance still needed} = \text{Total distance} - \text{Distance already driven} \]

\[ \text{Distance still needed} = 1955 \text{ km} - 325 \text{ km} \]

\[ \text{Distance still needed} = 1630 \text{ km} \]

So, Bernice will still need to drive 1630 kilometers."
"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we can follow these steps:

"Let's calculate the number of people on the train step by step.

1. **Initial number of people on the train:**
   Romeo boards the train with 120 people.

2. **First stop:**
   20 more people board the train.
   \[
   120 + 20 = 140
   \]
   So, there are 140 people on the train after the first stop.

3. **Second stop:**
   50 people disembark the train.
   \[
   140 - 50 = 90
   \]
   Then, twice the number of people who disembarked (which is 50) board the train.
   \[
   2 \times 50 = 100
   \]
   Adding these new passengers to the train:
   \[
   90 + 100 = 190
   \]
   So, there are 190 people on the train after the second stop.

4. **Third stop:**
   80 more people disembark the train.
   \[
   190 - 80 = 110
   \]
   So, there are 110 people on the train at the final stop.

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is:
\[
\boxed{110}

"To determine the cost of renovating the kitchen floor, we first need to calculate how many tiles are required to cover the 200 square feet.

Each tile is a square with a side length of 1 foot, so the area of each tile is:
\[ 1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt} \]

Since the total area of the kitchen floor is 200 square feet, the number of tiles needed is:
\[ 200 \text{ SqFt} \div 1 \text{ SqFt/tile} = 200 \text{ tiles} \]

Each tile costs $12, so the total cost for 200 tiles is:
\[ 200 \text{ tiles} \times \$12/\text{tile} = \$2400 \]

Therefore, the cost to renovate the kitchen floor is:
\[ \$2400 \]"
"To find out how much James pays for insurance a year after his accident, we first need to calculate the increased monthly cost and then multiply it by 12 to get the annual cost.

The normal cost of insurance is $120 a month. Since the cost increased by 60% due to the accident, we calculate the increase as follows:

\[ \text{Increase} = 120 \times \frac{60}{100} = 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the increased monthly cost is:

\[ \text{Increased Monthly Cost} = 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Now, to find the annual cost, we multiply the increased monthly cost by 12:

\[ \text{Annual Cost} = 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2304 \]"
"To determine how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the number of loads required for the twin beds and the king size bed separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of loads for the twin beds:
- Greg has 4 twin beds.
- Each load can wash 2 twin sets of sheets.
- Therefore, the number of loads for the twin beds is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) loads per week.

Next, let's calculate the number of loads for the king size bed:
- Greg has 1 king size bed.
- Each load can wash 1 king set of sheets.
- Therefore, the number of loads for the king size bed is \( \frac{1}{1} = 1 \) load per week.

Now, let's find the total number of loads per week:
- Total loads per week = Loads for twin beds + Loads for king size bed
- Total loads per week = 2 + 1 = 3 loads per week.

Finally, let's calculate the total number of loads per year:
- There are 52 weeks in a year.
- Total loads per year = Total loads per week * Weeks per year
- Total loads per year = 3 * 52 = 156 loads.

"To find out how many movies Jill and her friends can watch in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the number of movies they watch each weekend and then multiply by 4.

First, let's determine the number of movies they watch on Sunday. They watch half the number of movies on Sunday as they do on Saturday. Since they watch 4 movies on Saturday, they watch:

\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ movies on Sunday} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of movies they watch in one weekend. They watch 4 movies on Saturday and 2 movies on Sunday, so in one weekend they watch:

\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ movies} \]

Now, we need to find out how many movies they watch in 4 weeks. Since they watch 6 movies each weekend, in 4 weeks they will watch:

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ movies} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we first need to calculate the total amount of cat food Imma's cats consume per day.

Imma has 3 cats, and each cat is fed 60 grams of cat food twice a day. Therefore, the total amount of cat food consumed per day is:

\[ 3 \text{ cats} \times 60 \text{ grams/cat} \times 2 \text{ feedings/day} = 360 \text{ grams/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:

\[ \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams/day}} = 2 \text{ days} \]

So, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days."
"First, let's determine how many slices Jake ate. Since Becky ate 10 slices and she ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can calculate the number of slices Jake ate as follows:

\[ \text{Jake's slices} = \text{Becky's slices} - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \]

Next, we know that Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake. Therefore, we can calculate the number of slices Silvia ate as follows:

\[ \text{Silvia's slices} = 2 \times \text{Jake's slices} = 2 \times 7 = 14 \]

Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by adding the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:

\[ \text{Total slices} = \text{Becky's slices} + \text{Jake's slices} + \text{Silvia's slices} = 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 \]

So, the total number of slices they ate is:

"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time for the meal is the sum of the times for both parts, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Next, we isolate \( D \) by subtracting 18 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Then, we solve for \( D \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's part as follows:

\[ Betsy's\ part = D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes. The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to consider the following:

1. The cost of the cast: $200
2. The cost of the visit: $300/hour for a 30-minute visit. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the cost is $300 * 0.5 = $150
3. The cost of the painkillers: $4/pill for 30 pills. So, the cost is $4 * 30 = $120
4. The cost of parking: $6/hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours. So, the cost is $6 * 2 = $12

Now, we sum these costs to find the total cost of the doctor's visit:

Total cost = Cost of cast + Cost of visit + Cost of painkillers + Cost of parking
Total cost = $200 + $150 + $120 + $12
Total cost = $482

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."

"First, let's calculate how many pizzas the glee club ate and how many they have left.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. So, the number of pizzas they ate is:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \]
Therefore, the number of pizzas left for the glee club is:
\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \]

Next, let's calculate how many pizzas the football team ordered and how many they ate.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]
The football team ate 80% of their pizzas, so the number of pizzas they ate is:

"First, let's determine the number of big coupons Anthony wants to send out. Since he wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, and he wants to send out 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is:

\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, and he is sending out 700 small coupons:

\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, and he is sending out 1400 big coupons:

\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of mailing all the coupons, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the cost of mailing the big coupons:

\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:

"To determine the cost Dennis will incur to purchase 6 pounds of butter, we need to consider the promotion and the cost per pound of butter.

First, let's calculate the total amount of butter Dennis needs:
- Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants.
- He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
- Therefore, he needs \( 6 \times 1 = 6 \) pounds of butter.

Next, we need to consider the promotion: ""buy one pound of butter get one half off."" This means for every two pounds of butter, Dennis only pays for one pound.

Let's break down the cost for 6 pounds of butter under this promotion:
- For the first pound, Dennis pays the full price of $4.00.
- For the second pound, he gets the second pound at half price, which is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.
- For the third pound, he pays the full price of $4.00.
- For the fourth pound, he gets the fourth pound at half price, which is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.
- For the fifth pound, he pays the full price of $4.00.
- For the sixth pound, he gets the sixth pound at half price, which is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.

"First, let's determine the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats:
\[ 10 + 4 = 14 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of bananas eaten by both monkeys in a day:
\[ 10 + 14 = 24 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. Therefore, the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day is:
\[ \frac{315}{7} = 45 \text{ bananas each day} \]

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we subtract the number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day:

Therefore, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is 250 + 500 = 750 pieces."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the roses Jenny bought. She bought 15 roses, and since roses cost $2 each, the total cost for the roses is:

\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2/\text{rose} = \$30 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jenny has initially. She arrived with five 5 dollar bills, so she has:

\[ 5 \times \$5 = \$25 \]

Since the total cost of the roses is $30 and Jenny only has $25, she needs an additional $5 to pay for the roses. However, the question asks how many quarters she leaves with, which implies we need to find out how many quarters she receives in change.

The change she receives is:

\[ \$30 - \$25 = \$5 \]

Since quarters are worth $0.25 each, the number of quarters she receives is:

\[ \frac{\$5}{\$0.25/\text{quarter}} = 20 \text{ quarters} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"

   - The first train leaves the station 10 minutes after it arrives, so it leaves at 10 + 10 = 20 minutes.
   - The second train arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves, so it arrives at 20 + 30 = 50 minutes.
   - Stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed in the station, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives an hour after the second train leaves the station.
   - The second train leaves the station 50 minutes after it arrives, so it leaves at 50 minutes.
   - The third train arrives 60 minutes after the second train leaves, so it arrives at 50 + 60 = 110 minutes.
   - Leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it stays in the station for 0 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station.
   - The third train leaves the station at 110 minutes, so it arrives at 110 + 20 = 130 minutes.

Paul needs to board the fourth train, which arrives at 130 minutes. Since Paul arrives at 10 minutes (when the first train arrives), he will wait for the fourth train, which arrives at 130 minutes.

To find out how long Paul will wait, we calculate the difference between the time the fourth train arrives and the time Paul arrives:
\[ 130 - 10 = 120 \]

Therefore, Paul will wait for his train for 120 minutes.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 120 \]"
"To determine how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we first need to calculate how many toothpicks she has already saved.

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks:
\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie needs a total of 200 toothpicks. She has already saved 120 toothpicks, so the number of toothpicks she still needs is:
\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks, we divide the number of toothpicks she still needs by the number of toothpicks she saves each week:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks."
"First, let's determine the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch. The original price of the watch is $2000, and he bought it at 75% of its original price.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers paid} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage discount Mr. Rogers's friend obtained from the original price. The original price was $2000, and the friend paid $1800 for the watch.

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

To find the percentage discount, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage Discount} = \left( \frac{\text{Discount Amount}}{\text{Original Price}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage Discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers's friend from the original price is 10%."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs over a period of 4 hours.

1. First, we need to find out how many seconds are in 4 hours:
   \[
   4 \text{ hours} = 4 \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 4 \times 60 \times 60 \text{ seconds} = 14400 \text{ seconds}
   \]

2. Since one spring creates one jellyfish every second, in 14400 seconds, one spring would create:
   \[
   14400 \text{ jellyfish}
   \]

3. If we have 5 springs working simultaneously, the total number of jellyfish created would be:
   \[
   5 \times 14400 = 72000 \text{ jellyfish}
   \]

Therefore, 5 springs working at the same rate would create 72000 jellyfish in 4 hours."

\[ 180 + 15 = 195 \]

So, Frankie's score is 195."
"First, let's determine the total distance James walked. He walked halfway to the store, which is 2 miles, and then walked back home, which is another 2 miles. So, the total distance he walked is 2 miles + 2 miles = 4 miles.

James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour. To find out how long it took him to walk 4 miles, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 1 hour."
"First, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually.

Jenny buys 10 bunches, and each bunch has 4 bananas. Therefore, the total number of bananas she buys is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

The cost of buying 40 bananas individually at $0.80 each is:
\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches.

Jenny buys 10 bunches at $3.00 per bunch, so the total cost is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

Now, we find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually:
\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Jenny saved is:
\[ \$2.00 \]"
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) and the amount of fence Harry gets as \( H \). According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so we can write:

\[ H = S + 60 \]

Since the total amount of fence is 100 feet, we can also write:

\[ S + H = 100 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Subtract 60 from both sides:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we can first determine its growth rate per year. The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, so the growth rate per year is:

\[ \text{Growth rate per year} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \]

Now, to find out how many inches it will grow in 13 years, we multiply the growth rate per year by 13:

\[ \text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month, we need to calculate the total earnings from each type of bike and then sum them up.

First, let's determine the number of each type of bike sold:
- Total bikes sold = 300
- Number of Trekking bikes sold = 50% of 300 = 0.5 * 300 = 150
- Number of BMX bikes sold = 15% of 300 = 0.15 * 300 = 45
- Number of MTB bikes sold = Total bikes sold - (Trekking bikes + BMX bikes) = 300 - (150 + 45) = 300 - 195 = 105

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike:
- Price of one MTB = $500
- Price of one BMX = Half the price of an MTB = $500 / 2 = $250
- Price of one Trekking bike = $450

Now, we calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:
- Earnings from MTB bikes = Number of MTB bikes sold * Price of one MTB = 105 * $500 = $52,500
- Earnings from BMX bikes = Number of BMX bikes sold * Price of one BMX = 45 * $250 = $11,250
- Earnings from Trekking bikes = Number of Trekking bikes sold * Price of one Trekking bike = 150 * $450 = $67,500

Finally, we sum up the earnings from all types of bikes to find the total earnings:
- Total earnings = Earnings from MTB bikes + Earnings from BMX bikes + Earnings from Trekking bikes = $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250

The final numerical answer is $131,250."

"To find out how many hours a week John spends learning, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Number of periods John has to take each day:**
   - A normal student has 6 periods.
   - John has 2 extra classes, so he has \(6 + 2 = 8\) periods each day.

2. **Duration of each class:**
   - Each class is 40 minutes long.

3. **Total time spent in class each day:**
   - Since John has 8 periods each day and each period is 40 minutes long, the total time spent in class each day is \(8 \times 40 = 320\) minutes.

4. **Total time spent in class each week:**
   - John goes to class for 5 days a week, so the total time spent in class each week is \(320 \times 5 = 1600\) minutes.

5. **Extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday:**
   - John spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time.
   - The total weekly minutes are 1600, so the extra learning time is \(\frac{1600}{16} = 100\) minutes.

6. **Total time spent learning each week:**
   - The total time spent learning each week is the sum of the time spent in class and the extra learning time, which is \(1600 + 100 = 1700\) minutes.

7. **Convert minutes to hours:**
   - Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total time spent learning in hours is \(\frac{1700}{60} = \frac{1700}{60} = 28.3333...\) hours.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 28.3333 \text{ hours} \]"
"First, let's determine the initial height from which Nathan drops the ball. Since the ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony and each story is 24 feet high, the height from the third-floor balcony is:

\[ 3 \text{ stories} \times 24 \text{ feet/story} = 72 \text{ feet} \]

The ball bounces to 2/3 of its starting height with each bounce. Therefore, on the first bounce, the ball will reach:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 72 \text{ feet} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

On the second bounce, the ball will again bounce to 2/3 of its height from the first bounce:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 48 \text{ feet} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height the ball reaches on its second bounce is:

\[ 32 \text{ feet} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's convert all heights to inches for easier calculation. The first child is 6 feet tall, which is 6 * 12 = 72 inches. The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall. The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

The final numerical answer is:
72 inches"
"To determine the earnings from selling 2000 apples at a rate of $5 per bag, we first need to find out how many bags were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can calculate the number of bags sold as follows:

\[ \text{Number of bags sold} = \frac{\text{Total number of apples sold}}{\text{Number of apples per bag}} = \frac{2000}{10} = 200 \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags sold by the price per bag:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of bags sold} \times \text{Price per bag} = 200 \times 5 = 1000 \]

So, the orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the meat, so it left \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
3. The Allosaurus then ate the remaining meat, which is \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms. According to the problem, this amount is 270 kilograms.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]

To find \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

Therefore, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 kilograms.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total area of the walls that Tony needs to paint.

The north and south walls are each 10 feet by 8 feet, so the area of each is:
\[ 10 \times 8 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is:
\[ 80 \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The east and west walls are each 5 feet by 8 feet, so the area of each is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is:
\[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Adding the areas of all four walls together gives the total area to be painted:
\[ 160 + 80 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost of the paint. Since each gallon costs $12, the total cost is:
\[ 12 \times 12 = 144 \]

Therefore, the cost to paint the room is:
\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the probabilities step by step.

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Ellen starts with 12 sodas.
   - She shakes 3 sodas, leaving 9 unshaken sodas.
   - Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 8 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.

2. **Ellen's Brother's Actions:**
   - Ellen's brother takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas.
   - After this, there are 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas left.

3. **Ellen's Friend's Turn:**
   - Ellen's friend now has to choose from the remaining 8 sodas (2 shaken and 6 unshaken).
   - The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left.

The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is:
\[ \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \]

To express this probability as a percentage:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100\% = 25\% \]

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours and then sum these distances since the trains are traveling in opposite directions.

The first train travels at 60 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will travel:
\[ 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \]

The second train travels at half the speed of the first train, which is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]
In 3 hours, it will travel:
\[ 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles} \]

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each train has traveled:
\[ 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the items after the returns and purchases:

1. Sheila initially charged $85.00 worth of merchandise.
2. She returned an item that cost $15.00, so the charge is reduced by $15.00.
3. The new balance after the return is $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the items she bought:

1. The frying pan was on sale for 20% off $20.00. The discount is 20% of $20.00, which is $20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00. So, the frying pan cost $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.
2. The set of towels was 10% off $30.00. The discount is 10% of $30.00, which is $30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00. So, the set of towels cost $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

Now, let's add the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels to the new balance:

1. The new balance after the return is $70.00.
2. Adding the frying pan ($16.00) and the set of towels ($27.00) to the new balance gives $70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00.

Therefore, the new balance on her credit card is $113.00."
"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( T \).

According to the problem:
- A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{T}{5} \).
- A third of the large jellyfish change color under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{T}{5} = \frac{T}{15} \).
- When the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color. Therefore, \( \frac{T}{15} = 6 \).

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{T}{15} = 6 \]
\[ T = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ T = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate Lauren's annual savings:**
   Lauren saves 20% of her annual salary.
   \[
   \text{Annual savings} = 0.20 \times \$100,000 = \$20,000
   \]

2. **Determine the amount Lauren needs for retirement:**
   Lauren plans to live with 40% of her current annual salary.
   \[
   \text{Annual living expenses} = 0.40 \times \$100,000 = \$40,000
   \]
   Since she saves \$20,000 annually, the amount she needs to save for retirement is:
   \[
   \text{Total retirement savings needed} = \frac{\$40,000}{\$20,000} \times 20 \text{ years} = 2 \times 20 \text{ years} = 40 \text{ years}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of years Lauren needs to work:**
   Lauren plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years. Since she needs to save for 40 years to cover her living expenses, she needs to work for:
   \[
   \text{Years Lauren needs to work} = 40 \text{ years} - 20 \text{ years} = 20 \text{ years}

"To find the total number of students in the school, we start by noting that 40% of the school population consists of boys, and this percentage is equal to 240 boys. Let's denote the total number of students in the school by \( T \).

Given that 40% of \( T \) is 240 boys, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.40 \times T = 240 \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 600 \]

So, the total number of students in the school is 600. To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = T - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 600 - 240 \]

"To find out how much money my mom spent at the gardening shop, we need to add the cost of the pots and the sack of garden soil, and then subtract the value of the coupon.

The cost of the pots is $19.
The cost of the sack of garden soil is $26.
The value of the coupon is $7.

First, we add the cost of the pots and the sack of garden soil:
\[ 19 + 26 = 45 \]

Next, we subtract the value of the coupon from the total:
\[ 45 - 7 = 38 \]

So, the final amount of money my mom spent at the gardening shop is $38."
"To find the average height of the heels, we need to calculate the total height of all the heels and then divide by the number of heels.

There are 3 women wearing 4 inch heels, so the total height for these heels is:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ inches} \]

There are 3 women wearing 2 inch heels, so the total height for these heels is:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ inches} \]

The total height of all the heels is:
\[ 12 + 6 = 18 \text{ inches} \]

There are a total of 6 heels (3 from the 4 inch heels group and 3 from the 2 inch heels group).

The average height of the heels is:
\[ \frac{18}{6} = 3 \text{ inches} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time, we first need to calculate the total number of miles she needs to hike and the total number of days she will be on vacation.

Soledad plans to hike 9,300 miles in June. June has 30 days, so she will be hiking for 30 days.

Next, we calculate the total number of miles she plans to hike each day if she walks twice a day, covering 125 miles each time:
\[ 125 \text{ miles/time} \times 2 \text{ times/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of miles she will hike if she walks 250 miles per day for 30 days:
\[ 250 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 7500 \text{ miles} \]

Since she needs to hike 9,300 miles and she will only hike 7,500 miles if she walks 250 miles per day, we need to find out how many more miles she needs to hike per day to reach her goal of 9,300 miles in 30 days.

The additional miles she needs to hike in total is:
\[ 9300 \text{ miles} - 7500 \text{ miles} = 1800 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike, we divide the additional miles by the number of days:
\[ \frac{1800 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 60 \]"
"To calculate the total amount the store will have received after selling all the balls, we need to multiply the number of each color of ball by its respective cost and then sum these amounts.

For the red balls:
3 red balls * $9 per red ball = $27

For the blue balls:
11 blue balls * $5 per blue ball = $55

For the green balls:
25 green balls * $3 per green ball = $75

Now, we add these amounts together:
$27 + $55 + $75 = $157

Therefore, the store will have received $157 after all the balls are sold."
"First, let's determine how many kilograms of apples each person wants.

Pierre wants a quarter of the total 12 kg of apples:
\[ \text{Pierre's share} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg} \]

Paul wants one third of the total 12 kg of apples:
\[ \text{Paul's share} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg} \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount of apples that Pierre and Paul want:
\[ \text{Total wanted by Pierre and Paul} = 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg} \]

Since the total amount of apples is 12 kg, the amount of apples that James will have left is:
\[ \text{James's share} = 12 \text{ kg} - 7 \text{ kg} = 5 \text{ kg} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how much money Anna has spent in total. She started with a budget of $16 and has $2 left after her purchases. Therefore, the total amount spent is:

\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \]

Anna has already spent $4 on other items, so the amount spent on the books is:

\[ 14 - 4 = 10 \]

Anna bought 2 books, and both books cost the same amount. Therefore, the cost of each book is:

\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

So, the cost of each book is $5. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 0.2 \times 50 = 10 \]

Next, we add this value to the number of students enrolled last year:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \]

So, the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class is 60."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the rate at which the lighthouse's light blinks. We know that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. Therefore, the rate of blinking is:

\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times. We can use the rate we just calculated to find the time required:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} \]

Now, let's perform the division:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459}{51} = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times."

"First, let's determine the time each person took to complete their chores:

1. Amalia mowed the lawn, which took her 4 hours.
2. Megan walked the dog, which took her 2 hours longer than Amalia. Therefore, Megan's chore took her \(4 + 2 = 6\) hours.
3. Dior did the laundry, which took her well over 4 hours longer than Amalia. Since Amalia's chore took 4 hours, Dior's chore took more than \(4 + 4 = 8\) hours. Let's assume the minimum time Dior took, which is 9 hours (since ""well over"" typically means more than the minimum additional time).

Now, we can calculate the total time they all took to do their chores altogether:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Amalia's time} + \text{Megan's time} + \text{Dior's time} = 4 + 6 + 9 = 19 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total distance John drives each month for his visits to his parents.

First, we need to find out the distance for a one-way trip. We know that John drives at a speed of 70 mph and it takes him 2 hours to drive there. The formula to calculate distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

So, for a one-way trip:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{one-way}} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

Since John visits his parents twice a month, the round trip distance is:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{round-trip}} = 2 \times \text{Distance}_{\text{one-way}} = 2 \times 140 \, \text{miles} = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the total number of miles John drives each month when visiting his parents is:

\[ 280 \, \text{miles} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"If Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day for 7 days, she will walk a total of \(10 \times 7 = 70\) miles in 7 days.

According to the question, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Therefore, Brian will walk half the distance that Sofie walks in 7 days. So, Brian will walk \(70 \div 2 = 35\) miles in 7 days.

The final numerical answer is 35."
"To solve this, let's first calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers.

Two workers produce 6 toys per hour:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ toys/hour} \]
For a 10-hour shift:
\[ 12 \times 10 = 120 \text{ toys} \]

The other two workers produce 4 toys per hour:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ toys/hour} \]
For a 10-hour shift:
\[ 8 \times 10 = 80 \text{ toys} \]

Adding the toys produced by all four workers:
\[ 120 + 80 = 200 \text{ toys} \]

The total order is 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, 200 toys have been produced. Therefore, the number of toys still needed is:
\[ 400 - 200 = 200 \text{ toys} \]

Since the fifth worker works for the entire 10-hour shift, let's denote the number of toys produced by the fifth worker per hour as \( x \). The total number of toys produced by the fifth worker in 10 hours is:
\[ 10x \]

The total number of toys produced by all five workers is:
\[ 200 + 10x \]

We know that the total number of toys produced by all five workers must equal the total order of 400 toys:
\[ 200 + 10x = 400 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 10x = 200 \]
\[ x = 20 \]

Therefore, the fifth worker produces 20 toys per hour.

Elijah's dog that is half the weight of Kory's dog would weigh:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add the weights of Elijah's dogs to find the total weight of Elijah's dogs:
\[ 15 + 30 = 45 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs to find the combined weight:
\[ 45 + 60 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs altogether is:

1. Kris gave 7 stickers to Rob, and Kris kept 9 stickers. Therefore, before giving to Rob, Kris had 7 + 9 = 16 stickers.
2. Luis used half of his stickers and gave the rest to Kris. Since Kris had 16 stickers, Luis must have had 16 * 2 = 32 stickers before giving to Kris.
3. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. Since Luis had 32 stickers, Seth must have had 32 * 2 = 64 stickers in the beginning.

The final numerical answer is 64."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the M&Ms John has:

John buys 3 large bags, each weighing 10 ounces. Therefore, the total weight is:
\[ 3 \times 10 = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to determine how many M&Ms are in these 30 ounces. We know that 1 ounce of M&Ms contains 30 M&Ms. Therefore, the total number of M&Ms is:
\[ 30 \text{ ounces} \times 30 \text{ M&Ms/ounce} = 900 \text{ M&Ms} \]

Now, John wants to put 10 M&Ms in each small bag. To find out how many small bags he can make, we divide the total number of M&Ms by the number of M&Ms per small bag:
\[ \frac{900 \text{ M&Ms}}{10 \text{ M&Ms/bag}} = 90 \text{ small bags} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's first determine Liam's age two years ago. Since Liam is currently 16 years old, two years ago he was:

\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \text{ years old} \]

According to the problem, two years ago Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. Let's denote Vince's age two years ago as \( V \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 14 = 2V \]

To find \( V \), we solve for \( V \):

\[ V = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]

So, two years ago Vince was 7 years old. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:

\[ 7 + 2 = 9 \]

Therefore, Vince is currently 9 years old. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline as \( A \). Since they painted the same number of eggs, we have \( A = A \).

Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Sarah as \( S \). Then, the number of eggs painted by Camden is \( S + 12 \) because Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah.

We know that the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. So, we can write the equation:
\[ A + A + S + (S + 12) = 56 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2A + 2S + 12 = 56 \]
Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get:
\[ 2A + 2S = 44 \]
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
\[ A + S = 22 \]

We also know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, so:
\[ S + (S + 12) = 30 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get:
\[ 2S = 18 \]
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, substituting \( S = 9 \) back into the equation \( A + S = 22 \), we get:
\[ A + 9 = 22 \]
Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get:
\[ A = 13 \]

So, Arnold painted 13 eggs, Madeline painted 13 eggs, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

To find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold, we calculate:
\[ 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups} \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the total weight of the crayons is:

\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Each box weighs 8 ounces, and there are 25 boxes, so the total weight of the boxes is:

\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we add the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes to get the combined weight:

\[ \text{Total combined weight} = 200 \text{ ounces} + 200 \text{ ounces} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Finally, we convert the total combined weight from ounces to pounds. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound:

\[ \text{Total combined weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 25 \text{ pounds} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many 4-foot logs John can make from the 80-foot tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, the length of the logs he can make is:

\[ 80 \text{ feet} \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 4-foot logs he can cut from 64 feet of wood:

\[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

Now, we need to determine how many planks John can get from these 16 logs. Since he cuts 5 planks from each log:

\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

Finally, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling these planks. Since each plank is sold for $1.2:

\[ 80 \text{ planks} \times 1.2 \text{ dollars/plank} = 96 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns half of what her brother earns, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Valerie's salary} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

Given that Valerie earns $5000 per month, we can solve for her brother's salary:

\[ 5000 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

\[ \text{Brother's salary} = 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Now, we know Valerie's brother earns $10000 per month. Next, we need to find out how much their mother earns. Their mother earns twice their combined salary. First, we calculate their combined salary:

\[ \text{Combined salary} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} \]

\[ \text{Combined salary} = 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Their mother earns twice this amount:

\[ \text{Mother's salary} = 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \]

Now, we can find the total amount of money they all have together by adding their salaries:

\[ \text{Total amount} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} + \text{Mother's salary} \]

\[ \text{Total amount} = 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

So, the total amount of money they all have together is $45000."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk, and then calculate the total time for the entire walk.

First, let's find Grandma's speed on the beach. We know that she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes. Therefore, her speed on the beach is:
\[ \text{Speed on the beach} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} \]

Since she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is:
\[ \text{Speed on the sidewalk} = 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, we calculate the time spent on the sidewalk. Since she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk in 10 minutes, the time spent on the sidewalk is:
\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the total time spent on the entire walk. The time spent on the beach is 40 minutes, and the time spent on the sidewalk is 10 minutes. Therefore, the total time is:
\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate how much Jane has saved so far. She has saved $4 each week for 8 weeks, so:

\[ 4 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 8 \, \text{weeks} = 32 \, \text{dollars} \]

Jane's goal is to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she has already saved from her goal:

\[ 60 \, \text{dollars} - 32 \, \text{dollars} = 28 \, \text{dollars} \]

Jane saves $4 each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28, we divide the remaining amount by the weekly savings:

\[ 28 \, \text{dollars} \div 4 \, \text{dollars/week} = 7 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60."
"To find the total number of blue birds, we can break down the problem into parts and then sum them up.

First, we have 3 trees each with 7 blue birds:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Next, we have 2 trees each with 4 blue birds:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

Finally, we have 1 tree with 3 blue birds:
\[ 1 \times 3 = 3 \]

Subtracting 24 from both sides of the equation gives:

\[ \text{Current marbles} = 60 - 24 \]
\[ \text{Current marbles} = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles. If he loses 10 of the marbles he has, the number of marbles he will have is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the second mug of water such that after Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle, the resulting water can be drunk at a temperature of at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote the temperature of the second mug of water as \( T \) degrees.

First, we calculate the temperature of the water left in the 33-degree mug after pouring 4 ounces:
- The initial volume of water in the 33-degree mug is \( V \) ounces.
- After pouring 4 ounces, the remaining volume is \( V - 4 \) ounces.
- The temperature of the remaining water in the 33-degree mug is still 33 degrees because the temperature of the water does not change by pouring it out.

Next, we calculate the temperature of the water in the second mug after pouring 1 ounce:
- The initial volume of water in the second mug is \( V \) ounces.
- After pouring 1 ounce, the remaining volume is \( V - 1 \) ounce.
- The temperature of the remaining water in the second mug is \( \frac{T \times 1}{V - 1} = \frac{T}{V - 1} \) degrees.

Now, we mix the remaining water from both mugs into Donny's water bottle. The total volume of water in the bottle is \( V - 4 + (V - 1) = 2V - 5 \) ounces. The total temperature of the water in the bottle is:
\[ 33 \times (V - 4) + \frac{T}{V - 1} \times 1 \]

To be able to drink the water, the average temperature must be at least 40 degrees:
\[ \frac{33(V - 4) + \frac{T}{V - 1}}{2V - 5} \geq 40 \]

We need to find the minimum value of \( T \) that satisfies this inequality. Let's simplify the inequality:
\[ 33(V - 4) + \frac{T}{V - 1} \geq 40(2V - 5) \]
\[ 33V - 132 + \frac{T}{V - 1} \geq 80V - 200 \]
\[ \frac{T}{V - 1} \geq 80V - 80V + 200 - 132 \]
\[ \frac{T}{V - 1} \geq 68 \]
\[ T \geq 68(V - 1) \]

Since \( V \) is the initial volume of water in the mugs and it cancels out in the context of finding the minimum temperature of the second mug, we can conclude that the minimum temperature \( T \) must be at least 68 degrees.

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the second bottle is 68 degrees."
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added over the period and then add these to the initial number of animals.

First, let's calculate the number of cows added:
- Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day.
- There are 21 days in three weeks (since 3 weeks = 21 days).

So, the number of cows added is:
\[ 20 \text{ cows/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 420 \text{ cows} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of chickens added:
- Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day.
- There are 21 days in three weeks.

So, the number of chickens added is:
\[ 10 \text{ chickens/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ chickens} \]

Now, let's find the total number of cows and chickens on the farm after three weeks:
- Initial number of cows: 50
- Number of cows added: 420
- Total number of cows: \( 50 + 420 = 470 \)

- Initial number of chickens: 20
- Number of chickens added: 210
- Total number of chickens: \( 20 + 210 = 230 \)

Finally, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount:

Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs cost:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Since he orders 4 packs, he gets a 10% discount on the total cost. The discount amount is:
\[ 40 \times 0.10 = 4 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels he gets in total. Since each pack contains 9 bagels and he orders 4 packs, the total number of bagels is:
\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \]

To find the cost per bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels:
\[ \frac{36}{36} = 1 \]

So, the cost per bagel is $1.00.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1 \]"
"First, let's determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. According to the question, Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, we calculate:

\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 1 less than 3 is 2 scoops, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. The question states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, 1 less than 3 scoops is 2 scoops, and 3 less than 6 potatoes is 3 potatoes. Therefore, 2 scoops of mashed potatoes require 3 potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes are required for 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 2 scoops require 3 potatoes, 18 scoops would require:

\[ \frac{18}{2} \times 3 = 9 \times 3 = 27 \]

So, Gomer ate 27 potatoes. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days.

Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the next 30 days.

Chester then increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day for 30 days:
\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, let's find the total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days by adding the two amounts together:
\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

To find out how many dozens of eggs this is, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs):
\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozen} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus initially.

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can represent the number of men as \(5x\) and the number of women as \(9x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of passengers is given as 84. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[5x + 9x = 84\]
\[14x = 84\]
\[x = 6\]

Now, we can find the number of men and women:
- Number of men = \(5x = 5 \times 6 = 30\)
- Number of women = \(9x = 9 \times 6 = 54\)

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:

"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to first determine how many bouquets he sold in one day and then calculate the total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days.

From the information given:
- Each bouquet of sunflowers costs $8.
- Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers.
- Faraday earned $56 from selling bouquets per day.

First, we calculate the number of bouquets sold per day:
\[ \text{Number of bouquets sold per day} = \frac{\text{Total earnings from bouquets per day}}{\text{Price per bouquet}} = \frac{56}{8} = 7 \text{ bouquets} \]

Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold per day is:
\[ \text{Number of sunflowers sold per day} = \text{Number of bouquets sold per day} \times 12 = 7 \times 12 = 84 \text{ sunflowers} \]

Now, to find out how many sunflowers were sold in 3 days:
\[ \text{Total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days} = \text{Number of sunflowers sold per day} \times 3 = 84 \times 3 = 252 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many rocks Adam can buy with his $100. Each rock costs $5.

\[
\text{Number of rocks} = \frac{\text{Total money}}{\text{Cost per rock}} = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \text{ rocks}
\]

Adam can buy 20 rocks and then sell 60% of them. Let's calculate how many rocks he sells:

\[
\text{Number of rocks sold} = 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ rocks}
\]

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling these 12 rocks. Each rock is sold for $7.

\[
\text{Revenue from selling rocks} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ dollars}
\]

Adam initially had $100. After selling the rocks, he has $84 left. The loss is the difference between the initial amount and the final amount:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that both tickets are winners.

First, let's denote the probability of winning with the first ticket as \( P(W_1) \). According to the problem, \( P(W_1) = 20\% = 0.20 \).

The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning with the second ticket, \( P(W_2) \), is:
\[ P(W_2) = 3 \times P(W_1) = 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60 \]

Since the events are independent, the probability that both tickets are winners is the product of their individual probabilities:
\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = P(W_1) \times P(W_2) = 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of babies dressed in purple and blue, and then calculate the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple.

First, let's find out how many babies are dressed in purple and how many are dressed in blue:
- Total babies = 8
- Babies dressed in purple = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- Babies dressed in blue = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we calculate how many babies wear bows:
- Babies wearing bows among the blue-wearers = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 2 = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.6667 \) (rounding to the nearest whole number, 1 baby)
- Babies wearing bows among the purple-wearers = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is \( 1 + 2 = 3 \).

Now, we need to find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. This can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of purple-wearers wearing bows}}{\text{Total number of babies wearing bows}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) \times 100 \approx 66.67\% \]

"Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters. According to the problem, the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the blue rope \( B \) can be expressed as:
\[ B = Y - 7 \]

The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope \( R \) can be expressed as:
\[ R = 4B = 4(Y - 7) \]

The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write the equation:
\[ R + B + Y = 37 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Y \) into the combined length equation, we get:
\[ 4(Y - 7) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]

Adding 35 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 6Y = 72 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope \( Y \) is 12 centimeters, we can find the length of the blue rope \( B \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \]

And the length of the red rope \( R \):
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters. The final numerical answer is:

- \( Y = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \) pints (since half the mural is yellow)
- The total amount of paint is \( R + W + P + Y = 12 \) pints

Since \( R = W = P \), we can substitute \( W \) and \( P \) with \( R \) in the total paint equation:
\[ R + R + R + 6 = 12 \]
\[ 3R + 6 = 12 \]

Now, solve for \( R \):
\[ 3R = 12 - 6 \]
\[ 3R = 6 \]
\[ R = 2 \]

Therefore, the number of pints of red paint used is 2 pints.

The final numerical answer is:
2"
"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. The area of one bedroom is given by the product of its length and width:

\[ \text{Area of one bedroom} = 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

\[ \text{Total area of bedrooms} = 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so:

\[ \text{Area of the living room} = 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

\[ \text{Total area of the house} = 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

So, the total area of the house is:

\[ 3160 \text{ square feet} \]"
"To find the total number of puffs of clouds Alice counts from Monday to Friday, we need to calculate the number of puffs for each day and then sum them up.

- Monday: 3 puffs
- Tuesday: 2 * Monday's count = 2 * 3 = 6 puffs
- Wednesday: 2 * Tuesday's count = 2 * 6 = 12 puffs
- Thursday: 2 * Wednesday's count = 2 * 12 = 24 puffs
- Friday: 2 * Thursday's count = 2 * 24 = 48 puffs

Now, we sum the puffs from each day:
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93

So, the total number of puffs of clouds Alice counts at the end of the week is 93."
"To determine how many dishwashing cycles can be run for $1 with the new box, we first need to find out how many pods are in the new box.

The original box has 100 pods and costs $12. The new box has 20% more pods than the original box. To find the number of pods in the new box, we calculate 20% of 100 and add it to 100.

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \]

So, the new box has:

\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The new box also costs $12, so the cost per pod in the new box is:

\[ \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

If we use 1 pod per cycle, the cost per cycle is $0.10. To find out how many cycles can be run for $1, we divide $1 by the cost per cycle:

\[ \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run for $1 with the new box is:

\[ 10 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of 20 dollar bills Thomas initially withdraws from the bank. Since he withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills, we can calculate the number of bills as follows:

\[ \text{Number of 20 dollar bills} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \]

Next, Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home. Therefore, the number of bills he has left is:

\[ \text{Remaining bills} = 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Thomas then uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. The number of bills he uses is:

\[ \text{Bills used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, the number of bills he has left after paying the bill is:

\[ \text{Remaining bills after paying} = 40 - 20 = 20 \]

Thomas then triples his money. Since each bill is worth $20, the total amount of money he has after tripling is:

\[ \text{Total money} = 20 \times 3 = 60 \times 20 = 1200 \]

Finally, Thomas converts all his money to 5 dollar bills. The number of 5 dollar bills he has is:

\[ \text{Number of 5 dollar bills} = \frac{1200}{5} = 240 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 240 \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. In the first half, team A scores 4 goals.
2. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A in the first half, so team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals in the first half.
3. In the second half, team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half.
4. Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals in the second half.
5. Therefore, team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals in the second half.

Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored by each team:

- Team A scores \(4 + 2 = 6\) goals in the match.
- Team B scores \(2 + 8 = 10\) goals in the match.

Finally, the total number of goals scored in the match is the sum of the goals scored by both teams:

\[6 + 10 = 16\]

The final numerical answer is 16."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chalk the teacher has left and then calculate how many days he can use the chalk before it reaches 2 inches.

1. **Initial Chalk Length**: The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
2. **Chalk Used on Monday**: The teacher used 45% of the chalk by the end of Monday. So, the chalk used on Monday is:
   \[

"First, let's determine the number of girls and boys on varsity.

One-third of the girls are on varsity:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ girls on varsity} \]

One-fourth of the boys are on varsity:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ boys on varsity} \]

Next, we calculate the number of girls and boys not on varsity.

Number of girls not on varsity:
\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ girls not on varsity} \]

Number of boys not on varsity:
\[ 12 - 3 = 9 \text{ boys not on varsity} \]

Finally, we add the number of girls and boys not on varsity to find the total number of students not on varsity:

"First, let's determine how many face masks Mike bought. According to the problem, Mike bought 5 face masks.

Next, we need to calculate how many face masks Johnny bought. The problem states that Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike. We can express this mathematically as:

\[ \text{Number of masks Johnny bought} = 3 \times (\text{Number of masks Mike bought}) + 2 \]

Substituting the number of masks Mike bought (5):

\[ \text{Number of masks Johnny bought} = 3 \times 5 + 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of masks Johnny bought} = 15 + 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of masks Johnny bought} = 17 \]

So, Johnny bought 17 face masks. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of teeth that the dentist fixes. According to the problem, the dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills. Since he drills 4 teeth, the number of teeth capped is:

\[ 4 + 7 = 11 \]

So, the total number of teeth fixed by the dentist is the sum of the teeth drilled and the teeth capped:

\[ 4 + 11 = 15 \]

Now, we need to find what percentage of James' teeth (which is 30) are fixed. The percentage can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 50 \]"
"To calculate the refund amount, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total cost of the milk Mr. Marcellus initially purchased.
2. Calculate the amount of milk that was returned due to expiry.
3. Calculate the refund amount based on the returned milk.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the milk Mr. Marcellus initially purchased:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Number of gallons} \times \text{Cost per gallon} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 4000 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5/\text{gallon} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$14000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much milk was returned due to expiry. Since 2/5 of the milk had passed the expiry date:
\[ \text{Milk returned} = \text{Total gallons} \times \frac{2}{5} \]
\[ \text{Milk returned} = 4000 \text{ gallons} \times \frac{2}{5} \]
\[ \text{Milk returned} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, we calculate the refund amount based on the returned milk:
\[ \text{Refund amount} = \text{Milk returned} \times \text{Cost per gallon} \]
\[ \text{Refund amount} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5/\text{gallon} \]
\[ \text{Refund amount} = \$5600 \]

"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now, we substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5(C + 7)) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5(C + 7)}{3} \]
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old. Let's verify this by calculating Wendy's current age using the first equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) = 5(20 + 7) = 5 \times 27 = 135 \]

Now, let's check the second condition:
\[ C + 25 = 20 + 25 = 45 \]
\[ \frac{1}{3}W = \frac{1}{3} \times 135 = 45 \]

Both conditions are satisfied, so the final answer is:
\[ \text{Colin's current age} = 20 \]"
"First, let's determine how many books Bob can buy with $27,000. We know that he can buy 100 books for $500. Therefore, the cost per book is:

\[ \text{Cost per book} = \frac{500}{100} = 5 \text{ dollars per book} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27,000:

\[ \text{Total number of books} = \frac{27000}{5} = 5400 \text{ books} \]

Since Bob is distributing the money between 3 schools, we need to find out how many books he can buy per school:

\[ \text{Books per school} = \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \text{ books per school} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1800 \]"

\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices} \]

Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, we need to determine how many cheese pizzas are required to provide 36 slices:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed by Kate's friends. Each of the 6 friends eats 4 slices of pepperoni pizza:

\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Since the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we need to determine how many pepperoni pizzas are required to provide 24 slices:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

To find the total number of pizzas Kate needs to buy, we add the number of cheese pizzas and pepperoni pizzas required:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net number of snowballs Jay can make per hour and then determine how long it will take to reach 60 snowballs.

Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in an hour, 2 snowballs melt every hour. Therefore, the net number of snowballs Jay can make in an hour is:

\[ 20 - 2 = 18 \text{ snowballs per hour} \]

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs. We can set up the equation:

\[ 18 \times \text{hours} = 60 \]

Solving for hours:

\[ \text{hours} = \frac{60}{18} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \]

So, it will take Jay approximately 3.33 hours to have 60 snowballs."
"If John is 28 years old now and he is twice as old as Jim when the Digimon series came out, we can set up the following equation to find Jim's age at that time:

Let \( J \) be Jim's age when the series came out. According to the information given, John's age at that time was \( 2J \). Since John is currently 28 years old, we can say that the difference in their ages has remained constant over the 20 years since the series came out. Therefore:

\[ 2J = 28 \]

To find \( J \), we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ J = \frac{28}{2} = 14 \]

So, Jim was 14 years old when the series came out. Since 20 years have passed, we add 20 to Jim's age at that time to find his current age:

\[ 14 + 20 = 34 \]

Therefore, Jim is currently 34 years old."

"Let's break down the problem day by day to find out how many bandages were used and how many were left at the end of each day.

**First Day:**
- They used 38 bandages.
- They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
- Total bandages at the end of the first day: \(38 - 38 + 50 = 50\).

**Second Day:**
- They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
- Total bandages at the end of the second day: \(50 - 28 = 22\).

**Third Day:**
- They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered \(2 \times 50 = 100\) bandages.
- They used half a pack, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.
- Total bandages at the end of the third day: \(22 - 25 + 100 = 97\).

According to the problem, they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. However, based on our calculation, they had 97 bandages left. This discrepancy suggests that the problem might have a different interpretation or a different set of conditions. Given the problem's conditions, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is 50.

The final numerical answer is:
50"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the haircut. May's hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches, so the haircut involved cutting 2 inches of hair.

The cost for the haircut is $30 per inch, so for 2 inches, the cost is:
\[ 2 \text{ inches} \times \$30/\text{inch} = \$60 \]

Next, we add the cost of the hair color, which is $40.

So, the total cost is:
\[ \$60 + \$40 = \$100 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$100 \]"
"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to consider her regular pay and the additional attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her regular pay:
- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- She works 6 days a week.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

So, her daily pay is:
\[ 7.5 \text{ hours/day} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = \$11.25/\text{day} \]

Her weekly pay is:
\[ \$11.25/\text{day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = \$67.50/\text{week} \]

Since there are exactly 4 weeks in April, her total pay for April is:
\[ \$67.50/\text{week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = \$270.00 \]

Additionally, since she did not incur any absences for the month of April, she receives the $10 attendance bonus.

Therefore, her total earnings for April are:
\[ \$270.00 + \$10 = \$280.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$280.00 \]"
"To calculate the total amount of money Jason earned, we need to multiply the number of times he performed each task by the amount he earns for each task and then sum these amounts.

- For emptying the dishwasher: Jason emptied the dishwasher 6 times, and he earns $0.50 for each time. So, the earnings from emptying the dishwasher are \(6 \times 0.50 = 3.00\) dollars.
- For doing laundry: Jason did laundry once, and he earns $3.00 for each time. So, the earnings from doing laundry are \(1 \times 3.00 = 3.00\) dollars.
- For taking the trash out: Jason took the trash out twice, and he earns $0.75 for each time. So, the earnings from taking the trash out are \(2 \times 0.75 = 1.50\) dollars.
- For cleaning his room: Jason cleaned his room once, and he earns $1.50 for each time. So, the earnings from cleaning his room are \(1 \times 1.50 = 1.50\) dollars.

Now, we sum up all the earnings:
\[3.00 + 3.00 + 1.50 + 1.50 = 9.00\]

So, Jason earned a total of $9.00 in the two week period."
"First, let's determine the amount of blood in one shark. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and each whale has 40 gallons of blood, we can calculate the blood volume in one shark as follows:

\[ \text{Blood volume in one shark} = 3 \times 40 \text{ gallons} = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have together. We do this by multiplying the blood volume of one shark by ten:

\[ \text{Total blood volume for ten sharks} = 120 \text{ gallons/shark} \times 10 \text{ sharks} = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:

\[ 1200 \]"
"To calculate the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day, we need to add up all the groups of people who entered.

1. In the morning, 50 people entered.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people.

Now, we sum these numbers:

\[
50 \text{ (morning)} + 40 \text{ (10:00)} + 80 \text{ (twice 10:00)} + 150 \text{ (evening)} = 320
\]

So, the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day is 320."
"Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack contains 5 pens. Therefore, the total number of red pens is:
\[ 5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 25 \text{ red pens} \]

She also bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. So, the number of black pens is:
\[ 2 \times 25 \text{ red pens} = 50 \text{ black pens} \]

To find the total number of pens Alain has, we add the number of red pens and black pens together:
\[ 25 \text{ red pens} + 50 \text{ black pens} = 75 \text{ pens} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 75 \]"
"First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600, so the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find the cost per bottle of cognac. The cognac costs 50% more per bottle than the scotch, so the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 \times 1.5 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

The total cost for the cognac is:

\[ \text{Total cost of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we can find the total amount John spends on everything by adding the cost of the scotch and the cost of the cognac:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2400 \]"
"To find the total number of trees Mr. Julius planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted each day and then sum them up.

First, let's determine the number of trees planted on the first day:
- Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
- He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which means he planted \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

So, the total number of trees planted on the first day is:
\[ 20 \text{ (White Oak)} + 40 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 60 \text{ trees} \]

Next, let's determine the number of trees planted on the second day:
- Mr. Julius planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day, which means he planted \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
- He planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day. The number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the first day was 40, so \(\frac{1}{4}\) more than 40 is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]
Thus, the number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is:
\[ 40 + 10 = 50 \]

So, the total number of trees planted on the second day is:
\[ 30 \text{ (White Oak)} + 50 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 80 \text{ trees} \]

Finally, the total number of trees planted over the two days is:
\[ 60 \text{ (first day)} + 80 \text{ (second day)} = 140 \text{ trees} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{140} \]"
"To find out how much root beer was available for each person to drink during the party, we need to calculate the total amount of root beer remaining after all the losses and spills.

Starting with 24 gallons:
- On the first day, 4 gallons were drunk by Fred's children, so we subtract 4 gallons: \(24 - 4 = 20\) gallons.
- On the second day, 7 gallons were accidentally spilled by Barbie, so we subtract 7 gallons: \(20 - 7 = 13\) gallons.
- On the third day, 5 gallons were taken by Ronnie, so we subtract 5 gallons: \(13 - 5 = 8\) gallons.

On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party, and the remaining 8 gallons were shared equally among them. Therefore, each person would get \(8 \div 3\) gallons.

To find the numerical answer:
\[ \frac{8}{3} = 2 \frac{2}{3} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \frac{2}{3} \]"
"Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as \( x \).

According to the problem, eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation step by step.

First, subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8 \]
\[ 4x = 32 \]

Next, divide both sides by 4:
\[ \frac{4x}{4} = \frac{32}{4} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is \( 8 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"First, let's find out how many fish have red stripes. Since one-third of the fish have red stripes, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of fish with red stripes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

Next, we need to find out how many fish are left after accounting for the fish with red stripes. This is:

\[
\text{Remaining fish} = 66 - 22 = 44
\]

Now, we need to find out how many of these remaining fish have blue stripes. Since 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of fish with blue stripes} = \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
\]

Finally, to find the total number of fish that have either red or blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes to the number of fish with blue stripes:

\[
\text{Total number of fish with red or blue stripes} = 22 + 20 = 42
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
42

"First, let's calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had:

- Two eyeshadow palettes, each with four colors: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors
- Three makeup sets, each with six colors: \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors

So, the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had is:
\[8 + 18 = 26\]

Her sister steals one of the palettes, which means Amy loses 4 colors:
\[26 - 4 = 22\]

Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which means she uses up 3 colors (since half of 6 is 3):
\[22 - 3 = 19\]

Therefore, the final number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is:

"First, let's determine the height of Mattison's house and the height of the first floor.

Mattison's height is 60 inches. The house is 7 times as high as he is:
\[ \text{Height of the house} = 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

The first floor is thrice as high as Mattison is:
\[ \text{Height of the first floor} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Since the house has two stories, the height of the second floor is the total height of the house minus the height of the first floor:
\[ \text{Height of the second floor} = 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height from the floor of the second floor to the roof is the height of the second floor:
\[ \text{Height from the floor of the second floor to the roof} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 240 \]"
"First, let's calculate how many shells team Alphas found. They found 40% of the 700 shells.

\[ \text{Shells found by Alphas} = 700 \times \frac{40}{100} = 700 \times 0.4 = 280 \]

Next, we need to find out how many shells are left after team Alphas have found their share.

\[ \text{Remaining shells} = 700 - 280 = 420 \]

Team The finders then found 60% of the remaining shells.

\[ \text{Shells found by The finders} = 420 \times \frac{60}{100} = 420 \times 0.6 = 252 \]

Finally, to find out how many shells team Gogetters found, we subtract the shells found by Alphas and The finders from the total number of shells.

\[ \text{Shells found by Gogetters} = 700 - 280 - 252 = 168 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 168."
"Let's denote the number of miles the last dog needs to walk as \( x \).

The total number of miles the four dogs need to walk per day is the sum of the miles each dog needs:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 + x \]

According to the problem, the average number of miles the dogs need to walk per day is 3 miles. Since there are 4 dogs, the total number of miles they need to walk per day is:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \]

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 + x = 12 \]

Simplifying the left side:
\[ 8 + x = 12 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 12 - 8 \]
\[ x = 4 \]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day.

"First, let's calculate the loan amount John gets:

Loan amount = 40% of $250,000
Loan amount = 0.40 * $250,000
Loan amount = $100,000

Next, let's calculate how much of the loan amount John uses to pay off his debts:

Amount used to pay off debts = 60% of $100,000
Amount used to pay off debts = 0.60 * $100,000
Amount used to pay off debts = $60,000

Now, let's calculate how much money John has leftover after paying off his debts:

Money leftover = Loan amount - Amount used to pay off debts
Money leftover = $100,000 - $60,000
Money leftover = $40,000

So, the final numerical answer is $40,000."

"To determine Trinity's profit, we first need to calculate the selling price of the magazines and then subtract the cost price from it.

Trinity bought the magazines at $72 each. She sells them at 11/8 of the price she bought them. So, we calculate the selling price as follows:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8} \]

Let's perform the multiplication:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times 1.375 = 99 \]

So, the selling price of each magazine is $99.

Next, we calculate the profit by subtracting the cost price from the selling price:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price} \]
\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 = 27 \]

Therefore, Trinity's profit is $27."
"To find the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed per day for each setting and then multiply by the number of days it was used at that setting.

1. **Low setting:**
   - Removes 1 liter of water per day.
   - Brian used it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed at low setting = 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters.

2. **Medium setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the low setting.
   - Therefore, it removes 2 liters of water per day.
   - Brian used it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed at medium setting = 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters.

3. **High setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting.
   - Therefore, it removes 4 liters of water per day.
   - Brian used it for 5 days.
   - Total water removed at high setting = 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters.

Now, we sum up the total water removed from all settings:

"To determine the total amount Pauline spent on visits to the museum, we need to break down the problem into steps.

1. **Initial Cost Calculation:**
   - Pauline visits the museum three times a year.
   - The initial cost per visit is $2.
   - Over one year, the total cost is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) dollars.
   - Over 5 years, the total cost is \(5 \times 6 = 30\) dollars.

2. **Cost Increase Calculation:**
   - The cost of one visit increased by 150% after 5 years.
   - A 150% increase means the new cost is \(2 + (2 \times 1.5) = 2 + 3 = 5\) dollars per visit.

3. **Cost for the Next 3 Years:**
   - For the next 3 years, Pauline continues to visit the museum three times a year.
   - The cost per visit is now $5.
   - Over one year, the total cost is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.
   - Over 3 years, the total cost is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) dollars.

4. **Total Cost Calculation:**
   - The total amount spent over the 8 years (5 years + 3 years) is the sum of the costs from both periods.

"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, so the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find the value of \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, we calculate the length of the longer piece as follows:

\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet."
"To determine how much of his secret seasoning Aiden will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many pounds of meat are needed to make 80 meatballs.
2. Calculate the amount of seasoning needed based on the amount of meat.

First, we know that Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat. To find out how many pounds of meat are needed for 80 meatballs, we divide the number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound:

\[
\text{Pounds of meat needed} = \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds of meat}
\]

Next, we know that Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning for every pound of ground beef. Therefore, for 5 pounds of meat, the amount of seasoning needed is:

"First, we need to find the total width of all the windows. Since there are five windows and each window is 35 inches wide, we can calculate the total width as follows:

\[ \text{Total width} = 5 \times 35 \text{ inches} \]

\[ \text{Total width} = 175 \text{ inches} \]

Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows. So, we multiply the total width by 2:

\[ \text{Fabric needed} = 175 \text{ inches} \times 2 \]

\[ \text{Fabric needed} = 350 \text{ inches} \]

The final numerical answer is 350 inches."
"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts: the cost for the first 16 minutes and the cost for the remaining minutes.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute:
\[ 16 \text{ minutes} \times \$0.25/\text{minute} = \$4.00 \]

For the remaining 20 minutes (since 36 - 16 = 20), the cost is $0.2 per minute:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes} \times \$0.2/\text{minute} = \$4.00 \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total cost:
\[ \$4.00 + \$4.00 = \$8.00 \]

So, the total cost for a 36-minute call is $8.00."
"To find out how much rain will fall on Tuesday, we first need to calculate twice the amount of rain that fell on Monday and then add 1 inch to that amount.

Rain expected on Tuesday: \(4 + 1 = 5\) inches

So, the final numerical answer is 5 inches."
"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly made as \( C \) and the number of brownies as \( B \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be expressed as:
\[ B = 3C - 2 \]

Carly's class has 5 people, and each person gets 2 treats. Therefore, the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

The total number of treats is the sum of the cupcakes and brownies:
\[ C + B = 10 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]

Adding 2 to both sides:
\[ 4C = 12 \]

Dividing both sides by 4:
\[ C = 3 \]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of a basic manicure and a basic pedicure without any discounts:
- Basic manicure: $35
- Basic pedicure: $40

The total cost for both services without any discounts is:
\[ 35 + 40 = 75 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount for getting both services:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 75 = 0.20 \times 75 = 15 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ 75 - 15 = 60 \]

Karen also wants to add nail art on each of her fingers. There are 10 fingers in total (2 fingers per hand), and each nail art service costs $3:
\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \]

Finally, add the cost of the nail art to the discounted total cost of the services:
\[ 60 + 30 = 90 \]

So, Karen would pay in all:
\[ 90 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of issues Susan gets from each magazine:

1. For the 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year:
\[ 3 \text{ magazines} \times 12 \text{ issues/magazine} = 36 \text{ issues} \]

2. For the 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year:
\[ 1 \text{ magazine} \times 6 \text{ issues/magazine} = 6 \text{ issues} \]

3. For the last magazine that sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine:
\[ 4 \times 6 \text{ issues} = 24 \text{ issues} \]

Now, let's add up all the issues:
\[ 36 \text{ issues} + 6 \text{ issues} + 24 \text{ issues} = 66 \text{ issues} \]

Since each magazine is counted as one unit, the total number of magazines Susan gets every year is:

"Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as \( K \).

According to the problem, Shelley has 8 paintings more than Kim, so Shelley has \( K + 8 \) paintings.

Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, and we know Samantha has 27 paintings. Therefore, we can write the equation for the number of paintings Samantha has as:
\[ K + 8 - 12 = 27 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ K - 4 = 27 \]

To find \( K \), we add 4 to both sides of the equation:
\[ K = 27 + 4 \]
\[ K = 31 \]

So, Kim has 31 paintings. The final numerical answer is:

"To find the final price of the toy after the price changes, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price of the toy in December after an 80% increase.
2. Calculate the price of the toy in January after a 50% decrease from the December price.

**Step 1: Calculate the price in December.**

The original price of the toy in November was $40. In December, the price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we calculate 80% of $40 and add it to the original price.

\[ \text{Increase in December} = 40 \times \frac{80}{100} = 40 \times 0.8 = 32 \]

So, the price in December is:

\[ 40 + 32 = 72 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the price in January.**

In January, the price decreased by 50% from the December price. To find the new price, we calculate 50% of $72 and subtract it from the December price.

\[ \text{Decrease in January} = 72 \times \frac{50}{100} = 72 \times 0.5 = 36 \]

So, the price in January is:

\[ 72 - 36 = 36 \]

The final price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"First, let's calculate the standard fee for a 1-hour lesson, which is $80.

Next, we calculate the reduced fee for a 1-hour lesson given to a veteran, which is 25% off the standard rate. The reduced rate is:
\[ 80 \times (1 - 0.25) = 80 \times 0.75 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total earnings from the 4 lessons at the standard rate:
\[ 4 \times 80 = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the total earnings from the 2 lessons given to veterans:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the earnings from both types of lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day:
\[ 320 + 120 = 440 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 440 \]"

1. Sum all the scores.
2. Divide the sum by the number of scores.

Let's start by summing the scores:

\[ 50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 \]

Adding these step by step:

\[ 50 + 80 = 130 \]
\[ 130 + 80 = 210 \]
\[ 210 + 60 = 270 \]
\[ 270 + 40 = 310 \]
\[ 310 + 90 = 400 \]
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \]
\[ 500 + 70 = 570 \]
\[ 570 + 60 = 630 \]

The total sum of the scores is 630.

Next, we divide the sum by the number of scores. There are 9 scores in total.

\[ \text{Mean} = \frac{630}{9} \]

Performing the division:

\[ \frac{630}{9} = 70 \]

Therefore, Sally's mean score is 70."

20 - 5 = 15

Eve gave away 15 pomelos."
"First, let's calculate how many apples Walter ate. He bought 60 apples and ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of them:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ apples}
\]

So, the number of apples remaining after Walter ate 24 is:

\[
60 - 24 = 36 \text{ apples}
\]

Next, Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. The number of apples given to his sister is:

\[
0.25 \times 36 = 9 \text{ apples}
\]

So, the number of apples remaining after giving 9 apples to his sister is:

\[
36 - 9 = 27 \text{ apples}
\]

Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. The total money he received is:

"To find out how many novels Regina has written this year, we can set up a simple equation based on the information given.

If 9 novels is 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year, we can represent the number of novels she has written this year as \( x \). Therefore, we can write the equation as:

\[ 9 = \frac{3}{4}x \]

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \). We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{3}{4} \), which is \( \frac{4}{3} \):

\[ 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = x \]

Now, let's calculate the value of \( x \):

\[ x = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \]

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"To find the percentage of the distance Michael has covered, we first need to calculate the total distance he travels in 3 days.

Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr. There are 24 hours in a day, so in 3 days, the total number of hours is:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 72 \text{ hours} \]

The total distance Michael travels in 72 hours at 50 km/hr is:
\[ 72 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ km/hr} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

The distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. To find the percentage of the total distance that Michael has covered, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{\text{Distance covered}}{\text{Total distance}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 0.6 \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of grapes used by Madeline's brother to make the grape juice. Since Madeline ate 6 grapes and her brother used up 5 times as many grapes, we calculate:

\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ grapes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many grapes were used in total by Madeline and her brother. Adding the grapes used by Madeline and her brother gives:

\[ 6 + 30 = 36 \text{ grapes} \]

Their mother then used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. Since each pie recipe calls for 12 grapes, the total number of grapes used to make the pies is:

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ grapes} \]

The total number of grapes at the beginning is the sum of the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and their mother. Therefore, we add the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and the grapes used for the pies:

\[ 36 + 48 = 84 \text{ grapes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to calculate the weekly cost and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

First, let's calculate the weekly cost:
- Cost of pasta: $1.00
- Cost of cheddar cheese: $3.00
- Cost of gruyere cheese: $3.00 * 2 = $6.00

Total weekly cost = Cost of pasta + Cost of cheddar cheese + Cost of gruyere cheese
Total weekly cost = $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00

Next, we calculate the yearly cost by multiplying the weekly cost by the number of weeks in a year (52 weeks):
Yearly cost = Total weekly cost * Number of weeks in a year
Yearly cost = $10.00 * 52 = $520.00

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms. Since it takes 15 minutes per classroom, the total time required is:

\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert the total time into hours because the workday is given in hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 1200 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

The custodian works 8 hours per day. To find out how much of their day is spent cleaning, we divide the total cleaning time by the number of hours they work in a day:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours/day}} = 2.5 \text{ days} \]

However, the custodian only has 5 days to complete the cleaning. This means they will spend more than 8 hours per day cleaning. To find out what percentage of their day is spent cleaning, we use the total cleaning time (20 hours) and divide it by the number of days they have (5 days):

\[ \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{5 \text{ days}} = 4 \text{ hours/day} \]

Now, to find the percentage of their day spent cleaning, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{4 \text{ hours/day}}{8 \text{ hours/day}} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the custodian spends 50% of their day, on average, cleaning classrooms. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 50\% \]"
"First, let's determine the capacity of each shelf:

- Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase:

- The total capacity of one bookcase is the sum of the capacities of all the shelves: \(10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books.

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:

\[ \text{Number of bookcases} = \frac{110}{55} = 2 \]

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs Rose bought. Since she bought five dozens of eggs and each dozen costs $2.40, the total cost is:

\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12.00 \]

Next, let's determine the total number of eggs Rose bought. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, let's find out how much Rose will sell the eggs for. She sells the eggs at $1 for 3 eggs. Therefore, the total revenue from selling 60 eggs is:

\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ sets of 3 eggs} \]

Since each set of 3 eggs is sold for $1, the total revenue is:

\[ 20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find Rose's profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \]

So, Rose's profit is:

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, which can be written as:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

The total number of ice cubes is the sum of strawberry and blueberry cubes, which is given as 116:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:
\[ S = 20 \]

Now, substituting \( S = 20 \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time Phineas spends hopping and swimming.

Phineas needs to travel a total distance of 200 yards. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, he will travel 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.

The time taken to hop 100 yards on land at a speed of 20 yards per minute is:
\[ \text{Time hopping} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

The time taken to swim 100 yards in water at a speed of 10 yards per minute is:
\[ \text{Time swimming} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards/minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

The total time to return home is the sum of the time spent hopping and the time spent swimming:
\[ \text{Total time} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 15 \]"
"To determine the cost for Bob to build his project, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate how many boxes of popsicle sticks Bob needs.
2. Calculate the total cost based on the number of boxes.

First, we need to find out how many boxes of popsicle sticks Bob needs. Since each box contains 8 popsicle sticks and Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks, we divide 56 by 8:

\[ \text{Number of boxes} = \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost. Each box costs $2.00, so we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Bob to build his project is $14.00."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the cost of the main phone:**
   - The main phone costs $20.

2. **Determine the cost of each additional phone:**
   - Each additional phone costs half as much as the main phone.
   - Therefore, the cost of each additional phone is \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total cost of the additional phones:**
   - There are 4 additional phones (since there are 5 phones in total and 1 is the main phone).
   - The total cost for the additional phones is \( 4 \times 10 = 40 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total cost of the whole phone plan:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the cost of the main phone and the cost of the additional phones.
   - Therefore, the total cost is \( 20 + 40 = 60 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is 60."
"To determine how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.**

Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day. Since one dozen equals 12 doughnuts, we have:
\[ 10 \text{ dozen} = 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ doughnuts per day} \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount pop, which is \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels.
3. In the next 30 seconds, four times the initial amount pop, which is \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels.
4. In the final 30 seconds, half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, which is \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) kernels.

Now, let's sum up the total number of kernels that popped in the first 120 seconds:
\[ 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 \]

After the pan is taken off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds pop from the residual heat. The number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds is 40, so a quarter of that is:
\[ \frac{40}{4} = 10 \]

Adding these to the initial 200 kernels, the total number of kernels that Garrett has to eat is:
\[ 200 + 10 = 210 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of lemons Tim needs, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, calculate the number of lemons needed for the 4 gallons of lemonade:
- Tim needs 1 cup of lemon juice per gallon of lemonade.
- For 4 gallons, he needs \(4 \text{ cups of lemon juice}\).

Next, determine the number of lemons needed for 4 cups of lemon juice:
- 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice.
- Therefore, for 4 cups, he needs \(4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ lemons}\).

Now, consider the extra gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart:
- This extra gallon also requires 1 cup of lemon juice.
- Since the lemonade is twice as tart, it still requires 6 lemons to make 1 cup of juice.
- Therefore, for 1 cup, he needs 6 lemons.

Adding the lemons needed for the 4 gallons and the extra gallon:
- 24 lemons for the 4 gallons.
- 6 lemons for the extra gallon.

Total lemons needed:

"To determine how far Elvis is from his house, we need to calculate the distance he traveled west and the distance he traveled east, and then find the net distance from his starting point.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled west:
- Elvis drives west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance west = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled east:
- Elvis drives east for 8 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance east = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles

Now, we need to find the net distance from his starting point. Since he traveled west first and then east, we subtract the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east:
- Net distance = Distance east - Distance west
- Net distance = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

Therefore, Elvis is 54 miles from his house now."

33 square feet (small) + 32 square feet (medium) + 36 square feet (large) = 101 square feet

The total square footage of the quilt is 101 square feet."
"First, let's determine the number of seeds in a large sunflower. A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since one dozen equals 12, a small sunflower has:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds} \]

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36 seeds, we calculate:

\[ 0.50 \times 36 = 18 \text{ seeds} \]

Adding this to the 36 seeds of the small sunflower gives the number of seeds in a large sunflower:

\[ 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds} \]

Now, to find the total number of seeds in both a small and a large sunflower, we add the seeds from both:

\[ 36 + 54 = 90 \text{ seeds} \]

So, the total number of sunflower seeds altogether is:

\[ 90 \]"
"If George has 18 pens, then Timothy has three times that amount, which is:
\[ 18 \times 3 = 54 \text{ pens} \]

Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, so:
\[ \frac{54}{2} = 27 \text{ pens} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 27 \]"
"First, let's determine Anne's height. Since Albert is 36"" tall and Anne is twice as tall as Albert, Anne's height is:

\[ 2 \times 36 = 72 \text{ inches} \]

Jackie is now 2"" shorter than Anne, so Jackie's current height is:

\[ 72 - 2 = 70 \text{ inches} \]

Jackie grew 3"" over the summer, so her height before the summer was:

\[ 70 - 3 = 67 \text{ inches} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 67 \]"
"To determine how much money the company will receive for selling the chocolate bars during two weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of bars produced in two weeks.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling those bars.

First, let's find out how many bars are produced in two weeks. Since the company produces 5000 bars per day, in two weeks (which is 14 days), the number of bars produced is:
\[ 5000 \text{ bars/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 70000 \text{ bars} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling these bars. The company sells each bar for $2, so the total revenue is:
\[ 70000 \text{ bars} \times 2 \text{ dollars/bar} = 140000 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the company will receive \(\boxed{140000}\) dollars for selling the produced chocolate bars during two weeks."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts with the buy one get one 50% off deal.

The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, he gets the second T-shirt at 50% off the original price.

The discounted price of the second T-shirt is:
\[ 8 \times 0.5 = 4 \]

So, the total cost for the two T-shirts is:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes after the 40% discount.

The original price of the shoes is $40. The discount is 40%, so the price Jake pays is:
\[ 40 \times (1 - 0.4) = 40 \times 0.6 = 24 \]

Now, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends:
\[ 12 + 24 = 36 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is:
\[ 36 \]"
"First, let's calculate Ryan's total allowance for the 3 weeks he completed his chores. Since he earns $6 each week, his total allowance is:
\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Ryan spent on ice cream cones. He bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends, so he bought 4 ice cream cones at $1.25 each. The total cost for the ice cream cones is:
\[ 4 \times 1.25 = 5 \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from Ryan's total allowance to find out how much money he has left:
\[ 18 - 5 = 13 \]

Ryan wants to go to the movies and the tickets cost $6.50 each. To find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy with the remaining $13, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one movie ticket:
\[ 13 \div 6.50 = 2 \]

Therefore, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Ellen spent:

- Two bathrobes: $100 each, so 2 * $100 = $200
Total for Lani = $30 + $200 = $230

Now, let's add the totals for Ellen and Lani to find the overall amount spent:
Total spent = Total for Ellen + Total for Lani
Total spent = $105 + $230 = $335

The final numerical answer is:
335"
"First, let's calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar of the mixture:

- Passion fruit: 2 pounds at $6 per pound = 2 * $6 = $12
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds at $8 per pound = 1.5 * $8 = $12
- Special honey: 2 pounds at $10 per pound = 2 * $10 = $20

Total cost for one jar = $12 (passion fruit) + $12 (jackfruit) + $20 (honey) = $44

Tim sells each jar for $50, so the profit per jar is:

Profit per jar = Selling price - Cost price = $50 - $44 = $6

To find the profit for 10 jars:

Profit for 10 jars = 10 * $6 = $60

The final numerical answer is $60."
"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and then sum these values.

- Quarters: 32 quarters * $0.25/quarter = $8.00
- Dimes: 95 dimes * $0.10/dime = $9.50
- Nickels: 120 nickels * $0.05/nickel = $6.00
- Pennies: 750 pennies * $0.01/penny = $7.50

Now, we sum these values to get the total dollar amount:

Total = $8.00 + $9.50 + $6.00 + $7.50 = $31.00

The total dollar amount in the jar is $31.00."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janet spent:

- Ice cream: $3.50
- Movie tickets: $7.50 each, so for two tickets: $7.50 * 2 = $15.00
- Bracelet: $8.50

Now, let's add these amounts together:

Total spent = $3.50 + $15.00 + $8.50 = $27.00

Janet's parents gave her $40. To find out how much she has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the amount given by her parents:

Amount left = $40.00 - $27.00 = $13.00

So, the final numerical answer is $13.00."
"To determine how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of days Josh works in a week.
2. Determine the number of cars he services in a week.
3. Calculate his weekly earnings.
4. Multiply his weekly earnings by 2 to find his earnings in 2 weeks.

Josh works from Monday to Saturday, excluding Sunday and Wednesday. This means he works 5 days a week.

He services 3 cars a day, so in a week, he services:
\[ 3 \text{ cars/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 15 \text{ cars/week} \]

He gets paid $4 per car, so his weekly earnings are:
\[ 15 \text{ cars/week} \times 4 \text{ dollars/car} = 60 \text{ dollars/week} \]

To find his earnings in 2 weeks, we multiply his weekly earnings by 2:
\[ 60 \text{ dollars/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

"To calculate the total money Matthew would earn, we need to break down his collection into two equal parts and then calculate the earnings from each part.

Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers, so each part would have 12 / 2 = 6 toy soldiers.

For the first half (6 toy soldiers) at $5 each:
6 toy soldiers * $5/toy = $30

For the second half (6 toy soldiers) at $7 each:
6 toy soldiers * $7/toy = $42

Now, we add the earnings from both halves to find the total amount Matthew would earn:
$30 + $42 = $72

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 72."
"First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate returns, the dog continues to dig 6 holes a day, but Nate starts filling in 9 holes a day. The net effect is that the dog is still digging 6 - 9 = -3 holes per day, which means the dog is digging 3 holes faster than Nate is filling them. 

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take to fill in the 84 holes. Since the dog is digging 3 holes faster than Nate is filling them, we can calculate the number of days it will take to fill in all the holes:

\[ \text{Number of days} = \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

To find out how many weeks it takes, we divide the number of days by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):

\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes."

Total cookies made = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies made - (Rainbow cookies + Oatmeal cookies)

Let's calculate:

Chocolate chip cookies = 7995 - (2595 + 3075)
Chocolate chip cookies = 7995 - 5670
Chocolate chip cookies = 2325

So, the number of chocolate chip cookies made is 2325."
"First, let's determine the number of each item Igor gathered by accident:

- Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many, which is \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes.
- Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes, but Igor gathered two more than requested, which is \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes.
- Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, and Igor picked up the correct number, which is 7 beakers.

Now, let's calculate the total number of items Igor gathered:

- Test tubes: 8
- Beakers: 7
- Petri dishes: 16

Adding these together gives:

"First, let's determine how much money each person raised individually.

Alexandra raised $430.

Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so:
\[ \text{Kim's amount} = 430 + 320 = 750 \]

Sarah raised $300.

Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so:
\[ \text{Maryam's amount} = 300 + 400 = 700 \]

Now, let's add up the total amount of money raised by all of them:
\[ \text{Total amount} = \text{Alexandra's amount} + \text{Kim's amount} + \text{Sarah's amount} + \text{Maryam's amount} \]
\[ \text{Total amount} = 430 + 750 + 300 + 700 \]

Adding these amounts together:
\[ 430 + 750 = 1180 \]
\[ 1180 + 300 = 1480 \]
\[ 1480 + 700 = 2180 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they all raised is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Aaron's speed:**
   - Let's assume Aaron's speed is \( v \) miles per minute.
   - Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed is \( \frac{v}{2} \) miles per minute.

2. **Determine the distance Vanessa ran:**
   - We are given that Vanessa ran 4 miles.

3. **Determine the time Aaron took to run his part of the race:**
   - We are given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.

4. **Calculate the distance Aaron ran:**
   - Since Aaron's speed is \( v \) miles per minute and he took 16 minutes to run his part, the distance he ran is:
     \[
     \text{Distance Aaron ran} = v \times 16 \text{ minutes}
     \]

5. **Relate the distances run by Aaron and Vanessa:**
   - According to the problem, Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron did. Therefore:
     \[
     4 \text{ miles} = 2 \times (v \times 16 \text{ minutes})
     \]
   - Simplify the equation to find \( v \):
     \[
     4 = 32v
     \]
     \[
     v = \frac{4}{32} = \frac{1}{8} \text{ miles per minute}
     \]

6. **Calculate Vanessa's speed:**
   - Vanessa's speed is \( \frac{v}{2} = \frac{1/8}{2} = \frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute} \).

7. **Calculate the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles:**
   - Time is calculated by dividing the distance by speed:
     \[
     \text{Time Vanessa took} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{\frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute}} = 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race."

"First, let's calculate the total selling price of the 50 watermelons with a 25% profit.

The cost price for 50 watermelons is $80.

To find the selling price with a 25% profit, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Selling Price} = \text{Cost Price} \times (1 + \text{Profit Percentage}) \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ \text{Selling Price} = 80 \times (1 + 0.25) \]
\[ \text{Selling Price} = 80 \times 1.25 \]
\[ \text{Selling Price} = 100 \]

So, the total selling price for 50 watermelons is $100.

To find the selling price per watermelon, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:
\[ \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{\text{Total Selling Price}}{\text{Number of Watermelons}} \]
\[ \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{100}{50} \]
\[ \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = 2 \]

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2."
"First, let's determine James's current age. Since Dora will be 12 in 3 years, she is currently 9 years old. James is now twice as old as Dora, so James is currently 2 * 9 = 18 years old.

John had James when he was 19, so John is currently 19 + 18 = 37 years old.

Now, let's find out how old John's youngest son is. The youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest son is currently 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, the youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many oranges each person can peel in one hour and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate how many oranges Ana can peel in one hour:
- Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour = 60 minutes / 3 minutes per orange = 20 oranges.

Next, let's calculate how many oranges Jane can peel in one hour:
- Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour = 60 minutes / 4 minutes per orange = 15 oranges.

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane in one hour:
- Difference = Number of oranges peeled by Ana - Number of oranges peeled by Jane = 20 oranges - 15 oranges = 5 oranges.

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( Co \).

We know that:
1. Each chicken has 2 legs.
2. Each cow has 4 legs.
3. The total number of animals is 20.
4. The total number of legs is 70.

From the information given, we can set up the following equations:
\[ C + Co = 20 \]
\[ 2C + 4Co = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2Co = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + Co = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2Co = 35 \)

To solve this system, we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (C + 2Co) - (C + Co) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ C + 2Co - C - Co = 15 \]
\[ Co = 15 \]

Now that we know the number of cows (\( Co = 15 \)), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find the number of chickens (\( C \)):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 20 - 15 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is 5."
"First, we need to determine the total number of slices available from the 7 pizzas. Since each pizza is cut into 8 slices, we can calculate the total number of slices as follows:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to divide the total number of slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends, which makes a total of 4 people. So, we divide the total number of slices by 4:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Therefore, each of them can have 14 slices. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 14 \]"
