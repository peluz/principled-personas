"First, let's determine how many eggs Janet has left after eating and using some for baking.

Janet starts with 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 eggs for baking. So, the number of eggs left is:

\[ 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 \]

Janet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg. Therefore, her daily earnings from selling the eggs are:

\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

So, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of white fiber required and then sum it with the amount of blue fiber.

Given:
- The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.
- The robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber.

First, calculate the amount of white fiber:
- Since the robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber, and there are 2 bolts of blue fiber, the amount of white fiber is:
  \[
  \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ bolt}
  \]

Next, sum the bolts of blue and white fiber:
- Blue fiber: 2 bolts
- White fiber: 1 bolt
- Total bolts: 
  \[
  2 + 1 = 3 \text{ bolts}
  \]

Therefore, the total number of bolts required is 3."
"First, we need to calculate the new value of the house after the repairs and the increase in value. The original value of the house is $80,000. Josh adds $50,000 in repairs, so the total cost before the increase is:

\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

The value of the house increases by 150%. To find out how much the value increases, we calculate 150% of $130,000:

\[ 130,000 \times 1.5 = 195,000 \]

Adding this increase to the original cost gives the new value of the house:

\[ 130,000 + 195,000 = 325,000 \]

Josh sells the house for the new value of $325,000. To find the profit, we subtract the total amount Josh spent (the original cost plus the repairs) from the selling price:

\[ 325,000 - 130,000 = 195,000 \]

So, the profit Josh made is:

\[ 195,000 \]"
"James runs 3 sprints each day, and each sprint is 60 meters. Therefore, in one day, he runs:
\[ 3 \text{ sprints/day} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 180 \text{ meters/day} \]

Since he runs 3 times a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
\[ 180 \text{ meters/day} \times 3 \text{ days/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 540 \]"
"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she gives her flock in the morning and afternoon.

Wendi gives her flock 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. Therefore, the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
\[ 15 + 25 = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Since Wendi has a flock of 20 chickens and she feeds each chicken three cups of feed per day, the total amount of feed needed for the entire flock is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed in the final meal, we subtract the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total amount of feed needed for the day:
\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Thus, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:
\[ 20 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"
"To solve this, we need to calculate the cost for 16 glasses, considering the pricing structure.

- The first glass costs $5.
- Every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $5 * 0.60 = $3.

So, for every pair of glasses, the cost is $5 + $3 = $8.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can divide the total number of glasses by 2 to find out how many pairs of glasses he is buying:
\[ \frac{16}{2} = 8 \text{ pairs} \]

Now, we multiply the number of pairs by the cost per pair:
\[ 8 \times 8 = 64 \]

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses."
"To solve this problem, we will follow the relationships given and calculate the number of sheep in each city step by step.

1. **Seattle's Sheep:**
   - Seattle has 20 sheep.

2. **Charleston's Sheep:**
   - Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   - Therefore, Charleston has \( 4 \times 20 = 80 \) sheep.

3. **Toulouse's Sheep:**
   - Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   - Therefore, Toulouse has \( 2 \times 80 = 160 \) sheep.

4. **Total Sheep in All Cities:**
   - To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we add the number of sheep in each city.
   - Total = Seattle's Sheep + Charleston's Sheep + Toulouse's Sheep
   - Total = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260

Thus, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is 260."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the time taken for each part of the download.

1. **First 40% of the download:**
   - The file size is 200 GB.
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 0.40 \times 200 = 80 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) minutes.

2. **Windows update installation:**
   - This takes 20 minutes.

3. **Restarting the download:**
   - After the update, Carla has to start the download from the beginning.
   - The remaining 60% of the file is \( 0.60 \times 200 = 120 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 120 GB is \( \frac{120}{2} = 60 \) minutes.

Now, we sum up the time taken for each part:
- Time for the first 40%: 40 minutes
- Time for the update installation: 20 minutes
- Time for the restart and download of the remaining 60%: 60 minutes

Total time = \( 40 + 20 + 60 = 120 \) minutes.

The final numerical answer is 120 minutes."
"To solve this problem, we need to break down John's journey into segments and calculate the distance for each segment.

1. **First Segment:**
   - Time: 3 hours
   - Speed: 60 mph
   - Distance: \(3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ mph} = 180 \text{ miles}\)

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Time: 2 hours (in traffic)
   - Speed: 0 mph
   - Distance: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 0 \text{ mph} = 0 \text{ miles}\)

3. **Third Segment:**
   - Time: 0.5 hours
   - Speed: 30 mph
   - Distance: \(0.5 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ miles}\)

4. **Fourth Segment:**
   - Time: 3.5 hours (since 4 hours total - 2 hours traffic - 0.5 hours at 30 mph = 3.5 hours)
   - Speed: 80 mph
   - Distance: \(3.5 \text{ hours} \times 80 \text{ mph} = 280 \text{ miles}\)

Now, we sum up the distances from all segments to find the total distance from home:
- Distance from first segment: 180 miles
- Distance from second segment: 0 miles
- Distance from third segment: 15 miles
- Distance from fourth segment: 280 miles

Total distance from home: \(180 + 0 + 15 + 280 = 475 \text{ miles}\)

The final numerical answer is 475 miles."
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break it down into regular hours and overtime hours.

Eliza's regular rate is $10 per hour. For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
\[ 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \]

For the overtime hours, she works 5 hours over the regular 40 hours. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate:
\[ 1.2 \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$12/\text{hour} \]
So, her earnings for the 5 overtime hours are:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

Adding the earnings from regular hours and overtime hours gives us her total earnings for the week:
\[ \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \]

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are:
\[ \$460 \]"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the number of downloads for each month and then sum them up.

1. **First Month Downloads:**
   The program had 60 downloads in the first month.

2. **Second Month Downloads:**
   The number of downloads in the second month was three times the first month's downloads.
   \[
   3 \times 60 = 180
   \]
   So, the program had 180 downloads in the second month.

3. **Third Month Downloads:**
   The number of downloads in the third month was reduced by 30% from the second month's downloads.
   \[
   180 \times (1 - 0.30) = 180 \times 0.70 = 126
   \]
   So, the program had 126 downloads in the third month.

4. **Total Downloads Over Three Months:**
   To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we sum the downloads from each month:
   \[
   60 + 180 + 126 = 366
   \]

The total number of downloads over the three months is 366."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts:
- Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
- Each dozen of donuts costs $68.
- Therefore, the cost of the donuts is \(3 \times 68 = 204\).

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:
- Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
- Each dozen of mini cupcakes costs $80.
- Therefore, the cost of the mini cupcakes is \(2 \times 80 = 160\).

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes:
- Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
- Each dozen of mini cheesecakes costs $55.
- Therefore, the cost of the mini cheesecakes is \(6 \times 55 = 330\).

Now, let's add up the costs of all the pastries to find the total cost:
- Total cost = cost of donuts + cost of mini cupcakes + cost of mini cheesecakes
- Total cost = 204 + 160 + 330 = 694.

The final numerical answer is 694."
"To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money from the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point at which this profit becomes positive.

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:
- Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons.
- Each lemon is sold for $1.5.
- Therefore, the annual revenue from lemons is \(7 \times 1.5 = 10.5\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the annual cost of maintaining the tree:
- The cost to water and feed the tree is $3 per year.

Now, we can find the net profit each year by subtracting the annual cost from the annual revenue:
- Net profit per year = Annual revenue - Annual cost
- Net profit per year = \(10.5 - 3 = 7.5\) dollars.

Since the initial cost to plant the tree is $90, we need to determine how many years it will take for the net profit to cover this initial cost.

Let \(n\) be the number of years it takes to start earning money. The total net profit after \(n\) years is \(7.5n\). We need this to be at least equal to the initial cost of $90:
\[7.5n \geq 90\]

Solving for \(n\):
\[n \geq \frac{90}{7.5} = 12\]

Therefore, it will take at least 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

The final numerical answer is:
12"
"Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had as \( x \).

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \).

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \).

3. She then sold half of what was left at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \). The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \).

We know that after these sales, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

Let's solve this equation step by step.

First, simplify the expression inside the parentheses:

\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2x}{3} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 \]
\[ = \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{x}{3} + 1 \]
\[ = \frac{2x - x}{3} - 1 \]
\[ = \frac{x}{3} - 1 \]

So the equation becomes:

\[ \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5 \]

Add 1 to both sides:

\[ \frac{x}{3} = 6 \]

Multiply both sides by 3:

\[ x = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners. Let's verify this:

- She sold \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) vacuum cleaners at the green house, leaving her with \( 18 - 6 = 12 \) vacuum cleaners.
- She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, leaving her with \( 12 - 2 = 10 \) vacuum cleaners.
- She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) vacuum cleaners, leaving her with \( 10 - 5 = 5 \) vacuum cleaners.

The calculations confirm that Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners. The final numerical answer is:

18"
"First, let's calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we have:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after those who enrolled in contemporary dance are accounted for:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Now, 25% of these remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Finally, the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is the remaining students after those who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance are accounted for:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of students in hip-hop dance}}{\text{Total number of students}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.60 \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the entire students that enrolled in hip-hop dance is 60%."
"To determine which purchase plan maximizes profit, we need to calculate the future value of each item based on the given market growth rates.

For the jewelry:
- Current value: $5,000
- Market growth rate: 2.5% or 0.025 in decimal form
- Future value of jewelry = Current value * (1 + growth rate) = $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,000 * 1.025 = $5,125

For the electronic gadgets:
- Current value: $8,000
- Market growth rate: 1.2% or 0.012 in decimal form
- Future value of electronic gadgets = Current value * (1 + growth rate) = $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,000 * 1.012 = $8,096

Now, we calculate the profit for each option:
- Profit from jewelry = Future value of jewelry - Current value of jewelry = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets = Future value of electronic gadgets - Current value of electronic gadgets = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Comparing the two profits, the merchant would make a higher profit by purchasing the electronic gadgets.

The final numerical answer for the profit is $96."
"To determine the total distance covered by each train over the two days, we need to add the distances traveled in both directions.

1. The first day, the train travels 80 miles west.
2. The second day, the train travels 150 miles north.

The total distance covered by each train is the sum of these two distances:
\[ 80 \text{ miles} + 150 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles."
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from both teaching and coaching separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her annual earnings from teaching:
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual teaching earnings = 35 hours/week * $20/hour * 50 weeks/year

Next, let's calculate her annual earnings from coaching:
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She gets paid $30 per coaching session.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual coaching earnings = 15 hours/week * $30/session * 50 weeks/year

Now, let's sum up her annual teaching and coaching earnings to get her total annual salary.

Let's do the calculations:

Annual teaching earnings = 35 * 20 * 50 = $35,000
Annual coaching earnings = 15 * 30 * 50 = $22,500

Total annual salary = Annual teaching earnings + Annual coaching earnings
Total annual salary = $35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500

So, Jill's annual salary is $57,500."
"To determine how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs Claire uses per day.
2. Calculate the number of eggs Claire uses per week.
3. Calculate the number of eggs Claire uses in 4 weeks.
4. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.

Step 1: Claire uses 3 eggs per day.

Step 2: There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Step 3: For 4 weeks:
\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Step 4: There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so:
\[ \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozen} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 7 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour over the entire 12-mile trail.

First, let's calculate the total time Marissa wants to spend hiking to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour:
\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already spent 1 hour on the first 4 miles and another hour on the next 2 miles, which totals:
\[ 1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

This means she has:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]
left to hike the remaining distance.

The remaining distance is:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 4 \text{ miles} - 2 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the required speed for the remaining distance, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

Plugging in the values for the remaining distance and the time left:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Thus, Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles at a speed of 6 miles per hour to achieve her goal of an average speed of 4 miles per hour over the entire 12-mile trail.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \]"
"First, let's determine the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink. Since two-thirds of the orange drink is water, we calculate:

\[
\text{Water in orange drink} = \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters}
\]

Next, let's determine the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since three-fifths of the pineapple drink is water, we calculate:

\[
\text{Water in pineapple drink} = \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = \frac{45}{5} = 9 \text{ liters}
\]

Now, we combine the water from both drinks before any spillage:

\[
\text{Total water before spillage} = \frac{20}{3} + 9 = \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3} \approx 15.67 \text{ liters}
\]

After spilling one liter of the orange drink, the total volume of the mixture becomes:

\[
\text{Total volume after spillage} = 10 - 1 + 15 = 24 \text{ liters}
\]

The amount of water remains the same because only the orange drink was spilled, not the water. Therefore, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:

\[
\text{Water in remaining mixture} = \frac{47}{3} \approx 15.67 \text{ liters}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{47}{3}}
\]"
"First, let's determine Raymond's current age. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha and Samantha is currently 31 years old, Raymond is currently \(31 - 6 = 25\) years old.

Raymond had a son at the age of 23. Therefore, his son is currently \(25 - 23 = 2\) years old.

Since Samantha is currently 31 years old and her son is 2 years old, her son was born \(31 - 2 = 29\) years ago.

So, Raymond's son was born 29 years ago."
"To determine the total number of DVDs Billy sold on Tuesday, we can break down the sales by customer segment:

The burning time from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is 4 hours.

Given that the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, the total melting over 4 hours is:
\[ 2 \, \text{cm/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 8 \, \text{cm} \]

Therefore, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"To find the original price of the book, we can set up the equation based on the information given. If the book was bought for $19.50 with a 25% discount, this means Kyle paid 75% of the original price (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \). According to the problem, 75% of \( P \) is $19.50. We can write this as:

\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we need to solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's calculate the value of \( P \).
```python
# Calculation
original_price = 19.50 / 0.75
original_price
```
```output
RuntimeError
```
It seems there was an error in the execution environment. Let's perform the calculation manually:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} = 26.00 \]

So, the original price of the book was \( \$26.00 \).

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{26.00} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered except for the boxes of pizza.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
The cost of 4 apples is \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Adding these together gives:
\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\] dollars.

Marie paid a total of $50. If we subtract the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples from the total amount paid, we can find out how much she spent on the boxes of pizza:
\[50 - 33 = 17\] dollars.

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, we can determine the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered by dividing the amount spent on pizza by the cost per box:
\[17 \div 8.50 = 2\] boxes.

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza. The final numerical answer is:
\[2\]"
"To find out how much Mishka spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of each type of clothing item separately and then sum them up.

The cost of the shorts is:
3 pairs * $16.50/pair = $59.50

The cost of the pants is:
3 pairs * $22.50/pair = $67.50

The cost of the shoes is:
3 pairs * $42/pair = $126.00

Now, we add these amounts together to find the total cost:
$59.50 + $67.50 + $126.00 = $253.00

So, Mishka spent $253.00 on all the clothing items."
"To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.
2. Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.**

Cynthia eats 1 serving of ice cream every night. There are 60 days in the period.

\[
\text{Total servings} = 1 \text{ serving/day} \times 60 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ servings}
\]

**Step 2: Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need.**

Each carton contains 15 servings.

\[
\text{Number of cartons} = \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.**

Each carton costs $4.00.

\[
\text{Total cost} = 4 \text{ cartons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total amount Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days is:

\[

"Henry's second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip is 60 miles, the distance to the end of the trip is 60 miles. Therefore, the distance to his second stop is 60 - 15 = 45 miles from the start. He first stopped after 20 miles. To find out how many miles he traveled between his first and second stops, we subtract the distance of his first stop from the distance of his second stop: 45 - 20 = 25 miles.

The final numerical answer is 25."
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

The cost of the first pair of high heels is $33. The cost of the second pair of high heels is twice the cost of the first pair, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = 104 \]

So, the cost of the boots is \( 104 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 104 \]"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen based on the given ratio and total age.

Given:
- The ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11.
- The sum of their ages is 162.

Let's denote Darrell's age as \(7x\) and Allen's age as \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The sum of their ages is:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]
\[18x = 162\]
\[x = \frac{162}{18}\]
\[x = 9\]

Now, we can find their current ages:
- Darrell's age: \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\)
- Allen's age: \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\)

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is:
\[109\]"
"To find the average guess, we first need to determine each friend's guess and then calculate the average.

1. The first friend's guess is 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half of the first friend's guess:
   \[
   \text{Second friend's guess} = \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60
   \]
3. The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess:
   \[
   \text{Third friend's guess} = 80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100
   \]

Now, we calculate the average of these guesses:

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these as equations:
\[ S + G = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins \( S \) is 40, we can find the number of gold coins \( G \) using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins."
"First, let's find out how many jewels Aaron has. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Since Raymond has 40 jewels, half of Raymond's jewels is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, Aaron has:

\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \]

jewels.

Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Therefore, Siobhan has:

\[ 25 - 2 = 23 \]

jewels.

So, the final numerical answer is 23."
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points he scores in the second 20 minutes, we calculate 25% of 4 points and add it to the original 4 points.

25% of 4 points is \( 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \) point.

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) points.

Therefore, the total points Mike scored are \( 4 + 5 = 9 \) points.

The final numerical answer is 9."
"First, we need to determine the cost of one yogurt. Since 4 yogurts cost $5.00, the cost of one yogurt is $5.00 / 4 = $1.25.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so the cost of 2 yogurts per day is $1.25 * 2 = $2.50.

Over 30 days, the total cost for Terry would be $2.50 * 30 = $75.00.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 75."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John makes from selling his lego sets. He has 13 lego sets and sells each for $15.

\[ \text{Total money from lego sets} = 13 \times 15 = 195 \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money John spends on the video games. He buys 8 video games for $20 each.

\[ \text{Total money spent on video games} = 8 \times 20 = 160 \]

Now, we can determine how much money John has left after buying the video games. We know he has $5 left after these purchases.

\[ \text{Money left} = 195 - 160 = 35 \]

Since the problem states that John has $5 left, we can verify that the calculation is consistent with the given information.

Finally, since John sold all his lego sets and did not keep any lego sets, the number of lego sets he still has is:

\[ \text{Number of lego sets left} = 0 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 0 \]"
"To find John's speed, we first need to determine the total distance he runs in those 3 days and then divide that by the total time he spends running.

John runs 3 days a week, with the first day he runs 3 hours and the other two days he runs half as much, which is 1.5 hours each day.

So, the total distance he runs in those 3 days is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} + 1.5 \text{ hours/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

The total time he spends running in those 3 days is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, to find his speed, we divide the total distance by the total time:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how far Dana can travel in six hours given her running, walking, and skipping speeds, and the time she spends on each activity.

First, let's find Dana's walking speed. We know that Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, and this speed is half of her running speed. Therefore, her running speed is:
\[ \text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 3 \text{ miles per hour} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine the time she spends running and walking. Since she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, and the total time is six hours, we can calculate the time spent on each activity:
\[ \text{Time spent running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Time spent walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the distance she covers while running and walking:
\[ \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time spent running} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time spent walking} \]

To find the walking speed, we use the fact that her walking speed is one-fourth of her running speed:
\[ \text{Walking speed} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Running speed} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6 \text{ miles per hour} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Distance walking} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, we add the distances covered while running and walking to find the total distance Dana can travel in six hours:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance walking} = 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 18 \]"

\]

The dragon's reach is 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone.

\[
\text{Distance outside reach} = 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet}

"First, let's determine the number of calories in one serving of the bag of chips. Given that a 300g bag has 5 servings and contains 250 calories per serving, we can calculate the total calories in the bag as follows:

\[ \text{Total calories in the bag} = 5 \text{ servings} \times 250 \text{ calories/serving} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories are left for the day. The daily calorie target is 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories:

\[ \text{Calories left for the day} = 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to determine how many servings of chips you can eat with the remaining 200 calories. Since each serving contains 250 calories:

\[ \text{Servings you can eat} = \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories/serving}} = \frac{200}{250} = \frac{4}{5} = 0.8 \text{ servings} \]

Since each serving is 500g (because 300g is 5 servings), the amount of chips you can eat is:

\[ \text{Grams you can eat} = 0.8 \text{ servings} \times 500 \text{ grams/serving} = 400 \text{ grams} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 400 grams."
"First, let's determine the cost of making the candles. Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax and wicks for every 10 candles. For 20 candles, he will need 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks. The cost for 2 pounds is $10.00.

Next, let's calculate the revenue from selling 20 candles. Each candle is sold for $2.00, so the total revenue from 20 candles is:
\[ 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00 \text{ per candle} = \$40.00 \]

Now, we can calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ \text{Net Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} \]
\[ \text{Net Profit} = \$40.00 - \$10.00 = \$30.00 \]

So, the net profit if Charlie makes and sells 20 candles is:
\[ \$30.00 \]"
"To calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of articles written on each day.
2. Calculate the total number of hours spent writing articles over the three days.

**Step 1: Determine the number of articles written on each day.**

- **Monday:** Meredith wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday:** She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. So, the number of articles on Tuesday is:
  \[
  5 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 5 \right) = 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ articles}
  \]
- **Wednesday:** She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, the number of articles on Wednesday is:
  \[

The total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days is 104 hours."
"Candice started with 80 post-it notes and ended up with 23 post-it notes after placing one on each of 220 different cups of coffee. This means she used 220 post-it notes for the coffee cups. 

The total number of post-it notes used and remaining is 23, so the number of post-it notes she purchased at the store is the difference between the post-it notes she had before and the post-it notes she had after the purchase.

Let's denote the number of post-it notes in the package she purchased as \( x \).

The equation representing the situation is:
\[ 80 - x + 220 = 23 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 220 + 80 - x = 23 \]
\[ 300 - x = 23 \]
\[ x = 300 - 23 \]
\[ x = 277 \]

So, the number of post-it notes in the package that she purchased is 277."
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Given that each blue tie costs $40 and he spent a total of $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of each red tie. Since red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, the cost of each red tie is:

\[ \text{Cost per red tie} = \text{Cost per blue tie} \times (1 + 0.50) = 40 \times 1.50 = 60 \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

Finally, the total amount John spent on ties is the sum of the cost of the blue ties and the cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total spent on ties} = \text{Total spent on blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 800 \]"
"First, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches because the pieces are measured in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot.

So, the wire is 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches long.

Next, we divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece to find out how many pieces Tracy obtained.

48 inches / 6 inches/piece = 8 pieces.

"First, we need to find the total number of units in the building. Since there are 15 floors and each floor contains 8 units, the total number of units is:

\[ 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units/floor} = 120 \text{ units} \]

Next, we need to find out how many units are occupied. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is:

\[ 120 \text{ units} \times \frac{3}{4} = 90 \text{ units} \]

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

\[ 120 \text{ units} - 90 \text{ units} = 30 \text{ units} \]

So, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"First, we need to determine how many dozens of eggs Lloyd gets per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs per day by 12:

\[ \frac{252 \text{ eggs/day}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 21 \text{ dozen/day} \]

Next, we calculate how much money Lloyd makes per day by selling the eggs at $2 per dozen:

\[ 21 \text{ dozen/day} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 42 \text{ dollars/day} \]

To find out how much Lloyd makes in a week, we multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in a week (7 days):

\[ 42 \text{ dollars/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 294 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 294."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Tom to travel back from his destination. We know his speed on the return trip is 6 mph, but we need to know the distance he traveled to get to his destination first.

From 1 to 4 PM, Tom travels for 3 hours at a speed of 10 mph. The distance he covers is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, he travels back at a speed of 6 mph. The time it takes to travel back is:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{mph}} = 5 \, \text{hours} \]

So, the time it takes him to get back is 5 hours."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, and he removes 30 comic books.

\[ \text{Total weight of comic books} = 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. So, the remaining weight that needs to be removed is:

\[ \text{Remaining weight to be removed} = 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[ \text{Number of toys to be removed} = \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

"To determine the revenue for each day, we need to calculate the total charges for the truck and car tires repaired.

**Thursday:**
- Revenue from truck tires: \(6 \text{ tires} \times \$60/\text{tire} = \$360\)
- Revenue from car tires: \(4 \text{ tires} \times \$40/\text{tire} = \$160\)
- Total revenue on Thursday: \(\$360 + \$160 = \$520\)

**Friday:**
- Revenue from car tires: \(12 \text{ tires} \times \$40/\text{tire} = \$480\)
- Revenue from truck tires: \(0 \text{ tires} \times \$60/\text{tire} = \$0\)
- Total revenue on Friday: \(\$480 + \$0 = \$480\)

Now, we compare the total revenues:
- Thursday's revenue: \$520
- Friday's revenue: \$480

The difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday is:

\[ \text{Number of kittens Patchy has had} = 3 \times \text{Number of kittens Trixie has had} = 3 \times 12 = 36 \]

Next, we add the number of adopted kittens to the number of kittens Patchy has had:
\[ \text{Total number of adopted kittens} = 7 \]
\[ \text{Total number of Patchy's kittens} = 36 \]
\[ \text{Total number of kittens} = \text{Total number of adopted kittens} + \text{Total number of Patchy's kittens} = 7 + 36 = 43 \]

Therefore, the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has is:
\[ 43 \]"

Therefore, Peter can go to the movies 3 times with his budget of $42."
"First, we need to determine the maximum allowable weight of the boxes that can be added to the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit. The bridge can carry no more than 5000 pounds. We already know the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. Therefore, the maximum weight that can be added to the truck is:

\[ 5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds} \]

Each box weighs 15 pounds. To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we divide the maximum allowable weight of the boxes by the weight of one box:

\[ \frac{1245}{15} = 83 \]

Since 83 is a whole number, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83. Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 20 years and the last 10 years.

1. For the first 20 years, Marcy receives a fixed annual pension of $50,000.
2. After 20 years, she starts receiving 5% of the value of her pension each year. The value of her pension at the start of the 21st year is $50,000.

Let's calculate the annual pension for the last 10 years, starting from the 21st year.

The value of her pension at the start of the 21st year is $50,000. Starting from the 21st year, she receives 5% of this value each year. So, the annual pension for the last 10 years is:

\[ \text{Annual pension for the last 10 years} = 50,000 \times 0.05 = 2,500 \]

Therefore, if Marcy quits after 30 years, her annual pension will be $2,500."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service over the course of the year.

First, let's determine the monthly cost for the second half of the year. The initial monthly cost is $140, and for the second half of the year, the cost is 10% less. 

10% of $140 is calculated as:
\[ 0.10 \times 140 = 14 \]

So, the cost for the second half of the year is:
\[ 140 - 14 = 126 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for the first half of the year. Since there are 6 months in a half-year, the total cost for the first half is:
\[ 140 \times 6 = 840 \]

For the second half of the year, the total cost is:
\[ 126 \times 6 = 756 \]

Finally, we add the costs of both halves of the year to find the total amount Aleena paid by the end of the year:
\[ 840 + 756 = 1596 \]

Therefore, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is:

"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to find out how many miles she can drive per gallon of gas. We know that she has traveled 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas. Therefore, the miles per gallon (mpg) can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Miles per gallon} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

Now that we know her car can travel 25 miles per gallon, we can calculate how many miles she can drive on a full tank of 12 gallons:

\[ \text{Miles per full tank} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 300 miles."
"First, let's determine how long Jim spends on TV and reading in one session. He spends 2 hours watching TV and then reads for half as long as he watches TV. Therefore, he spends:

\[ \text{Reading time} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, in one session, he spends:

\[ \text{Total time} = 2 \text{ hours (TV)} + 1 \text{ hour (reading)} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total time spent in one week is:

\[ \text{Total weekly time} = 3 \text{ hours/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week} \]

To find out how many hours he spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly total by 4:

\[ \text{Total time in 4 weeks} = 9 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 36 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 36 \]"
"To determine the total number of people sent by all the schools, we need to consider the players and coaches from both the girls' and boys' teams.

Each school sends:
- 5 players from the girls' team

  \[
  \text{Number of rubies} = 175 - 35 = 140
  \]
- The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies, so:
  \[
  \text{Number of emeralds} = 2 \times 140 = 280
  \]

Now, let's find the total number of gems by summing up the diamonds, rubies, and emeralds:
\[
\text{Total number of gems} = 175 + 140 + 280 = 595
\]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the five cell phones before interest:

\[ \text{Total cost of phones} = 5 \times \$150 = \$750 \]

Next, we calculate the interest on the total cost. The interest rate is 2% per unit:

\[ \text{Interest per phone} = \$150 \times 0.02 = \$3 \]

Since Shiela bought five phones, the total interest is:

\[ \text{Total interest} = 5 \times \$3 = \$15 \]

Now, we add the total interest to the total cost of the phones to get the total amount Shiela will pay:

\[ \text{Total amount to pay} = \$750 + \$15 = \$765 \]

Finally, we divide the total amount by the number of months (3 months) to find out how much Shiela will pay each month:

\[ \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{\$765}{3} = \$255 \]

So, Shiela will pay $255 each month for 3 months."

"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the initial salary: $600.
2. Calculate the 10% increase for the first year of the 10% increase policy.
3. Add the 10% increase to the initial salary to get the new salary after the first year.
4. Repeat the process for the next two years.

Let's start with the first year:

1. Initial salary = $600.
2. 10% increase = 10% of $600 = 0.10 * $600 = $60.
3. New salary after the first year = $600 + $60 = $660.

Now, we apply the 10% increase to the new salary for the second year:

1. Salary after the first year = $660.
2. 10% increase = 10% of $660 = 0.10 * $660 = $66.
3. New salary after the second year = $660 + $66 = $726.

Finally, we apply the 10% increase to the new salary for the third year:

1. Salary after the second year = $726.
2. 10% increase = 10% of $726 = 0.10 * $726 = $72.60.
3. New salary after the third year = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60.

Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service will be $798.60."
"Let's denote the number of copies Harald's record sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn's record sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both Marilyn and Harald is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

The final numerical answer is 8,000."

"To solve this problem, let's define the ages of the kids using variables:

- Let \( J \) be Jackson's age.
- Then Amy's age is \( J + 5 \) (since Amy is 5 years older than Jackson).
- Corey's age is \( J + 5 + 2 = J + 7 \) (since Amy is 2 years younger than Corey).
- James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey's age is \( 10 + 1 = 11 \).

Since Corey's age is \( J + 7 \) and we know Corey's age is 11, we can set up the equation:
\[ J + 7 = 11 \]

Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 11 - 7 \]
\[ J = 4 \]

So, Jackson is 4 years old.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how fast Lee used to run the 400-meter hurdles. We know that Lee runs it 2 seconds faster than Gerald's new time. If Lee's new time is 38 seconds, then his old time was:

\[ 38 + 2 = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, we know that Gerald's new speed is 10% faster than his old speed. This means that if Gerald's old time was \( T \) seconds, his new time is \( 0.9T \) seconds. We know his new time is 38 seconds, so:

\[ 0.9T = 38 \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):

\[ T = \frac{38}{0.9} \]
\[ T = \frac{380}{9} \]
\[ T \approx 42.22 \text{ seconds} \]

So, Gerald's old time was approximately 42.22 seconds. With his improved diet, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Number of Dogs**: Given that there are 60 dogs.
2. **Number of Cats**: Since there are two cats for every dog, the number of cats is \(2 \times 60 = 120\).
3. **Number of Rabbits**: The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. The combined number of dogs and cats is \(60 + 120 = 180\). Therefore, the number of rabbits is \(180 - 12 = 168\).

Now, to find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits together:
\[ 60 + 120 + 168 = 348 \]

So, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348."
"First, let's find out how many boys and girls there are in Grade 5.

The total number of students is 200. Since 2/5 of the students are boys, the number of boys is:
\[ \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

Therefore, the number of girls is:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. Since 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout, the number of girls in the girl scout is:
\[ \text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[ \text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 40 \]"

\[ \text{Hours James slept} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 \]

\[ \text{Hours James slept} = 6 \]

Now, to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we subtract the hours James slept from the hours Harry slept:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Harry's sleep} - \text{James's sleep} \]

\[ \text{Difference} = 9 - 6 \]

\[ \text{Difference} = 3 \]

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the volume of tomatoes before cooking:**
   - The final sauce volume is 32 ounces.
   - The tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked.
   - Therefore, the volume of tomatoes before cooking is twice the volume of the sauce.
   - Volume of tomatoes before cooking = 32 ounces * 2 = 64 ounces.

2. **Determine the number of tomatoes:**
   - Each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes.
   - To find out how many 16-ounce cans are needed to get 64 ounces of tomatoes, we divide the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of one can.
   - Number of 16-ounce cans = 64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans.
   - Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes is:
   - Total number of tomatoes = 4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes.

Therefore, Freda used 12 tomatoes.

The final numerical answer is:

Next, Mary will give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges tomorrow. So, she will give away:

\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Now, to find out how many potted plants Mary will remain with, we subtract the number of plants she will give away from the number of plants she currently has:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

So, the final number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:

\[ 40 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Friend**: The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. **Second Friend**: The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. Therefore, the second friend pressed the doorbell \(20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25\) times.
3. **Fourth Friend**: The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. **Third Friend**: The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. Therefore, the third friend pressed the doorbell \(60 + 10 = 70\) times.

Now, we sum up all the doorbell presses:

- First friend: 20 times
- Second friend: 25 times
- Third friend: 70 times
- Fourth friend: 60 times

Total doorbell presses = \(20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175\)

The final numerical answer is 175."
"First, let's calculate the total number of pages Solo needs to read:

- Science: 4 pages
- Social Studies: 20 pages
- History: 7 pages
- Geography: 8 pages

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday. Therefore, the remaining pages he needs to read are:

Remaining pages = Total pages - Pages read on Monday
Remaining pages = 39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read, on average, in one day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days left:

Pages per day = Remaining pages / Number of days left
Pages per day = 24 / 4 = 6 pages

So, Solo needs to read, on average, 6 pages per day."
"To determine how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to break down his water consumption by weekdays and weekends.

John drinks water with each meal on weekdays (Monday through Friday):
- Breakfast
- Lunch
- Dinner
- Before bed

That's 4 glasses of water per day on weekdays.

So for 5 weekdays:
\[ 4 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ glasses} \]

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he drinks a soda with dinner instead of water:
- Dinner

That's 1 glass of water per day on weekends.

So for 2 weekend days:
\[ 1 \text{ glass/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 2 \text{ glasses} \]

Adding the glasses of water from weekdays and weekends:
\[ 20 \text{ glasses} + 2 \text{ glasses} = 22 \text{ glasses} \]

Therefore, the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is 22."
"To determine how many minutes it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total distance the fog bank needs to cover.
2. Calculate the rate at which the fog bank covers the city.
3. Use the rate to find the total time required to cover the entire city.

First, the total distance the fog bank needs to cover is the length of the city, which is 42 miles.

Next, we know that the fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. Therefore, the rate of coverage is:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{3 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

To find the total time required to cover 42 miles, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Rate}} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{\frac{3 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} = 42 \times \frac{10}{3} = 140 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the fog bank will take 140 minutes to cover the whole city.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner volume of one box and then multiply it by 3.

Each box has outer dimensions of 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. The walls are 1 inch thick, so the inner dimensions of each box are:
- Length: 5 inches - 2 * 1 inch = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - 2 * 1 inch = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - 1 inch = 3 inches

The inner volume of one box is:
\[ \text{Inner Volume} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} = 3 \times 4 \times 3 = 36 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume is:
\[ \text{Total Inner Volume} = 3 \times 36 = 108 \text{ cubic inches} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, let's break down the hours he spent watching TV each day:

- Monday and Tuesday: 1 hour each day, so 2 hours in total.
- Thursday: 1 hour for a 1-hour episode and 0.5 hours (30 minutes) for a 30-minute episode, totaling 1.5 hours.
- Friday: 2 hours for two 1-hour episodes.

Now, let's add up the hours for Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday:
\[ 2 \text{ (Monday and Tuesday)} + 1.5 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Friday)} = 5.5 \text{ hours} \]

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. So, the hours he spent watching TV on Wednesday is:
\[ 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 \text{ hours} \]

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is:
\[ \frac{1.5}{0.5} = 3 \]

Therefore, the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday is 3."
"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry meant to bake as \( x \). According to the problem, he actually baked twice as many as he meant to, plus 15 more cookies. So, the number of cookies he actually baked is \( 2x + 15 \).

After baking, he drops 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \). We are given that he now has 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 50 \]

So, Henry meant to bake 50 cookies. Since he actually baked twice as many as he meant to, plus 15 more, he baked \( 2 \times 50 + 15 = 115 \) cookies. However, the question asks for the number of cookies he baked last year, which is the number he meant to bake, \( x \).

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate, we first need to calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups each of them ate.

Marcell's fruit roll-ups:
Width: 3 roll-ups
Length: 14 roll-ups
Total for Marcell = 3 * 14 = 42 roll-ups

Beatrice's fruit roll-ups:
Width: 2 roll-ups
Length: 24 roll-ups
Total for Beatrice = 2 * 24 = 48 roll-ups

Now, we add the total number of fruit roll-ups they both ate:
Total roll-ups = 42 + 48 = 90 roll-ups

To find the average, we divide the total number of roll-ups by the number of people (which is 2):
Average = 90 / 2 = 45 roll-ups

The final numerical answer is 45."
"First, let's determine the speed at which Julia rows the boat. It took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Therefore, her rowing speed is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet per second} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it took Julia to row the entire 64 seconds distance to the shore:

\[ \text{Time to row 64 seconds} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds per 20 feet}} = 4 \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. To find out how much water the boat took on during the 80 feet row, we can set up a proportion:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = \frac{x \text{ liters}}{80 \text{ feet}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{2 \text{ liters} \times 80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

So, the boat took on 16 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore."

"First, let's determine the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold. Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, and Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, we can set up the following equation to find the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold:

\[ 6 \times \text{Number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold} = 1800 \]

Solving for the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold:

\[ \text{Number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold} = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \]

Next, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let's denote the number of birds in Jamal's photograph as \( B \). Therefore, we can write:

\[ 300 = B \times 50 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \]

Thus, the number of ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is 6.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the leftover lumber Sasha has:

- Five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at $16 each: \(5 \times 16 = $80\)

Total cost of the leftover lumber: \(100 + 80 = $180\)

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the leftover lumber:

- Ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards at $15 each (assuming the price has increased by 50% from $10 to $15): \(10 \times 15 = $150\)
- Five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at $24 each (assuming the price has increased by 50% from $16 to $24): \(5 \times 24 = $120\)

Total revenue from selling the leftover lumber: \(150 + 120 = $270\)

Finally, let's calculate the profit:

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $270 - $180 = $90

The final numerical answer is $90."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the ratio and how it applies to the total amount of sugar and water used.

The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total number of parts is 7 + 13 = 20 parts.

Given that the total amount of sugar and water used is 120 parts, we can find out how many parts correspond to the sugar by using the ratio. The sugar part of the ratio is 7 out of the total 20 parts.

To find the number of parts of sugar, we calculate:
\[ \text{Number of parts of sugar} = \frac{7}{20} \times 120 \]

Now, let's perform the calculation:
\[ \text{Number of parts of sugar} = \frac{7 \times 120}{20} = \frac{840}{20} = 42 \]

Therefore, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used is 42."

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
2. Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's salary.
3. Four years later, Adrien's salary was 40 percent more than what he was making four years ago.
4. Adrien and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously.

First, let's find Lylah's salary four years ago. Since Adrien's salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Adrien's salary} = \text{Lylah's salary} \times 1.30 \]

Given Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000:

\[ 40,000 = \text{Lylah's salary} \times 1.30 \]

Solving for Lylah's salary:

\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = \frac{40,000}{1.30} \]

\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = 30,769.23 \]

Now, let's calculate Adrien's salary four years later. Since his salary increased by 40 percent:

\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40,000 \times 1.40 \]

\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 56,000 \]

Since Adrien and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously, Lylah's salary four years later would also be 40 percent higher than her salary four years ago:

\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30,769.23 \times 1.40 \]

\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 43,076.92 \]

Finally, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is the sum of their new salaries:

\[ \text{Total salary} = \text{Adrien's new salary} + \text{Lylah's new salary} \]

\[ \text{Total salary} = 56,000 + 43,076.92 \]

\[ \text{Total salary} = 99,076.92 \]

So, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is $99,076.92."

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits each person brought:

- Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, so she brought \(5 + 8 = 13\) fruits in total.
- Kael brought 10 apples and 4 oranges, so he brought \(10 + 4 = 14\) fruits in total.

Finally, to find the total number of fruits they brought together, we add Morisette's and Kael's totals:

\[13 + 14 = 27\]

So, the total number of fruits they have is 27."

"First, let's determine the cost of each type of fruit based on the given information:

1. Each pepper costs $15.
2. A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, so a watermelon costs \(3 \times 15 = 45\) dollars.
3. An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs, so an orange costs \(45 - 5 = 40\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the items Dillon is buying:

- The cost for 4 watermelons is \(4 \times 45 = 180\) dollars.
- The cost for 20 peppers is \(20 \times 15 = 300\) dollars.
- The cost for 10 oranges is \(10 \times 40 = 400\) dollars.

"First, let's calculate the total number of patient hours seen in a day. Since each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes, we can convert this to hours:

\[ 24 \text{ minutes} = \frac{24}{60} \text{ hours} = 0.4 \text{ hours} \]

The hospital sees 500 people a day, so the total patient hours per day is:

\[ 500 \text{ patients/day} \times 0.4 \text{ hours/patient} = 200 \text{ hours/day} \]

Next, we calculate the revenue generated by the hospital from these patient hours. The hospital charges $200 per hour:

\[ 200 \text{ hours/day} \times 200 \text{ dollars/hour} = 40,000 \text{ dollars/day} \]

Now, we calculate the cost incurred by the hospital from these patient hours. The doctors charge $150 per hour:

\[ 200 \text{ hours/day} \times 150 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30,000 \text{ dollars/day} \]

Finally, the profit is the difference between the revenue and the cost:

\[ 40,000 \text{ dollars/day} - 30,000 \text{ dollars/day} = 10,000 \text{ dollars/day} \]

So, the hospital makes a profit of $10,000 per day."

$15.00 (subs) + $3.00 (chips) + $2.00 (cookies) = $20.00

The delivery fee is 20% of the total cost of the items:
20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00

Adding the delivery fee to the total cost of the items:
$20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Finally, adding the tip:
$24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

So, the total cost of Rory's delivery order is $29.00."
"First, let's calculate how many questions Mark could have completed in the given time for each test.

For the first test:
- Time available: 8 hours
- Rate: 5 questions per hour
- Questions completed: \( 8 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ questions/hour} = 40 \text{ questions} \)

For the second test:
- Time available: 6 hours
- Rate: 5 questions per hour
- Questions completed: \( 6 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ questions/hour} = 30 \text{ questions} \)

Now, let's calculate the number of questions left incomplete for each test.

For the first test:
- Total questions: 75

- Questions left incomplete: \( 75 - 40 = 35 \text{ questions} \)

For the second test:
- Total questions: 100
- Questions completed: 30
- Questions left incomplete: \( 100 - 30 = 70 \text{ questions} \)

Finally, let's add the questions left incomplete from both tests to get the total number of questions left incomplete.

Total questions left incomplete: \( 35 + 70 = 105 \)

The final numerical answer is 105."
"Let's denote the number of blue gumballs as \( B \) and the number of pink gumballs as \( P \).

According to the problem, we have:
\[ P = 4B + 22 \]

Given that there are 12 blue gumballs:
\[ B = 12 \]

Now, substitute \( B \) with 12 in the equation:
\[ P = 4(12) + 22 \]
\[ P = 48 + 22 \]
\[ P = 70 \]

So, the number of pink gumballs is 70."
"First, we need to determine the number of semi-automatic cars. We know there are 20 cars in total, 12 of which are automatic and 4 are manual. Therefore, the number of semi-automatic cars is:

\[ 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 \]

Next, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of the cars that are semi-automatic is 20%."
"Let's denote the number of queens as \( Q \), the number of baby bees as \( B \), and the number of worker bees as \( W \).

According to the problem:
1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so \( W = 2B \).
2. There are twice as many baby bees as queens, so \( B = 2Q \).
3. The total number of bees is 700, so \( W + B + Q = 700 \).

First, we can express \( W \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Q \):
- Since \( B = 2Q \), then \( W = 2B = 2(2Q) = 4Q \).

Now, substituting \( W \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Q \) into the total number of bees equation:
\[ 4Q + 2Q + Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees and worker bees:
- Number of baby bees \( B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200 \).
- Number of worker bees \( W = 4Q = 4(100) = 400 \).

So, the number of worker bees is \( 400 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 400 \]"

"First, let's calculate the total cost of nonfood items before tax:

- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

Total cost of nonfood items = $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $15

Next, we calculate the tax on the nonfood items. The tax rate is 10%, so the tax amount is:

Tax amount = 10% of $15 = 0.10 * $15 = $1.50

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of nonfood items to get the final cost:

Final cost = Total cost of nonfood items + Tax amount = $15 + $1.50 = $16.50

The final numerical answer is $16.50."
"First, let's calculate the total number of clients Kim will have:
- Current clients: 3
- Potential clients: 5
- Total clients: 3 + 5 = 8

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the supplies for one client:
- Cost of bleach per client: 2 bottles * $2/bottle = $4
- Cost of cloths per client: 1 pack * $5/pack = $5
- Total cost per client: $4 + $5 = $9

Now, let's calculate the total cost for all clients:
- Total cost for 8 clients: 8 * $9 = $72

Kim's total income each week is $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:

"To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of harvests John can have in a year.
2. Determine the total number of pineapples harvested based on the number of harvests.

First, since John harvests his pineapples every 3 months, we can calculate the number of harvests in a year:
- There are 12 months in a year.
- John harvests every 3 months, so the number of harvests in a year is \( \frac{12}{3} = 4 \) harvests.

Next, we know that John has 100 pineapples per hectare and he has 10 hectares:
- The total number of pineapples per hectare per harvest is 100.
- The total number of pineapples per hectare per year is \( 100 \times 4 = 400 \) pineapples.
- Since John has 10 hectares, the total number of pineapples harvested in a year is \( 400 \times 10 = 4000 \) pineapples.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the number of pieces in the second lego set. Since it has 3 times more pieces than the 500-piece set, we multiply 500 by 3:

\[ 500 \times 3 = 1500 \]

Next, we calculate the number of pieces in the third lego set. This set has 1/4 the number of pieces as the 500-piece set, so we divide 500 by 4:

\[ 500 \div 4 = 125 \]

Now, we add up all the pieces from the three sets to find the total number of lego pieces Johnny has to pick up:

\[ 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125 \]

So, the total number of lego pieces Johnny picks up is 2125."
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of 30 bees return to the hive, which is 15 bees.
3. In the following 6 hours, twice as many bees leave the hive as left in the first 6 hours, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.
4. In the final 6 hours, all the bees that left in the first 3 sets of 6 hours return to the hive.

Now, let's calculate the number of bees that return in the last 6 hours:

- In the first 6 hours, 30 bees left.
- In the next 6 hours, 60 bees left.
- In the following 6 hours, 60 bees left.

So, in total, 30 + 60 + 60 = 150 bees left the hive.

Since 15 bees returned in the second 6 hours, the number of bees that left but haven't returned yet is 150 - 15 = 135 bees.

In the final 6 hours, all 135 bees that left return to the hive.

Therefore, the number of bees that Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours is 135."
"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the admission tickets and then add the change she received.

The cost of an adult ticket is $12 and the cost of a child ticket is $10. Therefore, the total cost for 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket is:
\[ 12 + 10 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

Brittany's mom received $8 in change. This means the amount of money she gave the cashier is the total cost plus the change:
\[ 22 + 8 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier is:
\[ 30 \text{ dollars} \]"
"First, let's determine how many friends Dorothy has. We know that Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy. If Charlie has 12 friends, we can set up the equation:

\[ 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} = 12 \]

To find Dorothy's number of friends, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ \text{Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can determine how many friends James has. We know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. So, we set up the equation:

\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

Therefore, James has 16 Facebook friends. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 16 \]"
"First, we need to convert the distance from miles to feet because the speeds are given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance in feet:
\[ 3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet} \]

Tim's distance in feet:
\[ 2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each to reach home.

Time for Steve to reach home:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

Time for Tim to reach home:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

The winner (Steve) will be waiting at his house for the loser (Tim) for:

"To calculate the total amount Shawnda made, we need to determine the cost of inflating the tires for each type of vehicle and then sum these costs.

For the bicycles:
- Each bicycle has 2 tires.
- Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
- 5 people came with bicycles, so 5 bicycles * 2 tires/bicycle = 10 tires.
- The cost for inflating the tires of the bicycles is 10 tires * 25 cents/tire = 250 cents.

For the tricycles:
- Each tricycle has 3 tires.
- 3 people came with tricycles, so 3 tricycles * 3 tires/tricycle = 9 tires.
- The cost for inflating the tires of the tricycles is 9 tires * 25 cents/tire = 225 cents.

For the unicycle:
- A unicycle has 1 tire.
- 1 person came with a unicycle, so 1 tire.
- The cost for inflating the tire of the unicycle is 1 tire * 25 cents/tire = 25 cents.

Now, we sum the costs:
- Total cost = 250 cents (bicycles) + 225 cents (tricycles) + 25 cents (unicycle) = 500 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100:
- Total cost in dollars = 500 cents / 100 = 5 dollars.

Therefore, the total amount Shawnda made that day is 5 dollars."

"Let's denote the initial number of french fries in the pack as \( x \).

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
4. After the pigeons, the number of fries left is \( x - 14 - 7 - 9 = x - 20 \).
5. The raccoon then ate two thirds of the remaining fries, so it ate \( \frac{2}{3}(x - 20) \) fries, leaving \( \frac{1}{3}(x - 20) \) fries.
6. Ants carried off a final french fry, leaving 5 fries. So, we have:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3}(x - 20) - 1 = 5
   \]
7. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{3}(x - 20) - 1 = 5 \implies \frac{1}{3}(x - 20) = 6 \implies x - 20 = 18 \implies x = 38

Therefore, the initial number of french fries in the pack was 38."
"To calculate the total hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly class schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has three 1-hour classes each day. So, for these three days, he spends:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ classes/day} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes each day. So, for these two days, he spends:
\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ classes/day} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Adding these together gives the total hours spent on classes in one week:
\[ 9 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours/week} \]

Since there are 16 weeks in the semester, the total hours spent on classes in one semester is:
\[ 17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 272 hours."
"First, let's convert all the lengths to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll use inches for this purpose.

Each roll is 4 inches long, and Bill bakes 300 rolls every day. So, the total length of the rolls in inches is:
\[ 300 \text{ rolls} \times 4 \text{ inches/roll} = 1200 \text{ inches} \]

Each croissant is 6 inches long, and Bill bakes 120 croissants every day. So, the total length of the croissants in inches is:
\[ 120 \text{ croissants} \times 6 \text{ inches/croissant} = 720 \text{ inches} \]

Each baguette is 2 feet long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is:
\[ 2 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 24 \text{ inches} \]
Bill bakes 60 baguettes every day. So, the total length of the baguettes in inches is:
\[ 60 \text{ baguettes} \times 24 \text{ inches/baguette} = 1440 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we add the lengths of all the baked goods together to get the total length in inches:
\[ 1200 \text{ inches} + 720 \text{ inches} + 1440 \text{ inches} = 3360 \text{ inches} \]

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[ \frac{3360 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 280 \text{ feet} \]

So, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is 280 feet."
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order to last for 2 months, we first need to calculate the total number of bananas required by all the apes in one month and then multiply that by 2.

- Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
- Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
- Baboons need 100 bananas per month.

So, the total number of bananas needed per month is:
\[ 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 \text{ bananas per month} \]

For 2 months, the total number of bananas needed is:

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"To determine how far Blake and Kelly each run, we need to calculate the total distance each of them covers.

First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs:
- Blake runs back and forth 15 times.
- Each round trip is 200 yards (100 yards to the end and 100 yards back).
- Total distance for Blake = 15 * 200 yards = 3000 yards.

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs:
- Kelly runs back and forth once, covering 200 yards.
- Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards (40 yards to the 40-yard line and 40 yards back).
- Total distance for Kelly = 200 yards + 80 yards * 34 = 200 + 2720 = 2920 yards.

Now, we compare the distances:
- Blake runs 3000 yards.
- Kelly runs 2920 yards.

The difference in distance between the winner and the loser is:
- 3000 yards - 2920 yards = 80 yards.

The final numerical answer is 80 yards."

"First, let's calculate the number of each type of fish caught by Locsin:

- Starfish: Anakin caught 10 starfish, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.
- Sea horses: Anakin caught 6 sea horses, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
- Clownfish: Anakin caught 3 clownfish, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fish caught by each:

- Anakin's total: 10 starfish + 6 sea horses + 3 clownfish = 19 fish.
- Locsin's total: 5 starfish + 3 sea horses + 5 clownfish = 13 fish.

Finally, the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin together is:

19 (Anakin's fish) + 13 (Locsin's fish) = 32 fish.

The final numerical answer is 32."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the price increase step by step over the 36 months. The price increases by 20% every two months. Let's break it down:

1. **Initial Price**: $20
2. **Price after 2 months**: The price increases by 20% of $20.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 20 \times \frac{20}{100} = 4
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 20 + 4 = 24
   \]
3. **Price after 4 months**: The price increases by 20% of $24.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 24 \times \frac{20}{100} = 4.8
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 24 + 4.8 = 28.8
   \]
4. **Price after 6 months**: The price increases by 20% of $28.8.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 28.8 \times \frac{20}{100} = 5.76
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 28.8 + 5.76 = 34.56
   \]
5. **Price after 8 months**: The price increases by 20% of $34.56.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 34.56 \times \frac{20}{100} = 6.912
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 34.56 + 6.912 = 41.472
   \]
6. **Price after 10 months**: The price increases by 20% of $41.472.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 41.472 \times \frac{20}{100} = 8.2944
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 41.472 + 8.2944 = 49.7664
   \]
7. **Price after 12 months**: The price increases by 20% of $49.7664.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 49.7664 \times \frac{20}{100} = 9.95328
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 49.7664 + 9.95328 = 59.71968
   \]

We can see that the price increases by 20% every two months. To generalize, after \( n \) two-month periods, the price will be:
\[
\text{Price after } n \text{ two-month periods} = 20 \times (1 + 0.20)^n
\]

For 36 months, there are 18 two-month periods:
\[
\text{Price after 36 months} = 20 \times (1 + 0.20)^{18}
\]

Now, we calculate \( (1 + 0.20)^{18} \):
\[
(1.20)^{18} \approx 10.488
\]

Thus, the price after 36 months is:
\[
\text{Price after 36 months} = 20 \times 10.488 = 209.76
\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{209.76}

"First, let's determine the cost of one red car. According to the problem, one red car costs $4.

Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and an action figure costs $5, the cost of 3 action figures is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]
Therefore, the doll costs $15.

Now, we know the cost of one red car is $4 and the doll is $15. We need to find the total cost of all the toys:
\[ \text{Cost of red cars} + \text{Cost of action figures} + \text{Cost of doll} \]
\[ 5 \times 4 + 3 \times 5 + 15 \]
\[ 20 + 15 + 15 = 50 \]

So, the total value of all the toys is $50."

Total cost of accessories: €435

Money left for clothing = €1500 - €435 = €1065

So, the final numerical answer is €1065."
"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit to make 15 Spanish flans, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs required. Since each flan requires 3 eggs, for 15 flans, the total number of eggs needed is:

\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we know that each babysitting session provides 9 eggs. To find out how many babysitting sessions are needed to get 45 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs required by the number of eggs provided per babysitting session:

\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysitting sessions} \]

Thus, Sandra has to babysit 5 times to gather the required 45 eggs for making 15 Spanish flans."
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write:
\[ S = 2B \]

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write:
\[ (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \]

Substituting \( S = 2B \) into the equation, we get:
\[ (B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28 \]
\[ 3B + 4 = 28 \]

Subtract 4 from both sides:
\[ 3B = 24 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ B = 8 \]

Now, we can find Seth's current age using \( S = 2B \):
\[ S = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 16 \]"
"To find out how much money Jimmy has, we can set up an equation based on the information given:

Let \( J \) be the amount of money Jimmy has, and \( E \) be the amount of money Ethel has. According to the problem, we know that:

\[ J = 2E + 2 \]

We are also given that Ethel has $8, so:

\[ E = 8 \]

Now we can substitute the value of \( E \) into the equation to find \( J \):

\[ J = 2(8) + 2 \]
\[ J = 16 + 2 \]
\[ J = 18 \]

So, Jimmy has $18."
"To calculate the total miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to consider his daily walking distance and the number of days he walks that distance.

From Monday to Friday, he walks 20 miles each day. So for 5 days, he walks:
\[ 20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles} \]

On Saturday and Sunday, he walks 10 miles each day. So for 2 days, he walks:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Adding these together gives the total miles walked in a week:
\[ 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 120 miles."
"First, let's determine the cost of each item:
- The cost of the hat is $25.
- The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat, so it is \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.
- The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket, so it is \(\frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50\) dollars.

Now, to find the total cost of each uniform, we add the cost of the hat, the jacket, and the pants:
- Total cost = Cost of hat + Cost of jacket + Cost of pants
- Total cost = $25 + $75 + $50 = $150

So, the total cost of each uniform is $150."
"To find the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to calculate the legs from each group of creatures separately and then sum them up.

For the spiders:
\[ 80 \text{ spiders} \times 8 \text{ legs per spider} = 640 \text{ legs} \]

For the insects:
\[ 90 \text{ insects} \times 6 \text{ legs per insect} = 540 \text{ legs} \]

For the rare mutant invertebrates:
\[ 3 \text{ invertebrates} \times 10 \text{ legs per invertebrate} = 30 \text{ legs} \]

Now, we sum the legs from all groups:
\[ 640 \text{ legs} + 540 \text{ legs} + 30 \text{ legs} = 1210 \text{ legs} \]

So, the total number of legs Jake sees is:
\[ 1210 \]"
"First, let's establish the ages based on the information given:

1. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, we can calculate the total age of the four birds:

\[ \text{Total age} = \text{Age of Caboose} + \text{Age of Sally Two} + \text{Age of Granny Red} + \text{Age of Sally Four} \]

Since the age of the Caboose is not specified, we will assume it is 0 for the purpose of calculating the total age of the birds:

\[ \text{Total age} = 0 + 19 + 16 + 8 = 43 \]

So, the total age of the four birds is 43."
"First, we need to calculate the increased minimum payments for each of Jessica's debts.

For the student loans:
$300 * 1.5 = $450

For the credit card:
$200 * 1.5 = $300

For the mortgage:
$500 * 1.5 = $750

Next, we add these amounts to find the total monthly payment:
$450 + $300 + $750 = $1500

To find the annual payment, we multiply the monthly payment by 12:
$1500 * 12 = $18000

So, the final numerical answer is $18000."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes Billy to peel one potato and the time it takes to cut one potato. 

- Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
- Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

Since there are 60 potatoes, we can calculate the total time for each task separately and then sum them up.

- Total time to peel 60 potatoes: \(60 \times 1.5\) minutes
- Total time to cut 60 potatoes: \(60 \times 5\) seconds

Let's convert the total cutting time to minutes to add it to the total peeling time.

- Total time to peel 60 potatoes: \(60 \times 1.5 = 90\) minutes
- Total time to cut 60 potatoes: \(60 \times 5 = 300\) seconds. Converting 300 seconds to minutes: \(300 \div 60 = 5\) minutes

Now, let's add the total peeling time and the total cutting time to get the final time.

- Total time to finish prepping the potatoes: \(90 + 5 = 95\) minutes

The final numerical answer is 95 minutes."
"First, let's calculate the total revenue from selling lemonade. They sell 20 glasses per gallon at $0.50 per glass, so the revenue per gallon is:
\[ 20 \text{ glasses/gallon} \times \$0.50/\text{glass} = \$10/\text{gallon} \]

Given that their profit is $25, we can express the profit as the total revenue minus the total cost. Let's denote the number of gallons they made as \( x \). The total revenue is then:
\[ \$10 \times x \]

The total cost is the cost of lemons and sugar. The cost of lemons is $3 per gallon and the cost of sugar is $2 per gallon, so the total cost per gallon is:
\[ \$3 + \$2 = \$5/\text{gallon} \]
Thus, the total cost for \( x \) gallons is:
\[ \$5 \times x \]

The profit is given by the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ \$10x - \$5x = \$25 \]
\[ \$5x = \$25 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, they made 5 gallons of lemonade. The cost of lemons for 5 gallons is:
\[ \$3 \times 5 = \$15 \]

Therefore, the amount they spent on lemons is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, we need to determine the number of Chinese participants in the race. Given that there are 240 Asians in total and 80 of them are Japanese, the number of Chinese participants is:

\[ 240 - 80 = 160 \]

Next, we know that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants:

\[ 160 - 60 = 100 \]

So, the number of girls on the Chinese team is 100."
"First, let's calculate how much Zaid spends on rent, car fuel, and the remaining amount after these expenses.

Zaid's salary is 6000$ per month.

Rent: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \) dollars.
Car fuel: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \) dollars.

Total spent on rent and car fuel: \( 1500 + 2000 = 3500 \) dollars.

Remaining amount after rent and car fuel: \( 6000 - 3500 = 2500 \) dollars.

Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity:
Donation to charity: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \) dollars.

Remaining amount after donation to charity: \( 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \) dollars.

Zaid gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$:
Total given to daughter and wife: \( 200 + 700 = 900 \) dollars.

Remaining amount after giving to daughter and wife: \( 1250 - 900 = 350 \) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is 350 dollars."
"First, let's determine the number of crabs each person has:

Bo has 40 crabs.

Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ crabs} \]

Rani has ten more crabs than Monic, so Rani has:
\[ 36 + 10 = 46 \text{ crabs} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of crabs the three have together:

"To calculate Lloyd's earnings for the first two weeks, we need to multiply the number of hours he tutored each week by his hourly rate and then sum the results.

For the first week:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$50 \]

For the second week:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$80 \]

Adding the earnings from both weeks:
\[ \$50 + \$80 = \$130 \]

So, Lloyd earned a total of \$130 for the first two weeks."
"To find the number of votes the loser got, we first need to determine the number of votes the winner received. Since the winner got \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the votes, we can calculate this as follows:

Votes for the winner = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 80 \)

Let's calculate this value.
```python
# Total number of votes
total_votes = 80

# Votes for the winner
votes_winner = (3/4) * total_votes
votes_winner
```
```output
60.0
```
The winner received 60 votes. Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser received is:

Votes for the loser = Total votes - Votes for the winner

Let's calculate this.
```python
# Votes for the loser
votes_loser = total_votes - votes_winner
votes_loser
```
```output
NameError: name 'total_votes' is not defined
```
It seems there was an issue with the variable reference. Let me re-calculate the number of votes the loser received directly using the total votes and the votes for the winner.

Votes for the loser = 80 - 60

Let's perform this calculation.
```python
# Recalculating the votes for the loser
votes_loser = 80 - votes_winner
votes_loser
```
```output
NameError: name 'votes_winner' is not defined
```
It appears there was an issue with the variable reference again. Let me directly compute the number of votes the loser received without referencing the intermediate variable.

Votes for the loser = 80 - 60

Let's calculate this.
```python
# Direct calculation of votes for the loser
votes_loser = 80 - 60
votes_loser
```
```output
NameError: name 'votes_loser' is not defined
```
The number of votes the loser received is \( 20 \).

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[

"Let's denote the number of white carnations Sandra ordered as \( C \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, so the number of red roses is \( 4C \).
2. Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which are five times the number of white carnations, so \( 5C = 200 \).

First, we solve for \( C \) using the equation \( 5C = 200 \):
\[ C = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Now that we know \( C = 40 \), we can find the number of red roses:
\[ \text{Number of red roses} = 4C = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 160 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Mark's age two years ago:**
   - Jan's current age is 30.
   - Two years ago, Jan's age was \(30 - 2 = 28\).
   - According to the problem, two years ago Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time.
   - Half of Jan's age two years ago was \(\frac{28}{2} = 14\).
   - Therefore, Mark's age two years ago was \(14 + 5 = 19\).

2. **Determine Mark's current age:**
   - Since Mark was 19 two years ago, his current age is \(19 + 2 = 21\).

3. **Determine Jean's current age:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark.
   - Therefore, Jean's current age is \(21 + 2 = 23\).

The final numerical answer is 23."
"First, let's calculate the total time for the faster team to complete the race. Since each member of the faster team runs their leg in 55 seconds, the total time for the race is:

\[ 55 \text{ seconds/runner} \times 4 \text{ runners} = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time for the slower team to complete the race. The first runner takes 60 seconds, the second runner takes 57 seconds (3 seconds faster than the first), the third runner takes 54 seconds (3 seconds faster than the second), and the fourth runner takes 51 seconds (3 seconds faster than the third). The total time for the race is:

\[ 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, to find out how many seconds the faster team will win by, we subtract the total time of the faster team from the total time of the slower team:

\[ 222 \text{ seconds} - 220 \text{ seconds} = 2 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then compare them.

First, let's determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

\[ P(\text{number greater than 3}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Next, let's determine the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:

\[ P(\text{even on first roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll, given that the first roll was even, is also:

\[ P(\text{even on second roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of both events happening (rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll) is:

\[ P(\text{even on first and second roll}) = P(\text{even on first roll}) \times P(\text{even on second roll}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25 \]

Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. This is the difference in the probabilities divided by the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, then expressed as a percentage.

\[ \text{Difference in probabilities} = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 \]

\[ \text{Percentage more likely} = \left( \frac{0.25}{0.25} \right) \times 100\% = 100\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 100 \]"
"Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, so she picked 20 / 2 = 10 apples. Together, they picked 20 + 10 = 30 apples.

The final numerical answer is 30."
"Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as \( r \).

From the information given:
- There are 3 cages of rats, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is \( 3r \times 6 = 18r \).
- There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \).
- There are 20 pieces of straw given to the rabbits.

The total number of pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents is the sum of the pieces of straw given to the rats, hamsters, and rabbits. According to the problem, this total is 160 pieces of straw. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 18r + 50 + 20 = 160 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 18r + 70 = 160 \]
\[ 18r = 160 - 70 \]
\[ 18r = 90 \]
\[ r = \frac{90}{18} \]
\[ r = 5 \]

So, the number of rats in each cage is \( 5 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"To calculate the amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we can use the formula for simple interest:

\[ \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Here, the principal (P) is $100, the rate (R) is 2% or 0.02, and the time (T) is 3 months. Since the interest rate is given monthly, we can directly use the time in months.

\[ \text{Interest} = 100 \times 0.02 \times 3 = 6 \]

So, the total amount Mandy should give Benedict is the principal plus the interest:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} = 100 + 6 = 106 \]

Therefore, Mandy should give Benedict $106."
"Let's denote the number of bags the trader bought as \( n \).

The cost per bag includes the purchase price and the transportation cost, which is \( 20 + 2 = 22 \) dollars per bag.

The total cost for \( n \) bags is \( 22n \) dollars.

The selling price per bag is $30, so the total revenue from selling \( n \) bags is \( 30n \) dollars.

The trader made a total profit of $400, which means the total revenue minus the total cost equals $400. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 30n - 22n = 400 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 8n = 400 \]

To find \( n \), we divide both sides by 8:

\[ n = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 50 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food:

The cost of the tickets is $20.25.

The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, so:
\[ \text{Cost of food} = \$20.25 - \$4.50 = \$15.75 \]

Next, we add the cost of the tickets and the cost of the food to find the total cost of the tickets and food:
\[ \text{Total cost of tickets and food} = \$20.25 + \$15.75 = \$36.00 \]

They also spent $33 on rides, so the total cost for all expenses is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$36.00 + \$33.00 = \$69.00 \]

Since they agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:
\[ \text{Cost per person} = \frac{\$69.00}{3} = \$23.00 \]

So, each of them paid $23.00."
"John collects peaches for 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total number of minutes John spends collecting peaches is 3 * 60 = 180 minutes. If he collects 2 peaches per minute, then the total number of peaches he collects is 180 * 2 = 360 peaches.

The final numerical answer is 360."
"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ten ducks need per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of insects needed per day for one duck.
2. Multiply the daily amount needed for one duck by the number of ducks in the flock.

First, we know that the total amount of insects needed per week for one duck is 3.5 pounds. There are 7 days in a week, so the amount of insects needed per day for one duck is:
\[ \frac{3.5 \text{ pounds}}{7 \text{ days}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per day} \]

Now, for a flock of ten ducks, the total amount of insects needed per day is:
\[ 0.5 \text{ pounds per day per duck} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 5 \text{ pounds per day} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the net increase in trees each year.
2. Calculate the total number of trees after 10 years, considering the net increase.
3. Calculate the number of trees that die after 10 years.
4. Subtract the number of dead trees from the total number of trees after 10 years.

**Step 1: Net increase in trees each year**
Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year.
Net increase = 10 - 2 = 8 trees per year.

**Step 2: Total number of trees after 10 years**
Starting with 50 trees, the number of trees after 10 years, considering the net increase, is:
\[ 50 + 8 \times 10 = 50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees} \]

**Step 3: Number of trees that die after 10 years**
30% of the trees die after 10 years.
Number of trees that die = 30% of 130 = 0.30 * 130 = 39 trees.

**Step 4: Number of trees left after 10 years**
\[ 130 - 39 = 91 \text{ trees} \]

So, the final number of trees Tom has left after 10 years is:

"First, let's calculate the number of flamingos on each day.

On Friday morning, Sue had 18 pink plastic flamingos.

On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos. One third of 18 is:
\[ \frac{18}{3} = 6 \]
So, the neighbors took back 6 flamingos. This means they left 12 flamingos in the yard. The neighbors then painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out. Therefore, the number of flamingos in the yard on Saturday morning is:
\[ 12 \text{ (remaining pink)} + 6 \text{ (painted white)} = 18 \text{ flamingos} \]

On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. So, the total number of flamingos in the yard on Sunday morning is:
\[ 18 \text{ (remaining pink)} + 18 \text{ (new pink)} = 36 \text{ flamingos} \]

Now, we know there are 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos in the yard on Sunday morning. The difference between the number of pink flamingos and white flamingos is:
\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

So, at noon on Sunday, there are 6 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the cost of a pen. We know that a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined. Given that a pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30, we can calculate the cost of a pen as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of a pen} = \text{Cost of a pencil} + \text{Cost of an eraser} \]
\[ \text{Cost of a pen} = \$1.20 + \$0.30 \]
\[ \text{Cost of a pen} = \$1.50 \]

Now, to find out how much 8 pens will cost, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8:

\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = 8 \times \$1.50 \]
\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = \$12.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is \$12.00."

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of Pokemon cards Elaine collected each month and then sum them up with her initial number of cards.

1. **Initial number of cards**: Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.

2. **First month collection**: She collected three times the number of cards she initially had.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ cards}
   \]

3. **Second month collection**: She collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40 \text{ cards}

"First, let's determine how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher each week. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers and a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits:

\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher A} \]
\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher B} \]

Next, we know that Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, the amount Mark earns from Publisher A each week is:

\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays:

\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10 \text{ cents/sentence} \]

Therefore, the amount Mark earns from Publisher B each week is:

\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

Adding the earnings from both publishers gives the total amount Mark makes in a week:

\[ 2500 \text{ cents} + 5000 \text{ cents} = 7500 \text{ cents} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 7500 \]"

"First, let's calculate the raise in John's salary. His current weekly salary is $2000. A 5% raise on $2000 is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Raise} = 2000 \times \frac{5}{100} = 2000 \times 0.05 = 100 \]

So, his new weekly salary after the raise is:

\[ \text{New Weekly Salary} = 2000 + 100 = 2100 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money he makes in a year from his new weekly salary. There are 52 weeks in a year, so:

\[ \text{Total Yearly Salary} = 2100 \times 52 = 109200 \]

Finally, we add the one-time monetary reward of $5000 to his total yearly salary:

\[ \text{Total Yearly Income} = 109200 + 5000 = 114200 \]

So, the total amount of money John made that year is $114,200."
"First, we need to calculate the total tons of grapes produced per year. Josie has 10 acres and each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year. So, the total tons of grapes produced per year is:

\[ 10 \text{ acres} \times 5 \text{ tons/acre} = 50 \text{ tons} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total barrels of wine produced per year. Each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine. So, the total barrels of wine produced per year is:

\[ 50 \text{ tons} \times 2 \text{ barrels/ton} = 100 \text{ barrels} \]

Therefore, the total number of barrels of wine produced per year is:

\[ 100 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into parts:

1. **Sandwiches for lunch**: Carl ate a sandwich every day for 5 days, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich.
   - Total slices of cheese used for sandwiches = 5 days * 2 slices/day = 10 slices.

2. **Omelets for breakfast**: Carl ate omelets for 3 days, using 1 more slice of cheese per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet.
   - Total slices of cheese used for omelets = 3 days * 3 slices/day = 9 slices.

3. **Macaroni and cheese for dinner**: Carl used 8 slices of cheese for this dish.

Now, let's add up all the slices of cheese used:
- Total slices of cheese = Slices for sandwiches + Slices for omelets + Slices for macaroni and cheese
- Total slices of cheese = 10 slices + 9 slices + 8 slices = 27 slices.

So, the total number of slices of cheese Carl used is 27."
"First, let's calculate the number of blue pens Janet bought:
6 bags * 9 pens/bag = 54 blue pens

Next, let's calculate the number of red pens Janet bought:
2 bags * 6 pens/bag = 12 red pens

Now, let's add up all the pens Janet has:
Green pens: 22
Yellow pens: 10
Blue pens: 54
Red pens: 12

Total pens = 22 + 10 + 54 + 12 = 98 pens

So, the final numerical answer is 98."
"To find the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we first need to calculate the sum of her current scores and then determine what the sum of all six scores should be to achieve the desired average.

The scores of the first five tests are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. The sum of these scores is:
\[ 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 440 \]

To have an average of 93 over six tests, the total sum of the six test scores should be:
\[ 93 \times 6 = 558 \]

Let \( x \) be the score on the sixth test. The sum of all six test scores is then:
\[ 440 + x = 558 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 558 - 440 = 118 \]

Therefore, Brinley needs a score of 118 on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 118 \]"
"To calculate the total kilometers Micheal rode, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first four weeks and the next three weeks.

**First four weeks:**
- Micheal rode at least 5 times a week.
- Each time he rode 25 kilometers.
- Total kilometers in four weeks = 4 weeks * 5 rides/week * 25 kilometers/ride.

**Next three weeks:**
- Micheal rode 2 times a week.
- Each time he rode 60 kilometers.
- Total kilometers in three weeks = 3 weeks * 2 rides/week * 60 kilometers/ride.

Let's calculate these:

For the first four weeks:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ rides/week} \times 25 \text{ kilometers/ride} = 500 \text{ kilometers} \]

For the next three weeks:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 2 \text{ rides/week} \times 60 \text{ kilometers/ride} = 360 \text{ kilometers} \]

Now, we add the kilometers from both periods to get the total:
\[ 500 \text{ kilometers} + 360 \text{ kilometers} = 860 \text{ kilometers} \]

So, the total kilometers Micheal rode is 860 kilometers."
"First, we need to determine the weight of each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams and each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs:

\[ \text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{40 \text{ grams}}{2} = 20 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples. Joe has 25 chocolate bars, so the total weight of the chocolate bars is:

\[ \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 \text{ grams} = 1000 \text{ grams} \]

Joe also has 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:

\[ \text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20 \text{ grams} = 1600 \text{ grams} \]

Finally, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:

\[ \text{Total weight of Joe's bag of candy} = 1000 \text{ grams} + 1600 \text{ grams} = 2600 \text{ grams} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2600 \]"
"On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.
On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes.
On Wednesday, she bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

The total number of cakes she bought after all three days is \(4 + 12 + 60 = 76\).

The final numerical answer is 76."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates:

Half a dozen plates = 6 plates
Cost per plate = $6000
Total cost for half a dozen plates = 6 * $6000 = $36000

Now, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than $36000. Let's calculate the cost of twenty dozen cups:

Cost of twenty dozen cups = $36000 - $1200 = $34800

Now, we need to find the cost of one cup. Since twenty dozen cups is equal to 240 cups, we can calculate the cost per cup as follows:

Cost per cup = $34800 / 240 = $145

So, the total cost of buying each cup is $145."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate how much money Sara earns from babysitting:
- She earns $5 each time she babysits, and she babysits 4 times, so she earns \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars from babysitting.

Now, let's calculate how much money Sara earns from mowing the lawn:
- She earns $4 each time she mows the lawn.

Let's denote the number of times Sara needs to mow the lawn as \(x\). The total amount of money Sara will have after mowing the lawn is her initial savings plus the money she earns from babysitting plus the money she earns from mowing the lawn. This can be expressed as:
\[10 + 20 + 4x\]

We need this total to be at least equal to the cost of the jacket and shoes, which is $70. So, we set up the inequality:
\[10 + 20 + 4x \geq 70\]

Simplifying the left side of the inequality:
\[30 + 4x \geq 70\]

Subtract 30 from both sides:
\[4x \geq 40\]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[x \geq 10\]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn at least 10 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes. The final numerical answer is:
\[10\]"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \). According to the problem, the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs every day. Additionally, it is given that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which can be expressed as:

\[ w = r + 2 \]

The total number of eggs collected each day can be expressed as:

\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation:

\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify and solve for \( r \):

\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens. To verify, we can calculate the number of white chickens and the total eggs collected:

\[ w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \]
\[ 3r + 5w = 3(4) + 5(6) = 12 + 30 = 42 \]

The calculations confirm that the solution is correct. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park, as that's the distance he walks. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park are 1.5 miles by 6 miles, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (1.5 + 6) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the distance (15 miles) and speed (3 miles/hour) into the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{15}{3} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park."
"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of customers on the second day.
2. Calculate the total number of customers over the three days.
3. Find the number of customers on the third day by subtracting the total number of customers on the first and second days from the total number of customers over the three days.

First, we know that on the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than on the first day:
\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \text{ customers} \]

Next, we know the total number of customers over the three days is 500. To find the number of customers on the third day, we subtract the number of customers on the first and second days from the total:
\[ 500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250 \]

So, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is:
\[ 250 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 250 \]"
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons.

From the problem, we know that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Since each pool loses 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
Simplifying this equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ B = 2S + 16 \]

Now, we know that the current amount of water in the big pool is four times the current amount of water in the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have two equations:
1. \( B = 2S + 16 \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

We can set these two expressions for \( B \) equal to each other:
\[ 2S + 16 = 4S \]
Solving for \( S \):
\[ 16 = 2S \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool currently has 8 gallons of water. Let's verify this by finding the current amount of water in the big pool:
\[ B = 4S = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( 32 - 4 \times 4 = 32 - 16 = 16 \) gallons, and the small pool had \( 8 - 4 \times 4 = 8 - 16 = -8 \) gallons, which is not possible, so we need to recheck the consistency. The correct interpretation is that the big pool had \( 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( 8 \) gallons, which satisfies the condition that 4 minutes ago the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.

Thus, the current amount of water in the small pool is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to make her purchase, we first need to calculate the total cost of the pair of shoes and the matching belt.

Total cost = Cost of shoes + Cost of belt
Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00
Total cost = $352.00

Lori earns $8.00 per hour. To find out how many hours she needs to work, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage.

Hours needed = Total cost / Hourly wage
Hours needed = $352.00 / $8.00
Hours needed = 44

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She promised to return the principal amount plus an additional 10% of the principal amount. The principal amount is $2000.

The additional amount is 10% of $2000, which is:
\[ 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

So, the total amount to be returned is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Janeth is paying $165 per month for 12 months. The total amount she will pay over 12 months is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

To find the remaining balance, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount promised:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Thus, Janeth's remaining balance by the end of 12 months will be:
\[ 220 \]"
"There are 4 roses in the vase. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, there are 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias. The total number of flowers in the vase is the sum of the roses and dahlias, which is 4 + 11 = 15.

The final numerical answer is 15."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack, and then calculate their ages in three years. Finally, we will find the average of their ages at that time.

1. **Determine Harriet's current age:**
   Harriet is currently 21 years old.

2. **Determine Zack's current age:**
   Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, we can calculate Zack's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. **Determine Adrian's current age:**
   Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age:
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years old}
   \]

4. **Calculate their ages in three years:**
   - Harriet's age in three years: \(21 + 3 = 24\)
   - Zack's age in three years: \(42 + 3 = 45\)
   - Adrian's age in three years: \(63 + 3 = 66\)

5. **Calculate the average age of the three in three years:**
   \[
   \text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Harriet's age in three years} + \text{Zack's age in three years} + \text{Adrian's age in three years}}{3} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45

The final numerical answer is 45."
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna, and then subtract the points scored by Naomi and Yuri from the total points.

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. So, Yuri's score is \(\frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44\) points.
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna's score is \(68 + 17 = 85\) points.

Now, we add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[68 + 44 + 85 = 197\]

The total points scored by the four students is 251. Therefore, the points scored by Jojo are:
\[251 - 197 = 54\]

So, Jojo scored 54 points. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles and sudoku puzzles separately and then sum them up.

For the crossword puzzles:
- Time to finish one crossword puzzle = 10 minutes
- Number of crossword puzzles solved = 3
- Total time for crossword puzzles = 10 minutes/puzzle * 3 puzzles = 30 minutes

For the sudoku puzzles:
- Time to finish one sudoku puzzle = 5 minutes
- Number of sudoku puzzles solved = 8
- Total time for sudoku puzzles = 5 minutes/puzzle * 8 puzzles = 40 minutes

Now, we sum the total time spent on both puzzles:

- Total time spent = 30 minutes + 40 minutes = 70 minutes

The final numerical answer is 70 minutes."
"Initially, the tank has 120 liters of water. Celine used 90 liters, so the remaining water in the tank is:

\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters} \]

Celine then collected rainwater that is twice the amount left in the tank. Since there were 30 liters left, the amount of rainwater collected is:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters} \]

Adding the collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank gives:

\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final amount of water in the tank is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of cards James has after the changes:

- Initial fire type cards: 30
- Initial grass type cards: 20
- Initial water type cards: 40

After losing 8 water type cards:
- Water type cards left: 40 - 8 = 32

After buying 14 new grass type cards:
- Grass type cards now: 20 + 14 = 34

Now, the total number of cards James has is:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 34
- Water type: 32

So, the total number of cards is:
30 + 34 + 32 = 96

The number of water type cards left is 32. To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 = 0.3333 \times 100 = 33.33\% \]

"First, let's determine how many pieces Kalinda and her mom can place together per minute.

Kalinda places 4 pieces per minute.
Her mom places half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

Together, they can place \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces per minute.

The puzzle has 360 pieces. To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can place together per minute:

\[ \text{Time in minutes} = \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

So, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle."
"First, let's calculate how many watermelons were ready for harvest after the first two months. Since 30% of the 120 watermelons were ready, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Ready for harvest} = 120 \times \frac{30}{100} = 120 \times 0.30 = 36 \]

So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest and Ashlyn took them home. This means the number of watermelons remaining after the first harvest is:

\[ \text{Remaining} = 120 - 36 = 84 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining watermelons were ready for harvest two weeks later. Since 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready, we calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Ready for harvest after two weeks} = 84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 84 \times 0.75 = 63 \]

So, 63 watermelons were ready for harvest after the two weeks. This means the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:

\[ \text{Not ready} = 84 - 63 = 21 \]

Therefore, the number of melons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is 21."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the cars before tax and registration:
Cost of 12 cars = 12 * $20,000 = $240,000

Next, we calculate the tax on the cars:
Tax on cars = 10% of $240,000 = 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000

Now, we add the tax to the cost of the cars to get the total cost before registration:
Total cost before registration = $240,000 + $24,000 = $264,000

Then, we add the registration cost for all 12 cars:
Registration cost = 12 * $1,000 = $12,000

Finally, we add the registration cost to the total cost before registration to get the final amount Mark pays:
Total amount paid = $264,000 + $12,000 = $276,000

So, the final numerical answer is $276,000."

The final numerical answer is 50."
"If there were 50 ants and Dax found half as many bugs as ants, then the number of bugs is:

\[ \text{Number of bugs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of ants} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \]

To find the total number of insects in the garden, we add the number of ants and the number of bugs:

\[ \text{Total number of insects} = \text{Number of ants} + \text{Number of bugs} = 50 + 25 = 75 \]

So, the total number of insects in the garden is 75."

"Ram starts with 25 pens. For every 5 empty pens he can make 1 new pen. Therefore, with 25 pens, he can make:

\[ \frac{25}{5} = 5 \]

new pens. Adding these 5 new pens to the original 25 pens, he gets a total of:

\[ 25 + 5 = 30 \]

So, the total number of pens Ram gets is 30."
"Johnny's initial sum of money was $20 plus an extra $10, which totals $30. After investing this sum and it tripling in a year, the amount of money he had after a year is $30 * 3 = $90."
"First, let's determine the ages of Mary and Joan based on the information given:

- Jessa is 20 years old.
- Joan is 5 years older than Jessa, so Joan's age is \(20 + 5 = 25\) years.
- Mary is 2 years younger than Joan, so Mary's age is \(25 - 2 = 23\) years.

Now, we can find the sum of the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa:

\[ \text{Sum of ages} = \text{Jessa's age} + \text{Joan's age} + \text{Mary's age} = 20 + 25 + 23 \]

Let's calculate the sum:

\[ 20 + 25 + 23 = 68 \]

So, the sum of the ages of the three girls is 68."
"First, let's calculate the number of students who went out through exit A. Since 30% of the students went out through exit A, we have:

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 1000 = \frac{30}{100} \times 1000 = 300 \text{ students} \]

After 300 students left through exit A, the remaining number of students is:

\[ 1000 - 300 = 700 \text{ students} \]

Next, we calculate the number of students who went out through exit B. According to the problem, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining students went out through exit B. So, we have:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \text{ of } 700 = \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420 \text{ students} \]

The number of students who went out through exit C is the rest of the students, which is:

\[ 700 - 420 = 280 \text{ students} \]

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is:

\[ 280 \]"
"First, let's determine how many candies Robert has. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert and John has 54 candies, we can set up the equation:

\[ 2 \times \text{Robert's candies} = 54 \]

Solving for Robert's candies:

\[ \text{Robert's candies} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Now, we know Robert has 27 candies. Since James has 6 more candies than Robert, we can calculate the number of candies James has:

\[ \text{James's candies} = \text{Robert's candies} + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Finally, to find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's candies} - \text{James's candies} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

So, John has 21 more candies than James. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 21 \]"
"Dolly has 2 books and reads them all. She also reads Pandora's book, so she reads 2 + 1 = 3 books in total.
Pandora has 1 book and reads it all. She also reads Dolly's book, so she reads 1 + 1 = 2 books in total.
Collectively, they will read 3 + 2 = 5 books.

The final numerical answer is 5."
"First, let's determine how many pen pals Mike has left after stopping being pen pals with 2 of them. Initially, he had 5 pen pals, so after stopping being pen pals with 2, he has:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals left} \]

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each pen pal sends:

\[ 2 \text{ letters/week} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 10 \text{ pages/week} \]

Since there are 3 pen pals, the total number of pages sent by all pen pals in a week is:

\[ 3 \text{ pen pals} \times 10 \text{ pages/pen pal/week} = 30 \text{ pages/week} \]

Mike responds in kind, so he also writes 30 pages a week. Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. Therefore, the time he spends writing 30 pages is:

\[ 30 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \]"
"To determine how many minutes Jason has left on his phone plan, we need to calculate the total minutes he has used and subtract that from his plan's total.

First, calculate the total minutes Jason has used:
- Jason uses 15 minutes per day for his boss.
- There are 30 days in the month.
- He also used an additional 300 minutes.

Total minutes used = (Minutes used per day * Number of days) + Extra minutes
Total minutes used = (15 * 30) + 300
Total minutes used = 450 + 300
Total minutes used = 750

Now, subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes allowed by his plan:
Total minutes allowed = 1000
Minutes left = Total minutes allowed - Total minutes used
Minutes left = 1000 - 750
Minutes left = 250

So, Jason has 250 minutes left."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin initially had 24 fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin had \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Now Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, so Colby took \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. Now Griffin has \(9 - 2 = 7\) fries left.
5. After receiving fries from Ginger, Griffin had 27 fries. So, the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin is \(27 - 7 = 20\).

Therefore, the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin is 20."
"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( F \).

Given:
- There are 4 snails in the first aquarium.
- There are 32 snails in the second aquarium.
- The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is \( 32 - 4 = 28 \).
- This difference is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums.

Let's denote the total number of fish in both aquariums as \( 2F \) (since there are \( F \) fish in each aquarium).

According to the problem, the difference in the number of snails is twice the total number of fish:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2F \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ F = 7 \]

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 7 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist works for the movie:

6 hours/day * 4 days/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours

Next, let's calculate the total cost before the discount:

$250/hour * 120 hours = $30,000

Now, let's calculate the discount amount:

10% of $30,000 = 0.10 * $30,000 = $3,000

Finally, let's calculate the total cost after the discount:

$30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

So, Jean paid $27,000."
"First, we need to calculate the total amount Isabelle spent on the party supplies. We do this by adding up all the individual expenses:

\[
12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22 = 96
\]

Isabelle spent a total of $96 on the party supplies. She split this cost evenly among her three parents, so we need to divide the total cost by 3:

\[
96 \div 3 = 32
\]

Therefore, each person paid \(\boxed{32}\) dollars."
"First, we need to find the total weight of the onions. The chef bought 4 bags, and each bag weighs 50 pounds. So, the total weight is:

\[ 4 \text{ bags} \times 50 \text{ pounds per bag} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total cost. A pound of onions costs $1.50, so for 200 pounds, the cost is:

\[ 200 \text{ pounds} \times 1.50 \text{ dollars per pound} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the chef spent \(\boxed{300}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine how many cookies Sue's sister ate each day.

On Monday, her sister ate 5 cookies.
On Tuesday, her sister ate \( \frac{13}{5} = 2.6 \) cookies.

Next, we calculate how many cookies Sue ate each day.

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, so:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cookies} \]

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so:
\[ 2 \times 2.6 = 5.2 \text{ cookies} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate over the two days.

Sue's total cookies:
\[ 20 + 5.2 = 25.2 \text{ cookies} \]

Her sister's total cookies:
\[ 5 + 2.6 = 7.6 \text{ cookies} \]

Each cookie has 200 calories, so we calculate the total calories consumed by each.

Sue's total calories:
\[ 25.2 \times 200 = 5040 \text{ calories} \]

Her sister's total calories:
\[ 7.6 \times 200 = 1520 \text{ calories} \]

Finally, we find the difference in calories consumed:
\[ 5040 - 1520 = 3520 \text{ calories} \]

So, Sue consumed 3520 more calories than her sister."
"First, let's calculate the total number of students in the school. Since each class has 20 students and there are 3 classes, the total number of students is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

Given that the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the number of boys and girls in the school is:
\[ \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ boys and } 30 \text{ girls} \]

For the first class, there are 15 girls, so the number of boys in the first class is:
\[ 20 - 15 = 5 \text{ boys} \]

For the second class, there are 12 girls, so the number of boys in the second class is:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ boys} \]

Now, let's find out how many boys are in the third class. The total number of boys in the school is 30, and we already know the number of boys in the first and second classes:
\[ 5 + 8 = 13 \text{ boys} \]

Therefore, the number of boys in the third class is:
\[ 30 - 13 = 17 \text{ boys} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Previous Night's Kill:**
   - Wolves: 10
   - Cougars: 15

2. **Today's Kill:**
   - Let the number of cougars killed today be \( c \).
   - According to the problem, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, so the number of wolves killed today is \( 3c \).
   - Also, Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, so the number of cougars killed today is \( 15 - 3 = 12 \).

3. **Calculating Today's Wolves:**
   - Since today's number of cougars is 12, the number of wolves killed today is \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \).

4. **Total Animals Killed:**
   - Wolves killed in total: \( 10 \text{ (previous night)} + 36 \text{ (today)} = 46 \)
   - Cougars killed in total: \( 15 \text{ (previous night)} + 12 \text{ (today)} = 27 \)
   - Total animals killed: \( 46 + 27 = 73 \)

The final numerical answer is 73."

"First, let's find out how many times Anne went down the water slide. If Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30.

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.30 \times 30 = 9 \]

So, Anne went down the slide 9 times less than Mitchel:

\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Now, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne:

\[ 4 \times 21 = 84 \]

So, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

The final numerical answer is 84."
"First, let's determine the total number of cows after Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows. Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, which totals:

\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows/stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows, so the total number of cows becomes:

\[ 200 \text{ cows} + 40 \text{ cows} = 240 \text{ cows} \]

Next, Mr. Sylas divides these 40 new cows equally among the 20 stalls. Each stall will get:

\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows/stall} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. Since each stall has 2 cows, 8 stalls will have:

\[ 8 \text{ stalls} \times 2 \text{ cows/stall} = 16 \text{ cows} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

So, Brady has $45.00 in his piggy bank."
"First, we need to determine the total length of the redwood tree in feet, which is given as 200 feet.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the entire redwood tree before any damage. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we divide the total length of the tree by the length of each section to find the number of sections:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections} \]

Now, we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section to find the total weight of the tree:
\[ 20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to account for the damage caused by the termites. The termites ate 30% of the tree's wood, so we calculate 30% of the total weight:
\[ 0.30 \times 8000 \text{ pounds} = 2400 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we subtract the weight of the damaged wood from the total weight to find the remaining weight of the tree:
\[ 8000 \text{ pounds} - 2400 \text{ pounds} = 5600 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the final weight of the redwood tree is:
\[ 5600 \text{ pounds} \]"
"First, we calculate the cost for the overdue books. Nancy owes $0.50 for each of the 8 books, so the cost for the books is:

"Let's denote the number of apples Jamal has as \( J_a \) and the number of bananas Jamal has as \( J_b \).

From the information given:
1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, so if Andrea has 52 apples, then Jamal has \( 52 - 8 = 44 \) apples.
2. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so \( J_b = J_a + 4 \).
3. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so if Jamal has \( J_b \) bananas, then Andrea has \( \frac{J_b}{2} \) bananas. Since Andrea has 52 apples, we can use this to find the number of bananas Jamal has.

First, we know Jamal has 44 apples, so:
\[ J_b = 44 + 4 = 48 \]
This means Jamal has 48 bananas.

Now, we can find out how many bananas Andrea has:
\[ \text{Andrea's bananas} = \frac{J_b}{2} = \frac{48}{2} = 24 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits:
\[ \text{Total fruits} = \text{Andrea's apples} + \text{Andrea's bananas} + \text{Jamal's apples} + \text{Jamal's bananas} \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 168 \]

We know that 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies. Therefore, the amount of flour needed per cookie is:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{1 \text{ cup}}{6 \text{ cookies}} \]

Now, to find out how many cups of flour are needed for 66 cookies, we multiply the number of cookies by the amount of flour per cookie:
\[ 66 \text{ cookies} \times \frac{1 \text{ cup}}{6 \text{ cookies}} = 11 \text{ cups} \]

So, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow."
"First, we need to find out how many pennies are in two thirds of the pennies in the cup. There are 9,300 pennies in the cup, so we calculate two thirds of 9,300:

\[
\text{Number of pennies in the stack} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9300
\]

\[
\text{Number of pennies in the stack} = \frac{2 \times 9300}{3} = \frac{18600}{3} = 6200
\]

Now, we need to convert the number of pennies into dollars. Since 100 pennies equal 1 dollar, we divide the number of pennies by 100:

\[
\text{Total dollar amount} = \frac{6200}{100} = 62
\]

So, the total dollar amount in the stack is 62 dollars."

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price:
\[ \text{Brokerage Fee} = 350,000 \times \frac{5}{100} = 350,000 \times 0.05 = 17,500 \]

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price:
\[ \text{Transfer Fee} = 350,000 \times \frac{12}{100} = 350,000 \times 0.12 = 42,000 \]

Now, let's add the brokerage fee and the transfer fee to the selling price to get the total price:
\[ \text{Total Price} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500 \]

Finally, let's find out how much more the total price is than Mrs. Cruz's budget:
\[ \text{Difference} = 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500 \]

So, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget."
"First, we need to calculate the transfer fees, which are 3% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Transfer Fees} = 400,000 \times \frac{3}{100} = 12,000 \]

Next, we calculate the brokerage fee, which is 5% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Brokerage Fee} = 400,000 \times \frac{5}{100} = 20,000 \]

Now, we add the transfer fees and the brokerage fee to find the total fees paid.

\[ \text{Total Fees} = 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000 \]

Mr. Tan also paid $250,000 towards the remaining loan amount of the house.

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is $118,000."
"First, we need to calculate the time it takes for the oil to heat up to 400 degrees. We know it takes 20 minutes to heat the oil to 300 degrees, and it then takes 40% longer to heat it to 400 degrees.

To find 40% of 20 minutes:
\[ 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the additional time needed to heat the oil to 400 degrees is 8 minutes. Therefore, the total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes to cook the chicken. It takes 5 minutes less to cook than it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees:

- The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
- The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has \(300 + 12 = 312\) M&Ms.
- The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, so it has \(300 / 2 = 150\) M&Ms.

Now, we sum the M&Ms from all three bags:
\[ 300 + 312 + 150 = 762 \]

So, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms:**
   - Each house has 3 bedrooms.
   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.
   - Therefore, the number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is \(3 \text{ bedrooms} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows}\).

2. **Calculate the number of windows in the additional windows:**
   - Each house has an additional 4 windows.
   - Therefore, the number of additional windows in one house is 4 windows.

3. **Calculate the total number of windows in one house:**

- The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
- The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body, which is \( \frac{900}{10} = 90 \) stitches.
- The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is \( 2 \times 90 = 180 \) stitches.

Now, let's add up the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette:
\[ 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 \]

The total number of stitches for the whole sweater is 1800. Therefore, the number of stitches for the two sleeves combined is:
\[ 1800 - 1170 = 630 \]

Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches for each sleeve is:
\[ \frac{630}{2} = 315 \]

So, each sleeve takes 315 stitches. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 315 \]"
"First, we calculate the total cost for the tomato seeds:
20 packets * $40/packet = $800

Next, we calculate the total cost for the celery seeds:
80 packets * $30/packet = $2400

Now, we add the total costs of the tomato seeds and celery seeds to find the total amount spent:
$800 + $2400 = $3200

Therefore, Mrs. Rylan used $3200 to buy the seeds."
"First, let's calculate the number of lines Sean has to memorize for each part of his role.

For the solo song:
- The solo song has 54 lines.
- Sean has to memorize all 54 lines of the solo song.

For the first scene:
- The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song.
- The first scene has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.
- Sean has to memorize a third of the first scene's lines.
- Therefore, Sean has to memorize \(\frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36\) lines for the first scene.

For the second scene:
- The second scene has six more lines than the solo song.
- The second scene has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
- Sean has to memorize four-fifths of the second scene's lines.
- Therefore, Sean has to memorize \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48\) lines for the second scene.

Now, let's add up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
- Solo song: 54 lines
- First scene: 36 lines
- Second scene: 48 lines

Total lines Sean has to memorize:
\[ 54 + 36 + 48 = 138 \]

The final numerical answer is 138."
"First, let's calculate how many cards had the letter A on them. Since 2/5 of the cards had the letter A, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Cards with letter A} = \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \]

Next, we need to find out how many cards are left after removing the cards with letter A:

\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 80 - 32 = 48 \]

Now, 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B on them:

\[ \text{Cards with letter B} = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]

After removing the cards with letter B, we have:

\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 48 - 24 = 24 \]

Then, 5/8 of the remaining cards had the letter C on them:

\[ \text{Cards with letter C} = \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \]

After removing the cards with letter C, we have:

\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 24 - 15 = 9 \]

The remaining cards, which are 9 in number, had the letter D on them. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 9 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Matthew spends digging the holes and then convert that time into hours.

First, let's calculate the time spent on small holes:
- Matthew takes 3 minutes to dig one small hole.
- He needs to dig 30 small holes.

Total time for small holes = 3 minutes/hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time spent on large holes:
- Matthew takes 10 minutes to dig one large hole.
- He needs to dig 15 large holes.

Total time for large holes = 10 minutes/hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes.

Now, let's add the total time for both types of holes:
Total time in minutes = 90 minutes (small holes) + 150 minutes (large holes) = 240 minutes.

Finally, we convert the total time from minutes to hours:
1 hour = 60 minutes.

Total time in hours = 240 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours.

So, the final numerical answer is 4 hours."
"To find the sum of their ages in 10 years, we can start by understanding the current sum of their ages, which is given as 20. 

In 10 years, each of them will be 10 years older. Therefore, we can calculate the increase in their combined age by adding 10 years to each of their ages. Since there are two individuals, the total increase in their combined age will be:

\[ 10 \text{ years} + 10 \text{ years} = 20 \text{ years} \]

Adding this increase to the current sum of their ages:

\[ 20 \text{ years} + 20 \text{ years} = 40 \text{ years} \]

Thus, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

\[ 40 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 40 \]"
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, which translates to \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. This translates to \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \]"
"First, we calculate the cost of the popsicles. Peter bought 20 popsicles at $0.25 each, so the total cost for the popsicles is:
\[ 20 \times 0.25 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the ice cream bars. Peter bought 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each, so the total cost for the ice cream bars is:
\[ 4 \times 0.50 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the total amount Peter paid, we add the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars:
\[ 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Peter paid is:
\[ 7 \text{ dollars} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of spots a mamba has. Since a cobra has 70 spots and a mamba has half as many spots as a cobra, a mamba has:

\[ \text{Spots per mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, so the total number of spots for the cobras is:

\[ \text{Total spots for cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots, so the total number of spots for the mambas is:

\[ \text{Total spots for mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Adding the total spots for the cobras and mambas gives us the combined total number of spots:

\[ \text{Total spots combined} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of this combined total:

\[ \text{Half the number of spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2450 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people who will be eating the pizza.

- There are 12 team members.
- There are 3 coaches.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so \(12 \text{ team members} \times 2 \text{ guests/team member} = 24 \text{ guests}\).

Adding these together, the total number of people is:
\[ 12 \text{ team members} + 3 \text{ coaches} + 24 \text{ guests} = 39 \text{ people} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Each pizza serves 3 people, so we divide the total number of people by the number of people each pizza can serve:
\[ \frac{39 \text{ people}}{3 \text{ people/pizza}} = 13 \text{ pizzas} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Each pizza costs $15, so:
\[ 13 \text{ pizzas} \times 15 \text{ dollars/pizza} = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Maddy will spend \(\boxed{195}\) dollars."
"To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we first need to calculate the total length used by the topaz gemstones and then subtract that from the total length of the necklace to find the length used by the sterling silver beads.

Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and she uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace. Therefore, the total length used by the topaz gemstones is:
\[ 8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. So, the length used by the sterling silver beads is:
\[ 25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches} \]

Each sterling silver bead is 0.25 inches long. To find the number of sterling silver beads used, we divide the length used by the beads by the length of one bead:
\[ \frac{17 \text{ inches}}{0.25 \text{ inches/bead}} = 68 \text{ beads} \]

Thus, the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace is:
\[ 68 \]"
"To find the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot altogether, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of stories each wrote in the second week.
2. Sum the stories written in the first week.
3. Sum the stories written in the second week.
4. Add the totals from steps 2 and 3.

First, let's calculate the number of stories each wrote in the second week:
- Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week and doubled that in the second week, so she wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories in the second week.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week and doubled that in the second week, so he wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories in the second week.
- Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week and doubled that in the second week, so she wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories in the second week.

Next, we sum the stories written in the first week:
- Alani wrote 20 stories.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories.
- Margot wrote 60 stories.
So, the total number of stories written in the first week is \(20 + 40 + 60 = 120\).

Then, we sum the stories written in the second week:
- Alani wrote 40 stories.
- Braylen wrote 80 stories.
- Margot wrote 120 stories.
So, the total number of stories written in the second week is \(40 + 80 + 120 = 240\).

Finally, we add the totals from the first and second weeks:
- The total number of stories written in the first week is 120.
- The total number of stories written in the second week is 240.
So, the total number of stories written altogether is \(120 + 240 = 360\).

The final numerical answer is:

"Kelly has 5 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents. Therefore, 5 quarters are worth:
\[ 5 \times 25 = 125 \text{ cents} \]

She also has 2 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents. Therefore, 2 dimes are worth:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Adding the value of the quarters and the dimes together, Kelly has:
\[ 125 + 20 = 145 \text{ cents} \]

If she buys a can of pop for 55 cents, the amount of cents she will have left is:
\[ 145 - 55 = 90 \text{ cents} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this, we first need to calculate the total number of stars accounted for by the rows of 8 and 6 stars, and then subtract that from the total number of stars to find out how many are in the 5-star rows.

There are three rows of 8 stars each, so that's 3 * 8 = 24 stars.
There are two rows of 6 stars each, so that's 2 * 6 = 12 stars.

Adding these together gives us 24 + 12 = 36 stars accounted for by the 8-star and 6-star rows.

The flag has a total of 76 stars. So, the number of stars in the 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40 stars.

Since each of these rows has 5 stars, the number of 5-star rows is 40 / 5 = 8 rows.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 8."
"First, we need to calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight of 80 flagstones is:

\[ 80 \times 75 = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how many trucks are required to transport 6000 pounds, given that each truck can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds. We do this by dividing the total weight by the capacity of one truck:

\[ \frac{6000}{2000} = 3 \]

Since the result is a whole number, 3 trucks are sufficient to transport the 80 flagstones. Therefore, the number of trucks needed is:

\[ 3 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"First, we need to determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since it is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, we calculate:

\[ \text{Speed of car in the slow lane} = \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it took the car in the fast lane to travel 480 miles. We use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the fast lane:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{fast lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Since the car in the slow lane traveled the same distance (480 miles) but at a different speed (30 miles/hour), we can calculate the time it took for the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance using the same formula:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{slow lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

\[ 16 \text{ hours} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of medals Izzy has:**

   - Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali.
   - Therefore, Izzy has \(22 - 5 = 17\) medals.

2. **Calculate the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:**
   - Ali has 22 medals.
   - Izzy has 17 medals.
   - Together, they have \(22 + 17 = 39\) medals.

3. **Determine the total number of medals given out:**
   - According to the problem, Ali and Izzy together have 10 times less medals than have been given out.
   - This means the total number of medals given out is \(10 \times 39 = 390\).

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 390."
"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available:

Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, and there are 8 packets.
So, the total number of chocolate bars is \( 5 \times 8 = 40 \).

Next, we calculate the number of chocolate bars that the adults will get:

Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, and there are 4 adults.
So, the total number of chocolate bars for the adults is \( 6 \times 4 = 24 \).

Now, we find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children:

The total number of chocolate bars is 40, and the adults get 24.
So, the number of chocolate bars left for the children is \( 40 - 24 = 16 \).

Finally, we need to share the remaining chocolate bars equally among the 8 children:

Each child will get \( \frac{16}{8} = 2 \) chocolate bars.

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars."
"Susan works for 3 hours in total, but she takes a 30-minute break. Therefore, she works for 3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 2.5 hours is equal to 2.5 * 60 = 150 minutes.

Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes. To find out how much she earns in 150 minutes, we divide 150 by 10 to find out how many 10-minute intervals there are in 150 minutes, which is 150 / 10 = 15 intervals.

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, she earns 15 * $5 = $75.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is $75."
"First, let's determine the initial points for each player:

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Next, we check if any of them get an extra point in the fourth round. The extra point is given to those who have over 20 points.

- Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point.
- Jim has 18 points, so he does not get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point.

Now, we add the extra points to their initial points:

- Mike's new total is \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
- Jim's total remains \(18\) points.
- Tony's new total is \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

Finally, we calculate the total points for all three players:

\[22 + 18 + 43 = 83\]

So, the total points for all three players after the extra points had been distributed is 83."
"First, let's determine the ages of Will's sons. The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest son is half as old as the oldest, which means the youngest son is 4 years old.

Next, we calculate how many oranges each son washes. The oldest son washes 8 oranges, and the youngest son washes 4 oranges. Therefore, the total number of oranges washed by both sons is:

8 (oldest son) + 4 (youngest son) = 12 oranges

Will initially bought 15 oranges. After his sons wash 12 oranges, the number of oranges left unwashed is:

15 - 12 = 3 oranges

So, the final numerical answer is 3."
"On the first day, Darren does:
- 100 pushups

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day by the household.
2. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week by the household.
3. Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

First, let's calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day by the household. There are 5 members, and each consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since they eat rice at lunch and dinner, each person consumes 0.4 kg of rice per day.

Total daily consumption = 5 members * 0.4 kg/member/day = 2 kg/day

Next, we calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week. There are 7 days in a week.

Total weekly consumption = 2 kg/day * 7 days/week = 14 kg/week

Finally, we determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

Number of weeks the bag will last = 42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks

The final numerical answer is 3 weeks."
"To determine how many crates Sam was off by, we first need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week.

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he did not sell any bread on those days. He sold 20 crates over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday). On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates, on Wednesday, he sold 12 crates, and on Thursday, he sold 18 crates.

Let's add up the crates sold from Tuesday to Thursday:
15 crates (Tuesday) + 12 crates (Wednesday) + 18 crates (Thursday) = 45 crates

Now, we add the crates sold over the weekend:
45 crates + 20 crates = 65 crates

Sam's target for the week was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off by, we subtract the number of crates he sold from his target:
120 crates (target) - 65 crates (sold) = 55 crates

Sam was 55 crates off from his target for the week."
"To determine the total cost of the antique desk to Carmen, we need to calculate the bids she placed and the bids of the other bidders.

Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so she bids 3 times. Each of her bids increases by $50 from the previous bid, starting at $200. Therefore, her bids are:
1. First bid: $200
2. Second bid: $200 + $50 = $250
3. Third bid: $250 + $50 = $300

The other 3 bidders each bid once, and since they bid in sequence, their bids are:
1. First bidder: $200
2. Second bidder: $200 + $50 = $250
3. Third bidder: $250 + $50 = $300

Carmen wins with her third bid of $300. To find the total cost to Carmen, we sum her bids:
\[ 200 + 250 + 300 = 750 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 750 \]"
"To calculate the total amount John pays for driving a year, we need to break down the costs into miles driven and bonuses given to the driver.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven in a year:
- Distance to work one way: 30 miles
- Round trip to work each day: 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles
- Days per week: 5 days
- Weeks per year: 50 weeks
- Total miles driven in a year: 60 miles/day * 5 days/week * 50 weeks/year = 15000 miles/year

Next, let's calculate the cost for the miles driven:
- Cost per mile: $2
- Total cost for miles driven in a year: 15000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30000/year

Now, let's calculate the total bonus given to the driver in a year:
- Bonus per month: $150
- Months per year: 12 months/year
- Total bonus in a year: $150/month * 12 months/year = $1800/year

Finally, let's add the total cost for miles driven and the total bonus to find the total amount John pays in a year:
- Total cost for miles driven: $30000/year
- Total bonus: $1800/year
- Total amount paid in a year: $30000/year + $1800/year = $31800/year

"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the folding process and how the pages are printed.

1. **Folding Process**: When a piece of paper is folded vertically, it creates two sides: the left side and the right side. When unfolded, these sides correspond to the front and back of the page.
2. **Printing Process**: The pages are printed such that the left side of the folded paper contains the left side of the unfolded page, and the right side of the folded paper contains the right side of the unfolded page. This means that each piece of paper is used to print two pages (one on the left and one on the right).

Since the tabloid is 32 pages long, we can calculate the number of pieces of paper needed as follows:
- Each piece of paper is used for 2 pages.
- Therefore, for 32 pages, the number of pieces of paper required is \( \frac{32}{2} = 16 \).

Thus, the final numerical answer is 16."
"Annika spent $50 / 2 = $25 on food and snacks. After spending $25 on food and $10 on rides, she has spent a total of $25 + $10 = $35. Therefore, the amount left is $50 - $35 = $15.

The final numerical answer is 15."
"First, let's determine the number of books sold each year.

Given:
- Total books = 250
- Unsold books = 50
- Books sold this year = Total books - Unsold books = 250 - 50 = 200 books
- Books sold in the first year = 2 * Books sold this year = 2 * 200 = 400 books

However, the total number of books is only 250, so the first year's sales cannot be 400 books. This indicates there might be a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the problem. Let's assume the books sold in the first year are the maximum possible under the given constraints, which is 250 books (since she can't sell more than the total available).

So, the books sold in the first year = 250 books.
The books sold this year = 45 books.

Now, let's calculate the total books sold in the first and second years:
- Books sold in the first year = 250 books
- Books sold in the second year = 250 books - 45 books = 205 books

The price per book = $20.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money earned in the second year:
- Money earned in the second year = Books sold in the second year * Price per book = 205 * 20 = $4100

The final numerical answer is:
4100"
"To determine how much money Watson made in April, we need to calculate his earnings from his hourly wage and his weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate Watson's daily earnings:
- Watson works 10 hours a day.
- He earns $10 per hour.

\[ \text{Daily earnings} = 10 \, \text{hours/day} \times 10 \, \text{\$/hour} = 100 \, \text{\$/day} \]

Next, let's calculate his weekly earnings:
- Watson works 5 days a week.
- He earns $100 per day.

\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 100 \, \text{\$/day} \times 5 \, \text{days/week} = 500 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Since Watson received a $300 bonus each week if the company performed well, his total weekly earnings when the company performed well are:

\[ \text{Total weekly earnings} = 500 \, \text{\$/week} + 300 \, \text{\$/week} = 800 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Now, let's calculate his total earnings for the month of April. April has 30 days, and assuming it has 4 full weeks plus 2 extra days, we can calculate his earnings as follows:

\[ \text{Number of full weeks in April} = 4 \]
\[ \text{Earnings for 4 full weeks} = 4 \times 800 \, \text{\$/week} = 3200 \, \text{\$/month} \]

For the remaining 2 days in April, we need to calculate his earnings for those days. Since he works 10 hours a day, for 2 days, he works:

\[ \text{Earnings for 2 days} = 2 \times 100 \, \text{\$/day} = 200 \, \text{\$/month} \]

Adding the earnings from the full weeks and the extra days:

\[ \text{Total earnings for April} = 3200 \, \text{\$/month} + 200 \, \text{\$/month} = 3400 \, \text{\$/month} \]

Therefore, Watson made $3400 in April if the company performed very well for the whole month."
"To determine how many people John lost to, we first need to calculate how many people he beat and then subtract that number from the total number of people he arm wrestled.

John beats 80% of the 20 people he arm wrestled. 

80% of 20 is calculated as:
\[ 0.80 \times 20 = 16 \]

So, John beat 16 people. 

To find out how many people he lost to, we subtract the number of people he beat from the total number of people he arm wrestled:
\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, John lost to 4 people."
"First, let's determine how many loaves of bread are sold in the morning. Since two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning, we calculate:

\[
\text{Morning sales} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
\]

Next, we find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales:

\[
\text{Loaves left after morning} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
\]

In the afternoon and evening, half of the remaining loaves are sold equally. Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening combined is:

\[
\text{Afternoon and evening sales combined} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
\]

Since the loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[
\text{Afternoon sales} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ loaves}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
5

"First, we need to determine how much weight Joey loses in one week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so the weight loss per week is:

\[ \text{Weight loss per week for Joey} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in 1 week, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds. Therefore, to lose the same amount of weight (2 pounds) that Joey loses in 1 week, Sandy will take:

\[ \text{Number of weeks for Sandy} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the savings on the ice cream. The original price of one tub of ice cream is $13, and it is now sold at $11. The discount per tub is:

\[ 13 - 11 = 2 \]

So, the savings on one tub of ice cream is $2. Therefore, the savings on two tubs of ice cream would be:

\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \]

Next, let's calculate the savings on the milk. The discount on one packet of milk is $0.5. Therefore, the savings on four packets of milk would be:

\[ 0.5 \times 4 = 2 \]

Now, we add the savings from the ice cream and the milk to find the total savings:

\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \]

So, the total amount saved if you buy 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To determine the number of new limbs Helena's serum will cause a person to grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and extra legs that grow based on the given growth rates.

The serum makes a person grow an extra arm every three days. So, in fifteen days, the number of extra arms grown is:
\[ \frac{15}{3} = 5 \]

The serum makes a person grow an extra leg every five days. So, in fifteen days, the number of extra legs grown is:
\[ \frac{15}{5} = 3 \]

The total number of new limbs grown is the sum of the extra arms and extra legs:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
8"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
6 business suits * $100 each = $600

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
3 suitcases * $50 each = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit:
5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500
The cost of the flight ticket = $500 + $700 = $1200

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
Cost of business suits + Cost of suitcases + Cost of flight ticket = $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

The total amount Theo wishes to spend on the trip is $6000. He wants to save $2000 for the trip, so the amount he can spend on everything else (business suits, suitcases, flight ticket, and gifts) is:
$6000 - $2000 = $4000

Now, subtract the total expenses from the amount he can spend:
$4000 - $1950 = $2050

Therefore, Theo has to spend $2050 on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa."
"First, let's determine the number of eggs consumed by the family in one day.

- Three people eat 3 eggs each day: \(3 \times 3 = 9\) eggs.
- The remaining two people eat 2 eggs each day: \(2 \times 2 = 4\) eggs.

So, the total number of eggs consumed in one day is \(9 + 4 = 13\) eggs.

To find out how many eggs the family consumes in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7:

\[13 \times 7 = 91\]

Therefore, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week."
"To find Trent's age, we first need to determine Jane's age and then use that to find Trent's age.

Given:
- Quinn is 30 years old.
- Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn.
- Trent is 5 years older than Jane.

First, calculate Jane's age:
\[ \text{Jane's age} = \text{Quinn's age} - 3 = 30 - 3 = 27 \]

Next, calculate Trent's age:
\[ \text{Trent's age} = \text{Jane's age} + 5 = 27 + 5 = 32 \]

So, Trent is 32 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 32 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera's current age is 46 years.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old six years ago.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since six years have passed, Noah's current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Let \(P\) be the current population of Chile.
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was \(P / 2\).

4. **Use the given information about the population six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times the age of Noah.
   - Six years ago, Noah was 20 years old.
   - Therefore, \(P / 2 = 3000 \times 20\).

5. **Calculate the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - \(P / 2 = 60000\)
   - Therefore, \(P = 60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

6. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - Since the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now, the current population \(P\) is \(120000 \times 2 = 240000\).

The population of Chile now is \(\boxed{240000}\)."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players in the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Now, solve for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is 30.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha initially invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\)
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\)

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we account for the people who couldn't come due to illness. This number is 8.

Then, we account for the people who couldn't come due to previous commitments. This number is \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the number of people who couldn't come due to illness, which is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \).

The total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Finally, the number of people who show up for the party is the total number of people invited minus the number who couldn't come: \(24 - 10 = 14\).

So, the final numerical answer is 14."
"First, let's calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has after adding the ones he bought from Johanna to the store's initial amount.

Solomon bought 20 marbles and the store initially had 50 marbles, so the total number of marbles in the store after adding the bought marbles is:
\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \]

Next, we need to calculate the number of marbles Solomon received from his father. His father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as Solomon bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles, the number of marbles his father gave him is:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \]

Now, we add the marbles given by his father to the total number of marbles in the store:
\[ 70 + 8 = 78 \]

Each marble weighs 2 kg, so the total weight of the marbles is:
\[ 78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:
\[ 156 \]"
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Height (or depth) = 5 feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 5 = 120 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is given as $0.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = V \times \text{cost per cubic foot} \]
\[ C = 120 \times 0.1 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The number of girls is 3 times the number of boys.
2. The number of nongendered children is 1/10 the number of boys.
3. The classroom has 30 boys.

First, calculate the number of girls:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 3 \times \text{Number of boys} = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

Next, calculate the number of nongendered children:
\[ \text{Number of nongendered children} = \frac{1}{10} \times \text{Number of boys} = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3 \]

Now, add up all the children in the classroom:
\[ \text{Total number of children} = \text{Number of boys} + \text{Number of girls} + \text{Number of nongendered children} \]
\[ \text{Total number of children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 \]

So, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."

"First, let's determine the total number of people at the beginning of the party:

\[
\text{Total people at the beginning} = \text{Number of men} + \text{Number of women} = 25 + 15 = 40
\]

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left, so 3/4 of the people stayed:

\[
\text{People who stayed} = \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30
\]

We are given that 22 men stayed at the party. Let's find out how many women stayed:

\[
\text{Number of women who stayed} = \text{Total people who stayed} - \text{Number of men who stayed} = 30 - 22 = 8

"First, let's determine the total number of pencils Jam has. We know that Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. So, the number of pencils in the three boxes is:

\[ 26 - 2 = 24 \]

This means Jam has 24 pencils in the boxes and 2 loose pencils, making a total of 26 pencils. Now, we need to find out how many boxes are needed to store all the pencils if Meg also has 46 pencils. The total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together is:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

If we assume each box can hold the same number of pencils, we need to determine how many boxes are required to store 72 pencils. Since the problem does not specify the capacity of each box, we can assume that each box can hold 12 pencils (as 72 divided by 6 equals 12, and 72 divided by 12 equals 6, but the simplest and most straightforward assumption is 12 pencils per box).

So, the number of boxes needed to store 72 pencils is:

\[ \frac{72}{12} = 6 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 6 boxes to store all their pencils. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the total weakening of the coffee.

First, let's calculate the weakening due to the cooling of the coffee by 65 degrees. Each degree of cooling weakens the coffee by 13 milliliters. Therefore, for 65 degrees:

\[ 65 \text{ degrees} \times 13 \text{ milliliters/degree} = 845 \text{ milliliters} \]

Next, we need to account for the weakening due to the addition of 15 milliliters of cream. Each milliliter of added liquid weakens the coffee by 1 milliliter. Therefore, for 15 milliliters of cream:

\[ 15 \text{ milliliters} \times 1 \text{ milliliter/1 milliliter} = 15 \text{ milliliters} \]

Now, we add the two weakening effects together to get the total weakening of the coffee:

\[ 845 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 860 \text{ milliliters} \]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is 860 milliliters weaker when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream."
"If 5 people leave with 7 new records between them, and each person can trade 2 old records for 1 new record, then the total number of new records given out is 7. Since each new record traded requires 2 old records, the total number of old records traded in is \(7 \times 2 = 14\).

Therefore, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records."
"First, let's determine the number of junior and senior programmers.

Given that the total number of employees is 100 and the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:
\[ \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers is:
\[ \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Next, we know that each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total amount paid to junior programmers per month is:
\[ \text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

The senior programmers are paid $400 more than the junior programmers, so each senior programmer is paid:
\[ \text{Payment to each senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400 \]

Therefore, the total amount paid to senior programmers per month is:
\[ \text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

Finally, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers:
\[ \text{Total payment} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 224000 \]"
"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the number of people on the bus becomes \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people got down and 8 more got in, so the number of people on the bus becomes \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).

We are given that there were a total of 20 people heading to the third stop, which means that at the second bus stop, there were 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( 14 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has:
\[ 24 - 2 = 22 \]
lollipops left.

He passes 14 lollipops to his friends, so he has:
\[ 22 - 14 = 8 \]
lollipops left.

He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is:
\[ 2 \times 14 = 28 \]
So, he adds these to his current count:
\[ 8 + 28 = 36 \]
lollipops.

He eats 3 more that night and 2 more in the morning, so he eats:
\[ 3 + 2 = 5 \]
lollipops in total.

Therefore, the number of lollipops he has left is:

1. The phone needs to charge from 60% to 100%, which is a 40% increase.
2. The phone charges at a rate of 1% per 3 minutes.

First, we calculate the total time required to charge 40%:

\[ \text{Time required} = 40\% \times 3 \text{ minutes per 1\%} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we convert the time from minutes to hours:

\[ 120 \text{ minutes} = \frac{120}{60} \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \text{ hours} \]"

"First, let's calculate the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip where they spent $80. For every $20 spent, they get $1 off their next purchase. 

Rewards earned = $80 / $20 = 4 rewards

Each reward is worth $1 off, so they earned 4 rewards, which means they get $4 off their next purchase.

Next, let's calculate the rewards earned from their current shopping trip where they spent $43. 

Rewards earned = $43 / $20 = 2.15

Since they can only earn whole rewards, they earn 2 rewards, which means they get $2 off their next purchase.

Now, they used their rewards, which is $2 off, and applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. 

The coupon amount = 2 * $2 = $4

So, the total discount applied to the purchase is $2 (from rewards) + $4 (from the coupon) = $6.

The original cost of the shopping trip was $43. After applying the discounts, the cost is:

$43 - $6 = $37

Therefore, the customer paid $37 on this shopping trip."
"First, let's calculate the net pay for Job A.

Job A:
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours per year: 2000
- Total annual income before tax: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- State tax rate: 20%
- State tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net pay for Job A: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Next, let's calculate the net pay for Job B.

Job B:
- Annual income before any deductions: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax rate on net income: 10%
- Tax on net income: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay for Job B: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, let's find the difference in net pay between the two jobs.

"First, let's calculate the value of Maria's shares after the first year. She initially buys 8 shares at $8 each, so the initial investment is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8/\text{share} = \$64 \]

After the first year, the stock price increases by 50%. The new price per share is:

\[ \$8 \times (1 + 0.50) = \$8 \times 1.50 = \$12 \]

So, the value of her 8 shares after the first year is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12/\text{share} = \$96 \]

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. The new price per share is:

\[ \$12 \times (1 - 0.25) = \$12 \times 0.75 = \$9 \]

"First, let's determine how many hot dogs Thomas ate. Since Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, we calculate:

\[ \text{Thomas's hot dogs} = 3 \times \text{Luke's hot dogs} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Next, we find out how many hot dogs John ate. John ate half the amount that Thomas ate, so:

\[ \text{John's hot dogs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Thomas's hot dogs} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \]

Now, to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number John ate:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's hot dogs} - \text{Luke's hot dogs} = 3 - 2 = 1 \]

So, John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke. The final numerical answer is:

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( C \):
\[ 2C + C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:
\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of legs. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each:
\[ \text{Total legs} = (2 \times H) + (4 \times C) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = (2 \times 40) + (4 \times 20) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 80 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 160 \]

So, the total number of legs the animals have is 160."
"Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week for 4 weeks. So, the number of balls he adds is:

\[ 1 \text{ ball/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 4 \text{ balls} \]

Adding these to the initial 3 balls:

\[ 3 \text{ initial balls} + 4 \text{ added balls} = 7 \text{ balls} \]

When he starts juggling on stage, he drops 3 balls, so the number of balls he has left is:

\[ 7 \text{ balls} - 3 \text{ dropped balls} = 4 \text{ balls} \]

However, 2 of the dropped balls are caught by people in the crowd, so the number of balls Josh actually has to juggle is:

\[ 4 \text{ balls} - 2 \text{ caught balls} = 2 \text{ balls} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 2 balls."
"First, let's establish the weights of each animal based on the information given:

1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. The blue beetle weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
3. The green toad weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
4. The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so it weighs \(50 + 10 = 60\) pounds.
5. The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so it weighs \(50 - 20 = 30\) pounds.

Now, let's calculate the total weight of one of each animal:
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds

Adding these weights together:
\[ 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 240 \text{ pounds} \]

The container itself weighs 20 pounds. Therefore, the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is:
\[ 240 + 20 = 260 \text{ pounds} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 260 \]"
"Laurel initially received 24 baby outfits from her friend. At her baby shower, she received twice that amount, which is 2 * 24 = 48 outfits. Her mom gifted her with an additional 15 outfits. Adding all these together, the total number of outfits Laurel has is 24 + 48 + 15 = 87 outfits. 

The final numerical answer is 87."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the additional distance Tyson should run each day.
2. Determine the total distance Tyson runs each day after taking the coach's advice.
3. Calculate the total distance Tyson runs in a month.
4. Since June has 30 days, we will multiply the daily distance by 30.

First, let's calculate the additional distance Tyson should run each day:
\[ \text{Additional distance} = \frac{1}{5} \times 5000 \text{ meters} = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

Next, we determine the total distance Tyson runs each day after taking the coach's advice:
\[ \text{New daily distance} = 5000 \text{ meters} + 1000 \text{ meters} = 6000 \text{ meters} \]

Now, we calculate the total distance Tyson runs in a month:
\[ \text{Total distance in a month} = 6000 \text{ meters/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 180000 \text{ meters} \]

Finally, the total distance Tyson covered in June is:
\[ 180000 \text{ meters} \]

Let's box the final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{180000} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of each juice box:

- Juice Box A costs $4.
- Juice Box B costs $5 more than Juice Box A, so it costs $4 + $5 = $9.
- Juice Box C costs $7 more than Juice Box A, so it costs $4 + $7 = $11.

Now, to find out how much more Juice Box C costs than Juice Box B, we subtract the cost of Juice Box B from the cost of Juice Box C:

$11 - $9 = $2

So, Juice Box C is $2 more than Juice Box B."
"To calculate the total number of legs, we need to multiply the number of tables by the number of legs each type of table has and then sum the results.

For the 40 tables with 4 legs each:
\( 40 \times 4 = 160 \) legs

For the 50 tables with 3 legs each:
\( 50 \times 3 = 150 \) legs

Adding these together gives the total number of legs:
\( 160 + 150 = 310 \)

So, the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is 310."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Jenny buys in a week:
\[ 1 \text{ bag/week} \times 36 \text{ cookies/bag} = 36 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of cookies Jenny puts in her son's lunch box over the week:
\[ 4 \text{ cookies/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 20 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Now, let's calculate the number of cookies her husband eats over the week:
\[ 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 7 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Now, we can find out how many cookies are left for Jenny to eat by subtracting the cookies put in the son's lunch box and the cookies eaten by her husband from the total number of cookies:
\[ 36 \text{ cookies/week} - 20 \text{ cookies/week} - 7 \text{ cookies/week} = 9 \text{ cookies/week} \]

So, Jenny eats 9 cookies a week."
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the shirts before the discount. Davos bought 2 shirts, each costing $30, so the total cost before the discount is:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Next, we need to calculate the discount amount. The discount is 40%, so the discount amount on the total cost is:

\[ 60 \times \frac{40}{100} = 60 \times 0.40 = 24 \]

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the total cost to find out how much Davos paid:

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts."
"First, let's calculate the daily earnings from tractors:
- They sold 10 tractors a day.
- Each tractor was sold for $100.

So, the daily earnings from tractors were:
\[ 10 \text{ tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate the daily earnings from silos:
- They sell 5 silos a day.
- Each silo is sold for $220.

So, the daily earnings from silos are:
\[ 5 \text{ silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day} \]

Now, we need to find the percentage increase in daily earnings from making silos compared to making tractors:
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New earnings} - \text{Old earnings}}{\text{Old earnings}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\$1100 - \$1000}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{\$100}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage more they are making per day now is:
\[ 10\% \]"
"To calculate the total annual cost for Madeline's dog, we need to first find the monthly cost and then multiply it by 12 (the number of months in a year).

The cost of food per month is calculated as follows:
- Food costs $25 per week.
- There are 4 weeks in a month.
- Therefore, the monthly cost of food is $25 * 4 = $100.

The cost of treats per month is given as $20.

The cost of medicine per month is given as $100.

Adding these together gives the total monthly cost:
- Total monthly cost = Cost of food + Cost of treats + Cost of medicine
- Total monthly cost = $100 + $20 + $100 = $120.

To find the annual cost, we multiply the monthly cost by 12:
- Annual cost = Total monthly cost * 12
- Annual cost = $120 * 12 = $1440.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is $1440."
"To find the total number of hours Peyton's after-work activities will take, we need to calculate the duration of each activity and then sum them up.

Therefore, the total number of hours for all Peyton’s after-work activities is 8 hours."
"First, let's determine the number of plant pots needed for the roses. Since the number of plant pots needed for the roses is twice the number needed for the daisies, and 30 plant pots are needed for the daisies, the number of plant pots needed for the roses is:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of plant pots needed for both the daisies and the roses:

\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \]

April had already bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many plant pots she has left over, we subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number of plant pots she already bought:

\[ 100 - 90 = 10 \]

So, the number of plant pots April has left over is:

\[ 10 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Andrea started with $36.
2. She spent some money on a sweater that cost $11.
3. She also gave her brother $4.

To find out how much she saved, we need to subtract the total amount she spent from the initial amount she had.

First, calculate the total amount spent:
\[ \text{Total spent} = \text{Cost of sweater} + \text{Amount given to brother} = 11 + 4 = 15 \]

Now, subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:
\[ \text{Amount saved} = \text{Initial amount} - \text{Total spent} = 36 - 15 = 21 \]

So, Andrea saved $21.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming.

Boating time: 6 hours
Swimming time: 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours

Total time for boating and swimming: 6 hours + 3 hours = 9 hours

Next, let's calculate the total time he spent watching shows.

He watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so:
Total show-watching time: 3 shows * 2 hours/show = 6 hours

The 6 hours of show-watching is 30% of the total time spent. Let's denote the total time spent as \( T \). Therefore:
\[ 0.30T = 6 \text{ hours} \]
\[ T = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{0.30} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we know that 40% of the total time \( T \) was spent sightseeing. So:
\[ \text{Time spent sightseeing} = 0.40 \times 20 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Annabelle will earn from her first job. She earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours, so her earnings from the first job are:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Annabelle will earn from her second job. She earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours, so her earnings from the second job are:
\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add the earnings from both jobs to find the total amount of money Annabelle will have after working at both jobs:
\[ 200 + 75 = 275 \text{ dollars} \]

Annabelle already has $80 in her savings. Adding the money she will earn from her jobs to her current savings gives:
\[ 80 + 275 = 355 \text{ dollars} \]

The phone costs $400, so the amount of money Annabelle still needs to save is:
\[ 400 - 355 = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the height of the second tree. Since the second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, and the shortest tree is 6 feet tall, the height of the second tree is:
\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the combined height of the shortest and the second tree:
\[ 6 + 11 = 17 \text{ feet} \]

The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and the second tree:
\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height of the tallest tree is 34 feet."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the toy cars. Dean bought 6 toy cars, and each toy car costs $2. So the total cost for the toy cars is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the teddy bears. Dean bought 5 teddy bears, and each teddy bear costs $1. So the total cost for the teddy bears is:
\[ 5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's find the total cost of the toys Dean bought:
\[ 12 + 5 = 17 \text{ dollars} \]

Dean initially had $28. After buying the toys, the amount of money he has left is:
\[ 28 - 17 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

"First, let's calculate the total cost for the mini-golf and go-karts:

- Cost for one round of mini-golf: $5
- Cost for two rides on go-karts: $10 * 2 = $20

Total cost for mini-golf and go-karts: $5 + $20 = $25

Now, let's subtract this total cost from the budget to find out how much money is left for arcade tokens:

- Remaining budget: $90 - $25 = $65

Morgan wants to have $5 in arcade tokens, so we subtract that from the remaining budget:

- Remaining budget after arcade tokens: $65 - $5 = $60

This $60 is the amount of money she can spend on her friends. Since each friend gets $5 worth of arcade tokens, we can find out how many friends she can invite by dividing the remaining budget by the cost per friend:

- Number of friends: $60 / $5 = 12

So, Morgan can invite 12 friends to her birthday party."
"First, let's calculate how much Marisa spends on lollipops each day. She buys 4 lollipops every day, and each lollipop costs 25 cents. So, the cost per day is:

\[ 4 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 100 \text{ cents} \]

Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar, Marisa spends $1 on lollipops each day.

Next, let's calculate how much money Marisa earns from her pocket money each day. She gets $5 every day.

Now, we need to find out how much money she saves each day. This is the difference between her daily pocket money and the cost of the lollipops:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars} - 1 \text{ dollar} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Marisa saves $4 each day. To find out how much she saves over 5 days, we multiply her daily savings by 5:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Billy spent on gumballs. He bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, so the total cost for the gumballs is:

\[ 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Since he spent half of his change on gumballs, the total change he received after buying candy is:

\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Billy started with $10, so the amount he spent on candy is:

\[ 10 - 4 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of candy is $1.5 per pound. To find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we divide the total amount spent on candy by the cost per pound:

\[ \frac{6}{1.5} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( S \).

According to the problem, Carver's age (45 years) is 5 years less than twice his son's age. This can be expressed as:
\[ 45 = 2S - 5 \]

To find \( S \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 45 + 5 = 2S \]
\[ 50 = 2S \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ \frac{50}{2} = S \]
\[ 25 = S \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the distance of the entire trip from the first city to the third city and back to the first city.

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city back to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the second and third city trip, which is \(100 - 50 = 50\) miles.

So, the total distance for one complete round trip (first to second, second to third, and third to first) is:
\[75 + 100 + 50 = 225 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[225 \times 3 = 675 \text{ miles}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance traveled in one day by the service interval:
\[18000 \div 675 = 26.6667\]

Since the train cannot go a fraction of a day between services, we round up to the next whole number. Therefore, the train goes between services every 27 days.

The final numerical answer is:
\[27\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of stuffing required for each type of dog bed and then calculate the total amount needed for the specified number of beds.

First, let's find out how much stuffing a collie bed requires. The collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. A Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds of stuffing and a chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing. The average is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Average stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we know:
- A chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing.
- A collie bed requires 5 pounds of stuffing.

Next, we calculate the total stuffing needed for the specified number of beds:
- Mark needs to make 4 chihuahua beds. The total stuffing for the chihuahua beds is:
\[
4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]
- Mark needs to make 3 collie beds. The total stuffing for the collie beds is:
\[
3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the stuffing required for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds to find the total amount of stuffing needed:
\[
8 + 15 = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the total amount of stuffing Mark needs is:
\[
\boxed{23}

"First, we calculate the time John spent driving to his friend's house. The distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, and he drives at a speed of 70 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time taken to drive to his friend's house is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} = \frac{200 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{200}{70} \text{ hours} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 2.857 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the time John spent on the detour. The detour added 10 miles to his trip, so the total distance for the detour is:

\[ 200 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 210 \text{ miles} \]

The speed during the detour is 70 mph, so the time taken for the detour is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the time John spent driving home. The distance home is 240 miles, and he drives at a speed of 80 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{home}} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we add up all the times to get the total trip time:

\[ \text{Total Time} = \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} + \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} + \text{Time}_{\text{home}} = \frac{20}{7} + 3 + 3 \]

To add these times, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 7 and 1 is 7, so we convert 3 and 3 to fractions with denominator 7:

\[ 3 = \frac{21}{7} \]
\[ 3 = \frac{21}{7} \]

So the total time is:

\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{20}{7} + \frac{21}{7} + \frac{21}{7} = \frac{20 + 21 + 21}{7} = \frac{62}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 8.857 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \frac{62}{7} \text{ hours} \]"

\[ 53 - 4 = 49 \]

So, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School who were present on Friday is 49."
"If there are 6 girls in the park and twice the number of boys, then there are 6 * 2 = 12 boys in the park. Therefore, the total number of kids in the park is 6 girls + 12 boys = 18 kids."
"To find the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test, we first need to calculate the total points she has already scored on her first two tests and then determine how many more points she needs to reach the required total of 42 points.

Points scored on the first test: 15 points
Points scored on the second test: 18 points

Total points scored on the first two tests: 15 + 18 = 33 points

The total points required to pass: 42 points

To find the minimum points needed on the third test, we subtract the points she has already scored from the total required points:

Points needed on the third test = Total points required - Points scored on the first two tests
Points needed on the third test = 42 - 33 = 9 points

Therefore, the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass is 9 points."
"Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as \( C \). According to the problem, \( C = 3 \).

The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is \( 4C - 5 \). Substituting \( C = 3 \) into this expression, we get:
\[ 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]

The number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is \( 3 \) times the number of shoplifters, which is \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \).

Now, we sum up the number of customers kicked out for each reason:
\[ C + \text{shoplifting} + \text{violence} = 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 \]

The total number of people kicked out of the Walmart is 50. Therefore, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the points Erin had before scoring the additional 14 points.

First, let's find out how many points Sara has:
- Sara scored 8 points.

Next, we know that after scoring 14 points, Erin has three times more points than Sara:
- Let \( E \) be the number of points Erin had before scoring the additional 14 points.
- After scoring 14 points, Erin's total points become \( E + 14 \).

According to the problem, \( E + 14 = 3 \times 8 \).

Now, calculate \( 3 \times 8 \):
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

So, we have:
\[ E + 14 = 24 \]

To find \( E \), subtract 14 from both sides of the equation:
\[ E = 24 - 14 \]
\[ E = 10 \]

Therefore, Erin had 10 points before scoring the additional 14 points.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames without the additional logo cost:
\[ 44 \text{ seniors} \times \$20 \text{ per frame} = \$880 \]

Next, we calculate the additional cost for etching the logo on each frame, which is 20% of the original cost:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } \$20 = 0.20 \times \$20 = \$4 \]
So, the total cost for etching per frame is:
\[ \$20 + \$4 = \$24 \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for all 44 frames with the logo etching:
\[ 44 \text{ frames} \times \$24 \text{ per frame} = \$1056 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the pins for 2 seniors:
\[ 2 \text{ seniors} \times \$5 \text{ per pin} = \$10 \]

Then, we calculate the cost of the cords for 1/4 of the seniors (which is 11 seniors):
\[ 11 \text{ seniors} \times \$12 \text{ per cord} = \$132 \]

Finally, we sum up all the costs:
\[ \$1056 + \$10 + \$132 = \$1198 \]

The total amount spent on the senior gifts is:

So, the total number of hours Hallie had dance practice in a week is 5 hours."
"First, let's determine the number of faulty pieces of equipment. Since 40% of the total number of pieces were faulty, we can calculate the number of faulty pieces as follows:

\[ \text{Number of faulty pieces} = 40\% \times \text{Total number of pieces} \]

Let's denote the total number of pieces as \( N \). Then the number of faulty pieces is:

\[ \text{Number of faulty pieces} = 0.40 \times N \]

Since the total cost of the equipment is $400,000, the cost per piece of equipment is:

\[ \text{Cost per piece} = \frac{\$400,000}{N} \]

The total cost of the faulty pieces is:

\[ \text{Total cost of faulty pieces} = 0.40 \times N \times \frac{\$400,000}{N} = 0.40 \times \$400,000 = \$160,000 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the functioning pieces of equipment is:

\[ \text{Total cost of functioning pieces} = \$400,000 - \$160,000 = \$240,000 \]

So, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is:

\[ \$240,000 \]"

"Mrs. Sherman made a dozen bread rolls, which is equal to 12 rolls. She gave one roll to each of her 6 children, so she gave away 6 rolls. This leaves her with 12 - 6 = 6 rolls. She then broke each of the remaining 6 rolls into 8 pieces. Therefore, the total number of pieces she fed to the chickens is 6 rolls * 8 pieces/roll = 48 pieces. 

The final numerical answer is 48."
"First, we find out how many pupils like blue. Since half of the class likes blue, we calculate:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

This means 20 pupils like blue. The remaining pupils are:

\[
40 - 20 = 20
\]

Next, we find out how many of these remaining pupils like green. One-fourth of the remaining 20 pupils like green:

\[
\frac{20}{4} = 5
\]

So, 5 pupils like green. The rest of the pupils like yellow. The number of pupils who like yellow is the remaining pupils after accounting for those who like blue and green:

\[
20 - 5 = 15
\]

Therefore, the number of pupils who like the color yellow is:

\[
15

"First, we need to determine how many apples Lucy sold on Monday. Given that she sold all the apples she picked on Monday and received $56 from selling them at $4 per piece, we can calculate the number of apples sold on Monday as follows:

\[ \text{Number of apples sold on Monday} = \frac{\$56}{\$4/\text{apple}} = 14 \text{ apples} \]

Next, we calculate the number of apples picked on Tuesday. According to the problem, Lucy picked 12 apples on Tuesday.

Then, we calculate the number of apples picked on Wednesday. The problem states that Lucy picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday. Therefore:

\[ \text{Number of apples picked on Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ apples} \]

To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we sum the apples picked on each day:

\[ \text{Total number of apples} = 14 \text{ (Monday)} + 12 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 24 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 50 \text{ apples} \]

So, the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days is:

\[ 50 \]"
"To determine how many socks Lindsay has missed, we first need to calculate the total number of socks she has washed.

A pair of socks consists of 2 socks. Lindsay washes 10 pairs, so the number of socks from the pairs is:
\[ 10 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ socks per pair} = 20 \text{ socks} \]

She also washes 15 loose socks. Therefore, the total number of socks she has washed is:
\[ 20 \text{ socks from pairs} + 15 \text{ loose socks} = 35 \text{ socks} \]

Lindsay started with 50 socks. To find out how many socks she has missed, we subtract the number of socks she has washed from the total number of socks:
\[ 50 \text{ socks} - 35 \text{ socks} = 15 \text{ socks} \]

So, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is:
\[ 15 \]"
"Rachel initially had 23 cookies. Janet gave her 42 more cookies. So, the total number of cookies Rachel had after receiving from Janet is:

"To calculate the monthly payment for a loan with a fixed interest rate, we can use the formula for the monthly payment on a loan, which is given by:

\[ M = P \frac{r(1+r)^n}{(1+r)^n-1} \]

Where:
- \( M \) is the monthly payment.
- \( P \) is the principal loan amount ($3,650).
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (annual interest rate divided by 12).
- \( n \) is the number of payments (loan term in months).

Given:
- \( P = 3650 \)
- Annual interest rate = 10%, so the monthly interest rate \( r = \frac{10\%}{12} = \frac{0.10}{12} = \frac{1}{120} \)
- \( n = 5 \) months

Now, let's plug these values into the formula:

\[ M = 3650 \frac{\frac{1}{120}(1+\frac{1}{120})^5}{(1+\frac{1}{120})^5-1} \]

First, calculate \( (1 + \frac{1}{120})^5 \):

\[ (1 + \frac{1}{120})^5 = (1 + 0.008333)^5 \approx 1.04166 \]

Now, substitute this back into the formula:

\[ M = 3650 \frac{\frac{1}{120} \times 1.04166}{1.04166 - 1} \]

\[ M = 3650 \frac{0.0086805}{0.04166} \]

\[ M = 3650 \times 0.20833 \]

\[ M \approx 760.00 \]

So, Karan has to pay approximately $760 per month."
"First, we calculate the distance Cho hiked. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Cho, the speed is 14 kilometers per hour and the time is 8 hours. So,

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{h} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, we calculate the distance Chloe hiked. The speed for Chloe is 9 kilometers per hour and the time is 5 hours. So,

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{h} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked, we subtract the distance Chloe hiked from the distance Cho hiked:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many silver and gold pesos Anna has:

- Axel has 50 silver pesos. Anna has twice as many, so Anna has \(50 \times 2 = 100\) silver pesos.
- Axel has 80 gold pesos. Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so Anna has \(80 + 40 = 120\) gold pesos.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pesos they have together:

- Axel's total: \(50\) silver pesos + \(80\) gold pesos = \(130\) pesos.
- Anna's total: \(100\) silver pesos + \(120\) gold pesos = \(220\) pesos.

Adding their totals together:

\(130 + 220 = 350\)

So, the total number of pesos they have together is 350."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make:

- Each pitcher holds 12 cups.
- She can make 3 pitchers of lemonade.

So, the total number of cups is:
\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups/pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling all the lemonade:

- She sells each cup for $1.
- She has 36 cups.

So, the total revenue is:
\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1/\text{cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we calculate the cost of making the lemonade:

- She spent $18 to buy the supplies.

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue:
\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Millie sells all the lemonade, so if she sells all 36 cups in one hour, her profit per hour is:
\[ \$18 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$18 \]"
"Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially as \( L \).

According to the problem, he sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. We know that this remaining amount is 12.8 hectares.

So, we can write the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{5} L = 12.8 \]

To find \( L \), we need to solve for \( L \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):
\[ L = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} \]

Now, let's perform the multiplication:
\[ L = 12.8 \times 2.5 \]

To make the multiplication easier, we can convert 12.8 to a fraction:
\[ 12.8 = \frac{128}{10} = \frac{64}{5} \]

Now, multiply:
\[ L = \frac{64}{5} \times 2.5 = \frac{64}{5} \times \frac{5}{2} = \frac{64 \times 5}{5 \times 2} = \frac{64}{2} = 32 \]

So, Mr. Ruther initially had 32 hectares of land.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 32 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 50\% \times 52 = 0.50 \times 52 = 26 \]

Since the choir is evenly split between boys and girls, the number of boys is also 26.

Next, we need to find out how many female members are performing. Since all female members are performing, the number of female members is equal to the number of girls, which is 26.

On the day of the performance, half the people performing can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, only half of the female members can perform:

\[ \text{Female members who can perform} = \frac{26}{2} = 13 \]

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them, so we add these 3 teachers to the 13 female members who can perform:

\[ \text{Total number of people who sang} = 13 + 3 = 16 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 16 \]"
"To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his 5 test scores. The scores are 65, 94, 81, 86, and 74.

Let's add these step by step:
\[ 65 + 94 = 159 \]
\[ 159 + 81 = 240 \]
\[ 240 + 86 = 326 \]
\[ 326 + 74 = 400 \]

So, the total sum of the scores is 400.

Next, we divide the total sum by the number of tests (which is 5) to find the average:
\[ \frac{400}{5} = 80 \]

Therefore, Wilson's current math grade is 80.

\[ \text{Total messages} = 66 + 22 = 88 \]

So, the total number of messages delivered is:

\[ 88 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost for David who buys a ride bracelet. The ride bracelet costs $30 and gives 9 rides. So, David's total cost is $30.

Next, let's calculate the cost for Dasha who buys tickets. Each ride costs 2 tickets, and there are 9 rides, so Dasha needs 9 * 2 = 18 tickets. Since each ticket costs $2, Dasha's total cost is 18 * $2 = $36.

Now, let's find out how much money David saves by comparing his cost to Dasha's cost. Dasha's total cost is $36, and David's total cost is $30. Therefore, David saves $36 - $30 = $6.

The final numerical answer is $6."
"To determine how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of gifts Monica needs to wrap.
2. Divide the total length of ribbon by the total number of gifts.

First, let's calculate the total number of gifts:
- Monica has 6 gifts to wrap for her family.
- She has 4 gifts to wrap for her friends.
- She has 2 gifts to wrap for her teachers.

Total number of gifts = 6 (family) + 4 (friends) + 2 (teachers) = 12 gifts.

Next, we divide the total length of ribbon by the total number of gifts:
- Monica has 144 inches of ribbon.
- She needs to wrap 12 gifts.

Number of inches of ribbon per gift = 144 inches / 12 gifts = 12 inches per gift.

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many popsicles Betty and Sam each have based on the given ratio and total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. The total parts of the ratio are 5 + 6 = 11 parts.

Given that the total number of popsicles is 165, we can find out how many popsicles each part of the ratio represents by dividing the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts in the ratio:
\[ \text{Value of each part} = \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can find out how many popsicles Betty and Sam have:
- Betty's popsicles: \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \)
- Sam's popsicles: \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \)

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ \text{Difference} = 90 - 75 = 15 \]

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's convert all the time spent into the same unit. We'll use minutes for this calculation.

Carol spends 4 hours writing a song. Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, 4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

She spends half that much time recording it, so recording takes 240 / 2 = 120 minutes.

Editing takes 90 minutes.

The total time spent is the sum of the time spent writing, recording, and editing:
240 (writing) + 120 (recording) + 90 (editing) = 450 minutes.

To find the percentage of her total work time spent editing, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total time spent}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{90}{450} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of her total work time that Carol spent editing is 20%."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of spaces available in the shelving system and then calculate how many more books Wendy needs to place.

The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns, so the total number of spaces is:
\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books already in the system. Let's denote the number of books already in the system as \( x \). Then, the number of books Wendy wants to place is:
\[ 2x + 20 \]

The total number of books in the system after Wendy places her books will be:
\[ x + (2x + 20) = 3x + 20 \]

Since the total number of spaces in the system is 36, we set up the equation:
\[ 3x + 20 = 36 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ 3x + 20 = 36 \]
\[ 3x = 36 - 20 \]
\[ 3x = 16 \]
\[ x = \frac{16}{3} \]

Now, we calculate the number of books Wendy needs to place:
\[ 2x + 20 = 2 \left( \frac{16}{3} \right) + 20 = \frac{32}{3} + 20 = \frac{32}{3} + \frac{60}{3} = \frac{92}{3} \]

To find the final numerical answer, we convert \(\frac{92}{3}\) to a decimal:
\[ \frac{92}{3} \approx 30.67 \]

Since the number of books must be a whole number, and typically in such contexts, we would round to the nearest whole number, we get:
\[ 31 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 31 \]"

"To determine how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for a quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for:
- 3 cups of flour
- 1 cup of milk

For a quadruple batch, the amounts are:
- Flour: \( 3 \text{ cups} \times 4 = 12 \text{ cups} \)
- Milk: \( 1 \text{ cup} \times 4 = 4 \text{ cups} \)

Next, we calculate how many bags of flour and bottles of milk are needed.

Flour is sold in 2-cup bags:
- \( \frac{12 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups/bag}} = 6 \text{ bags} \)

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles:
- \( \frac{4 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups/bottle}} = 2 \text{ bottles} \)

Finally, we find the difference between the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the energy consumption of the air conditioner per hour.
2. Determine the daily energy consumption before and after the reduction.
3. Calculate the daily energy savings.
4. Compute the total energy savings over 30 days.

First, the air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour. Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, the energy consumption per hour in kilowatts is:
\[ \frac{900 \text{ watts}}{1000} = 0.9 \text{ kW} \]

Next, calculate the daily energy consumption before the reduction:
\[ 0.9 \text{ kW} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 7.2 \text{ kWh} \]

After reducing the usage by 5 hours a day, the new daily energy consumption is:
\[ 0.9 \text{ kW} \times (8 - 5) \text{ hours} = 0.9 \text{ kW} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 2.7 \text{ kWh} \]

The daily energy savings is:
\[ 7.2 \text{ kWh} - 2.7 \text{ kWh} = 4.5 \text{ kWh} \]

Finally, the total energy savings over 30 days is:
\[ 4.5 \text{ kWh/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 135 \text{ kWh} \]

So, the total kilowatt-hours of electric energy saved in 30 days is:

\[ \text{Initial number of corns} = 2 \times \text{Initial number of cannolis} = 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

Next, Allan bought 60 more cannolis at the store. Therefore, the new number of cannolis is:

\[ \text{New number of cannolis} = \text{Initial number of cannolis} + 60 = 40 + 60 = 100 \]

Allan also bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought. Since he bought 60 more cannolis, the number of corns he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of corns bought} = 60 - 40 = 20 \]

Adding these 20 corns to the initial number of corns, the new total number of corns is:

\[ \text{New total number of corns} = \text{Initial number of corns} + \text{Number of corns bought} = 80 + 20 = 100 \]

Now, we can find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house:

\[ \text{Combined total} = \text{New total number of corns} + \text{New number of cannolis} = 100 + 100 = 200 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 200 \]"
"Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day. He has already completed half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which means he has taken 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps so far. He also took an additional 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. Let's denote the steps he took during his jog as \( J \).

After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps. This means that the total number of steps he took throughout the day is the sum of the steps he took before the jog, the steps he took during the jog, and the steps he had left to take after the jog. We can express this as:

\[ 5,000 + 1,000 + J = 10,000 - 2,000 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 5,000 + 1,000 + J = 8,000 \]

Combining the known values on the left side:

\[ 6,000 + J = 8,000 \]

To find \( J \), we subtract 6,000 from both sides of the equation:

\[ J = 8,000 - 6,000 \]

\[ J = 2,000 \]

So, Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog."
"First, we need to calculate the total number of words in the book. The book is 45 pages long and averages 200 words per page. Therefore, the total number of words in the book is:

\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we calculate how long it takes Toby to read the entire book. Given that Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute, the time it takes to read the book is:

\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby plans to leave the house as soon as he finishes the book, which will be 30 minutes after he starts reading. He has 60 minutes until he needs to be at the airport. Therefore, the time Toby will be at the airport is:

\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 30 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby also needs to account for the 10 minutes it takes to get to the airport. Thus, the total time Toby will spend traveling to the airport is:

\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Toby will be at the airport 40 minutes after he starts reading, and he needs to be there in 60 minutes, the number of minutes early Toby will be is:

\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 40 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Toby will be 20 minutes early."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money paid to the employees in May and June, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the total amount paid in May:
- Number of employees hired in May: 40
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours worked per week: 40
- Weeks in a month (considering a month as 4 weeks for simplicity): 4

The total amount paid to each employee in May is:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 15 \times 40 \times 4 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

The total amount paid to all employees in May is:
\[ 40 \text{ employees} \times 2400 \text{ dollars/employee} = 96000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount paid in June:
- Number of employees whose contracts expired in June: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \)
- Number of employees whose contracts did not expire in June: \( 40 - 10 = 30 \)

The total amount paid to the employees whose contracts did not expire in June is the same as in May:
\[ 30 \text{ employees} \times 2400 \text{ dollars/employee} = 72000 \text{ dollars} \]

The total amount paid to the employees whose contracts expired in June is:
\[ 10 \text{ employees} \times 2400 \text{ dollars/employee} = 24000 \text{ dollars} \]

The total amount paid in June is:
\[ 72000 \text{ dollars} + 24000 \text{ dollars} = 96000 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is:
\[ 96000 \text{ dollars (May)} + 96000 \text{ dollars (June)} = 192000 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 192000 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is sold in a special deal: ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means for the first pound, she pays $3, and for the second pound, she only pays $1.50 (which is $3 - $1.50).

So, the total cost for the taffy is:
\[ 3 + 1.50 = 4.50 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells. She bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50.

Then, let's calculate the cost of the magnets. She bought 4 magnets at $0.25 each:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1.00 \]

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[ 4.50 \text{ (taffy)} + 1.50 \text{ (seashells)} + 1.00 \text{ (magnets)} = 7.00 \]

Sally's parents gave her $10 to spend. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from the $10:
\[ 10.00 - 7.00 = 3.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 3.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the two packs of fireworks. The first pack costs $400, and the second pack costs twice as much, which is $800. So, the total cost for the two packs is:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the $1200. A 20% discount means Tim pays 80% of the total cost for the fireworks. So, we calculate 80% of $1200:

\[ 1200 \times 0.80 = 960 \]

Now, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted cost of the fireworks:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is:

\[ 1110 \]"
"Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies a night. Over 30 days, she will eat:
\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, the number of dozens she needs to make is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 5 dozens."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. We know that 5% of the candles are dangerous and have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. However, only 1% of the total candles are guaranteed not to explode, which means 99% of the candles are dangerous.

First, let's find out how many candles are dangerous:
\[ \text{Number of dangerous candles} = 99\% \text{ of } 50000 = 0.99 \times 50000 = 49500 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these dangerous candles have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog:
\[ \text{Number of dangerous candles that smell like wet dog} = 5\% \text{ of } 49500 = 0.05 \times 49500 = 2475 \]

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 2475.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2475 \]"
"First, we need to determine the discount price for each blouse. The regular price of each blouse is $20, and there is a 30% discount.

The discount amount per blouse is calculated as:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Regular Price} \times \text{Discount Rate} = 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]

So, the discounted price per blouse is:
\[ \text{Discounted Price} = \text{Regular Price} - \text{Discount Amount} = 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so the total cost for the discounted blouses is:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \text{Discounted Price} \times \text{Number of Blouses} = 14 \times 4 = 56 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 56 \]"
"Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees as \( A \).

From the problem, we know:
- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples.
- Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
- Joanne's sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
- Joanne's sister doesn't take any apples from the average trees, so she contributes 0 apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is:
\[ 30 + 15 + A \]

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne's sister is:
\[ 60 + 45 + 0 = 105 \]

The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500:
\[ (30 + 15 + A) + (60 + 45) = 500 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 45 + A + 105 = 500 \]
\[ 150 + A = 500 \]
\[ A = 500 - 150 \]
\[ A = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 350 \]"
"Let's denote the number of camels as \( C \) and the number of dromedaries as \( D \).

From the problem, we have two equations:
1. The total number of heads: \( C + D = 180 \)
2. The total number of humps: \( 2C + D = 304 \)

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, we can express \( C \) in terms of \( D \) from the first equation:
\[ C = 180 - D \]

Next, we substitute \( C \) in the second equation:
\[ 2(180 - D) + D = 304 \]
\[ 360 - 2D + D = 304 \]
\[ 360 - D = 304 \]
\[ -D = 304 - 360 \]
\[ -D = -56 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 56 \]"
"To solve this, let's break down the trip into segments and calculate the distance traveled in each segment.

1. **First 4 days**: Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day.
   - Distance = 200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

2. **Next 2 days**: Tom traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days.
   - Distance = 30% of 800 km = 0.30 * 800 km = 240 km

3. **Next day**: Tom didn't travel at all.
   - Distance = 0 km

4. **Second week**: Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day.
   - Distance = 300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, let's sum up the distances from all segments to find the total distance traveled during the trip.

- Total distance = Distance in first 4 days + Distance in next 2 days + Distance in the next day + Distance in the second week
- Total distance = 800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

The total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is 3140 kilometers."
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given.

1. We know Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
2. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. Therefore, we can find the size of Zack's locker by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4:
   \[
   \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]
3. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. Therefore, we can find the size of Timothy's locker by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2:
   \[
   \text{Timothy's locker size} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

So, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches."
"Stanley's comb fell from an elevation of 10,000 feet to 6,000 feet (10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet). Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet - 6,000 feet = -3,000 feet. However, since we are calculating the distance to reach Stanley's comb, we take the absolute value of the difference, which is 3,000 feet.

The final numerical answer is 3000."
"To determine Mr. Josue's total capital after receiving funds from the banks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of money given by the second bank.
2. Sum the amounts given by both banks.
3. Add the total amount received from the banks to his initial capital.

First, the second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank. Since the first bank gave him $4000, the second bank gave him:
\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Next, we sum the amounts given by both banks:
\[ 4000 + 8000 = 12000 \]

Now, we add this total to his initial capital of $5000:
\[ 5000 + 12000 = 17000 \]

Therefore, the total capital Mr. Josue has now is:
\[ 17000 \]"
"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, which means a total of 4 * 5 = 20 cats were taken away. So, the number of cats remaining on the rock is 50 - 20 = 30 cats. Later, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse they'd seen. The number of cats that ran away is 3/5 * 30 = 18 cats. Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is 30 - 18 = 12 cats.

The final numerical answer is 12."
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service with the given pricing structure, we need to break down the cost into segments based on the different rates.

1. **First 6 months**: The cost is $8 per month.
   \[
   6 \text{ months} \times \$8/\text{month} = \$48
   \]

2. **Next 2 months (months 7 and 8)**: The cost is the normal rate of $12 per month.
   \[
   2 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$24
   \]

3. **Next 8 months (months 9 to 16)**: The cost is the increased rate of $14 per month.
   \[
   8 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$112
   \]

Now, we sum up the costs for all the segments:
\[
\$48 + \$24 + \$112 = \$184
\]

Therefore, the total cost for 2 years of the service is:
\[
\boxed{184}

"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:

\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of both jeans:

\[ 28 + 22 = 50 \]

Cole saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can determine how much he saved from each type of jeans. Let's denote the savings from the jogger jeans as \( S_j \) and the savings from the tattered jeans as \( S_t \). We know:

\[ S_j + S_t = 6 \]
\[ S_j = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]
\[ S_t = 6 - 2 = 4 \]

Now, we need to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. The original cost of the jogger jeans is $22 and the original cost of the tattered jeans is $28. The difference in cost is:

\[ 28 - 22 = 6 \]

So, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 more than the tattered jeans. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To calculate the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to sum the capacities of all the vehicles rented.

First, we calculate the capacity of the buses:
\[ 4 \text{ buses} \times 60 \text{ employees per bus} = 240 \text{ employees} \]

Next, we calculate the capacity of the minibusses:
\[ 6 \text{ minibusses} \times 30 \text{ employees per minibus} = 180 \text{ employees} \]

Then, we calculate the capacity of the minivans:
\[ 10 \text{ minivans} \times 15 \text{ employees per minivan} = 150 \text{ employees} \]

Finally, we sum the capacities of all the vehicles:
\[ 240 \text{ employees} + 180 \text{ employees} + 150 \text{ employees} = 570 \text{ employees} \]

So, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"Lillian builds 3 bird feeders herself and buys 3 more, making a total of 6 bird feeders. Each of her bird feeders attracts 20 birds a day. The bird feeders she made herself attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so each of her bird feeders attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds a day. Therefore, the total number of birds she can expect to see each day is 6 feeders * 30 birds/feeder = 180 birds.

The final numerical answer is 180."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the soup. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. Since the bagel costs $4, we can calculate the cost of the soup as follows:

Cost of soup = Cost of bagel + 25% of the cost of the bagel
Cost of soup = $4 + 0.25 * $4
Cost of soup = $4 + $1
Cost of soup = $5

Next, we know the cake costs half of the price of the bagel. Since the bagel costs $4, the cake costs:

Cost of cake = 1/2 * Cost of bagel
Cost of cake = 1/2 * $4
Cost of cake = $2

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the dinner by adding the cost of the soup, the bagel, and the cake:

Total cost = Cost of soup + Cost of bagel + Cost of cake
Total cost = $5 + $4 + $2
Total cost = $11

So, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for the dinner she ordered."
"Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( x \).

Kenny keeps \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his cards, so he sells \( \frac{2}{3} \) of them. The number of cards he sells is \( \frac{2}{3}x \).

He sells each card for $1.5, so the total amount of money he earns from selling the cards is \( 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}x = x \).

According to the problem, after spending $50 on the ticket, he has $50 left. This means the total amount of money he earned from selling the cards is $100 (since he spent $50 and had $50 left).

So, we have:
\[ x = 100 \]

Therefore, Kenny started with 100 cards."
"First, let's determine how many hotdogs the caterer initially prepared. Since half of the 40 guests would have two hotdogs each, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of guests who would have two hotdogs} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Since these 20 guests would each have 2 hotdogs, the total number of hotdogs prepared for these guests is:

\[
20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ hotdogs}
\]

However, since 40 guests showed up and everyone wanted a second hotdog, the total number of hotdogs needed is:

\[
40 \text{ hotdogs}
\]

The caterer only prepared 40 hotdogs, which means all 40 guests could have one hotdog each. Since everyone wanted a second hotdog, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:

\[
40 - 40 = 0

"First, let's determine the number of letters in Indras' sister's name. We know that Indras' name has 6 letters. Half of the letters in Indras' name is:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name, so:

\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Now, to find the total number of letters in both names, we add the number of letters in Indras' name to the number of letters in her sister's name:

\[ 6 + 7 = 13 \]

So, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Mixing bowls: $20.00
- Utensils: 5 utensils at $5.00 each, so 5 * $5.00 = $25.00

Total cost before discount = $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Now, let's calculate the discount amount:

- The discount is 20%, so the discount amount is 20% of $165.00.

Discount amount = 20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00

Finally, let's calculate the total cost after the discount:

Total cost after discount = Total cost before discount - Discount amount
Total cost after discount = $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

So, the final numerical answer is $132.00."

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Dora has:
- From her allowance: $2
- From her mother: $16

Total money Dora has = $2 + $16 = $18

Now, let's find out how much more money Dora needs:
Money needed = Total cost - Total money Dora has
Money needed = $19 - $18 = $1

So, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball."
"First, let's determine how many dragons Prince Arthur slew. Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus. Since Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons, we calculate:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Arthur} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \]

Next, we calculate how many dragons Prince Walter slew. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Walter} = 2 \times 75 = 150 \]

Finally, we determine how many dragons Prince Bruce slew. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Bruce} = \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30 \]

So, the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew is:

"First, we need to determine how much gas is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we can calculate the amount of gas per container as follows:

\[ \text{Gas per container} = \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5 \text{ containers}} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Josey needed \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a container, so we calculate the amount of gas she needed in gallons:

\[ \text{Gas needed by Josey} = \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so:

\[ \text{Gas needed by Josey in pints} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints per gallon} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine how much money George spent on chips. We know that George got 3 bags of chips and each bag costs 40 cents. Therefore, the total cost for the chips is:
\[ 3 \times 40 \text{ cents} = 120 \text{ cents} \]

Since George spent $5, which is 500 cents, and he had 1% of his money left after buying the chips, we can calculate how much money he had left:
\[ 500 \text{ cents} \times 0.01 = 5 \text{ cents} \]

This means the amount of money George spent on chips and candy bars is:
\[ 500 \text{ cents} - 5 \text{ cents} = 495 \text{ cents} \]

Since he spent 120 cents on chips, the amount of money spent on candy bars is:
\[ 495 \text{ cents} - 120 \text{ cents} = 375 \text{ cents} \]

Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so the number of candy bars George bought is:
\[ \frac{375 \text{ cents}}{75 \text{ cents per candy bar}} = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of candy bars George bought is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"

"Rory and her mom each have a piece, which means they have 2 pieces in total. The cake weighs 20 ounces, and Rory cuts it into 8 pieces, so each piece weighs 2.5 ounces. After Rory and her mom have their pieces, there are 6 pieces left. Therefore, the remaining cake weighs 6 * 2.5 = 15 ounces."
"First, we need to find the total number of oranges. Sitti bought 34 oranges and Juris bought 22 oranges. So, the total number of oranges is:

\[ 34 + 22 = 56 \]

Next, we need to determine how many people will be sharing the oranges. Sitti and Juris are sharing with their 6 other friends, so the total number of people is:

\[ 2 + 6 = 8 \]

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people:

\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

So, everyone will get 7 oranges. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 7 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of onions Antoine needs. The recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, and he doubles that amount:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00 \text{ per pound} = \$8.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box is $2.00:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00 \text{ per box} = \$4.00 \]

The total cost for the ingredients is the sum of the cost of the onions and the beef stock:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

\[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00 \text{ per serving} \]

"First, let's determine the time it takes for Wayne to drive to the theater. According to the problem, it takes Wayne 4 minutes to drive to the theater.

Since the drive from Bernadette’s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne’s hotel, we can calculate the time it takes for Bernadette to drive to the theater as follows:
\[ \text{Time for Bernadette} = 4 \times \text{Time for Wayne} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne will take 4 minutes to get to the theater, he will arrive at the theater in:
\[ 4 + 4 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

To arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, Bernadette should leave:
\[ 8 - 5 = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 3 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the width of the room first, and then use that to find the perimeter.

Given:
- Area of the room = 360 square feet
- Length of the room = 3 yards

First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard = 3 feet, the length in feet is:
\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

We can use this formula to find the width:
\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{Width} \]
\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have the length and the width, we can find the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]
\[ P = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} \]
\[ P = 98 \text{ feet} \]

So, the perimeter of the room is 98 feet."
"First, let's calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

So, the total number of beads Elizabeth bought is:
\[ 1 \text{ pack of red} + 2 \text{ packs of clear} = 1 \times 20 + 2 \times 20 = 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ beads} \]

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

So, the total number of beads Margareth bought is:
\[ 3 \text{ packs of blue} + 4 \text{ packs of red} = 3 \times 20 + 4 \times 20 = 60 + 80 = 140 \text{ beads} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:
\[ 140 \text{ beads} - 60 \text{ beads} = 80 \text{ beads} \]

So, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven. Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour.

\[ \text{Temperature increase from oven} = 3 \, \text{hours} \times 5 \, \text{degrees/hour} = 15 \, \text{degrees} \]

Next, let's calculate the temperature decrease due to the window. Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.

\[ \text{Temperature decrease from window} = \left(\frac{30 \, \text{minutes}}{10 \, \text{minutes}}\right) \times 2 \, \text{degrees} = 3 \times 2 \, \text{degrees} = 6 \, \text{degrees} \]

Now, let's find the net temperature change by combining the temperature increase and decrease.

\[ \text{Net temperature change} = 15 \, \text{degrees} - 6 \, \text{degrees} = 9 \, \text{degrees} \]

Finally, we add this net temperature change to the initial temperature of the house.

\[ \text{Final temperature} = 40 \, \text{degrees} + 9 \, \text{degrees} = 49 \, \text{degrees} \]

So, the house's final temperature is 49 degrees."
"First, let's convert all times to minutes for easier calculation:
- Jon's total time: 40 (swim) + 80 (bike) + 50 (run) = 170 minutes.
- James' swim time: 40 minutes * (1 - 0.10) = 40 * 0.90 = 36 minutes.
- James' bike time: 80 minutes + 5 minutes = 85 minutes.
- James' run time: unknown, let's call it \( R \) minutes.

Now, let's calculate James' total time:
- James' total time = 36 (swim) + 85 (bike) + \( R \) (run) = 121 + \( R \) minutes.

We know that Jon won the race by 10 minutes, so James' total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
- James' total time = Jon's total time + 10 minutes = 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Now we can set up the equation for James' total time:
\[ 121 + R = 180 \]

Solving for \( R \):
\[ R = 180 - 121 = 59 \]

So, James' run time is 59 minutes. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 59 \]"
"First, let's convert the length of Movie C into minutes. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 1.25 hours is:

\[ 1.25 \times 60 = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so:

\[ \text{Length of Movie B} = 75 + 5 = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, so:

\[ \text{Length of Movie A} = \frac{80}{4} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"First, we need to determine how many miles the horse runs. The horse runs at a speed of 32 miles per hour for 30 minutes, which is half an hour. Therefore, the distance covered is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 32 \, \text{MPH} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 16 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of hay the horse eats. For every mile the horse runs, it eats 1/2 a bail of hay. Therefore, for 16 miles, the horse eats:

\[ \text{Hay consumed} = 16 \, \text{miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \, \text{bail/mile} = 8 \, \text{bails} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the hay. Since each bail of hay costs $3, the total cost for 8 bails is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 \, \text{bails} \times 3 \, \text{\$/bail} = 24 \, \text{\$} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which totals:

\[ \text{Total money Michael has} = 6 \times 5 \, \text{\$} = 30 \, \text{\$} \]

Finally, we calculate the change Michael has after buying the hay:

\[ \text{Change} = \text{Total money Michael has} - \text{Total cost of hay} = 30 \, \text{\$} - 24 \, \text{\$} = 6 \, \text{\$} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of eggs Rozanne has. She uses 4 dozen eggs, and since one dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs equal \(4 \times 12 = 48\) eggs. She also has 2 loose eggs. Therefore, the total number of eggs is \(48 + 2 = 50\) eggs.

Next, we need to find out how many glasses of eggnog she can make. Since each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs, the total number of glasses of eggnog she can make is \(50 \div 5 = 10\) glasses.

Finally, since each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog, the number of trays she can put out is \(10 \div 5 = 2\) trays.

"First, let's calculate the cost price per sneaker:
\[ \text{Cost price per sneaker} = \frac{\$576}{48 \text{ sneakers}} = \$12 \text{ per sneaker} \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from the flash sale:
\[ \text{Revenue from flash sale} = 17 \text{ sneakers} \times \$20 = \$340 \]

Now, let's find out how many sneakers were sold to the department store:
\[ \text{Sneakers sold to department store} = 48 \text{ sneakers} - 17 \text{ sneakers} = 31 \text{ sneakers} \]

Then, let's calculate the total revenue from the department store:
\[ \text{Revenue from department store} = 31 \text{ sneakers} \times \$25 = \$775 \]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from both sales:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = \$340 + \$775 = \$1115 \]

Finally, let's calculate the profit:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = \$1115 - \$576 = \$539 \]

So, the salesman's profit is:
\[ \boxed{539} \]"

"Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as \( P \).

The cost of the super ticket is $20, and the cost of one popcorn with a soda with the super ticket is $21 (since the popcorn and soda cost $1 extra).

The cost of buying a movie ticket for $12 and a popcorn and a soda at regular price is:
\[ 12 + P + 3 = 15 + P \]

According to the problem, you saved $2 by buying the super ticket, so the cost of the super ticket is $2 more than the cost of buying a movie ticket and a popcorn and a soda at regular price. This gives us the equation:
\[ 20 = 15 + P + 2 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 20 = 17 + P \]
\[ P = 20 - 17 \]
\[ P = 3 \]

So, the regular price of popcorn is $3.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the original cost per balloon.
2. Calculate the new cost per balloon after the price increase.
3. Compute the total cost for 170 balloons at the new price.

First, let's find the original cost per balloon. The total cost for 20 balloons was $900. Therefore, the cost per balloon was:
\[ \text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Two days later, the cost per balloon increased by $20. So, the new cost per balloon is:
\[ \text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons at the new price:
\[ \text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = 170 \times 65 \]

Let's calculate this:
\[ 170 \times 65 = 170 \times (60 + 5) = 170 \times 60 + 170 \times 5 = 10200 + 850 = 11050 \]

So, the total cost for Bentley to fill 170 balloons after the price increase is:
\[ \boxed{11050} \]"
"To find the average speed of the car during the entire trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

First, calculate the distance for each segment of the trip:
- For the first segment: \(60 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles}\)
- For the second segment: \(30 \text{ mph} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 30 \text{ miles}\)

Next, add the distances to find the total distance:
- Total distance = \(120 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 150 \text{ miles}\)

Now, calculate the total time taken:
- Total time = \(2 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} = 3 \text{ hours}\)

Finally, calculate the average speed:
- Average speed = \(\frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ mph}\)

The car's average speed during the trip is 50 mph."
"First, let's calculate the value of the sapphires Jenna has left after the trade. Jenna started with 8 sapphires and traded 3 for 2 rubies. So, she has 5 sapphires left.

The value of the sapphires Jenna has left is:
\[ 5 \text{ sapphires} \times \$800 \text{ per sapphire} = \$4000 \]

Next, we need to calculate the value of the rubies Jenna received. She traded 3 sapphires for 2 rubies, and since 3 sapphires are worth:
\[ 3 \text{ sapphires} \times \$800 \text{ per sapphire} = \$2400 \]
The rubies are worth $1200 each, so the value of 2 rubies is:
\[ 2 \text{ rubies} \times \$1200 \text{ per ruby} = \$2400 \]

Now, we add the value of the sapphires and the rubies to find the total value of all her jewels:
\[ \$4000 + \$2400 = \$6400 \]

So, the total value of all her jewels is:
\[ \$6400 \]"
"To find out how many apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we can follow these steps:

"First, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the raised bed) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

For one raised bed, the volume is:

\[ V = 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:

\[ \text{Total Volume} = 10 \times 32 \, \text{cubic feet} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of Bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet per bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{dollars per bag} = 1920 \, \text{dollars} \]

Thus, the total cost for the potting soil is:

"First, let's calculate the number of green cards. We know that there are 15 red cards and that the number of green cards is 60% more than the number of red cards.

The number of green cards can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Number of green cards} = \text{Number of red cards} + 0.60 \times \text{Number of red cards} \]
\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + 0.60 \times 15 \]
\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + 9 \]
\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 24 \]

Next, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards:
\[ \text{Number of yellow cards} = \text{Number of red cards} + \text{Number of green cards} \]
\[ \text{Number of yellow cards} = 15 + 24 \]
\[ \text{Number of yellow cards} = 39 \]

Now, we can find the total number of cards by adding the number of red, green, and yellow cards:
\[ \text{Total number of cards} = \text{Number of red cards} + \text{Number of green cards} + \text{Number of yellow cards} \]
\[ \text{Total number of cards} = 15 + 24 + 39 \]
\[ \text{Total number of cards} = 78 \]

"First, we need to find the total number of puppies. Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, so the total number of puppies is:
\[ 8 + 12 = 20 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. Jennifer's dog has 3 spotted puppies and Brandon's dog has 4 spotted puppies, so the total number of spotted puppies is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we use the formula for percentage:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of Spotted Puppies}}{\text{Total Number of Puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 \]

Calculating the fraction:
\[ \frac{7}{20} = 0.35 \]

Then, converting to a percentage:
\[ 0.35 \times 100 = 35\% \]

So, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is:

"First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed:

- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
- Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
- Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, let's sum up the total weight of all the feed:

Total weight = 2 pounds (sugar cubes) + 48 pounds (carrots) + 3150 pounds (hay) + 1300 pounds (oats) = 4500 pounds

The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips are needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:

Weekly earnings from aluminum cans = 3 cans * 2 cents/can = 6 cents.

Next, let's calculate her weekly earnings from plastic bottles:
- Each plastic bottle is worth 3 cents.
- She drinks 5 plastic bottles a week.

Weekly earnings from plastic bottles = 5 bottles * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents.

Now, let's add the weekly earnings from both aluminum cans and plastic bottles to get her total weekly earnings:
- Total weekly earnings = 6 cents (from cans) + 15 cents (from bottles) = 21 cents.

Finally, to find out how much she earns in a four-week month, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4:
- Total earnings in a four-week month = 21 cents/week * 4 weeks = 84 cents.

The final numerical answer is 84 cents."

"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll use inches since the remoras' measurements are given in inches.

1 foot = 12 inches

The shark's length is 10 feet, which is:
\[ 10 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 120 \text{ inches} \]

Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is:
\[ 2 \times 6 \text{ inches} = 12 \text{ inches} \]

To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Length of remoras}}{\text{Shark's length}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{120 \text{ inches}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{10} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how long Jason has to spend walking each day, we need to divide the total minutes required to break in the shoes by the number of days he plans to walk in a week.

Total minutes to break in the shoes = 240 minutes
Number of days per week he plans to walk = 4 days

Minutes per day = Total minutes to break in the shoes / Number of days per week

Let's calculate this:
Minutes per day = 240 minutes / 4 days = 60 minutes/day

So, Jason has to spend 60 minutes walking each day."
"To find out how many books each child received, we first need to determine the total number of books Sarah bought. Since each book costs $15 and she spent $300, we can calculate the total number of books by dividing the total amount spent by the cost per book:

\[
\text{Total number of books} = \frac{\text{Total amount spent}}{\text{Cost per book}} = \frac{300}{15} = 20
\]

Now, Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids. To find out how many books each child received, we divide the total number of books by the number of kids:

\[
\text{Books per child} = \frac{\text{Total number of books}}{\text{Number of kids}} = \frac{20}{4} = 5
\]

So, each child received 5 books. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion. First, we need to find out how many kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both.

The number of kids allergic to dairy is 9.
The number of kids allergic to peanuts is 6.
The number of kids allergic to both is 3.

Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion, the number of kids allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Allergic to dairy or peanuts} = \text{Allergic to dairy} + \text{Allergic to peanuts} - \text{Allergic to both} \]
\[ \text{Allergic to dairy or peanuts} = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both. Since there are 32 kids in total, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:
\[ \text{Not allergic to anything} = \text{Total kids} - \text{Allergic to dairy or peanuts} \]
\[ \text{Not allergic to anything} = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is 20."

"First, let's calculate the cost of the plane tickets. Since each plane ticket costs $5000 and there are two tickets, the total cost for the plane tickets is:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the hotel. The normal price of the hotel per day is $1500, but it is 20% more expensive because it is a busy weekend. So, the weekend price per day is:
\[ 1500 + (1500 \times 0.20) = 1500 + 300 = 1800 \]
Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 1800 \times 3 = 5400 \]

Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel to find the total cost of the trip:
\[ 10000 + 5400 = 15400 \]

"To determine the number of guests for which the costs of the two venues are equal, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let's denote the number of guests by \( n \).

**Cost at the first venue:**
- The flat fee is $200.
- Food for each guest costs $5.
- Therefore, the total cost at the first venue is:
  \[
  \text{Cost}_1 = 200 + 5n
  \]

**Cost at the second venue:**
- The cost per guest is $25.
- Food for each guest is included in the price, so the total cost per guest is $25.
- Therefore, the total cost at the second venue is:
  \[
  \text{Cost}_2 = 25n
  \]

We need to find the number of guests \( n \) for which the costs are equal:
\[
200 + 5n = 25n

"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \( D \). According to the problem, Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects. Additionally, David found half of what Bodhi found, so if Bodhi found \( B \) insects, then \( D = \frac{B}{2} \).

The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + B = 43 \]
Since \( D = \frac{B}{2} \), we can substitute \( B \) with \( 2D \) in the equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]
Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]
Divide both sides by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]
Now, we know David found 9 insects. Since Lily found 7 more than David, we calculate the number of insects Lily found as:
\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]
So, Lily found 16 insects. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 10 \text{ trips/week} \]

Each bus trip costs her $2.20, so the total cost for her current bus trips in a week is:

\[ 10 \text{ trips/week} \times \$2.20/\text{trip} = \$22.00 \text{ per week} \]

Now, let's compare this to the cost of buying a weekly bus pass, which is $20. The savings by buying the bus pass instead of paying for individual trips each week is:

\[ \$22.00 - \$20.00 = \$2.00 \]

So, Janet would save $2.00 by buying the weekly bus pass."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has 20 sheep.
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does. This means the zoo has \(2 \times 30 = 60\) cows.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. This means the farm has \(\frac{20}{2} = 10\) sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo combined:

- The farm has \(30\) cows + \(10\) sheep = \(40\) animals.
- The zoo has \(60\) cows + \(20\) sheep = \(80\) animals.

So, the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo combined is \(40 + 80 = 120\).

The final numerical answer is 120."
"To determine how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we start by understanding the relationship between the quantities bought by Sophia and Rose. According to the problem, Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.

Given:
- Rose bought 12 onions.
- Rose bought 4 potatoes.

Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as \( S_o \) and the number of potatoes Sophia bought as \( S_p \).

From the problem, we know:
\[ 4 \times (S_o + S_p) = 12 + 4 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[ 4 \times (S_o + S_p) = 16 \]

Next, we solve for \( S_o + S_p \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ S_o + S_p = \frac{16}{4} \]
\[ S_o + S_p = 4 \]

Therefore, Sophia bought a total of 4 onions and potatoes combined. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \]"
"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we first need to calculate the total number of calories he needs to burn to lose 30 pounds. Given that he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose one pound, the total calories he needs to burn to lose 30 pounds is:

\[ 3500 \text{ calories/pound} \times 30 \text{ pounds} = 105000 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to determine the number of days from December 31st to July 19th. We can break this down into months:

- December: 31 days
- January: 31 days
- February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
- March: 31 days
- April: 30 days
- May: 31 days
- June: 30 days
- July (up to July 19th): 19 days

Adding these together gives:

\[ 31 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 221 \text{ days} \]

Now, to find the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to maintain, we divide the total calories he needs to burn by the number of days:

\[ \frac{105000 \text{ calories}}{221 \text{ days}} \approx 475.64 \text{ calories/day} \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, Andy needs to maintain a daily calorie deficit of approximately 476 calories each day to reach his goal."

"First, let's calculate how much money Julie spent on clothes. She spent 20% of $500 on clothes:

\[ 0.20 \times 500 = 100 \]

So, after buying clothes, the remaining amount of money Julie had is:

\[ 500 - 100 = 400 \]

Next, Julie spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs:

\[ 0.25 \times 400 = 100 \]

Therefore, after buying CDs, the remaining amount of money Julie had is:

\[ 400 - 100 = 300 \]

So, the final amount of money Julie had left is $300."
"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, the house cost three times as much as the lot, so we can write:

\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]

Combining like terms, we have:

\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

To find \( L \), we divide both sides by 4:

\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000 \]

Now that we know the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house using the equation \( H = 3L \):

\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000 \]

So, the house cost $90,000.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 90,000 \]"

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the canvas bags:
- Tara sold each canvas bag for $8.
- She sold 40 canvas bags, so the total revenue is \(40 \times 8 = $320\).

Finally, let's calculate the profit:
- Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost.
- So, the profit is \(320 - 32 = $288\).

The final numerical answer is 288."
"To find out how many punches Joe threw, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Determine the total duration of the fight in minutes.
2. Calculate the total number of punches thrown by multiplying the average number of punches per minute by the total duration of the fight.

First, the fight lasts 5 rounds, and each round is 3 minutes long. So, the total duration of the fight is:
\[ 5 \text{ rounds} \times 3 \text{ minutes/round} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, Joe throws 25 punches per minute. Therefore, the total number of punches thrown in 15 minutes is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has. He has four $10 bills and six $20 bills.

Total money = (4 * $10) + (6 * $20)
Total money = $40 + $120
Total money = $160

Ali gives half of the total money to his sister.

Money given to sister = $160 / 2
Money given to sister = $80

Now, let's calculate the remaining money after giving half to his sister.

Remaining money = $160 - $80
Remaining money = $80

Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner.

Amount used for dinner = (3/5) * $80
Amount used for dinner = $48

Therefore, the number of math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday is 39."
"First, let's determine how many quarts each person can pick per hour:

- Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.
- Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
- Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick \(5 \times 2 = 10\) quarts per hour.
- Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than does Kathy, so Ricky can pick \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, let's add up the quarts picked per hour by all four individuals:

- Tony: 6 quarts
- Bobby: 5 quarts
- Kathy: 10 quarts
- Ricky: 8 quarts

Total quarts picked per hour = \(6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29\) quarts.

"First, let's calculate Ada's daily electric consumption before adding the new device:
- Ada's daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour
- New device's daily consumption: 2 kilowatts per hour
- Total daily consumption after adding the new device: 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour

Next, let's calculate the daily cost of electricity:
- Cost per kilowatt per hour: $1.50
- Daily cost after adding the new device: 14 * $1.50 = $21.00

Now, let's calculate the weekly cost of electricity:
- Weekly cost after adding the new device: $21.00 * 7 = $147.00

Before adding the new device, Ada's daily consumption was 12 kilowatts per hour, so the daily cost was:
- Daily cost before adding the new device: 12 * $1.50 = $18.00

And the weekly cost before adding the new device:
- Weekly cost before adding the new device: $18.00 * 7 = $126.00

Finally, let's find the difference between the weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the work rate of one person and then scale it up for 5 people.

1. One person can paint half a house in 5 days. Therefore, one person can paint a whole house in 10 days.
2. The work rate of one person is \(\frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}}\).
3. For 5 people working together, the combined work rate is \(5 \times \frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}} = \frac{5 \text{ houses}}{10 \text{ days}} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{2 \text{ days}}\).
4. This means that 5 people can paint a whole house in 2 days.
5. Since there are 24 hours in a day, 2 days is equal to \(2 \times 24 = 48\) hours.

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ophelia has 20 sofas.
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. Therefore, Ophelia has \(20 + 2 = 22\) chairs.
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. Therefore, Jenna has \(3 \times 22 = 66\) chairs.
4. Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, Ophelia also has 22 sofas (as calculated earlier).
5. Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so Jenna has \(66 - 2 = 64\) sofas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have together:

- Ophelia's total: \(20\) sofas + \(22\) chairs = \(42\)
- Jenna's total: \(64\) sofas + \(66\) chairs = \(130\)

"Let's denote the cost of the computer as \( C \), the cost of the printer as \( P \), and the cost of one monitor as \( M \).

Given:
- \( C = 1100 \)
- \( P = C - 400 \)
- The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400.

First, we calculate the cost of the printer:
\[ P = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

Next, we set up the equation for the total cost:
\[ C + 2M + P = 2400 \]

Substitute the known values of \( C \) and \( P \) into the equation:
\[ 1100 + 2M + 700 = 2400 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 1800 + 2M = 2400 \]

Subtract 1800 from both sides to isolate the term with \( M \):
\[ 2M = 600 \]

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( M \):
\[ M = 300 \]

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is \( 300 \) dollars.

"First, we need to determine the number of boys and girls. Since there are 20 kids in total and they are divided into two equal groups, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

Each boy brought back 60 seashells. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is:
\[ 10 \text{ boys} \times 60 \text{ seashells/boy} = 600 \text{ seashells} \]

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. So, the total number of seashells brought by the girls is:
\[ 600 \text{ seashells} + 4 \times 600 \text{ seashells} = 600 \text{ seashells} + 2400 \text{ seashells} = 3000 \text{ seashells} \]

Since there are 10 girls, the number of seashells each girl brought is:
\[ \frac{3000 \text{ seashells}}{10 \text{ girls}} = 300 \text{ seashells/girl} \]

Thus, the number of seashells brought by each girl is:

Let's add these step by step:
\[ 31 + 50 = 81 \]
\[ 81 + 45 = 126 \]
\[ 126 + 62 = 188 \]

Therefore, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many more vlogs Emma needs to make to complete her monthly goal of 72 vlogs, we first need to calculate the total number of vlogs she has already made in the first three weeks.

She made:
- 18 vlogs in the first week,
- 21 vlogs in the second week,
- 15 vlogs in the third week.

Adding these together gives:
\[ 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 \]

Emma's monthly goal is 72 vlogs. To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her monthly goal:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable parts. First, we need to determine the number of days in the second half of April. April has 30 days, so the second half of April consists of 15 days (14 days in the second half plus the 15th day of the month).

Let's denote the amount Elvis saves in the first half of April as \( x \). Therefore, the amount he saves in the second half of April will be \( 2x \).

The total savings for the month of April will be the sum of the savings in the first half and the second half:
\[ x + 2x = 3x \]

We know that Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 3x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{1125}{3} = 375 \]

So, Elvis saves $375 in the first half of April. For the second half of April, he saves twice this amount:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 375 = 750 \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save $750 for each day in the second half of the month.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate how much Jairus earns for completing 20 tasks. Jairus earns $0.8 for each task, so for 20 tasks, he earns:
\[ 0.8 \times 20 = 16 \]

Next, let's calculate how much Jenny earns for completing 20 tasks. Jenny earns $0.5 for each task, so for 20 tasks, she earns:
\[ 0.5 \times 20 = 10 \]

Now, to find out how much more Jairus earns than Jenny, we subtract Jenny's earnings from Jairus's earnings:
\[ 16 - 10 = 6 \]

So, Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny."
"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars. The total amount of money is $100, so we can write the equation:

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets $20. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's amount as:

\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets $80.

The final numerical answer is 80."
"Jeff walks 6 miles to work one way. Since he walks to work and back home each day, he walks 6 miles per day. If he has to work 5 times a week, the total miles he walks in a week is 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week.

The final numerical answer is 30."
"To determine the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Rewriting**: Elise writes the entire alphabet twice.
   - The alphabet has 26 letters.
   - Therefore, writing it twice means \(26 \times 2 = 52\) letters.

2. **Second Rewriting**: Elise writes half of the alphabet once.
   - Half of the alphabet is \(26 / 2 = 13\) letters.
   - Therefore, writing half of the alphabet once means \(13\) letters.

3. **Third Rewriting**: Elise re-writes everything she has already written.
   - This includes the two full alphabets and the half alphabet.
   - The total number of letters already written is \(52 + 13 = 65\).
   - Therefore, re-writing everything she has already written means \(65\) letters.

Now, we sum up all the letters written:
- First rewriting: \(52\) letters.
- Second rewriting: \(13\) letters.
- Third rewriting: \(65\) letters.

Adding these together:
\[ 52 + 13 + 65 = 130 \]

Thus, the total number of letters Elise has written is:
\[ \boxed{130} \]"

"First, we need to determine the total number of toys required for a play set that is five times larger than James's play set. James's play set has 80 toys, so a play set five times larger would have:

\[ 80 \times 5 = 400 \text{ toys} \]

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have enough toys to make a play set that is five times larger than James's play set. Therefore, if \( x \) is the number of toys Jonathan currently has, then:

\[ x + 2 = 400 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

\[ x = 400 - 2 \]
\[ x = 398 \]

So, Jonathan currently has 398 toys."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of each item before the discount:

- The cost of five notebooks is \(5 \times \$1.50 = \$7.50\).
- The cost of two pens is \(2 \times \$0.25 = \$0.50\).
- The cost of one calculator is \(1 \times \$12 = \$12\).
- The cost of one geometry set is \(1 \times \$10 = \$10\).

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost before the discount:
\[
\$7.50 + \$0.50 + \$12 + \$10 = \$20
\]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
\[
10\% \text{ of } \$20 = 0.10 \times \$20 = \$2
\]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Daniel has to spend:
\[
\$20 - \$2 = \$18
\]

So, Daniel has to spend \(\boxed{18}\) dollars."

The final numerical answer is $17."
"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break down the commission structure:

1. For the first $1000 of sales, she earns a 30% commission.
2. For sales over $1000, she earns an additional 10% commission on the amount over $1000.

First, calculate the commission on the first $1000:
\[ \text{Commission on first $1000} = 1000 \times 0.30 = 300 \]

Next, calculate the additional commission on the amount over $1000:
\[ \text{Amount over $1000} = 2500 - 1000 = 1500 \]
\[ \text{Additional commission} = 1500 \times 0.10 = 150 \]

Now, add both commissions to find the total earnings:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = 300 + 150 = 450 \]

So, Antonella earned $450 from selling goods worth $2500."
"First, let's calculate the total number of bottles Bill currently has. He has 2 cases of water, and each case has 24 bottles. So, the total number of bottles he currently has is:

So, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water."
"First, let's determine how long it takes Ray to swim a mile when the water is warm.

Given:
- When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.
- When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when it is cold.

Let's calculate the time it takes to swim a mile in warm water:
- Twice the time it takes in cold water is \(2 \times 16 = 32\) minutes.
- Adding 2 minutes to this gives \(32 + 2 = 34\) minutes.

So, it takes Ray 34 minutes to swim a mile in warm water.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water:
- In cold water, it takes \(16 \times 3 = 48\) minutes to swim 3 miles.
- In warm water, it takes \(34 \times 3 = 102\) minutes to swim 3 miles.

Finally, to find out how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day, we subtract the time taken in cold water from the time taken in warm water:
- \(102 - 48 = 54\) minutes.

Therefore, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day."
"First, let's calculate how much John earns in a day:

"First, let's determine the daily recommended cups of coffee for Octavia. Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, if we denote the daily recommended cups of coffee as \( R \), then Octavia drinks \( \frac{R}{2} \) cups of coffee.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks, so Juan drinks \( 10 \times \frac{R}{2} = 5R \) cups of coffee.

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. This means Juan needs to reduce his coffee intake from \( 5R \) cups to 4 cups.

To find out by how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we calculate the difference between his current intake and the recommended intake:
\[ 5R - 4 \]

Since the daily recommended cups of coffee for Octavia (and hence Juan) is \( R \), we can express the reduction in terms of \( R \):
\[ 5R - 4 \]

Therefore, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by \( 5R - 4 \) cups. However, without the specific value of \( R \), we can't provide a numerical answer. If we assume \( R = 4 \) (which would make the daily recommended intake for Juan 20 cups, but this is not necessary for the calculation), then:
\[ 5 \times 4 - 4 = 20 - 4 = 16 \]

So, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 16 \]"
"To find the total number of rodents, we need to add the number of hamsters to the number of guinea pigs.

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Adding the number of hamsters and guinea pigs together gives:
\[ 30 + 15 = 45 \]

Therefore, the pet shop had a total of 45 rodents."
"First, let's determine the weights of Susan and Bob.

Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark. Since Mark weighs 150 pounds, Susan's weight is:
\[ 150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds} \]

Bob weighs twice as much as Susan. Since Susan weighs 130 pounds, Bob's weight is:
\[ 2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we can find the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob. The average weight is calculated by summing their weights and dividing by the number of people (which is 3 in this case):
\[ \text{Average weight} = \frac{150 + 130 + 260}{3} = \frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 180 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the angle the sun makes with the ground after moving for 10 hours.

Initially, the sun is at the tip of the pyramid, which is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground. The sun moves upward at a rate of 5 degrees per hour. Over 10 hours, the sun will move upward by:

\[ 5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the total angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours will be the initial angle plus the angle the sun has moved upward:

\[ 32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much James spends on candles, we first need to find out how many candles he needs in total.

1. Determine the ages of the sons:
   - The older son is 12 years old.
   - The younger son is 4 years younger, so he is \(12 - 4 = 8\) years old.

2. Calculate the total number of candles needed:
   - James needs one candle for each son, so he needs \(12 + 8 = 20\) candles.

3. Determine how many packs of candles are needed:
   - Each pack contains 5 candles.
   - To find the number of packs needed, divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack: \(20 \div 5 = 4\) packs.

   - Each pack costs $3.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 4 packs is \(4 \times 3 = 12\).

James spends $12 on candles."
"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the pages read in the first week and add it to the pages read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week. She read for 15 minutes each night for 7 nights, so the total reading time in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pages she can read in 105 minutes. Given that she can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, we can find out how many pages she reads in 1 minute by dividing 2 pages by 1.5 minutes:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of pages read in the first week by multiplying the total reading time in minutes by the number of pages read per minute:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is the sum of the pages read in the first week and the second week:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

So, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equation based on the information given.

Let \( S \) be Shiloh's current age, and let \( N \) be his nephew's current age.

From the problem, we know:
- Shiloh's current age \( S = 44 \) years.
- In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( S + 7 \).
- In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be three times his nephew's age at that time, which is \( N + 7 \).

So, we can write the equation:
\[ S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Substitute \( S = 44 \) into the equation:
\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Next, solve for \( N \):
\[ 51 = 3N + 21 \]
\[ 51 - 21 = 3N \]
\[ 30 = 3N \]
\[ N = 10 \]

Therefore, his nephew is currently 10 years old.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we need to determine the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna based on the information given about Richie.

First, we know that Richie scored 80 goals. According to the problem, Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. Therefore, we can calculate the number of goals Mark scored as follows:
\[ \text{Goals scored by Mark} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 20 = 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Next, we know that Richie also scored 45 more goals than Anna. Therefore, we can calculate the number of goals Anna scored as follows:
\[ \text{Goals scored by Anna} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 45 = 80 - 45 = 35 \]

Now, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers by adding the goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna:
\[ \text{Total goals} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} + \text{Goals scored by Mark} + \text{Goals scored by Anna} = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 \]

Thus, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is:

So, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \$21 \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Peter spends each day. Since he has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week (7 days), he spends:

\[ \frac{70}{7} = 10 \text{ dollars per day} \]

Next, we calculate how much money Peter spends on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. This is 4 days, so he spends:

\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Since each wooden action figure costs $5, the number of wooden action figures he buys is:

\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \text{ wooden action figures} \]

Now, we calculate how much money Peter has left after buying the wooden action figures. He started with $70 and spent $40, so he has:

- Days 4 and 5: 120 birds
- Day 6: 20 birds
- Day 7: 90 birds

Total number of birds seen = 50 (day 1) + 50 (day 2) + 0 (day 3) + 120 (day 4) + 120 (day 5) + 20 (day 6) + 90 (day 7)

Total number of birds seen = 50 + 50 + 0 + 120 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 450 birds

Number of days = 7

Average number of birds seen per day = Total number of birds seen / Number of days
Average number of birds seen per day = 450 / 7

Average number of birds seen per day = 64.28571428571429

Rounded to two decimal places, the average number of birds Mack saw per day is approximately 64.29."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Starting Value**: Diane gave the number train a starting value of 20.
2. **First Operation**: Add half of the starting value to the starting value.
   - Half of the starting value: \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \)
   - Adding this to the starting value: \( 20 + 10 = 30 \)
3. **Second Operation**: Divide the result by 5.
   - Dividing by 5: \( \frac{30}{5} = 6 \)
4. **Third Operation**: Multiply the result by the starting value minus 12.
   - Starting value minus 12: \( 20 - 12 = 8 \)
   - Multiplying the result from the second operation by this value: \( 6 \times 8 = 48 \)

Therefore, the final value of the number train is 48."
"The boy has 5 cards. His brother has 3 fewer cards, which means his brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards. Together, they have 5 + 2 = 7 cards.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage error in Maggie's oven and then apply that same percentage error to the 520 degrees she needs for her recipe.

First, let's calculate the percentage error when the oven is set to 450 degrees and the actual temperature is 468 degrees.

The error is:
\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage error is:
\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

Now, we need to apply this 4% error to the 520 degrees required for her recipe.

The error in degrees for 520 degrees is:
\[ 520 \times \frac{4}{100} = 520 \times 0.04 = 20.8 \]

So, the actual temperature she should set the oven to is:
\[ 520 - 20.8 = 499.2 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 499.2 \]"
"To find the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to add the duration of the first movie to the duration of the second movie.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Converting this to minutes:
1 hour = 60 minutes
So, 1 hour and 30 minutes = 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting this to minutes:
2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes
So, 2 hours and 5 minutes = 120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes.

Now, we add the durations of the two movies:
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes.

Therefore, the total time Max will take to watch the two movies is 215 minutes."
"First, we need to calculate the value of Juan's house. If Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's, then it is 70% of the price of Herb's house. 

The price of Herb's house is $76,000. To find 70% of $76,000, we calculate:
\[ 0.70 \times 76,000 = 53,200 \]

So, Juan's house is worth $53,200.

Next, we need to find the combined value of both houses. We add the value of Juan's house to the value of Herb's house:
\[ 53,200 + 76,000 = 129,200 \]

Therefore, the value of the two houses combined is:
\[ 129,200 \]"
"First, let's determine how many cups and dishes Judy initially bought.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups.

She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.

At the event, her friend brought 40 cups. Since Judy initially bought 12 cups, her friend brought \(40 - 12 = 28\) more cups than Judy bought.

Her friend also brought 20 more dishes than Judy's initial 24 dishes, so her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend.

Judy brought 12 cups and 24 dishes, so the total for Judy is \(12 + 24 = 36\) items.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 44 dishes, so the total for her friend is \(40 + 44 = 84\) items.

The total number of utensils (cups and dishes) brought by both is \(36 + 84 = 120\).

The final numerical answer is:
120"
"First, let's calculate the discounted price of one box of contacts. The original price of one box is $100.00, and it is currently 10% off. 

The discount amount is:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the discounted price of one box is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost for the 2 boxes is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Since there are 90 single use contacts in 1 box, 2 boxes will contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ contacts} \]

To find the cost per pair of contacts, we need to know how many pairs of contacts Pete will get. Assuming a pair consists of 2 contacts, the number of pairs in 180 contacts is:
\[ \frac{180}{2} = 90 \text{ pairs} \]

Therefore, the cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ \frac{180.00}{90} = 2.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 2.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Jill earned.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so she worked a total of:
\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

At $10 an hour, Jill earned:
\[ 3 \times 10 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate how much John earned.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ hours on Saturday} \]

John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked:
\[ 3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ hours on Sunday} \]

Therefore, John worked a total of:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ hours} \]

At $10 an hour, John earned:
\[ 7 \times 10 = 70 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings:
\[ 70 - 30 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

So, John earned $40 more than Jill. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 40 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total calories burned by Hannah during her workout.

For the aerobics:
- She spends 2 hours doing aerobics.
- Aerobics burn 500 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from aerobics = 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.

For the running:
- She spends 1 hour running.
- Running burns 600 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from running = 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.

Now, let's add the calories burned from both activities to get the total calories burned:
- Total calories burned = calories burned from aerobics + calories burned from running
- Total calories burned = 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories.

Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. To find out how many ml of water she needs to drink for 1600 calories, we can set up a proportion:
- For 200 calories, she drinks 100 ml.
- For 1600 calories, she drinks \( x \) ml.

The proportion can be written as:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{100 \text{ ml}} = \frac{1600 \text{ calories}}{x \text{ ml}} \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{1600 \text{ calories} \times 100 \text{ ml}}{200 \text{ calories}} \]
\[ x = \frac{160000 \text{ ml}}{200} \]
\[ x = 800 \text{ ml} \]

So, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the note, the number of red jelly beans is 1% less than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \). Similarly, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of the red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \), we find:
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
- The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \).
- The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \).

The difference between the number of green and red jelly beans is:
\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 30 \]"
"First, let's determine the increase in Jared's typing speed. He starts at 47 WPM and increases to 52 WPM after some lessons. The increase in speed is:

\[ 52 - 47 = 5 \text{ WPM} \]

Next, if he continues to increase his typing speed by 5 words per minute, his new speed will be:

\[ 52 + 5 = 57 \text{ WPM} \]

Now, we need to find the average of the three measurements: 47 WPM, 52 WPM, and 57 WPM. The average is calculated by summing these values and dividing by the number of measurements:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{47 + 52 + 57}{3} \]

Let's calculate the sum:

\[ 47 + 52 + 57 = 156 \]

Now, divide the sum by 3:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{156}{3} = 52 \]

So, the average of the three measurements is:

So, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay."
"To determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, we need to calculate the height of the beanstalk each day until it surpasses the window's height of 20 feet.

The beanstalk starts at 4 feet tall and doubles its height every day. Let's calculate the height of the beanstalk day by day:

- Day 0: 4 feet
- Day 1: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
- Day 2: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
- Day 3: 16 * 2 = 32 feet

On Day 3, the beanstalk reaches a height of 32 feet, which is taller than the 20 feet Mark's window is off the ground.

Therefore, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final numerical answer is 3."
"To determine how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms every day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the protein content per gram of mushrooms.
   - The cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and contains 3 grams of protein.
   - Therefore, the protein content per gram of mushrooms is \( \frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams of mushrooms}} = 0.03 \text{ grams of protein per gram of mushrooms} \).

2. Calculate the daily protein intake from 200 grams of mushrooms.
   - If John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, the daily protein intake is \( 200 \text{ grams} \times 0.03 \text{ grams of protein per gram of mushrooms} = 6 \text{ grams of protein per day} \).

3. Calculate the weekly protein intake.
   - Since John eats 6 grams of protein every day, the weekly protein intake is \( 6 \text{ grams of protein per day} \times 7 \text{ days per week} = 42 \text{ grams of protein per week} \).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 42 grams of protein per week."
"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Expanding and simplifying the equation:
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
\[ J - 2J = -10 \]
\[ -J = -10 \]
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

George needs 2 implants, each with a base price of $2000. So, the cost for the implants is:
\[ 2 \times 2000 = 4000 \]

For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. So, the additional cost for the crown is:
\[ 500 \]

The total cost for the dental work is:
\[ 4000 + 500 = 4500 \]

George has already put down a deposit of $600. Therefore, the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
\[ 4500 - 600 = 3900 \]

George makes $15 per hour at work. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
\[ \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \]

So, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 260 \]"
"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees, and the other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees. The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ degrees} \]
\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ degrees} \]

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees. Therefore, the measure of the largest angle is:

\[ 90 \]

Let's confirm this by printing the final answer.
```python
# Calculation
x = 180 / 6  # smallest angle
largest_angle = 3 * x  # largest angle

largest_angle
```
```output
Done

The measure of the largest angle in the triangle is \(\boxed{90}\) degrees."
"First, we need to determine the total amount of money Colby has in cents. We can do this by converting each type of coin to cents and then summing them up.

- Quarters: 8 quarters * 25 cents/quarter = 200 cents
- Dimes: 6 dimes * 10 cents/dime = 60 cents
- Nickels: 14 nickels * 5 cents/nickel = 70 cents
- Pennies: 15 pennies * 1 cent/penny = 15 cents

Now, we add up all the cents:
200 cents (from quarters) + 60 cents (from dimes) + 70 cents (from nickels) + 15 cents (from pennies) = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy:
345 cents / 5 cents/gumball = 69 gumballs

The final numerical answer is 69."
"To determine the total number of legs in the pet store, we need to consider the number of legs each type of pet has and then multiply by the number of each type of pet.

- Dogs have 4 legs each.
- Cats have 4 legs each.
- Birds have 2 legs each.

Given:
- There are 5 dogs.
- There are 2 cats.
- There are 10 birds.

Now, we calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet:

"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz makes in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we can calculate the hourly rate for Ruiz as follows:

\[ \text{Ruiz's hourly rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa makes in one hour. According to the problem, Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we can calculate the amount Marissa makes in one hour as follows:

\[ \text{Marissa's hourly rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 60 \text{ pounds per hour} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of chocolates Ruiz and Marissa make together in 12 hours. First, we calculate the total amount Ruiz makes in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Ruiz's total in 12 hours} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Marissa makes in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Marissa's total in 12 hours} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the totals together to find the combined total amount of chocolates made by Ruiz and Marissa in 12 hours:

"To calculate the total earnings, we need to break down the problem into two parts based on the given time periods and then sum the earnings.

For the first four hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.

So, the earnings for the first four hours are:
\[ 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} \]

For the next two hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.

So, the earnings for the next two hours are:

"First, we need to determine the total number of rotations the tires go through in a month. Given that the car drives 400 miles a month and the tires rotate 725 times for every 2 miles, we can calculate the total rotations per month as follows:

\[ \text{Rotations per mile} = \frac{725}{2} \]
\[ \text{Rotations per month} = 400 \times \frac{725}{2} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of rotations per month:

\[ \text{Rotations per month} = 400 \times 362.5 = 145000 \]

Now, we know that each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations. To find out how many months the tires can last, we divide the total number of rotations each tire can handle by the number of rotations per month:

\[ \text{Months per tire} = \frac{10,440,000}{145000} \]

\[ \text{Months per tire} = 72 \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can now find out how many years the tires can last:

\[ \text{Years per tire} = \frac{72}{12} = 6 \]

So, the tires can last for 6 years. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To find out how much each pump costs, we first need to determine the total number of washes Jackie can get from one bottle of shampoo. Since the directions say 2 pumps give 120 washes, and Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, each pump will give 120 washes.

The cost of the bottle is $24.00. To find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the number of pumps in the bottle.

\[
\text{Cost per pump} = \frac{\$24.00}{2 \text{ pumps}} = \$12.00 \text{ per pump}
\]

To convert this cost into cents, we multiply by 100 (since $1 = 100$ cents).

\[
\$12.00 \times 100 = 1200 \text{ cents}
\]

So, the cost of each pump is 1200 cents."
"First, we need to calculate the sale price of the shirt and the shorts. The shirt originally costs $25 and there is a 30% discount.

The discount amount for the shirt is:

Next, we calculate the sale price of the shorts. The shorts originally cost $35 and there is a 30% discount.

The discount amount for the shorts is:
\[ 35 \times \frac{30}{100} = 35 \times 0.30 = 10.50 \]

So, the sale price of the shorts is:
\[ 35 - 10.50 = 24.50 \]

Now, we add the sale prices of the shirt and the shorts to find the total cost of the outfit:
\[ 17.50 + 24.50 = 42.00 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. After purchasing the outfit, the amount of money he will have left is:
\[ 50 - 42.00 = 8.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 8.00 \]"
"To determine how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a week.
2. Determine the total amount of butter needed based on the number of dozens.

Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week. There are 7 days in a week.

So, the total number of dozens of croissants he wants to make in a week is:
\[ 4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozen} \]

It takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. Therefore, to find out how many pounds of butter are needed for 28 dozen croissants, we multiply the number of dozens by the amount of butter needed per dozen:
\[ 28 \text{ dozen} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week."
"First, we need to calculate the cost to repave Monica's street. The cost is $194 per meter and her street is 150 meters long. So, the cost for Monica's street is:
\[ 194 \times 150 = 29100 \]

Next, we calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street. Lewis' street is 490 meters long, so the cost for Lewis' street is:
\[ 194 \times 490 = 94860 \]

To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we subtract the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis' street:
\[ 94860 - 29100 = 65760 \]

So, the additional cost to repave Lewis' street is:
\[ 65760 \]"
"First, we need to determine the total duration of John's research. The initial funding covers the first 5 months, and the research takes 10 times that long. Therefore, the total duration of the research is:

\[ 5 \text{ months} \times 10 = 50 \text{ months} \]

Next, we calculate the funding for the first 5 months. The initial funding is $100,000 for the first 5 months.

For the remaining 45 months (since the total duration is 50 months and the first 5 months are already accounted for), the funding per month is 50% more than the initial $20,000 per month. Therefore, the funding per month for the remaining months is:

\[ 20,000 \times 1.5 = 30,000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

The total funding for the remaining 45 months is:

\[ 45 \text{ months} \times 30,000 \text{ dollars per month} = 1,350,000 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the initial funding to the funding for the remaining months gives the total cost of the research:

\[ 100,000 + 1,350,000 = 1,450,000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost of John's research is:

\[ \boxed{1450000} \]"
"To determine the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to sum the meat consumed by each player:

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce, so \(8 \times 1 = 8\) ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces.

Now, we add the ounces of meat consumed by each player:
\[ 6 + 8 + 16 = 30 \]

Therefore, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces."
"To find the total number of posts in March, we need to calculate the number of days in March and then multiply it by the average number of posts per day per member and the total number of members.

March has 31 days.

Each member posts an average of 3 posts per day, so each member will post \(3 \times 31 = 93\) posts in March.

With 1000 members, the total number of posts in March will be \(93 \times 1000 = 93000\).

Thus, the total number of posts that the group will have in March is 93000."
"To determine how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of loads of laundry Gary does in a year.
2. Determine the total gallons of water used in a year.
3. Calculate the total cost of the water used in a year.

First, Gary does laundry twice a week. There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total number of loads of laundry Gary does in a year is:
\[ 2 \text{ loads/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 104 \text{ loads/year} \]

Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water, so the total gallons of water used in a year is:
\[ 104 \text{ loads/year} \times 20 \text{ gallons/load} = 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \]

A gallon of water costs $0.15, so the total cost of the water used in a year is:
\[ 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \times 0.15 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 312 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 312 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the rocks:
2 bags * $2.50 per bag = $5.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of the coral:
3 pieces * $2.00 per piece = $6.00

Then, let's calculate the cost of the fish:
20 fish * $0.50 per fish = $10.00

Finally, the cost of the fish food is given as $2.00.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
Cost of the aquarium + Cost of rocks + Cost of coral + Cost of fish + Cost of fish food
= $10.00 + $5.00 + $6.00 + $10.00 + $2.00
= $33.00

So, the total amount Scarlett spent is $33.00."
"To find the height of Jane's beanstalk after 3 weeks, we need to follow the growth pattern described:

1. After the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.
2. After the second week, it doubled in height, so it became \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches tall.
3. After the third week, it grew another 4 inches, so it became \(6 + 4 = 10\) inches tall.

Therefore, the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks is 10 inches."
"To determine how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of meat Prince can sell in one day.
2. Determine the total amount of meat from the bull.
3. Calculate the number of days required to sell the total amount of meat.

First, Prince sells 15 kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day. Therefore, the amount of meat he sells in one day is:
\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Next, the bull weighs 750 kg. To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell all the meat from the bull, we divide the total weight of the bull by the amount of meat sold per day:
\[ \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

So, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull."
"First, let's calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium. There are 4 rows with 18 seats each:

\[ \text{Total seats} = 4 \times 18 = 72 \]

Next, we find out how many seats were occupied by the administrators. One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators:

\[ \text{Seats occupied by administrators} = \frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18 \]

Now, we calculate the number of seats remaining after the administrators have been seated:

\[ \text{Remaining seats} = 72 - 18 = 54 \]

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents:

\[ \text{Seats occupied by parents} = \frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18 \]

Finally, we find out how many seats were occupied by the students by subtracting the seats occupied by administrators and parents from the remaining seats:

\[ \text{Seats occupied by students} = 54 - 18 = 36 \]

So, the number of students in the school auditorium is:

\[ \text{Number of students} = 36 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 36 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of street lights at one intersection. Since each pole has 4 street lights and there are 6 poles at each intersection, the number of street lights at one intersection is:

\[ 4 \text{ lights/pole} \times 6 \text{ poles} = 24 \text{ lights} \]

Next, we need to find the total number of street lights for all 4 intersections. Since each intersection has 24 street lights, the total number of street lights for 4 intersections is:

\[ 24 \text{ lights/intersection} \times 4 \text{ intersections} = 96 \text{ lights} \]

We are given that 20 of these street lights are not working. Therefore, the total number of functioning street lights is:

\[ 96 \text{ lights} - 20 \text{ non-functioning lights} = 76 \text{ functioning lights} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 76 \]"
"To find out how many total times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to add the number of times each DVD has already been played to their respective maximum play counts.

The first DVD can be played 1000 times and has been played 356 times, so it can still be played:
1000 - 356 = 644 times.

The second DVD can also be played 1000 times and has been played 135 times, so it can still be played:
1000 - 135 = 865 times.

Adding the remaining play counts of both DVDs together:
644 + 865 = 1509 times.

Therefore, the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is 1509."
"To calculate the total cost of John's physical therapy, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of therapy sessions John attended.
2. Calculate the total number of hours John spent in therapy.
3. Compute the total cost based on the hourly rate.

First, John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks, and each week he attended twice for 2 hours at a time. Therefore, the total number of sessions is:
\[ 6 \text{ weeks} \times 2 \text{ sessions/week} = 12 \text{ sessions} \]

Next, since each session is 2 hours long, the total number of hours John spent in therapy is:
\[ 12 \text{ sessions} \times 2 \text{ hours/session} = 24 \text{ hours} \]

The cost per hour is $125, so the total cost is:
\[ 24 \text{ hours} \times 125 \text{ dollars/hour} = 3000 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total cost of John's physical therapy is:
\[ 3000 \]"
"First, let's determine how many pieces of gum Jim chews during the school day. Since he chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school and a school day lasts 8 hours, we can calculate the number of pieces he chews during school as follows:

\[ \text{Pieces chewed during school} = \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours/piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we account for the pieces he chews on the way home from school and after dinner:

\[ \text{Pieces chewed on the way home and after dinner} = 1 + 1 = 2 \text{ pieces} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of pieces Jim chews during the day:

\[ \text{Total pieces chewed during the day} = 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we need to determine how many pieces of gum Jim has left before giving half to his sister. Initially, he has a 20-pack of gum, which means he has 20 pieces. After chewing 6 pieces, the number of pieces remaining is:

\[ \text{Pieces remaining before giving to sister} = 20 - 6 = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

Jim then gives half of the remaining pieces to his sister:

\[ \text{Pieces given to sister} = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, the number of pieces Jim has left at the end of the day is:

\[ \text{Pieces left} = 14 - 7 = 7 \text{ pieces} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 7 \]"
"To find out how old Charmaine will be 4 years from now, we first need to determine her current age. If she will be 16 years old in 12 years, we subtract 12 from 16 to find her current age:

\[ 16 - 12 = 4 \]

So, Charmaine is currently 4 years old. To find out how old she will be 4 years from now, we add 4 to her current age:

\[ 4 + 4 = 8 \]

Therefore, Charmaine will be 8 years old 4 years from now."
"First, let's calculate how much the baseball coach spent. The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs at $3 each, so the total cost for the baseball coach is:
\[ 9 \times 3 = 27 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate how much the basketball coach spent. The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs at $14 each, so the total cost for the basketball coach is:
\[ 8 \times 14 = 112 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we subtract the amount spent by the baseball coach from the amount spent by the basketball coach:
\[ 112 - 27 = 85 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach."
"To find out how many flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of flowers planted.
2. Determine the fraction of flowers that have bloomed.

First, let's calculate the total number of flowers planted:
\[ \text{Total flowers} = \text{Number of rows} \times \text{Flowers per row} = 10 \times 20 = 200 \]

Next, we know that 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed:
\[ \text{Flowers that have bloomed} = \frac{4}{5} \times \text{Total flowers} = \frac{4}{5} \times 200 = 160 \]

So, the number of flowers in Arianna's garden that have bloomed is:

"First, we need to convert the internet speed from kilobytes per second (kb/s) to megabytes per second (Mb/s).

Given:
- Ashley's internet speed = 20 kb/s
- 1 Mb = 1000 kb

So, the speed in Mb/s is:
\[ \text{Speed in Mb/s} = \frac{20 \text{ kb/s}}{1000 \text{ kb/Mb}} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \]

Next, we need to convert this speed to Mb per hour. There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so:
\[ \text{Speed in Mb/h} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \times 3600 \text{ s/h} = 72 \text{ Mb/h} \]

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed in Mb per hour is:
\[ 72 \text{ Mb/h} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the total number of cars towed over the week.

First, we calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days:
- On the first day, the tow truck pulled 10 cars.
- On the second day, the tow truck pulled 10 cars.
- On the third day, the tow truck pulled 10 cars.

So, for the first three days, the total number of cars towed is:
\[ 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \]

Next, we calculate the number of cars towed on the remaining days of the week. There are four remaining days (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday), and the tow truck pulled four fewer cars each day than it did on the first three days. Therefore, the number of cars towed each of these days is:
\[ 10 - 4 = 6 \]

So, for the remaining four days, the total number of cars towed is:
\[ 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 24 \]

Finally, we add the number of cars towed on the first three days to the number of cars towed on the remaining four days to get the total number of cars towed that week:
\[ 30 + 24 = 54 \]

Thus, the total number of cars towed that week is:
\[ 54 \]"
"First, we need to convert Adam's current height from inches to feet to compare it with the required height. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

\[ 40 \text{ inches} = \frac{40}{12} \text{ feet} = 3.3333 \text{ feet} \]

The minimum height required to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. Therefore, Adam needs to grow:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} - 3.3333 \text{ feet} = 0.6667 \text{ feet} \]

Adam grows 2 inches per year, which is equivalent to \(\frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6}\) feet per year. To find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow 0.6667 feet, we divide the required growth by his annual growth rate:

\[ \frac{0.6667 \text{ feet}}{\frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year}} = 0.6667 \times 6 = 4 \text{ years} \]

So, Adam will be tall enough to ride the roller coaster in 4 years."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 cars James sold:
\[ \text{Total cost of cars} = 10 \times \$25,000 = \$250,000 \]

Next, we calculate the amount the company paid to acquire these cars:
\[ \text{Cost to acquire the cars} = 30\% \times \$250,000 = 0.30 \times \$250,000 = \$75,000 \]

Now, we find the total profit James made:
\[ \text{Total profit} = \text{Total cost of cars} - \text{Cost to acquire the cars} = \$250,000 - \$75,000 = \$175,000 \]

James received a 10% commission on the profits:
\[ \text{Commission} = 10\% \times \$175,000 = 0.10 \times \$175,000 = \$17,500 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$17,500 \]"
"First, let's find out how many riders can stay upright on the wave. Since only 25% of the riders can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives, we calculate:

\[ 100 \text{ riders} \times 25\% = 100 \times 0.25 = 25 \text{ riders} \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 25 riders are women. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we calculate:

\[ 25 \text{ riders} \times 60\% = 25 \times 0.60 = 15 \text{ women} \]

Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright is the total number of riders who can stay upright minus the number of women who can stay upright:

\[ 25 \text{ riders} - 15 \text{ women} = 10 \text{ men} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 10 \]"
"First, let's find the price of the gold jewel. Given that the price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel, and the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

\[
\text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600
\]

Next, we need to find the price of the silver jewel. The problem states that the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of the gold jewel. Therefore, we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

\[
\text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
\]

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond jewel, the gold jewel, and the silver jewel:

\[
\text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800
\]

So, the total price for all three jewels is:

\[
\boxed{4800}

"First, let's determine the number of truck stamps Max bought. Since he bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, and he bought 16 snowflake stamps, the number of truck stamps is:

\[ 16 + 3 = 19 \]

Next, we need to find out how many rose stamps Max bought. He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so the number of rose stamps is:

\[ 19 - 9 = 10 \]

Now, to find the total number of stamps Max bought, we add the number of snowflake stamps, truck stamps, and rose stamps together:

\[ 16 + 19 + 10 = 45 \]

So, the total number of stamps Max bought is:

\[ 45 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between him and Bob.

First, let's calculate the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap. Since Bob is driving at 55 mph and Tom is driving at 70 mph, Tom is gaining on Bob at a rate of:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is reducing the 75-mile gap by 15 miles every hour. To find out how long it will take Tom to close the gap completely, we divide the initial gap by the rate at which Tom is closing it:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Gap}}{\text{Closing Rate}} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"First, we need to determine how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate the number of fish Darren caught as follows:

\[ \text{Darren's fish} = \text{Naomi's fish} - 6 = 17 - 6 = 11 \]

Next, we need to find out how many fish Tommy caught. According to the problem, Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. Since Darren caught 11 fish, we can calculate the number of fish Tommy caught as follows:

\[ \text{Tommy's fish} = \text{Darren's fish} + 3 = 11 + 3 = 14 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 14."
"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the cost per class and then find out how many classes he can afford to miss.

First, we calculate the cost per class:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of classes}} = \frac{60}{10} = 6 \]

According to the parents' condition, they will not sign him up again if the cost per class exceeds $10. Since the cost per class is $6, which is less than $10, Manny can miss any number of classes as long as the cost per class remains less than $10.

Therefore, Manny can miss all 10 classes and still meet the parents' condition.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel over a week.

First, let's find out how many customers Jewel processes in a day:
- Jewel processes 50 customers per day.

Since Julie processes customers twice as fast as Jewel, we calculate the number of customers Julie processes per day:
- Julie processes \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \) customers per day.

Next, we calculate the total number of customers processed by both in one day:
- Total customers per day = Jewel's customers + Julie's customers
- Total customers per day = 50 + 100 = 150 customers.

Now, we need to find out the total number of customers processed in a week (7 days):
- Total customers per week = Total customers per day \(\times\) 7
- Total customers per week = 150 \(\times\) 7 = 1050 customers.

Therefore, the total weekly production for the two is 1050 customers."
"First, let's determine how far Reggie ran. Since Paisley ran 4 miles and Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, we calculate:

\[ \text{Reggie's distance} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. So, to find out how far Lynn ran, we subtract 3 miles from Reggie's distance:

\[ \text{Lynn's distance} = 20 - 3 = 17 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles."
"First, let's find the cost of one apple and one orange.

The cost of one apple is $5.20 / 4 = $1.30.
The cost of one orange is $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.

Now, to find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges, we calculate:

Cost of 5 apples = 5 * $1.30 = $6.50.
Cost of 5 oranges = 5 * $1.10 = $5.50.

Total cost = Cost of 5 apples + Cost of 5 oranges = $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

So, the final numerical answer is $12.00."
"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \(V\) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the hole:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel one cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \(T\) it will take him to dig the hole is:

\[ T = \text{volume} \times \text{time per cubic foot} \]
\[ T = 72 \times 3 = 216 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 216 seconds."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each additional feature:

1. King cab upgrade: $7,500
2. Leather seats: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so $7,500 / 3 = $2,500
3. Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats, so $2,500 - $500 = $2,000
4. Upgraded exterior light package: $1,500

Now, let's add up all the extra costs:
- King cab upgrade: $7,500
- Leather seats: $2,500
- Running boards: $2,000
- Upgraded exterior light package: $1,500

Total extra cost = $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1,500 = $13,500

Now, let's add the base price of the truck to the total extra cost:
- Base price of the truck: $30,000
- Total extra cost: $13,500

Total cost = $30,000 + $13,500 = $43,500

The final numerical answer is $43,500."

"First, let's calculate the cost of the suits:
- James buys 10 suits.
- Each suit costs $750.
- Total cost for suits = 10 * $750 = $7500.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the dress pants:
- The cost of each dress pant is 1/5 of the cost of a suit.
- Cost of each dress pant = $750 / 5 = $150.
- James buys 10 dress pants.
- Total cost for dress pants = 10 * $150 = $1500.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the dress shirts:
- James buys 3 dress shirts per suit.
- Since he buys 10 suits, he buys 10 * 3 = 30 dress shirts.
- Each dress shirt costs $60.
- Total cost for dress shirts = 30 * $60 = $1800.

Finally, let's add up all the costs:
- Total cost = Cost of suits + Cost of dress pants + Cost of dress shirts
- Total cost = $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800.

The final numerical answer is $10800."
"To calculate the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we need to consider the daily averages and the number of days in February.

The news website publishes an average of 20 political and weather news articles every day. Therefore, in February (which has 28 days), the total number of articles published by the news website is:
\[ 20 \text{ articles/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 560 \text{ articles} \]

The sister company publishes an average of 10 business news articles daily. Therefore, in February, the total number of articles published by the sister company is:
\[ 10 \text{ articles/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 280 \text{ articles} \]

Adding the articles published by both websites in February gives:
\[ 560 \text{ articles} + 280 \text{ articles} = 840 \text{ articles} \]

So, the total number of articles the two websites published together in February is:
\[ 840 \]"

\[ \frac{64}{2} = 32 \]

Their son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so her age is:
\[ 32 - 3 = 29 \]

Therefore, Steve's son's wife is 29 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 29 \]"
"To find the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions, we first need to determine the amount of flour in one bag.

Given that one bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, we can calculate the total amount of flour in one bag as follows:
\[ 8 \text{ portions} \times 2 \text{ kilograms per portion} = 16 \text{ kilograms} \]

Now, to find the total amount of flour in three bags, we multiply the amount of flour in one bag by 3:
\[ 16 \text{ kilograms per bag} \times 3 \text{ bags} = 48 \text{ kilograms} \]

So, the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions is 48 kilograms."
"First, we calculate the distance Alisa biked. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Alisa:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Alisa}} = 12 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4.5 \, \text{hours} = 54 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance Stanley biked:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Stanley}} = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2.5 \, \text{hours} = 25 \, \text{miles} \]

To find the total distance biked by both Alisa and Stanley, we add their distances together:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Alisa}} + \text{Distance}_{\text{Stanley}} = 54 \, \text{miles} + 25 \, \text{miles} = 79 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for Bill to dig through the soil and the clay separately, and then sum these times.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil:
- Bill digs at a rate of 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He needs to dig 24 feet of soil.

Time to dig through soil = \(\frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}\).

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the clay:
- Bill digs at half the rate through clay, which is 2 feet per hour.
- He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.

Time to dig through clay = \(\frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours}\).

Now, we sum the times to find the total time to dig the well:
Total time = Time through soil + Time through clay
Total time = 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

The final numerical answer is:

- Howie and his teacher make up 2 people.
- There are 25 classmates.

First, we calculate the total number of people:
\[ 2 \text{ (Howie and his teacher)} + 25 \text{ (classmates)} = 27 \text{ people} \]

Since Howie wants to get one vanilla and one chocolate cupcake for each person, we need to multiply the number of people by 2 (one vanilla and one chocolate):
\[ 27 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ cupcakes per person} = 54 \text{ cupcakes} \]

Therefore, the total number of cupcakes Howie should buy is:
\[ 54 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of likes Fishio received three weeks after posting her selfie. We know that after 1 week, she received 2000 likes. Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times the initial number of likes.

Initial number of likes = 2000
Number of likes after 3 weeks = 70 * initial number of likes
Number of likes after 3 weeks = 70 * 2000 = 140000

Now, if she received 20000 more new likes recently, we add these to the number of likes she had after 3 weeks.

Total number of likes = Number of likes after 3 weeks + 20000
Total number of likes = 140000 + 20000 = 160000

So, the total number of Instagram likes is 160000."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the pomegranates Clara bought on Tuesday.

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the total cost before the voucher discount is:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \]

She got a $2 voucher discount, so the final cost for Clara on Tuesday is:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pomegranates Sheila bought on Wednesday.

The price per pomegranate on Wednesday was $30, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \]

The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount is:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the final cost for Sheila on Wednesday is:
\[ 600 - 60 = 540 \]

Now, we find the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila:
\[ 540 - 398 = 142 \]

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:
\[ \boxed{142} \]"
"Let's denote the total amount Ariadne earned from selling green hats in the first month as \( G \). According to the problem, the sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount earned from selling green hats. Therefore, we can write:

\[ 400 = \frac{1}{2} G \]

From this equation, we can solve for \( G \):

\[ G = 400 \times 2 = 800 \]

So, Ariadne earned $800 from green hats in the first month. The total sales in the first month are the sum of the sales from red and green hats:

\[ \text{Total sales in the first month} = 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

In the second month, her sales were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales of the first month:

\[ \text{Total sales in the second month} = \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \]

To find the total amount she made in two months, we add the total sales of the first month and the total sales of the second month:

\[ \text{Total sales in two months} = 1200 + 900 = 2100 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2100 \]"
"To determine how much James paid for the horse-drawn carriage, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total time hired:**
   - James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM.
   - Total time hired = 9 PM - 5 PM = 4 hours.

2. **Account for the free hour:**
   - James gets 1 hour free.
   - Effective paid hours = Total time hired - Free hour = 4 hours - 1 hour = 3 hours.

3. **Calculate the cost for each paid hour:**
   - The first paid hour costs $15.
   - Each subsequent hour costs twice the previous hour's cost.
   - Cost for the first hour = $15.
   - Cost for the second hour = 2 * $15 = $30.
   - Cost for the third hour = 2 * $30 = $60.

4. **Sum the costs of the paid hours:**
   - Total cost = Cost of first hour + Cost of second hour + Cost of third hour
   - Total cost = $15 + $30 + $60 = $105.

Therefore, James paid $105 for the carriage service."
"To find out how many dollars were withheld from Sally’s wage, we need to calculate the difference between the amount in her bank account at the end of the week and the amount she should have in her bank account if she had received her full weekly wage.

The amount in her bank account at the end of the week is $420.
The amount she should have in her bank account if she had received her full weekly wage is $300.

The difference, which represents the amount withheld, is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Amount withheld} = \text{Amount in bank account at the end} - \text{Amount she should have} \]
\[ \text{Amount withheld} = 420 - 300 \]
\[ \text{Amount withheld} = 120 \]

So, the number of dollars withheld from Sally’s wage is $120."
"First, let's determine the total number of deviled egg halves Lori needs. Since each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves and she is inviting 16 guests, the total number of deviled egg halves is:

\[ 3 \text{ halves/guest} \times 16 \text{ guests} = 48 \text{ halves} \]

Since each deviled egg is made from 2 halves, the total number of whole eggs needed is:

\[ \frac{48 \text{ halves}}{2 \text{ halves/egg}} = 24 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we need to find out how many dozens of eggs this is. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, the number of dozens of eggs Lori needs is:

The final numerical answer is $330,000."
"First, let's determine the cooking times for each item:

- It took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice.
- It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so the cooking time for pork is \(30 + 20 = 50\) minutes.
- The beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is \(30 + 50 = 80\) minutes. Therefore, the cooking time for beans is \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) minutes.

Now, to find the total cooking time for all the food, we add the cooking times for rice, beans, and pork:

\[30 + 50 + 40 = 120\]

So, the total time it took to cook all the food is 120 minutes."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts:
- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for this mixture is \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts:
- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for this mixture is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
- The difference is \( 10 - 7 = 3 \) dollars.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's denote:
- \( s \) as the number of sheep,
- \( g \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we know:
1. Each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, and the total number of legs is 70.
2. Each sheep and each goose has one head, and the total number of heads is 20.

This gives us the following equations:
\[ 4s + 2g = 70 \]
\[ s + g = 20 \]

We can solve this system of equations step by step. First, we can simplify the first equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2s + g = 35 \]

Now we have the simplified system:
\[ 2s + g = 35 \]
\[ s + g = 20 \]

Next, we can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate \( g \):
\[ (2s + g) - (s + g) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2s + g - s - g = 15 \]
\[ s = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep is \( s = 15 \).

To verify, we can substitute \( s = 15 \) back into the second equation:
\[ 15 + g = 20 \]
\[ g = 5 \]

Now we check the number of legs:
\[ 4s + 2g = 4(15) + 2(5) = 60 + 10 = 70 \]

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"

Christina has a total of 30 days in the month. She had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the rest were neutral. This means the number of neutral days is:
\[ 30 - 12 - 8 = 10 \]

The first eight days were good, the next eight days were bad, and the next eight days were neutral. This means the number of good days recorded so far is:
\[ 8 \text{ (first eight days)} + 12 \text{ (remaining good days)} = 20 \]

The next three days are described as good, neutral, and good. So, the number of good days in these three days is:

"First, let's determine how many toys James needs initially. He currently has 4 toys for 4 dogs, so each dog has one toy. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so he needs 8 more toys to have one for each of the 12 dogs (4 original + 8 new).

So, after the first purchase, James has 4 (original) + 8 (new) = 12 toys.

Next, James sees that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left. This means there are now 12 * 2 = 24 dogs in the shelter. Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 24 toys.

So, after the second purchase, James has 12 (after first purchase) + 24 (new) = 36 toys.

Finally, 3 dogs are gone, so James no longer needs toys for those 3 dogs. Therefore, he has 36 - 3 = 33 toys.

The total number of toys James needs is 33."

Total weight: Jack's weight + Weight of 8 other adults
Total weight = 80 kg + 640 kg = 720 kg

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg. To find out by how much they will exceed the maximum load, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight.

Exceeding weight = Total weight - Maximum load
Exceeding weight = 720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg

The final numerical answer is 20 kg."
"Let's denote the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has as \( C \).

Given:
- Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so if Max has \( M \) cookies, then Katarina has \( M - 5 \).
- Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so \( M = C + 12 \).
- Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so if Max has \( M \) cookies, then Summer has \( M + 23 \).
- Katarina has 68 cookies, so \( M - 5 = 68 \).

From the equation \( M - 5 = 68 \), we can solve for \( M \):
\[ M = 68 + 5 = 73 \]

Now, we know Max has 73 cookies. Using the relationship \( M = C + 12 \), we can solve for \( C \):
\[ 73 = C + 12 \]
\[ C = 73 - 12 = 61 \]

So, the Cookie Monster has 61 cookies. Now we can find out how many cookies Summer has:
\[ M + 23 = 73 + 23 = 96 \]

Now we have:
- Katarina has 68 cookies.
- Max has 73 cookies.
- The Cookie Monster has 61 cookies.
- Summer has 96 cookies.

To find the total number of cookies, we sum these amounts:
\[ 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298 \]

The total number of cookies they have is:
\[ \boxed{298} \]"
"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, so the extension is \( 0.5x \) cm.

She also adds 20 cm to the bottom of the dress with a lace trim.

The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm.

So, the equation representing the final length is:
\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Divide both sides by 1.5:
\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} \]
\[ x = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 80 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time Chris spent mowing half of his lawn in ""turtle"" mode and the time he spent mowing the other half in ""rabbit"" mode.

First, let's convert the time for ""turtle"" mode to minutes:
- ""Turtle"" mode: 1 hour = 60 minutes

Next, let's convert the time for ""rabbit"" mode to minutes:
- ""Rabbit"" mode: 40 minutes

Chris mows half of his lawn in each mode. Therefore, the time spent mowing half of the lawn in ""turtle"" mode is:
- Time in ""turtle"" mode: 60 minutes / 2 = 30 minutes

The time spent mowing half of the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode is:
- Time in ""rabbit"" mode: 40 minutes / 2 = 20 minutes

Now, we add the time spent in both modes to find the total time:
- Total time: 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes

Therefore, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is 50 minutes."
"First, let's calculate the total time John and Jack have already spent walking.

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( Tr \).

Given that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can write:
\[ T = Tr + 7 \]

Also, given that the combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44, we can write:
\[ T + T + Tr + Tr + Tr = 44 \]
\[ 2T + 3Tr = 44 \]

Substituting \( T = Tr + 7 \) into the second equation:
\[ 2(Tr + 7) + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 2Tr + 14 + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr = 30 \]
\[ Tr = 6 \]

Now, substituting \( Tr = 6 \) back into the equation \( T = Tr + 7 \):
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, the age of one of the twins is 13 years."

- Reading homework: 40 minutes
- History homework: 20 minutes

Total homework time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, 3 hours is equal to 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's find out how many minutes John has left for napping:

Total minutes before dinner - Total homework time = Minutes for napping
180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes

So, John has 100 minutes to nap."
"First, let's determine the cost of the candies. We know that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40. Therefore, the cost of the five lollipops is:

\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

This means the cost of the four candies is:

\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of one candy. Since four candies cost $1.20, the cost of one candy is:

\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Now, we can calculate the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:

\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

And the cost of 10 candies is:

\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:

\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 7.00 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of coins each person has saved over ten years and then sum these amounts.

First, let's determine how many coins Rong has saved in ten years:
- Rong saves 20 coins per month.
- There are 12 months in a year, so in ten years, there are \(10 \times 12 = 120\) months.
- Therefore, the total number of coins Rong has saved is \(20 \times 120 = 2400\) coins.

Next, let's determine how many coins Neil has saved in ten years:
- Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong per month. This means Neil saves \(20 + \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 20 + 8 = 28\) coins per month.
- In ten years, Neil saves \(28 \times 120 = 3360\) coins.

Now, we sum the coins saved by Rong and Neil over ten years:
- Total coins saved by Rong and Neil together is \(2400 + 3360 = 5760\) coins.

"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Since each vaccine costs $20 and John needs 2 vaccines, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \]

Next, let's denote the cost of the heartworm check as \( H \). According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as \( T \). Therefore, we have:
\[ H = 0.6T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + H \]

Since \( H = 0.6T \), we can substitute \( H \) in the total bill equation:
\[ T = 40 + 0.6T \]

To find \( T \), we need to solve this equation. Subtract \( 0.6T \) from both sides:
\[ T - 0.6T = 40 \]
\[ 0.4T = 40 \]

Now, divide both sides by 0.4:
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.4} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, let's determine the price of each type of fruit:

- The price of one apple is $0.5.
- The price of one banana is twice the price of one apple, so it is \(2 \times 0.5 = $1.0\).
- The price of one orange is three times the price of one banana, so it is \(3 \times 1.0 = $3.0\).

Next, we calculate the total cost for one crate of fruit, which contains 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges:

- The cost for 5 bananas is \(5 \times 1.0 = $5.0\).
- The cost for 12 apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = $6.0\).
- The cost for 7 oranges is \(7 \times 3.0 = $21.0\).

"To find the percent of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the percentage of water used for industrial purposes by the city.
2. Subtract this percentage from 100% to find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes.

First, we know that Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. Out of this 40%, 80% is used for industrial purposes. Therefore, the percentage of water used for industrial purposes by the city is:
\[ 40\% \times 80\% = 40\% \times 0.80 = 32\% \]

Next, to find the percentage of water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the industrial usage percentage from the total usage percentage:
\[ 40\% - 32\% = 8\% \]

So, the percent of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is:

"First, let's calculate how much candy Ginger eats in two weeks. Since there are 14 days in two weeks and Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy each day, we can calculate the total amount of candy Ginger eats as follows:

\[ \text{Ginger's candy eaten} = 4 \, \text{pieces/day} \times 14 \, \text{days} = 56 \, \text{pieces} \]

Since Ginger started with 100 pieces of candy, after two weeks, Ginger will have:

\[ \text{Ginger's remaining candy} = 100 \, \text{pieces} - 56 \, \text{pieces} = 44 \, \text{pieces} \]

Next, let's calculate how much candy Amy eats in two weeks. Since Amy eats 3 pieces of candy each day, we can calculate the total amount of candy Amy eats as follows:

\[ \text{Amy's candy eaten} = 3 \, \text{pieces/day} \times 14 \, \text{days} = 42 \, \text{pieces} \]

Since Amy started with 100 pieces of candy, after two weeks, Amy will have:

\[ \text{Amy's remaining candy} = 100 \, \text{pieces} - 42 \, \text{pieces} = 58 \, \text{pieces} \]

Now, to find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger after two weeks, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy:

\[ \text{Difference} = 58 \, \text{pieces} - 44 \, \text{pieces} = 14 \, \text{pieces} \]

So, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy after two weeks."

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the same amount of blueberries at the store. The cost per pound at the store is $2.5.

The cost for 30 pounds at the store is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.5 \text{ per pound} = \$75 \]

Now, to find out how much James saved by picking the blueberries himself, we subtract the cost he incurred from the cost of buying them at the store:
\[ \$75 - \$65 = \$10 \]

So, James saved:
\[ \$10 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the new price of each computer after a 10% increase.

Original price per computer = $700
Increase in price = 10% of $700 = 0.10 * $700 = $70

New price per computer = Original price + Increase = $700 + $70 = $770

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of money paid for 500 computers at the new price.

Total amount paid = New price per computer * Number of computers
Total amount paid = $770 * 500 = $385,000

The final numerical answer is $385,000."
"First, let's calculate the calories from the eggs. John uses 6 eggs, and each egg is 75 calories. So the total calories from the eggs are:
\[ 6 \text{ eggs} \times 75 \text{ calories/egg} = 450 \text{ calories} \]

Next, let's calculate the calories from the cheese. John uses 2 oz of cheese, and each ounce of cheese is 120 calories. So the total calories from the cheese are:
\[ 2 \text{ oz} \times 120 \text{ calories/oz} = 240 \text{ calories} \]

Then, let's calculate the calories from the ham. John uses 2 oz of ham, and each ounce of ham is 40 calories. So the total calories from the ham are:
\[ 2 \text{ oz} \times 40 \text{ calories/oz} = 80 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we add up all the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham to get the total calories in the omelet:
\[ 450 \text{ calories} + 240 \text{ calories} + 80 \text{ calories} = 770 \text{ calories} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the number of people who receive interviews. Since 30% of the 100 people receive interviews, we have:

\[ 100 \times 0.30 = 30 \text{ people} \]

Next, we calculate the number of people who receive a job offer. Since 20% of the 30 people who receive interviews get a job offer, we have:

\[ 30 \times 0.20 = 6 \text{ people} \]

Finally, we determine how many of those who receive a job offer accept the position. Since a third of the 6 people who receive a job offer accept the position, we have:

\[ 6 \times \frac{1}{3} = 2 \text{ people} \]

So, the number of people who accept the position is 2."

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of taps Helga makes with both feet over the 5-minute period, considering the different tap rates for different parts of her dance.

First, let's calculate the number of taps when her arms are at her sides:
- Right foot tap rate: 300 taps per minute
- Left foot tap rate: 250 taps per minute
- Combined tap rate: 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute

For 3 minutes (since she raises her arms for 2 minutes, she has her arms at her sides for 5 - 2 = 3 minutes):
\[ 550 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 1650 \text{ taps} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of taps when her arms are raised:
- Right foot tap rate: 200 taps per minute
- Left foot tap rate: 200 taps per minute
- Combined tap rate: 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute

For 2 minutes:
\[ 400 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 800 \text{ taps} \]

Now, we add the taps from both parts of the dance:
\[ 1650 \text{ taps} + 800 \text{ taps} = 2450 \text{ taps} \]

The combined total number of times that Helga taps both of her feet is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost for Ron if he decides to fix the pothole himself.

1. Fine for unauthorized road maintenance: $120
2. Cost of 3 buckets of asphalt: 3 buckets * $25 per bucket = $75

Total cost for Ron if he fixes the pothole himself:
$120 + $75 = $195

Now, let's calculate the damage that would be done to Ron's car if the pothole is not fixed:
$450

To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we subtract the total cost of fixing the pothole from the potential damage to his car:
$450 - $195 = $255

So, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole himself."

- Baby chairs sent: 13

Total chairs sent for repair = 20 + 13 = 33

Now, let's calculate the number of chairs left:

Chairs left = Total chairs initially - Total chairs sent for repair
Chairs left = 193 - 33 = 160

The restaurant has 160 chairs left."
"First, let's determine the total number of slices of pizza ordered. Since each of the five friends ordered one pizza and each pizza had 12 slices, the total number of slices is:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate how many slices Bryce and two of his friends ate. They ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizzas:
\[ 2 \times \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Then, we calculate how many slices the remaining two friends ate. They ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizzas:
\[ 2 \times \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Now, we add the slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends and the slices eaten by the other two friends:
\[ 16 + 18 = 34 \]

Finally, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices to find out how many slices are left:
\[ 60 - 34 = 26 \]

So, the number of slices of pizza left is:
\[ 26 \]"
"First, let's determine the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages. The cat takes 30 minutes to eat 9 sausages. The dog takes \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the time the cat takes, so the dog's time is:

\[
\text{Dog's time} = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we need to find the average time both the cat and the dog take to eat the sausages. The average time is calculated by adding the times together and then dividing by 2:

\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{\text{Cat's time} + \text{Dog's time}}{2} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}

"First, let's convert Topher's shoe length to inches only. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, Topher's shoe length of 8-feet and 4-inches is:

\[ 8 \times 12 + 4 = 96 + 4 = 100 \text{ inches} \]

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( x \) inches. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches. Let's confirm this by substituting \( x = 10 \) back into the original equation:

\[ 9(10) + 10 = 90 + 10 = 100 \]

The equation holds true, so the length of one of Bobby's shoes is indeed 10 inches. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 10 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of windows in the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars.
- Each student's car has 4 windows.
- Therefore, the total number of windows in the students' cars is \(64 \times 4 = 256\) windows.

Next, let's calculate the number of windows in the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each teacher's car has 2 windows.
- Therefore, the total number of windows in the teachers' cars is \(32 \times 2 = 64\) windows.

Now, let's calculate the number of windows Hannah smashes in the students' cars:
- She smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.
- A quarter of 256 windows is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64\) windows.

Next, let's calculate the number of windows Hannah smashes in the teachers' cars:
- She smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows.
- 3/4ths of 64 windows is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48\) windows.

Finally, let's add the number of windows smashed in both the students' and teachers' cars:
- The total number of windows smashed is \(64 + 48 = 112\).

"To find the percentage of blue spools, we first need to calculate the total number of spools and the number of blue spools.

Candy has:
- 15 light blue spools
- 45 dark blue spools
- 40 light green spools
- 50 dark green spools

The total number of spools is:
\[ 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150 \]

The total number of blue spools (light blue and dark blue) is:
\[ 15 + 45 = 60 \]

To find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplifying the fraction:
\[ \frac{60}{150} = \frac{2}{5} \]

Now, calculate the percentage:
\[ \left( \frac{2}{5} \right) \times 100 = 40\% \]

So, the percentage of blue spools is:
\[ 40\% \]"

"First, let's determine Dora's father's age. According to the problem, Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. Since Dora is 15 years old, we can calculate her father's age as follows:

\[
\text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8 = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38
\]

Next, we need to find Dora's mother's age. The problem states that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. Therefore, we can calculate her mother's age as follows:

\[
\text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4 = 38 - 4 = 34
\]

Now, we can find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother by adding their ages together:

\[
\text{Total combined age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87

\[ 50\% \times 100 = 50 \]

So, candidate C received 50 votes."
"First, let's determine how many apples Beck has initially. Since Boris has 100 apples and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, we can calculate the number of apples Beck has as follows:

\[ \text{Beck's initial apples} = \text{Boris's apples} - 23 = 100 - 23 = 77 \]

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. So, we need to update the number of apples each person has after this transaction:

\[ \text{Boris's apples after giving 10 to Beck} = 100 - 10 = 90 \]
\[ \text{Beck's apples after receiving 10 from Boris} = 77 + 10 = 87 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after this transaction:

\[ \text{Difference in apples} = \text{Boris's apples} - \text{Beck's apples} = 90 - 87 = 3 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of students in each class.
2. Calculate the number of girls in each class.
3. Subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class to find the number of boys.

First, since the total number of students in the two classes is 80 and each class has the same number of students, we can find the number of students in each class by dividing the total number of students by 2:

\[ \text{Number of students in each class} = \frac{80}{2} = 40 \]

Next, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. Therefore, the number of girls in each class is:

\[ \text{Number of girls in each class} = 40 \times \frac{40}{100} = 40 \times 0.4 = 16 \]

Finally, to find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many students would be in each group if the activity is divided into 12 groups of equal size.

Given:
- Total number of students = 54
- Total number of groups required = 12

To find the number of students per group when divided into 12 groups:
\[ \text{Number of students per group} = \frac{54}{12} \]

Perform the division:
\[ \frac{54}{12} = 4.5 \]

Since the number of students per group must be a whole number, it's clear that 12 groups of equal size are not possible with 54 students. 

Now, to find out how many more groups are needed to form, we need to determine the smallest number of groups that can accommodate 54 students with each group having an equal number of students. This number is the smallest divisor of 54 that is greater than 6 (since 6 groups were initially considered).

The divisors of 54 are: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54.

The smallest divisor greater than 6 is 9. Therefore, 9 groups of 6 students each can be formed.

To find out how many more groups are needed:
\[ \text{Number of additional groups needed} = 9 - 6 = 3 \]

Thus, the number of additional groups needed is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of chairs rented during weekdays and weekends over two 4-week months.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during a single weekday and a single weekend day:
- Weekday rental: 60 chairs per day
- Weekend rental: 100 chairs per day

Next, we calculate the total number of chairs rented in one week:
- There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a week.
- Total chairs rented in a week = (5 days * 60 chairs/day) + (2 days * 100 chairs/day)

Now, let's calculate the total chairs rented in one 4-week month:
- Total chairs rented in one 4-week month = (Total chairs rented in one week) * 4

Finally, we calculate the total chairs rented in two 4-week months:
- Total chairs rented in two 4-week months = (Total chairs rented in one 4-week month) * 2

Let's do the calculations:
- Chairs rented in one week = (5 * 60) + (2 * 100) = 300 + 200 = 500 chairs
- Chairs rented in one 4-week month = 500 * 4 = 2000 chairs
- Chairs rented in two 4-week months = 2000 * 2 = 4000 chairs

Therefore, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is 4000 chairs."
"To find the final number of bananas Gunther found in the pile, we need to follow the sequence of events and perform the necessary calculations step by step.

1. Initially, Gunther had 48 bananas.
2. Arnold stole half of the bananas:
   \[
   \text{Bananas stolen by Arnold} = \frac{48}{2} = 24
   \]
   \[
   \text{Bananas left} = 48 - 24 = 24
   \]
3. The next day, Gunther added 25 more bananas:
   \[
   \text{Bananas after adding 25} = 24 + 25 = 49
   \]
4. The next evening, Arnold stole another 12 bananas:
   \[
   \text{Bananas left} = 49 - 12 = 37
   \]
5. On the third day, Gunther added another 6 bananas:
   \[
   \text{Bananas after adding 6} = 37 + 6 = 43
   \]

Therefore, the final number of bananas Gunther found in the pile is 43."
"To find out how much each roommate will pay per year for electricity, we first need to calculate the total annual cost of the electricity bill and then divide that by the number of roommates.

The monthly cost of the electricity bill is $100. Therefore, the annual cost is:
\[ 100 \times 12 = 1200 \text{ dollars} \]

Since there are 4 roommates, each roommate will pay:
\[ \frac{1200}{4} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

So, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity."
"First, let's determine the total number of glasses and plates Jeff initially sent.

Jeff sent 8 dozen glasses. Since one dozen equals 12, the total number of glasses sent is:
\[ 8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ glasses} \]

Jeff also sent 4 dozen plates. The total number of plates sent is:
\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ plates} \]

Next, we need to account for the broken items. 10 glasses and 6 plates were broken. Therefore, the number of glasses and plates that are not broken are:
\[ 96 - 10 = 86 \text{ glasses} \]
\[ 48 - 6 = 42 \text{ plates} \]

Now, we add the number of glasses and plates that are not broken to find the total number of glasses and plates Jeff has now:
\[ 86 + 42 = 128 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many small stickers Lorraine trades for large buttons. She starts with 30 small stickers and trades 90% of them:

\[ 30 \times 0.90 = 27 \text{ small stickers} \]

Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons from trading 27 small stickers.

Next, let's calculate how many large stickers she trades for large buttons. She starts with 40 large stickers and trades 50% of them:

\[ 40 \times 0.50 = 20 \text{ large stickers} \]

Since each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons, and a large button is worth three small buttons, trading 20 large stickers for large buttons gives her 20 large buttons.

Now, let's determine how many large stickers she has left after trading 20 of them for large buttons. She started with 40 large stickers and traded 20, so she has:

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ large stickers} \]

She trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons. Since each large sticker is worth three small buttons, trading 20 large stickers gives her:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ small buttons} \]

Now, let's sum up all the buttons Lorraine has by the end. She has 27 small buttons from trading small stickers, 20 large buttons from trading large stickers, and 60 small buttons from trading the remaining large stickers. Since a large button is worth three small buttons, the 20 large buttons are equivalent to:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ small buttons} \]

So, the total number of buttons she has is:

\[ 27 + 60 + 60 = 147 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 147 \]"
"To find out how many matches Joey played in one week, we need to add up the matches he played on each day of the week mentioned.

- On Monday, Joey played 2 matches.
- On Friday, Joey played 1 match.
- On Saturday, Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday. Since he played 2 matches on Monday, on Saturday he played \(2 \times 2 = 4\) matches.

Now, we add the matches from each day:
\[ 2 \text{ (Monday)} + 1 \text{ (Friday)} + 4 \text{ (Saturday)} = 7 \]

Therefore, Joey played a total of 7 matches in one week."
"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x \). The total number of votes cast is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is \( x + 2x = 3x \).

We know the total number of people on the council is 33, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x \):
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Thus, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 22 \).

\[
\boxed{22}

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Extra-small (XS) shirts**: 11 students need size extra-small.
2. **Small (S) shirts**: Twice as many students need size small as extra small. Therefore, the number of students needing size small is \(2 \times 11 = 22\).
3. **Medium (M) shirts**: Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size medium is \(22 - 4 = 18\).
4. **Large (L) shirts**: Half as many students need size large as size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size large is \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\).
5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts**: Six more students need size extra-large than large. Therefore, the number of students needing size extra-large is \(9 + 6 = 15\).

Now, we sum up all the students to find the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order:
\[ 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75 \]

The total number of shirts Krissa ordered is 75."

\[ \text{Total number of songs} = \text{Number of playlists} \times \text{Number of songs per playlist} \]
\[ \text{Total number of songs} = 20 \times 300 = 6000 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of hours:
\[ \text{Total number of hours} = \text{Total number of songs} \times \text{Length of each song} \]
\[ \text{Total number of hours} = 6000 \times 10 = 60000 \]

So, the 20 playlists will last a total of 60,000 hours."
"First, let's find out how many people think horse #2 will win. 20% of 50 people is calculated as follows:

\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win. This leaves us with:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

people who do not think horse #2 will win. Next, we need to find out how many of these 40 people think horse #7 will win. 60% of these 40 people is:

\[ 0.60 \times 40 = 24 \]

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win. This leaves us with:

\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \]

people who do not think horse #7 will win. These 16 people think horse #12 will win. Therefore, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is:

\[ 16 \]"
"To find the total number of puppies Jana has, we can work backwards from the information given.

We know that one third of the Pomeranian puppies are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. Therefore, the total number of Pomeranian puppies is three times the number of girls, which is:
\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \]

Since these 18 Pomeranian puppies represent two thirds of Jana's total puppies, we can find the total number of puppies by setting up the following equation:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Total Puppies} = 18 \]

To find the total number of puppies, we solve for the total:
\[ \text{Total Puppies} = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 27 \]

So, Jana has 27 puppies in total."
"First, let's determine how much money Jayden has after his sister gives him half of her allowance.

Jayden's sister gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is:
\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

So, Jayden now has:
\[ 70 + 45 = 115 \]

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the amount he has from the cost of the camera:
\[ 200 - 115 = 85 \]

Therefore, Jayden needs an additional $85 to buy the camera."
"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The first house needs \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the second house, so the first house needs \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases.
- The third house needs double the first house, so the third house needs \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) cases.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{5}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{5} \):
\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{5} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. The third house needs double the first house, which is:
\[ 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = 2 \times \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many fruits George has, we first need to calculate how many pears he has based on the information that he has 45% more pears than bananas.

Given:
- George has 200 bananas.
- He has 45% more pears than bananas.

First, calculate 45% of the number of bananas:
\[ 45\% \text{ of } 200 = 0.45 \times 200 = 90 \]

So, George has 90 more pears than the 200 bananas. Therefore, the number of pears is:
\[ 200 + 90 = 290 \]

Now, add the number of bananas and pears to find the total number of fruits:

"First, let's calculate the total hours Tatiana has available over the weekend:

\[ \text{Total hours} = 7 \text{ (Saturday)} + 5 \text{ (Sunday)} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we subtract the time she spends reading:

\[ \text{Remaining time after reading} = 12 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

She plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time:

\[ \text{Time spent on video games} = \frac{1}{3} \times 9 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the time she spends playing soccer:

"To calculate the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to consider the time spent driving to the museum, the time spent at the museum, and the time spent driving back home.

First, let's calculate the time spent driving to the museum. The distance to the museum is 150 miles and Jack drives at a speed of 75 mph. The time spent driving to the museum is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time spent driving to the museum is:

\[ \text{Time to museum} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Since the trip back home is the same distance and at the same speed, the time spent driving back home is also 2 hours.

Jack spends 6 hours at the museum. Therefore, the total time Jack is gone from home is the sum of the time spent driving to the museum, the time spent at the museum, and the time spent driving back home:

\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time to museum} + \text{Time at museum} + \text{Time back home} \]
\[ \text{Total time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Total time} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

"First, we need to calculate the total number of wheels required for the cars and motorcycles.

For the cars:
Henry needs 4 wheels for each car, and he has 57 cars.
\[ 4 \text{ wheels/car} \times 57 \text{ cars} = 228 \text{ wheels} \]

For the motorcycles:
Henry needs 2 wheels for each motorcycle, and he has 73 motorcycles.
\[ 2 \text{ wheels/motorcycle} \times 73 \text{ motorcycles} = 146 \text{ wheels} \]

Now, we add the wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles to find the total number of wheels required:
\[ 228 \text{ wheels} + 146 \text{ wheels} = 374 \text{ wheels} \]

Henry has 650 wheels in the box. To find out how many wheels will be left after assembling all the toys, we subtract the total number of wheels required from the number of wheels Henry has:

"First, let's break down the information given:

- Mike has 600 movies in total.
- A third of the movies are in various series, which means \( \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \) movies are in series.
- The remaining movies are \( 600 - 200 = 400 \) movies.
- 40% of the remaining 400 movies are older movies, which means \( 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \) movies are older.
- The rest of the remaining movies are not in series or older, which is \( 400 - 160 = 240 \) movies.

Now, let's calculate the cost:

- The cost for the series movies is $6 each, so the total cost for the series movies is \( 200 \times 6 = 1200 \) dollars.
- The cost for the older movies is $5 each, so the total cost for the older movies is \( 160 \times 5 = 800 \) dollars.
- The cost for the remaining movies is $10 each, so the total cost for the remaining movies is \( 240 \times 10 = 2400 \) dollars.

Adding these costs together gives the total cost to replace the movies:

\[ 1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 4400."

"First, let's calculate the distance the Llesis family drove. They drove for 6 hours at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.

\[ \text{Distance driven} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 50 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to calculate the hiking speed. The problem states that the hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.

\[ \text{Hiking speed} = \frac{50}{2} - 5 = 25 - 5 = 20 \, \text{miles/hour} \]

They hiked for 1.5 hours at this speed.

\[ \text{Distance hiked} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 20 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, to find the total distance to their vacation spot, we add the distance driven and the distance hiked.

\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance driven} + \text{Distance hiked} = 300 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 330 \, \text{miles} \]

The final numerical answer is 330 miles."
"Let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumps on as \( E_e \) and the number of berries she collects as \( B_e \). Ava jumps on \( E_a = E_e + 8 \) enemies and collects \( B_a = B_e + 3 \) berries. Emma's score can be represented as \( S_e = 10E_e + 5B_e \), and Ava's score can be represented as \( S_a = 10E_a + 5B_a + 30 \times 4 \).

Substituting the values for \( E_a \) and \( B_a \) into Ava's score equation, we get:
\[ S_a = 10(E_e + 8) + 5(B_e + 3) + 120 \]
\[ S_a = 10E_e + 80 + 5B_e + 15 + 120 \]
\[ S_a = 10E_e + 5B_e + 215 \]

Since Emma's score is \( S_e = 10E_e + 5B_e \), the difference in their scores is:
\[ S_a - S_e = (10E_e + 5B_e + 215) - (10E_e + 5B_e) \]

"First, we need to determine the total cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each. This can be calculated as:
\[ 30 \text{ dollars/pizza} \times 2 \text{ pizzas} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

The total cost for all four pizzas is 64 dollars. Therefore, the cost of the other two pizzas combined is:
\[ 64 \text{ dollars} - 60 \text{ dollars} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the remaining cost by 2:
\[ \frac{4 \text{ dollars}}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars/pizza} \]

Thus, each of the other two pizzas cost 2 dollars. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"To solve this, let's break down the problem into parts:

1. **Normal Days (3 days):** They ride their bikes thrice a day.
   - Number of rides per normal day = 3
   - Number of normal days = 3
   - Total rides on normal days = 3 rides/day * 3 days = 9 rides

2. **Special Days (2 days):** They ride their bikes twice the times they do on normal days.
   - Number of rides per special day = 2 * 3 = 6 rides
   - Number of special days = 2
   - Total rides on special days = 6 rides/day * 2 days = 12 rides

3. **Total rides in a week:**
   - Total rides = rides on normal days + rides on special days
   - Total rides = 9 rides + 12 rides = 21 rides

The final numerical answer is 21."
"Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as \( w \) and the number of orange fish he bought as \( o \). We know that the total number of fish he bought from the pet store is \( o + w = 17 \).

After adding these fish to his pond, the total number of orange fish became \( 3 + o \) and the total number of white fish became \( 4 + w \). According to the problem, after adding the new fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish. This gives us the equation:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( o + w = 17 \)
2. \( 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \)

Let's solve the second equation first:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]
\[ 3 + o = 8 + 2w \]
\[ o - 2w = 5 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( o + w = 17 \)
2. \( o - 2w = 5 \)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use elimination. First, we'll eliminate \( o \) by subtracting the second equation from the first:
\[ (o + w) - (o - 2w) = 17 - 5 \]
\[ o + w - o + 2w = 12 \]
\[ 3w = 12 \]
\[ w = 4 \]

Now that we have \( w = 4 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( o \):
\[ o + 4 = 17 \]
\[ o = 13 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish and 13 orange fish. The number of white fish Bob bought at the store is \( 4 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's calculate how many miles Andy drives in a week. Since he goes to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days. The one-way distance is 5 miles, so the round trip (to and from work) is 10 miles per day. Therefore, in a week, he drives:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 50 \text{ miles/week} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of gas Andy consumes in a week. Given that his car's fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon, the number of gallons used per week is:

\[ \frac{50 \text{ miles/week}}{10 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons/week} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost of the gas consumed in a week. If the price of gas is $3 per gallon, then the cost per week is:

\[ 5 \text{ gallons/week} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 15 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie received from her aunt.

Carrie received ten twenties, which means:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Carrie also received 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount from the quarters is:
\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Carrie received is:
\[ 200 + 35 = 235 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate how much money Carrie spent. She spent all the quarters, which is $35, and 3/5 of the twenties. The amount spent on the twenties is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Carrie spent for lunch is:
\[ 35 + 120 = 155 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many OLED TVs were sold, we first need to determine the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold, and then subtract these from the total sales.

Given:
- One-fourth of the sales are smart TVs.
- One-eighth of the sales are analog TVs.
- The rest are OLED TVs.
- Total sales = 40 TVs.

First, calculate the number of smart TVs sold:
\[ \text{Number of smart TVs} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

Next, calculate the number of analog TVs sold:
\[ \text{Number of analog TVs} = \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5 \]

Now, calculate the number of OLED TVs sold by subtracting the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total sales:
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (\text{Number of smart TVs} + \text{Number of analog TVs}) \]
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (10 + 5) \]
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - 15 \]
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 25 \]

So, the number of OLED TVs sold is 25."
"To determine how much money John is missing, we first need to calculate the total cost of the trip and then subtract the amount he already has.

The total cost of the trip is $300. The school has agreed to cover half of this cost, so the school will cover:
\[ \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

This means John needs to cover the remaining half of the trip cost:
\[ 300 - 150 = 150 \]

John currently has $50. To find out how much more money he needs, we subtract the amount he has from the total cost he needs to cover:
\[ 150 - 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, John is missing:
\[ 100 \]"
"First, we need to determine the temperature difference that needs to be addressed to prevent the pipes from freezing. The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. The temperature during the night is 33 degrees colder than during the day, so the temperature during the night is:

\[ 45 - 33 = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, we need to find out how much the temperature needs to be raised to 32 degrees to prevent the pipes from freezing. The difference between the night temperature and the freezing point is:

\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Since each log of wood raises the temperature by 5 degrees, the number of logs needed to raise the temperature by 20 degrees is:

\[ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \]

So, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"

"First, let's calculate Jamie's regular daily earnings. She earns $20 per hour for 8 hours of work each day.

\[ \text{Regular daily earnings} = 20 \times 8 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine her special hourly rate for any additional hours worked. Since she worked 11 hours and 8 of those are regular hours, she worked 3 additional hours at the special rate.

The special hourly rate is 150% of her regular hourly rate. So, we calculate the special hourly rate as follows:

\[ \text{Special hourly rate} = 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Now, we calculate her earnings for the additional 3 hours:

\[ \text{Earnings for additional hours} = 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add her regular earnings to her earnings for the additional hours to find her total earnings for the day:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 160 + 90 = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Jamie was paid \(\boxed{250}\) dollars for her work on last Tuesday."

The final numerical answer is 32."
"To find out how much money Mike will have left after buying the jeans, we first need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans.

The original price of the jeans is $40.00, and they are advertised 25% off. To find the discount amount, we calculate 25% of $40.00:

\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 40 \times \frac{25}{100} = 40 \times 0.25 = 10 \]

So, the discount amount is $10.00. To find the sale price of the jeans, we subtract the discount amount from the original price:

\[ \text{Sale Price} = 40 - 10 = 30 \]

Mike pays with a $50.00 bill. To find out how much money he will have left over, we subtract the sale price of the jeans from the $50.00 bill:

\[ \text{Money Left} = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of employees after three months.
2. Calculate the total salary paid to all employees each month.
3. Multiply the total salary per month by the number of months (3).

**Step 1: Number of employees after three months**

- Initial number of employees: 200
- New employees hired each month: 20
- Number of months: 3

Number of new employees hired in 3 months: \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \)

Total number of employees after three months: \( 200 + 60 = 260 \)

**Step 2: Total salary paid to all employees each month**

Each employee is paid $4000 per month.

Total salary per month for 260 employees: \( 260 \times 4000 = 1040000 \)

**Step 3: Total amount of money paid to employees after three months**

"First, let's determine Billy's starting salary and his hourly rate after the raises.

Billy's initial hourly rate was $10 per hour. After 2 months, he received a raise of $0.50 per hour, so his new hourly rate became:
\[ 10 + 0.50 = 10.50 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

On his first anniversary, he received another raise of $1.00 per hour, so his hourly rate became:
\[ 10.50 + 1.00 = 11.50 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Now, let's calculate Billy's earnings for 20 hours at his final hourly rate of $11.50 per hour:
\[ 11.50 \times 20 = 230 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine Sally's starting salary. Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary, which was $10 per hour. Therefore, Sally's starting salary is:
\[ 10 + 0.50 = 10.50 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Now, let's calculate Sally's earnings for 20 hours at her hourly rate of $10.50 per hour:
\[ 10.50 \times 20 = 210 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we subtract Sally's total earnings from Billy's total earnings:
\[ 230 - 210 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Billy will earn $20 more than Sally in 20 hours of work."

Nikita's score is 11 more than half of Pierson's score. So, we first calculate half of Pierson's score:
\[ \text{Half of Pierson's score} = \frac{278}{2} = 139 \]

Then, we add 11 to this value to get Nikita's score:
\[ \text{Nikita's score} = 139 + 11 = 150 \]

Now, we add Pierson's and Nikita's scores together to find the total:
\[ \text{Total score} = 278 + 150 = 428 \]

So, the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita is 428."
"First, let's calculate the number of students and teachers in the school.

The school has 40 classes with an average of 25 students per class:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 25 \text{ students/class} = 1000 \text{ students} \]

The school also has 40 classes with an average of 3 teachers per class:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 3 \text{ teachers/class} = 120 \text{ teachers} \]

Each child plants 1 tree, so the number of trees planted by the students is:
\[ 1000 \text{ students} \times 1 \text{ tree/student} = 1000 \text{ trees} \]

Each teacher plants 2 trees, so the number of trees planted by the teachers is:
\[ 120 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ trees/teacher} = 240 \text{ trees} \]

Adding the trees planted by the students and the teachers gives the total number of trees planted:

"First, let's calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:

- Puppies: 3
- Koalas: 5
- Zebras: 2
- Frogs: 4

Total stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Let's denote the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy as \( x \).

After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30%. Therefore, the equation representing this situation is:

\[ \frac{x}{14 + x} = 0.30 \]

To solve for \( x \), we can rearrange the equation:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the pass rates for each grade:

- For third graders: \( \frac{340}{500} = 0.68 \) or 68%
- For fourth graders: \( \frac{40}{100} = 0.40 \) or 40%
- For fifth graders: The pass rate is twice that of fourth graders, so \( 2 \times 0.40 = 0.80 \) or 80%

Next, we calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students:

- Third graders: 340
- Fourth graders: 40
- Fifth graders: 400

Total number of students: \( 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 \)

Total number of students who passed: \( 340 + 40 + 400 = 780 \)

Finally, the overall pass rate is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{\text{Total number of students who passed}}{\text{Total number of students}} = \frac{780}{1000} = 0.78 \]

"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we first need to determine the total number of branches he climbed during the week.

Given that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs and he made $105 during the week, we can calculate the total number of branches he climbed by dividing the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\text{Total money made}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} \]

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = 420 \]

Since this was the total for the week, and there are 7 days in a week, we can find the average number of branches climbed per day by dividing the total branches by the number of days:

\[ \text{Branches climbed per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches climbed}}{\text{Number of days in a week}} = \frac{420}{7} \]

\[ \text{Branches climbed per day} = 60 \]

So, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day."

- For the first 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals.
- For the next 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals.
- For the next 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals.
- For the last 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals.

Adding these together gives the total number of petals initially picked:
\[15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\] petals.

Next, Rose drops 1 of each type of flower:
- She drops 1 of the 5-petal flowers, which means she drops \(1 \times 5 = 5\) petals.
- She drops 1 of the 6-petal flowers, which means she drops \(1 \times 6 = 6\) petals.
- She drops 1 of the 4-petal flowers, which means she drops \(1 \times 4 = 4\) petals.
- She drops 1 of the 7-petal flowers, which means she drops \(1 \times 7 = 7\) petals.

The total number of petals dropped is:
\[5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\] petals.

Subtracting the dropped petals from the initial total gives the number of petals remaining in the vase:

Next, we need to account for the marshmallows that were dropped on the ground. They dropped 3 marshmallows, so the total number of marshmallows used and dropped is:

\[ 18 + 3 = 21 \]

The bag originally had 35 marshmallows. After using and dropping 21 marshmallows, the number of marshmallows left in the bag is:

\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \]

Now, we need to determine how many S'mores each kid can have with the 14 marshmallows left. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, John and DeSean can each have:

\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]

So, each kid can have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 7 \]"
"First, let's determine the total playtime for each person in minutes. Jack and his two significantly worse friends can each play for 20 minutes, while the significantly better friend can play for 30 minutes (1.5 times 20 minutes).

The total playtime for Jack and his two significantly worse friends is:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

The significantly better friend plays for:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding these together gives the total playtime:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Since they played for 4 hours, we convert 4 hours to minutes:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we calculate how many 20-minute intervals fit into 240 minutes:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/game}} = 12 \text{ games} \]

Since each game costs 1 quarter, the total number of quarters used is:
\[ 12 \text{ quarters} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"Let's denote the amount of each ingredient Tanya uses as follows:
- Let \( S \) be the amount of salt.
- Let \( O \) be the amount of oil.
- Let \( F \) be the amount of fragrance.
- Let \( C \) be the amount of citrus zest.
- Let \( G \) be the amount of sugar.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S = G \) (same amount of salt as sugar)
2. \( F = C \) (same amount of fragrance as citrus zest)
3. \( O = 2S \) (twice as much oil as salt)
4. \( S = C \) (same amount of salt as citrus zest)

Since \( S = C \) and \( F = C \), we can say \( S = F = C \).

The total amount of ingredients in the jar is 10 ounces. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total amount of ingredients as:
\[ S + O + F + C + G = 10 \]

Substituting the relationships into the equation:
\[ S + 2S + S + S + S = 10 \]
\[ 6S = 10 \]
\[ S = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \]

Since \( O = 2S \):
\[ O = 2 \times \frac{5}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \]

Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \( \frac{10}{3} \) ounces.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \frac{10}{3} \]"
"To calculate the total amount of money John spent, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cows separately and then add them together.

The cost of the goats is:
3 goats * $500/goat = $1500

The cost of the cows is:
2 cows * $1500/cow = $3000

Adding these together gives the total amount spent:
$1500 + $3000 = $4500

So, the final numerical answer is $4500."
"Paul currently has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes, which totals to 8 + 40 = 48 cupcakes. He needs 63 cupcakes in total, so he should buy 63 - 48 = 15 more cupcakes."
"First, let's determine how many cars Joe initially has. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. The number of cars he sells is:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

After selling 8 cars, Joe has:

\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \text{ cars} \]

Then, Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

After giving away 16 cars, Joe has:

\[ 32 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, the final number of cars Joe remains with is:

\[ 16 \]"
"First, we need to determine how much money the students raised. The total amount raised is $175,000, and $50,000 of this amount comes from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much each student raised. There are 20 students, and the total amount raised by the students is $125,000. So, the amount each student raised is:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

Thus, each student raised \(\boxed{6250}\) dollars."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Sandy spent walking over the two days in minutes.

First, let's determine the time Sandy spent walking on the first day:
- Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day.

Next, we calculate the time she spent walking on the second day:
- She walked half as many hours on the second day as she did on the first day.
- Therefore, the time spent on the second day is \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) hours.

Now, we add the hours from both days to find the total time in hours:
- Total time in hours = 8 hours (first day) + 4 hours (second day) = 12 hours.

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we use the conversion factor that 1 hour = 60 minutes:
- Total time in minutes = 12 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 720 minutes.

Thus, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes."
"First, let's determine the number of cars in the parking lot during the lunch break before any left. Initially, there were 50 cars, and during the first break, 20 more cars arrived. So, the total number of cars before any left is:

\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \]

During the lunch break, half of these cars left the parking lot. Therefore, the number of cars that left is:

\[ \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

The number of cars remaining in the parking lot after some left is:

\[ 70 - 35 = 35 \]

So, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is:

\[ 35 \]"
"To calculate John's earnings for a full 7-day week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily earnings:
   - John does 30 cycles of work a day.
   - Each cycle has 5 tasks.
   - Each task pays $1.20.
   - Therefore, the earnings per cycle are \(5 \times 1.20 = 6.00\) dollars.
   - So, the daily earnings are \(30 \times 6.00 = 180.00\) dollars.

2. Calculate the weekly earnings:
   - John works 7 days a week.
   - Therefore, the weekly earnings are \(180.00 \times 7 = 1260.00\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is 1260.00."
"First, let's determine the points scored by Sasha and Julie in the first game.

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, so:
Julie's points in the first game = Sasha's points in the first game - 4
Julie's points in the first game = 14 - 4 = 10 points

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie did in the first game. So:
Sasha's points in the second game = Julie's points in the first game - 6
Sasha's points in the second game = 10 - 6 = 4 points

Now, let's calculate the total points Sasha scored during both games:
Total points Sasha scored = Sasha's points in the first game + Sasha's points in the second game
Total points Sasha scored = 14 + 4 = 18 points

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to calculate the total number of tins of cat food Kimberly bought. She bought 8 packages of cat food, and each package contains 11 tins. Therefore, the total number of tins of cat food is:

\[ 8 \times 11 = 88 \text{ tins} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of tins of dog food Kimberly bought. She bought 6 packages of dog food, and each package contains 6 tins. Therefore, the total number of tins of dog food is:

\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \text{ tins} \]

To find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we subtract the total number of tins of dog food from the total number of tins of cat food:

\[ 88 - 36 = 52 \]

So, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 52 \]"
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now we can find out how many cards Becca has:
\[ 3P + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

So, Becca has 153 cards. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 153 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of each color of eggs Cindy has:

- Cindy has 5 green eggs.
- She has twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she has \(2 \times 5 = 10\) blue eggs.
- She has one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so she has \(10 - 1 = 9\) pink eggs.
- She has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she has \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\) yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs:

- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: 10
- Pink eggs: 9
- Yellow eggs: 3

Total number of eggs = \(5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27\)

So, Cindy had a total of 27 eggs."
"First, let's calculate the shipping cost. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound plus $0.08 per mile.

The cost for the weight of the book is:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.35/\text{pound} = \$1.40 \]

The cost for the distance is:
\[ 20 \text{ miles} \times \$0.08/\text{mile} = \$1.60 \]

So, the total shipping cost is:
\[ \$1.40 + \$1.60 = \$3.00 \]

Next, we calculate the refundable amount from the purchase price. Amazon will refund 75% of the book's purchase price:
\[ 32 \text{ dollars} \times 0.75 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount Milly will lose. This is the sum of the shipping cost and the difference between the purchase price and the refundable amount:
\[ \$3.00 + (32 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars}) = \$3.00 + \$8.00 = \$11.00 \]

So, Milly will lose:
\[ \$11.00 \]"

Money left: $140 - $80 = $60

So, the final numerical answer is $60."
"To determine how many bars of chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to first calculate the total production for the first three weeks and then subtract this from the total monthly production.

First week production: 8,000 bars

Second week production: Half of the first week, which is \( \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \) bars

Third week production: Three times the first week, which is \( 8,000 \times 3 = 24,000 \) bars

Now, we add the production of the first three weeks:
\[ 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars} \]

Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. Therefore, the production in the fourth week is:

"To calculate the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to consider the time spent on each activity and then sum them up.

1. **Time spent on TikTok videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week.
   - Each video is 4 minutes long.
   - Therefore, the time spent on TikTok videos each week is \(18 \times 4 = 72\) minutes.
   - For a month with four weeks, the total time spent on TikTok videos is \(72 \times 4 = 288\) minutes.

2. **Time spent writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Since 1 hour equals 60 minutes, 2 hours equal \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes.
   - For a month with four weeks, the total time spent writing songs is \(120 \times 4 = 480\) minutes.

3. **Time spent on makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup.
   - For a week, the total time spent on makeup is \(15 \times 6 = 90\) minutes.
   - For a month with four weeks, the total time spent on makeup is \(90 \times 4 = 360\) minutes.

Now, we sum up all the time spent:
- Time on TikTok videos: 288 minutes
- Time writing songs: 480 minutes

"First, let's establish the relationships given in the problem:

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain \(12 \times 1 = 12\) inches high.
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain \(4 \times 12 = 48\) inches high.
4. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain \(10 \times 48 = 480\) inches high.

Now, we need to convert the height Naruto can lift a mountain from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

\[ 480 \text{ inches} \div 12 = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 40 feet."
"Mason travels at a rate of 8 miles per hour for 4 hours, so the distance covered in the first part of the journey is:
\[ 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles} \]

Then, he travels for another 6 hours, so the distance covered in the second part of the journey is:
\[ 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \]

The total distance traveled is the sum of the distances from both parts of the journey:

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the number of animals, their speed, and the time it takes to complete the journey.

First, let's determine the total ""kangaroo-hours"" required to cross the highway. Since 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway, the total ""kangaroo-hours"" is:
\[ 3 \text{ kangaroos} \times 18 \text{ hours} = 54 \text{ kangaroo-hours} \]

This means that the total distance to be covered is 54 kangaroo-hours. Now, we need to find out how long it will take for 4 turtles to cover the same distance, given that each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo.

Since each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, it will take twice as long for each turtle to cover the same distance. Therefore, the time it takes for one turtle to cover the distance is:
\[ 18 \text{ hours} \times 2 = 36 \text{ hours} \]

For 4 turtles, the total time required will be:
\[ 4 \text{ turtles} \times 36 \text{ hours/turtle} = 144 \text{ hours} \]

So, the number of hours it will take for four turtles to cross the highway is:

"First, let's determine the final price of the laptop after the trade-in discount. The original price of the laptop is $600, and the trade-in discount is $200. Therefore, the final price is:

\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means she currently has:

\[ 400 - 50 = 350 \]

Erika has received $150 from her part-time job and $80 from her mom. Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as \( x \). The total amount of money Erika has now is:

\[ x + 150 + 80 = x + 230 \]

We know that this total amount is $350, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 230 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

Therefore, Erika has $120 in her purse. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"First, we calculate the total number of slices from the large apples. Since each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces and Adam slices 3 large apples, the total number of slices from the large apples is:
\[ 3 \text{ apples} \times 5 \text{ slices/apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of slices from the small apples. Since each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces and Adam slices 5 small apples, the total number of slices from the small apples is:
\[ 5 \text{ apples} \times 3 \text{ slices/apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we add the slices from the large and small apples to find the total number of slices Adam has:

"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to have to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to calculate the current daily milk production and then find out how much additional milk is needed.

The current daily milk production from 3 cows is:
\[ 5 \text{ liters/cow/day} \times 3 \text{ cows} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The additional milk needed is:
\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow provides 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed to produce the additional 10 liters of milk is:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow/day}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs to have 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of students good at math, we need to consider those who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

Given:
- 5 students are good at math only.
- 8 students perform well in English only.
- The rest are good at both math and English.

First, we calculate the number of students who are good at both math and English. Since there are 20 students in total:
\[ 20 = (\text{good at math only}) + (\text{good at English only}) + (\text{good at both}) \]
\[ 20 = 5 + 8 + (\text{good at both}) \]
\[ 20 = 13 + (\text{good at both}) \]
\[ (\text{good at both}) = 20 - 13 = 7 \]

Next, we add the number of students who are good at math only to the number of students who are good at both math and English:
\[ \text{Total good at math} = (\text{good at math only}) + (\text{good at both}) \]
\[ \text{Total good at math} = 5 + 7 = 12 \]

Therefore, the total number of students good at math is:

"First, let's calculate the total time required for one group to perform, including the time for getting on and off stage, and the intermission.

Time for one group:
- Getting on stage: 2 minutes
- Performing: 6 minutes
- Exiting stage: 2 minutes
- Intermission: 10 minutes

Total time for one group = 2 + 6 + 2 + 10 = 20 minutes

The concert duration is 2 hours, which is equivalent to 120 minutes.

To find out how many groups can perform, we divide the total concert time by the time required for one group:

Number of groups = Total concert time / Time per group
Number of groups = 120 minutes / 20 minutes/group
Number of groups = 6

So, the final numerical answer is 6."
"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years with simple interest, we can use the formula for simple interest:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Given:
- Principal (\(P\)) = $300
- Rate (\(R\)) = \(\frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225\%\)
- Time (\(T\)) = 3 years

First, calculate the simple interest:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 225\% \times 3 \]

Since 225% is equivalent to 2.25 in decimal form:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 2.25 \times 3 \]

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 6.75 \]

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 2025 \]

Now, calculate the total amount after 3 years:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Simple Interest} \]

"First, let's determine the number of white shirts with collars and without collars.

- Total white shirts = 40
- White shirts with collars = 40 / 2 = 20
- White shirts without collars = 40 - 20 = 20

Next, let's determine the number of floral shirts with buttons and without buttons.

- Total floral shirts = 50
- Floral shirts with buttons = 20
- Floral shirts without buttons = 50 - 20 = 30

Now, we need to find how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars.

- Floral shirts without buttons = 30
- White shirts with no collars = 20

The difference is:

- Difference = Floral shirts without buttons - White shirts with no collars = 30 - 20 = 10

The final numerical answer is 10."
"First, we need to determine how many trays the farmer needs to hold all 900 eggs. Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold:

\[
\frac{900 \text{ eggs}}{30 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 30 \text{ trays}
\]

Next, we need to calculate the total earnings if the farmer sells each tray for $2.5. Since he has 30 trays and each tray is sold for $2.5, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray:

\[
30 \text{ trays} \times 2.5 \text{ dollars/tray} = 75 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
75

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Goats in Each Farm:**
   - Farm X: 55 goats
   - Farm Y: 45 goats

2. **Goats Sold:**
   - From Farm X: 10 goats
   - From Farm Y: Twice as many as from Farm X, which is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) goats

3. **Goats Remaining After Selling:**
   - Farm X: \(55 - 10 = 45\) goats
   - Farm Y: \(45 - 20 = 25\) goats

4. **Total Goats Left:**
   - Total goats left = Goats left in Farm X + Goats left in Farm Y
   - Total goats left = \(45 + 25 = 70\)

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 70."
"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
2. Divide the total amount spent on shoes by the total number of pairs bought.

James buys 2 pairs of shoes each month. There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of pairs of shoes he buys in a year is:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair of shoes, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs bought:
\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

So, the average amount James pays for each pair of shoes is:
\[ 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the green food. Since each basket of green food costs $25 and you are buying 3 baskets, the total cost for the green food is:
\[ 25 \times 3 = 75 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the red food. Each basket of red food costs $18, but you get $2 off for each basket. Therefore, the effective cost per basket of red food is:
\[ 18 - 2 = 16 \]
Since you are buying 3 baskets of red food, the total cost for the red food is:
\[ 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

Now, we add the total cost of the green food and the total cost of the red food to find the overall total cost:
\[ 75 + 48 = 123 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 123 \]"

"To solve this problem, let's break it down year by year:

1. In the first year, the town builds 12 homes.
2. In the second year, they build three times the number of homes built in the first year. So, they build \(3 \times 12 = 36\) homes.
3. In the third year, they double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total number of homes built in the first two years is \(12 + 36 = 48\). Therefore, in the third year, they build \(2 \times 48 = 96\) homes.

Now, to find the total number of homes built over the three years, we add the number of homes built each year:

\[12 + 36 + 96 = 144\]

So, the town will have built 144 homes over the next three years."
"Let's denote the ages as follows:
- Let \( B \) be the age of your brother.
- Let \( S \) be the age of your sister.
- Let \( M \) be the age of your mom.
- Let \( Y \) be your age.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( Y = B - 3 \).
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( Y = S + 2 \).
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( M = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all your ages is 87: \( Y + B + S + M = 87 \).

First, we can express \( B \) and \( S \) in terms of \( Y \):
- From \( Y = B - 3 \), we get \( B = Y + 3 \).
- From \( Y = S + 2 \), we get \( S = Y - 2 \).

Next, we substitute \( B \) and \( S \) into the equation for \( M \):
- \( M = 3B - 1 = 3(Y + 3) - 1 = 3Y + 9 - 1 = 3Y + 8 \).

Now we substitute \( Y \), \( B \), \( S \), and \( M \) into the sum of the ages equation:
- \( Y + B + S + M = 87 \)
- \( Y + (Y + 3) + (Y - 2) + (3Y + 8) = 87 \)
- \( Y + Y + 3 + Y - 2 + 3Y + 8 = 87 \)
- \( 6Y + 9 = 87 \)
- \( 6Y = 78 \)
- \( Y = 13 \).

So, you are 13 years old."
"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first calculate the total number of glue sticks required. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks needed is:

\[ 27 \times 2 = 54 \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of glue sticks are required to get at least 54 glue sticks. Since glue sticks come in packs of 8, we divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:

\[ \frac{54}{8} = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks. To ensure he has enough, we calculate the total number of glue sticks in 7 packs:

\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 \]

Since 56 is more than the 54 glue sticks needed, Mr. Jackson will have 2 extra glue sticks left over. Thus, the number of packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy is:

\[ 7 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 7 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Amount of Water**: The initial amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

2. **After the First Day**: The amount of water doubles. Therefore, the amount of water after the first day is:
   \[
   4000 \text{ gallons} \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **After the Second Day**: The amount of water doubles again. Therefore, the amount of water after the second day is:
   \[
   8000 \text{ gallons} \times 2 = 16000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

4. **After the Third Day**: The volume of water increases by 6000 gallons. Therefore, the amount of water after the third day is:
   \[
   16000 \text{ gallons} + 6000 \text{ gallons} = 22000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

Thus, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point after the third day is 22000 gallons."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of new infections each day and add them to the total number of infected people.

- **Day 0**: Initially, there are 10 infected people.
- **Day 1**: Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others, so the number of new infections is \(10 \times 6 = 60\). Therefore, the total number of infected people after Day 1 is \(10 + 60 = 70\).
- **Day 2**: Now there are 70 infected people, and each of them infects 6 others. The number of new infections is \(70 \times 6 = 420\). Therefore, the total number of infected people after Day 2 is \(70 + 420 = 490\).
- **Day 3**: Now there are 490 infected people, and each of them infects 6 others. The number of new infections is \(490 \times 6 = 2940\). Therefore, the total number of infected people after Day 3 is \(490 + 2940 = 3430\).

So, the total number of people infected after three days is 3430."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Rafaela received as tips. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate the total as follows:

\[ \text{Total tips for Rafaela} = 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money Julieta received as tips. Julieta received 10% less money than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's total tips:

\[ 10\% \text{ of Rafaela's tips} = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]

So, Julieta received:

\[ \text{Total tips for Julieta} = 800 - 80 = 720 \]

Now, to find the total amount of money both Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether, we add their individual totals:

\[ \text{Total tips for both} = 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1520 \]"
"Jennifer initially had 12 oranges. She gave her three daughters a total of 2 oranges each, which amounts to 3 daughters * 2 oranges/daughter = 6 oranges. Her son received 3 oranges.

"First, let's determine how many badges each person earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge per month. In a year (12 months), Claire earns:
\[ 1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ badges} \]

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire. Therefore, Amber earns 1 badge every 2 months. In a year, Amber earns:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/badge}} = 6 \text{ badges} \]

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. Therefore, in a year, Wendy earns:
\[ 12 \text{ badges} \times 3 = 36 \text{ badges} \]

Now, to find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns:
\[ 36 \text{ badges} - 6 \text{ badges} = 30 \text{ badges} \]

So, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a year."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

   - From 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM is 5 hours.

2. **Calculate the total number of banana bread loaves baked:**
   - Paige bakes 2 loaves per hour.
   - Over 5 hours, she bakes \( 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \).

3. **Calculate the total number of slices:**
   - Each loaf is cut into 8 slices.
   - Therefore, 10 loaves yield \( 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \).

4. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the slices:**
   - Each slice is sold for 50 cents.

"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of burritos given to the students.
2. Subtract the number of burritos given to the students and the number of burritos Mr. George ate from the total number of burritos ordered.

First, calculate the total number of burritos given to the students:
\[ \text{Number of students} = 50 \]
\[ \text{Burritos per student} = 10 \]
\[ \text{Total burritos for students} = 50 \times 10 = 500 \]

Next, add the number of burritos Mr. George ate:
\[ \text{Burritos Mr. George ate} = 20 \]
\[ \text{Total burritos given out} = 500 + 20 = 520 \]

Finally, subtract the total number of burritos given out from the total number of burritos ordered:

\[ \text{Leftover burritos} = 600 - 520 = 80 \]

So, the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is 80."
"First, let's determine the number of green cars. Since there are 12 red cars and 2 fewer green cars than red cars:

\[ \text{Number of green cars} = 12 - 2 = 10 \]

Next, we calculate the number of blue cars. The number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars:

\[ \text{Number of blue cars} = 3 \times 10 = 30 \]

Now, we can find the total number of red, green, and blue cars:

\[ \text{Total of red, green, and blue cars} = 12 + 10 + 30 = 52 \]

Given that the total number of cars in the rink is 75, we can find the number of yellow cars by subtracting the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:

\[ \text{Number of yellow cars} = 75 - 52 = 23 \]

So, the number of yellow cars is:

"Let's denote the number of books Anne has as \( A \), the number of books Sofie has as \( S \), and the number of books Fawn has as \( F \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S = A + 25 \)
2. \( A = F - 12 \)
3. \( S + A + F = 85 \)

We can substitute the expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \) into the third equation. First, express \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
\[ A = F - 12 \]

Next, express \( S \) in terms of \( F \):
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \]

Now substitute \( S \) and \( A \) into the total number of books equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books. The final numerical answer is:

\]

So, after the first day, the number of pieces remaining is:

\[
60 - 24 = 36 \text{ pieces}
\]

On the second day, Tobias ate 10 pieces, so the number of pieces remaining after the second day is:

"First, we need to calculate the total cost for Sarah's friend to buy the 20 meters of rope at $2 per meter.

\[
\text{Total cost} = 20 \text{ meters} \times \$2/\text{meter} = \$40
\]

Next, we calculate how much money Sarah will have after selling the rope. Since she sells it for $2 per meter, the total amount she gets is:

\[
\text{Total money Sarah gets} = 20 \text{ meters} \times \$2/\text{meter} = \$40
\]

Now, Sarah uses this $40 to buy a new rope at $1.5 per meter. We need to find out how many meters of rope she can buy with $40:

\[
\text{Number of meters she can buy} = \frac{\$40}{\$1.5/\text{meter}} = \frac{40}{1.5} = \frac{400}{15} = \frac{80}{3} \approx 26.67 \text{ meters}
\]

Since she can only buy whole meters, she can buy 26 meters of the new rope. The cost for 26 meters is:

\[
\text{Cost for 26 meters} = 26 \text{ meters} \times \$1.5/\text{meter} = \$39

"To solve this problem, let's denote Melanie's current age as \( M \).

According to the problem, in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ M + 10 = 18 \]

Solving for \( M \):
\[ M = 18 - 10 \]
\[ M = 8 \]

So, Melanie's current age is 8 years.

We need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. Let's denote the number of years from now as \( x \). In \( x \) years, Melanie's age will be \( 8 + x \). We want this to be three times her current age, which is 8. Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ 8 + x = 3 \times 8 \]
\[ 8 + x = 24 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 24 - 8 \]

"First, let's calculate the cost of each item Kelly has in her cart.

1. The cost of bacon:
   Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total.
   \[
   \text{Cost per pack of bacon} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. The cost of chicken:
   Each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   \[
   \text{Cost per pack of chicken} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Kelly has 6 packs of chicken.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of chicken} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. The cost of strawberries:
   Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of strawberries} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. The cost of apples:
   Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   \[
   \text{Cost per pack of apples} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Kelly has 7 packs of apples.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of apples} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's sum up the total cost of all the items:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of bacon} + \text{Cost of chicken} + \text{Cost of strawberries} + \text{Cost of apples}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 10 + 24 + 12 + 14 = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget:
\[
\text{Money left} = 65 - 60 = 5 \text{ dollars}
\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}

"Let's denote the usual runtime of Elaina's concerts as \( x \) minutes. According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, so the final concert duration is \( 2x \) minutes. Additionally, at the end of the final concert, she performs a 15-minute encore. Therefore, the total runtime of the final concert including the encore is:

\[ 2x + 15 \]

We are given that the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. So we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual runtime of Elaina's concerts is 25 minutes. Let's confirm this by calculating the total runtime of the final concert:

\[ 2 \times 25 + 15 = 50 + 15 = 65 \]

The calculation confirms that the total runtime is indeed 65 minutes. Therefore, the usual runtime of Elaina's concerts is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Argo initially has 200 toys. After giving away 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky, the total number of toys given away is 40 + 80 + 30 = 150 toys. Therefore, the number of toys Argo has now is 200 - 150 = 50 toys."
"To find the total number of chimichangas made on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday, we need to add the number of chimichangas made each day.

- On Tuesday, they make 125 chimichangas.
- On Wednesday, they make 125 chimichangas.
- On Friday, they make twice as many as on Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 125 = 250\) chimichangas.

Now, we add the number of chimichangas made on these three days:

\[ 125 + 125 + 250 = 500 \]

So, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many microphones can be paired after accounting for the 20% that won't fit.

First, calculate 20% of the 50 microphones:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 10 \]

This means 10 microphones won't be paired. Therefore, the number of microphones that can be paired is:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Now, to find out how many pairs of microphones can be arranged, we divide the number of paired microphones by 2:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of birds flying overhead. Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes. According to the problem, 2/3 of that number of birds are flying overhead. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of birds flying overhead} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of birds feeding. Jerry counts 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of birds feeding} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, we add up all the birds Jerry counts:

\[ \text{Total number of birds} = \text{Number of birds nesting} + \text{Number of birds flying overhead} + \text{Number of birds feeding} \]
\[ \text{Total number of birds} = 6 + 4 + 24 = 34 \]

So, the total number of birds Jerry counts is 34."

"First, let's calculate the total number of petals for the orchids. Joelle has 5 orchids, and each orchid has 5 petals. So, the total number of petals for the orchids is:

\[ 5 \text{ orchids} \times 5 \text{ petals/orchid} = 25 \text{ petals} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals for the African daisies. Joelle has 4 African daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals. So, the total number of petals for the daisies is:

\[ 4 \text{ daisies} \times 10 \text{ petals/daisy} = 40 \text{ petals} \]

Now, to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we subtract the total number of petals of the orchids from the total number of petals of the daisies:

\[ 40 \text{ petals} - 25 \text{ petals} = 15 \text{ petals} \]

So, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants, so we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. We find the number of flowering plants by subtracting the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:

\[ \text{Number of flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25 \]

To find what percent of the total plants are flowering plants, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find the speed of the whirligig, we first need to determine the speed of the thingamabob. We know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of the thingamabob can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{\text{Speed of whatchamacallit}}{11} = \frac{121 \text{ meters/second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters/second} \]

Now, we know that a whirligig spins five times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of the whirligig is:

\[ \text{Speed of whirligig} = 5 \times \text{Speed of thingamabob} = 5 \times 11 \text{ meters/second} = 55 \text{ meters/second} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the costs Ellen incurs each day:

- The salad costs $6.
- The yogurt costs half the price of the salad, which is $6 / 2 = $3.
- Let the cost of one carrot be \( C \).

Ellen eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day. The total cost for these items is given as $11. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total cost as:

\[ 2C + 6 + 3 = 11 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2C + 9 = 11 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 2C = 2 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ C = 1 \]

So, the cost of one carrot every day is $1.

"First, let's determine how much Tasha earned from mowing lawns. We know that Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as she mowed Joe's lawn, and Alba's lawn five times as many times as she mowed Joe's lawn. Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( x \).

From this, we can determine the number of times she mowed Kamala's lawn and Alba's lawn:
- Kamala's lawn: \( 3x \)
- Alba's lawn: \( 5x \)

The total number of times Tasha mowed lawns is the sum of the times she mowed each lawn:
\[ x + 3x + 5x = 9x \]

We know that Tasha earned $6 for mowing Joe's lawn, and since she mowed Joe's lawn \( x \) times, we can calculate her earnings per lawn mowed:
\[ \text{Earnings per lawn} = \frac{6}{x} \]

Now, we can calculate her total earnings from mowing lawns:
\[ \text{Total earnings from mowing lawns} = 9x \times \frac{6}{x} = 9 \times 6 = 54 \]

Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. To find out how much she made from lemonade sales, we subtract her earnings from mowing lawns from her total earnings:
\[ \text{Earnings from lemonade sales} = 80 - 54 = 26 \]

"First, we need to find Carl's weight. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, we can calculate Carl's weight as follows:

Carl's weight = Martin's weight + 16 kg
Carl's weight = 55 kg + 16 kg
Carl's weight = 71 kg

Next, we need to find Christian's weight. Since Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, we can calculate Christian's weight as follows:

Christian's weight = Carl's weight + 8 kg
Christian's weight = 71 kg + 8 kg
Christian's weight = 79 kg

Finally, we need to find Harry's weight. Since Harry is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, we can calculate Harry's weight as follows:

Harry's weight = Christian's weight - 5 kg
Harry's weight = 79 kg - 5 kg
Harry's weight = 74 kg

The weight of Harry is 74 kg."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours John rents his car out in a month. He rents his car 10 times a month, and each time for 3 hours. So, the total number of hours rented in a month is:

\[ 10 \text{ times/month} \times 3 \text{ hours/time} = 30 \text{ hours/month} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money John earns from renting his car in a month. He gets paid $25 per hour, so:

\[ 30 \text{ hours/month} \times 25 \text{ dollars/hour} = 750 \text{ dollars/month} \]

Now, we need to find out the profit John makes. To do this, we subtract his monthly car payment from his monthly earnings:

"First, we need to determine how many miles Anis rowed. We know that Anis rowed \(\frac{1}{5}\) times more miles than Dijana. Since Dijana rowed 50 miles, we can calculate the additional miles Anis rowed as follows:

\[
\text{Additional miles Anis rowed} = \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles}
\]

Adding this to the 50 miles Dijana rowed gives us the total distance Anis rowed:

\[
\text{Total miles Anis rowed} = 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles}
\]

Now, we can find the total distance both Dijana and Anis rowed by adding their individual distances:

"First, let's determine how many pages each person read.

Yesterday:
- Denise read 10 pages.
- Daniel read 13 pages.

Today:
- Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.
- Daniel was not able to read any pages today, so he read 0 pages today.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages each person read over the two days:
- Denise read \(10 + 18 = 28\) pages in total.
- Daniel read \(13 + 0 = 13\) pages in total.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total number of pages Daniel read from the total number of pages Denise read:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of soup and how it can be distributed among Calvin, his wife, and his two children.

1. **Total Bowls of Soup:**
   - Calvin is an adult, so he needs 1 bowl.
   - His wife is also an adult, so she needs 1 bowl.
   - Each of their two children needs 1 bowl each.
   - Therefore, the total number of bowls needed is \(1 + 1 + 2 = 4\) bowls.

2. **Soup Capacity:**
   - The pot can fill 4 adult's bowls or 8 child's bowls.
   - Since 4 adult's bowls equal 4 child's bowls, the pot can hold 8 child's bowls.

3. **Leftover Soup:**
   - Since the pot can hold 8 child's bowls and they only need 4 bowls, the leftover soup will be enough for \(8 - 4 = 4\) child's bowls.

4. **Distribution of Leftover Soup:**
   - The leftover soup can be distributed among the two children.
   - Each child can have 2 bowls of soup from the leftover.

Therefore, each child will be able to have 2 bowls of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

"To determine the amount of material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we first need to calculate the material required for each type of mask.

For small masks:
- 2 yards of material are needed for 4 small masks.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4} = 0.5 \text{ yards} \).

For large masks:
- 2.25 yards of material are needed for 3 large masks.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3} = 0.75 \text{ yards} \).

Now, we calculate the material needed for 20 small masks and 8 large masks:
- Material for 20 small masks: \( 20 \times 0.5 \text{ yards} = 10 \text{ yards} \).
- Material for 8 large masks: \( 8 \times 0.75 \text{ yards} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information provided.

Let \( D \) be Duncan's age eight years ago and \( A \) be Adam's age four years ago.

From the problem, we know:
1. Duncan's current age is 60.
2. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( 60 - 8 = 52 \).
3. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was two times Adam's age four years ago, so \( D = 2A \).
4. Four years ago, Adam's age was \( A - 4 \).

Since \( D = 52 \), we can substitute this into the equation \( D = 2A \):
\[ 52 = 2A \]
Solving for \( A \):
\[ A = \frac{52}{2} = 26 \]

So, four years ago, Adam was 26 years old. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his age four years ago:

"Let's denote the number of red balloons as \( R \) and the number of yellow balloons as \( Y \). According to the problem, \( R = 20 \).

Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon, so the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is \( 2R \). Given that \( R = 20 \), the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \).

The total number of pieces of bologna thrown at all balloons is 58. Therefore, the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons is \( 58 - 40 = 18 \).

Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, the number of yellow balloons \( Y \) can be found by dividing the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons by 3. So, \( Y = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).

Thus, the number of yellow balloons is 6.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items they bought:
- The cake costs $11.
- They bought 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons. At $0.5 for 2 balloons, the cost per balloon is $0.25. Therefore, the cost for 12 balloons is \(12 \times 0.25 = $3\).
- They bought 2 tubs of ice cream at $7 each, so the cost for the ice cream is \(2 \times 7 = $14\).

Now, let's add up the total cost:
\[ 11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \]

This means they spent a total of $28. Since they combined their allowances, the total amount given to them by their mother is $28. Since they are two girls, the amount each received is:

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops. Each lollypop was sold for $0.8, so the total revenue is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollypop} = \$240 \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops. Each lollypop cost $0.5, so the total cost is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollypop} = \$150 \]

Finally, the profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ \$240 - \$150 = \$90 \]

So, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops."
"First, let's determine the number of each type of pet Larry has:

- Larry has 3 cats.
- He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dogs.
- He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has \(9 - 2 = 7\) rabbits.
- He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has \(3 \times 7 = 21\) fish.
- He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish, so he has \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\) gerbils.

Now, let's sum up all the pets:

- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Total number of pets = \(3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47\)

The final numerical answer is 47."
"First, let's determine how many slices Josh can eat in a day. Since Josh can eat twice as much as Abby, and Abby can eat 2 slices a day, Josh can eat:

\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ slices a day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many slices Abby and Josh eat together in one day. Abby eats 2 slices and Josh eats 4 slices, so together they eat:

\[ 2 + 4 = 6 \text{ slices a day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days the loaf of bread will last. The loaf has 24 slices, and they eat 6 slices per day, so the number of days the loaf will last is:

\[ \frac{24}{6} = 4 \text{ days} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"Martha collects shells every month. She started collecting at age 5 and her 10th birthday marks the end of her collection period. To find out how many months she collected shells, we calculate the difference in age and then find the number of months.

From age 5 to 10, she has 5 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of months is:
\[ 5 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 60 \text{ months} \]

Since she collects one shell each month, the total number of shells she has collected by her 10th birthday is:
\[ 60 \text{ shells} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 60 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cups of chamomile and mint tea Lana brews in each row, and then find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row.

First, we know that Lana has 27 cups of tea in total and she divides these into 3 rows with an equal number of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row. This means that in each row, there are an equal number of chamomile and mint tea cups. Let's denote the number of chamomile tea cups in each row as \( x \) and the number of mint tea cups in each row as \( x \). Therefore, the total number of cups in each row is \( 2x \).

Since there are 3 rows, the total number of cups of chamomile and mint tea is:
\[ 3 \times 2x = 6x \]

We know that the total number of cups of chamomile and mint tea is 27, so:
\[ 6x = 27 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = \frac{27}{6} = 4.5 \]

Since \( x \) represents the number of cups of chamomile tea and mint tea in each row, and we need to find the number of cups of mint tea in each row, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is:
\[ x = 4.5 \]

Therefore, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is:
\[ \boxed{4.5} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time the sloth spends picking berries and then use that to find out how many berries he can pick per trip.

The sloth spends 4 hours on each trip down to pick berries and climb back up. If he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we need to calculate how many trips he can make in 8 hours.

First, we calculate the number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours:
\[ \text{Number of trips} = \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips} \]

Since he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours and he makes 2 trips in that time, the number of berries he picks per trip is:
\[ \text{Berries per trip} = \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip} \]

Therefore, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip is 12."
"First, we need to determine the amount of water in the tank. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons of water, the tank will have:

\[ \text{Tank capacity} = \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much water will be left in the tank after 6 days, given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. The total amount of water removed from the tank in 6 days is:

\[ \text{Water removed} = 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[ \text{Water remaining} = 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2000 \]"
"To determine how many more movies Colby can see, we need to calculate his remaining budget after accounting for the items he has already purchased.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items he has already bought:
- 2 tubs of popcorn: \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars
- 4 boxes of candy: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars
- 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday: \(5 \times 10 = 50\) dollars
- 8 movies on other days: \(8 \times 7 = 56\) dollars

Total cost of these items:
\[16 + 8 + 50 + 56 = 120\]

Colby's total monthly budget is $150. Therefore, the remaining budget is:
\[150 - 120 = 30\]

Now, we need to determine how many more movies he can see with the remaining $30. Each movie ticket costs $7, so we divide the remaining budget by the cost of one movie ticket:
\[30 \div 7 = 4 \text{ R } 2\]

This means he can see 4 more full movies with the remaining $30, and he will have $2 left over.

The final numerical answer is:
4"
"First, we need to calculate the calories for the mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins.

For the mini cinnamon rolls:
- A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
- A mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll.
- Therefore, a mini cinnamon roll has \( \frac{600}{3} = 200 \) calories.
- Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls.
- So, the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls are \( 200 \times 200 = 40000 \) calories.

For the mini blueberry muffins:
- A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
- A mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin.
- Therefore, a mini blueberry muffin has \( \frac{450}{3} = 150 \) calories.
- Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins.
- So, the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins are \( 300 \times 150 = 45000 \) calories.

Adding the calories from both types of pastries:
- Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls: 40000 calories.
- Total calories from mini blueberry muffins: 45000 calories.
- Therefore, the total calories from all pastries are \( 40000 + 45000 = 85000 \) calories.

The final numerical answer is 85000 calories."
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the five days and then divide by the number of days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, so she removed \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs each day.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days:
\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

First, add the Junebugs removed on Monday and Tuesday:
\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]

Next, add the Junebugs removed on Wednesday:
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]

Then, add the Junebugs removed on Thursday:
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]

Finally, add the Junebugs removed on Friday:
\[
243 + 57 = 300
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days is 300.

To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days (5):
\[
\frac{300}{5} = 60
\]

Thus, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"First, we calculate the distance traveled by the bus. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For the bus:
\[ \text{Speed} = 60 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \times 5 = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance traveled by the car:
\[ \text{Speed} = 30 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 8 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 30 \times 8 = 240 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we find the difference in distance traveled by the bus and the car:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 300 - 240 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

So, the bus went 60 miles farther than the car. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 60 \]"
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to add up all the toys Sophie already has and then subtract that total from the overall number of toys she has.

The total number of toys Sophie already has is:
- Building blocks: 31
- Stuffed animals: 8
- Stacking rings: 9

Adding these together:
31 + 8 + 9 = 48

Sophie has a total of 62 toys for her nephew. To find out how many bouncy balls are in the tube, we subtract the number of toys she already has from the total number of toys:

62 - 48 = 14

Therefore, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is 14."
"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old:
\[ P + Pa + J = 100 \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
\[ Pa = J + 10 \]

3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
\[ P = Pa + J \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[ P = (J + 10) + J \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 \]

Now, we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

Now that we have \( J \), we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[ Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

So, the age of Peter is \( 50 \) years old.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we calculate the total distance Zoey spits her seeds. Zoey has 40 seeds and spits each one 10 feet, so the total distance Zoey spits is:
\[ 40 \text{ seeds} \times 10 \text{ feet/seed} = 400 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the total distance Sydney spits her seeds. Sydney has 35 seeds and spits each one 12 feet, so the total distance Sydney spits is:
\[ 35 \text{ seeds} \times 12 \text{ feet/seed} = 420 \text{ feet} \]

To find the average total distance spat, we add the total distances spat by Zoey and Sydney and then divide by 2:
\[ \text{Average total distance} = \frac{400 \text{ feet} + 420 \text{ feet}}{2} = \frac{820 \text{ feet}}{2} = 410 \text{ feet} \]

The average total distance spat is:

"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the daily, monthly, and hourly widget production and sales for each machine.

First, let's calculate the daily widget production for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1440 widgets/day
- WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1080 widgets/day

Next, let's calculate the monthly widget production for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: 1440 widgets/day * 30 days/month = 43200 widgets/month
- WidgetMaster 9000: 1080 widgets/day * 30 days/month = 32400 widgets/month

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the widgets for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: 43200 widgets/month * $6/widget = $259200/month
- WidgetMaster 9000: 32400 widgets/month * $6/widget = $194400/month

Finally, let's find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000:

"To determine how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the total cost for his stay under both options and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total hours Cameron will be staying:
- From 5 pm to 10 am the next day is 7 hours.
- Since he arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am, he will stay for 7 hours after the initial 12-hour stay.

Next, we calculate the cost for the initial 12-hour stay:
- The initial 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos.

Now, we calculate the cost for the additional 7 hours:
- For each additional hour after the 12-hour mark, Cameron pays an extra 70 pesos.
- Therefore, for 7 additional hours, the cost is \(7 \times 70 = 490\) pesos.

Adding the cost of the initial 12-hour stay and the additional 7 hours:
- Total cost = 1000 pesos (initial 12-hour stay) + 490 pesos (additional 7 hours) = 1490 pesos.

If Cameron had chosen the 24-hour option, the cost would be:
- 24-hour stay costs 1600 pesos.

Now, we find the savings by subtracting the total cost of the 12-hour plus additional 7-hour option from the 24-hour option:
- Savings = 1600 pesos (24-hour option) - 1490 pesos (12-hour plus additional 7-hour option) = 110 pesos.

Therefore, Cameron would save 110 pesos."
"First, let's determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. So, we calculate twice the amount each goat needs and then subtract 3 pounds:

\[ \text{Hay per sheep} = 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep. There are 15 goats, and each needs 5 pounds of hay:

\[ \text{Total hay for goats} = 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

There are 12 sheep, and each needs 7 pounds of hay:

\[ \text{Total hay for sheep} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the total hay needed for the goats and the sheep gives us the total amount of hay Nate needs:

\[ \text{Total hay needed} = 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 159 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much John earned in the week:
\[ \text{Earnings} = \text{Hourly Wage} \times \text{Hours Worked} = 50 \times 6 = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of gas:
\[ \text{Cost of Gas} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the remaining money after buying gas:
\[ \text{Remaining Money} = \text{Earnings} - \text{Cost of Gas} = 300 - 50 = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so we subtract that from the remaining money:
\[ \text{Money After Deposit} = \text{Remaining Money} - 100 = 250 - 100 = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of 5 pencils:
\[ \text{Cost of Pencils} = 5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the cost of the pencils from the money after the deposit:
\[ \text{Money After Buying Pencils} = \text{Money After Deposit} - \text{Cost of Pencils} = 150 - 50 = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, let's determine how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with the remaining money:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount. James gets 10 new CDs, and each CD costs $15. So the total cost is:

\[ 10 \times 15 = 150 \]

Next, we apply the 40% discount. The discount amount is:

\[ 150 \times 0.40 = 60 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:

\[ 150 - 60 = 90 \]

James decides to sell 5 of the CDs for $40. The cost of these 5 CDs is:

\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \]

So, the money he gets from selling the 5 CDs is $40. The net loss from selling these 5 CDs is:

\[ 75 - 40 = 35 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money he was out is the cost of the 5 CDs after the discount minus the money he got from selling them:

\[ 90 - 75 + 40 - 40 = 90 - 75 = 15 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 15 \]"

"First, let's calculate the distance James swims. He swims 60% of the 20-mile lake, which is:
\[ 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes for James to swim 12 miles at a pace of 2 miles per hour:
\[ \text{Time to swim 12 miles} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

James then rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is:
\[ \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

After resting, James swims the remaining 8 miles (20 - 12 = 8 miles) at half the speed, which is:
\[ \text{Speed for the remaining distance} = \frac{2 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile/hour} \]
\[ \text{Time to swim the remaining 8 miles} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, the total time taken is the sum of the swimming time, the resting time, and the swimming time for the remaining distance:
\[ \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours} \]

"Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as \( A \), by Dinar as \( D \), and by Bahati as \( B \).

According to the problem, Bahati scored the most points and it was 20 more than Azibo scored and 10 more points than Dinar scored. This gives us the following relationships:
\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]

Since the total points scored by the three individuals is 45, we have:
\[ B + A + D = 45 \]

We can substitute \( B \) from the first equation into the total points equation:
\[ (A + 20) + A + D = 45 \]
\[ 2A + D + 20 = 45 \]
\[ 2A + D = 25 \]

Next, we substitute \( B \) from the second equation into the total points equation:
\[ (D + 10) + A + D = 45 \]
\[ A + 2D + 10 = 45 \]
\[ A + 2D = 35 \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( 2A + D = 25 \)
2. \( A + 2D = 35 \)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use substitution. From the first equation, solve for \( D \):
\[ D = 25 - 2A \]

Substitute \( D \) into the second equation:
\[ A + 2(25 - 2A) = 35 \]
\[ A + 50 - 4A = 35 \]
\[ -3A + 50 = 35 \]
\[ -3A = 35 - 50 \]
\[ -3A = -15 \]
\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points. To verify, we can find the points scored by Dinar and Bahati:
\[ D = 25 - 2A = 25 - 2(5) = 15 \]
\[ B = A + 20 = 5 + 20 = 25 \]

Check the total:
\[ B + A + D = 25 + 5 + 15 = 45 \]

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of points Azibo scored is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of reports Vince stapled from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM.

First, calculate the total time Vince was stapling reports:
- From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Next, convert the total time into minutes:
- 15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes.

Now, determine how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:
- 900 minutes / 15 minutes/interval = 60 intervals.

Since Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes, we can calculate the total number of reports stapled:
- 60 intervals * 30 reports/interval = 1800 reports.

Therefore, the total number of reports Vince stapled is 1800."
"To calculate the total sleep time Kim had on that day, we need to consider her usual sleep duration and adjust for the changes.

1. **Usual sleep duration**: Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours.
2. **Convert to minutes**: 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes.
3. **Sleepwalking time**: She sleepwalked from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes.
4. **Waking up early**: She woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, which means she was awake for 5 minutes longer than usual.

So, the total time she was awake that day is:
- Usual sleep duration: 480 minutes
- Plus the 23 minutes she sleepwalked: 480 + 23 = 503 minutes
- Plus the 5 minutes she was awake earlier: 503 + 5 = 508 minutes

Since she was awake for 508 minutes, the time she slept on her bed is the total time minus the time she was awake:
- Total time awake: 508 minutes
- Usual sleep duration: 480 minutes
- Time slept on bed: 508 - 480 = 28 minutes

The final numerical answer is 28 minutes."
"First, let's determine how many measuring spoons Jonathan has initially. Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has two dozen measuring cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons as follows:

- Two dozen measuring cups is equal to \(2 \times 12 = 24\) measuring cups.
- Therefore, the number of measuring spoons is \(\frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16\) measuring spoons.

Next, we account for the 6 measuring spoons that Jonathan gifts to Pedro:

- After giving away 6 measuring spoons, the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has left is \(16 - 6 = 10\) measuring spoons.

Now, we add the remaining measuring spoons to the number of measuring cups to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining:

- Jonathan has 24 measuring cups and 10 measuring spoons remaining.
- Therefore, the total number of utensils is \(24 + 10 = 34\).

The final numerical answer is 34."
"First, let's determine the initial number of occupied beds in the hospital. The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of these beds are occupied.

\[ \text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

This means the initial number of unoccupied beds is:

\[ \text{Initial unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 200 = 800 \]

Next, we need to calculate the number of patients admitted over 2 weeks. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, and 50 patients are admitted each day.

\[ \text{Total patients admitted in 2 weeks} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

Now, we can find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks by adding the initial occupied beds to the total patients admitted:

\[ \text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Finally, the total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks is:

\[ \text{Total unoccupied beds after 2 weeks} = 1000 - 900 = 100 \]

So, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100."
"First, let's determine the number of emails Robyn sends to her family. We know that out of the sixteen emails, seven are work emails. Therefore, the number of non-work emails is:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these non-work emails are sent to her family. According to the problem, two-thirds of the non-work emails are sent to her family. So, the number of family emails is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

Now, we need to find out how many emails are left after accounting for the work and family emails. The number of remaining emails after sending work and family emails is:

\[ 16 - 7 - 6 = 3 \]

These remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. According to the problem, one-third of these remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. So, the number of boyfriend emails is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

Therefore, the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"First, let's determine Shawna's age. Since Shawna is three times as old as Aliya and Aliya is 3 years old, we can calculate Shawna's age as follows:

\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Now, we know that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. Therefore, we can calculate Shawna's father's age as follows:

\[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 45."
"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate the number that is 20% less than the number reported by Courtney.

Courtney reported 48 people attended the concert. Kelly states that this number is 20% too high. Therefore, we need to find 20% of 48 and subtract it from 48.

First, calculate 20% of 48:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 48 = \frac{20}{100} \times 48 = 0.2 \times 48 = 9.6 \]

Now, subtract this value from the reported number:
\[ 48 - 9.6 = 38.4 \]

Since the number of people must be a whole number, and assuming the context allows for fractional people (which is unusual but possible in some scenarios), the number of people who really attended the concert is 38.4.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 38.4 \]"
"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \). According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls. Therefore, we can set \( 2J = 2 \), which implies \( J = 1 \). So, Jeffrey carried 1 ball, Jason carried \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) balls, and Jordan carried \( 4 \times 1 = 4 \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey:
\[ 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 7."
"To solve this, let's break down the information given:

- On the first day, they dug 10 holes.
- On the second day, they dug 13 holes.
- On the third day, they dug 8 holes but also filled in 2 holes, so the net increase in holes was 8 - 2 = 6 holes.
- By the end of the third day, the total number of holes dug is 10 (first day) + 13 (second day) + 6 (third day net increase) = 29 holes.
- By the end of the fourth day, the total number of holes dug is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day, which is 4 * 10 = 40 holes.
- Therefore, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day minus the total number of holes by the end of the third day, which is 40 - 29 = 11 holes.

The final numerical answer is 11."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of corn chips given the conditions.

1. Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips.
2. Collins received 15 more corn chips than the number Amora and Lainey received, which means Collins received \(70 + 15 = 85\) corn chips.
3. The total number of corn chips is the sum of the corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins.

Let's calculate the total number of corn chips:

\[
\text{Total corn chips} = 70 + 70 + 85
\]

Now, let's perform the addition:

\[
70 + 70 = 140
\]
\[
140 + 85 = 225

"First, we need to calculate the cost of the travel tickets. The problem states that the travel tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. The supplies cost $400 in total.

To find 50% of $400:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the cost of the travel tickets is:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Therefore, the travel cost is $600."
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( X = S + 5 \)
2. \( S = 4A - 13 \)
3. \( X + S + A = 339 \)

First, we substitute the expressions for \( X \) and \( S \) from the first two equations into the third equation.

Substituting \( X = S + 5 \) and \( S = 4A - 13 \) into \( X + S + A = 339 \):

\[ (4A - 13) + 5 + (4A - 13) + A = 339 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 4A - 13 + 5 + 4A - 13 + A = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Add 21 to both sides:

\[ 9A = 360 \]

Divide by 9:

\[ A = 40 \]

Now, we can find \( S \) using \( S = 4A - 13 \):

\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 147 \]"

"To find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the distance flown in each segment of the journey and then sum these distances.

1. **First Segment:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Direction: Norttherly
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour

- At the surprise party: 4 dozen = 4 * 12 = 48 brownies
- During the party: 1 1/2 dozen = 3/2 dozen = 3/2 * 12 = 18 brownies

Now, let's add them all together:

12 (initial) + 3 (office) + 48 (surprise) + 18 (during the party) = 81 brownies

Therefore, the number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is 81."
"First, let's determine the ages of Nani's brother and sister.

Nani's age is 8 years.

His brother is twice his age, so:
\[ \text{Brother's age} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ years} \]

Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani, which means she is 75% of Nani's age:
\[ \text{Sister's age} = 0.75 \times 8 = 6 \text{ years} \]

Now, let's calculate the total age of all three family members:
\[ \text{Total age} = \text{Nani's age} + \text{Brother's age} + \text{Sister's age} \]
\[ \text{Total age} = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 \text{ years} \]

"To determine the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the total length of the fence. Since the fence is rectangular, we can find the perimeter (P) using the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 25 \]
\[ P = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing. Therefore, the total number of wooden slats required is:

\[ \text{Total slats} = \text{Perimeter} \times \text{Slats per foot} \]
\[ \text{Total slats} = 50 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Total slats} = 100 \]

So, Robert will need 100 wooden slats."
"First, let's determine the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington initially had and how many she gave away:

- Total boxes bought: 12
- Boxes given to mom: 2
- Boxes given to sister: 2

Total boxes given away = 2 + 2 = 4

So, the number of boxes Mrs. Harrington kept is:
12 - 4 = 8 boxes

Next, we calculate the total number of oranges in the boxes she kept:
- Each box contains 20 oranges
- Boxes kept: 8

Total oranges kept = 8 * 20 = 160 oranges

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges, so the total number of oranges she had initially is:
160 oranges (kept) = 1/4 of total oranges
Total oranges = 160 * 4 = 640 oranges

The number of oranges she sold is the remaining 3/4 of the total oranges:
3/4 of 640 = (3/4) * 640 = 480 oranges

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
480 oranges"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( S \).

According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. Therefore, the number of states in India can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Number of states in India} = \frac{1}{2}S + 4 \]

We need to find the total number of states in both countries together. This can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Total number of states} = S + \left(\frac{1}{2}S + 4\right) \]

Simplifying the expression:
\[ \text{Total number of states} = S + \frac{1}{2}S + 4 \]
\[ \text{Total number of states} = \frac{2}{2}S + \frac{1}{2}S + 4 \]
\[ \text{Total number of states} = \frac{3}{2}S + 4 \]

The problem does not provide the exact number of states in the USA, so we cannot determine a specific numerical answer. However, if we assume the number of states in the USA is known, we can substitute that value into the equation to find the total number of states in both countries.

For example, if the USA has 50 states (\( S = 50 \)):
\[ \text{Total number of states} = \frac{3}{2} \times 50 + 4 \]
\[ \text{Total number of states} = 75 + 4 \]
\[ \text{Total number of states} = 79 \]

Thus, the total number of states in both countries together, assuming the USA has 50 states, is 79."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Tyler wants to buy:
- Dictionary: $18
- Dinosaur book: $13
- Children's cookbook: $8

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Tyler has already saved $14. So, the additional amount he needs to buy the books is:
Additional amount needed = Total cost - Amount saved
Additional amount needed = $39 - $14 = $25

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn the additional $25, we divide the additional amount needed by his hourly wage:
Hours needed = Additional amount needed / Hourly wage
Hours needed = $25 / $5 = 5 hours

So, Tyler has to work 5 hours to afford his books."
"First, let's determine how many cherries Richard has. We know that Robert has 30 cherries and that he has 10 more than Richard. Therefore, Richard has:

\[ \text{Cherries Richard has} = \text{Cherries Robert has} - 10 = 30 - 10 = 20 \]

Next, we know the total number of cherries is 60. We can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting the number of cherries Richard and Robert have from the total:

\[ \text{Cherries Jerry has} = \text{Total cherries} - (\text{Cherries Richard has} + \text{Cherries Robert has}) \]
\[ \text{Cherries Jerry has} = 60 - (20 + 30) = 60 - 50 = 10 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Cherries Robert has} - \text{Cherries Jerry has} = 30 - 10 = 20 \]

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry. The final numerical answer is:

So, the red car is $40 cheaper than the blue car. Therefore, the price of the red car is:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Now, to find the total cost of both cars, we add the price of the red car to the price of the blue car:
\[ 60 + 100 = 160 \]

The total cost of both cars is $160."
"To solve this problem, let's define the current ages of Emil's dad and brother as \(D\) and \(B\) respectively.

Given:
- Emil is currently 19 years old.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.

First, let's determine how many years it will be until Emil turns 24:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \text{ years} \]

When Emil turns 24, his dad's age will be:
\[ D + 5 \]

According to the problem, at that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad:
\[ 24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5) \]

Solving for \(D\):
\[ 24 = \frac{D + 5}{2} \]
\[ 48 = D + 5 \]
\[ D = 43 \]

So, Emil's dad is currently 43 years old.

Next, we know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother:
\[ 24 = 2B \]

Solving for \(B\):
\[ B = \frac{24}{2} \]
\[ B = 12 \]

So, Emil's brother is currently 12 years old.

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother:
\[ D + B = 43 + 12 = 55 \]

The sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is:

"First, let's find out how many students are football players. Since 20% of the class are football players, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 30 = \frac{20}{100} \times 30 = 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are football players. This means the remaining number of students is:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining 24 students are either cheerleaders or part of the band. Since 25% of the remaining students are cheerleaders or part of the band, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 24 = \frac{25}{100} \times 24 = 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are either cheerleaders or part of the band. Adding the football players to these students, we get the total number of students leaving early:

\[ 6 \text{ (football players)} + 6 \text{ (cheerleaders or band members)} = 12 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we first need to determine the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size five boots, Charlie wears size \(5 \times 5 = 25\) boots.

Next, we calculate the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie. The average is found by adding the sizes of their boots and then dividing by 2.

\[
\text{Average size} = \frac{\text{Charlie's size} + \text{Sophie's size}}{2} = \frac{25 + 5}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15
\]

So, the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie is 15."
"First, let's convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches to match the units of the plant width. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

\[ 111 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 1332 \text{ inches} \]

Each plant is 12 inches wide, and there needs to be 1.5 feet (which is 18 inches) between every plant. So, the total space taken by one plant and the space between it and the next plant is:

\[ 12 \text{ inches} + 18 \text{ inches} = 30 \text{ inches} \]

To find out how many plants can fit in the flower bed, we divide the total length of the flower bed by the space taken by one plant and the space between it and the next plant:

\[ \frac{1332 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/plant}} = 44.4 \text{ plants} \]

Since Pat can't plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants. Pat already owns 17 plants, so the number of additional plants she needs to buy is:

\[ 44 - 17 = 27 \text{ plants} \]

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional plants is:

\[ 27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed."
"First, we need to determine how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day. Since Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, we calculate:

\[ \text{Edgar's brother's pretzels per day} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

Next, to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we multiply the number of pretzels he eats in a day by the number of days in a week:

\[ \text{Edgar's brother's pretzels in a week} = 9 \times 7 = 63 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 63."
"To determine the total cost Katherine will spend, we need to calculate the cost for one basket and then multiply by the number of baskets.

First, let's calculate the cost for one basket:
- Cost of petunias: 3 petunias * $3.00/petunia = $9.00
- Cost of sweet potato vines: 2 vines * $2.50/vine = $5.00

Total cost for one basket: $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00

Now, we need to find the total cost for 5 baskets:
- Total cost for 5 baskets: 5 baskets * $14.00/basket = $70.00

Therefore, the total amount Katherine will spend is $70.00."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

For the sunflowers:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

For the carnations:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of soil they have is 30 pounds. So, the remaining soil for roses is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. Therefore, the number of roses they can plant is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"First, we need to calculate how much Jessica sets aside each month for fancy shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly paycheck.

\[ \text{Monthly savings for shoes} = 25\% \times \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times \$2,000.00 = \$500.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how much she can save in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year:

\[ \text{Annual savings for shoes} = \$500.00 \times 12 = \$6,000.00 \]

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so we need to determine how many pairs she can buy with her annual savings:

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes} = \frac{\$6,000.00}{\$1,000.00} = 6 \]

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, the time required to peel 90 shrimp is:

\[ \text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to saute 90 shrimp. Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, the time required to saute 90 shrimp is:

\[ \text{Time to saute 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/10 minutes}} = 3 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Emily needs to do both tasks (peeling and sauteing) simultaneously, the total time required will be the longer of the two times calculated, because she can't peel shrimp while they are cooking. Therefore, the total time required is 30 minutes.

The final numerical answer is:
30"
"First, let's calculate the temperature change during each phase of the air conditioner's operation:

1. **Low setting for 3 hours:**
   - Rate: 2 degrees per hour
   - Time: 3 hours
   - Temperature change: \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ degrees}\)

2. **High setting for 4 hours:**
   - Rate: 3 degrees per hour
   - Time: 4 hours
   - Temperature change: \(3 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ degrees}\)

3. **Off for 2 hours:**
   - The room will warm up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Temperature change: \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ degrees}\)

Now, let's sum up the temperature changes:
- Total temperature change: \(6 \text{ degrees} + 12 \text{ degrees} + 4 \text{ degrees} = 22 \text{ degrees}\)

Since the room was initially at its starting temperature, the final temperature is 22 degrees higher than the starting temperature. Therefore, the room is 22 degrees higher than the starting temperature.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time:**
   - Bill's father saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill saw the comet for the second time when he was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old.

2. **Determine the time interval between the first and second sightings:**
   - The comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
   - The time interval between the first and second sightings is 75 years.

3. **Determine Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.
   - The time interval between the first and second sightings is 75 years.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to break down the information given and calculate each category of checks:

1. **Electric Bill**: Once per month, so 12 checks per year.
2. **Gas Bill**: Once per month, so 12 checks per year.
3. **Church**: Twice per month, so 24 checks per year.
4. **Pest and Lawn Service**: Quarterly, which means 4 times per year, so 4 checks per year.

Now, we sum these up:

\[ 12 \text{ (electric)} + 12 \text{ (gas)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn)} = 52 \text{ checks per year} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 52."
"Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as \( F \). According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4}F \).

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. Therefore, the number of flights to France is \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the remaining flights. The remaining flights can be calculated as \( F - \frac{3}{4}F = \frac{1}{4}F \). Since this remaining number of flights is split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{4}F = \frac{1}{8}F \).

The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day is \( 2 \times 44 = 88 \). So, \( F = 88 \).

Now, we can find the number of flights to France by substituting \( F = 88 \) into the expression for the number of flights to France, which is \( \frac{1}{8}F \):
\[ \frac{1}{8} \times 88 = 11. \]

Thus, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is \( 11 \)."
"First, let's determine the duration of each wolf's howl.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so:
\[ \text{Chikote's howl duration} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Igneous howls for as long as Tobias and Chikote combined, so:
\[ \text{Igneous's howl duration} = 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, let's find the combined duration of all three wolves' howls in seconds:
\[ \text{Combined duration} = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 \text{ seconds} \]

To convert the combined duration from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):
\[ \text{Combined duration in minutes} = \frac{120}{60} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate how much money Adam's father gave him. Since his father gave him twice as much as his mother, and his mother gave him $6, his father gave him \(2 \times 6 = 12\) dollars.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money Adam received from his mother and father: \(6 + 12 = 18\) dollars.

Adam originally needed $30 for the trousers. To find out how much he had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount he received from his parents from the total cost of the trousers: \(30 - 18 = 12\) dollars.

So, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the age of Wilfred. Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \(A\), \(B\), \(H\), and \(W\) respectively. We know the following:

1. \(A = 3\)
2. \(B = 4\)
3. The total age of the children is 20, so \(A + B + H + W = 20\).
4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is \(\frac{20}{4} = 5\). Therefore, \(H = 2 \times 5 = 10\).

Now we can substitute the known values into the total age equation:
\[3 + 4 + 10 + W = 20\]
\[17 + W = 20\]
\[W = 20 - 17\]
\[W = 3\]

So, the age of Wilfred is 3. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount Walter has collected from his neighbors and the online fund:
- From neighbors: $500
- From online fund: $1500

Total collected so far: $500 + $1500 = $2000

Next, we need to determine how much Walter's lawyer will contribute. The lawyer will donate three times as much as everyone else donates. To find out how much everyone else has donated, we need to add the $200 given by Walter's friend to the total collected so far:
- Total collected so far: $2000
- Amount given by friend: $200

Total amount donated by everyone else: $2000 + $200 = $2200

Now, we calculate the lawyer's contribution, which is three times the amount donated by everyone else:
- Amount donated by everyone else: $2200
- Lawyer's contribution: 3 * $2200 = $6600

So, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6600."
"First, we need to calculate the total number of cookies. Since there were 100 guests and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies, the total number of cookies is:

The bride decided to give half of the cookies to the church next door. Therefore, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500 \text{ cookies}}{2} = 750 \text{ cookies} \]

Each person in the church next door got 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church next door, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people} \]

So, the number of people in the church next door is:

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the distribution of the watermelon slices among the family members. Let's denote the total volume of the watermelon as \( V \).

Given that there are 2 adults and 4 kids, and each adult's slice is twice as big as each kid's slice, we can represent the volume of each adult's slice as \( 2x \) and the volume of each kid's slice as \( x \).

The total volume of the watermelon is the sum of the volumes of all slices:
\[ V = 2(2x) + 4(x) = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

Each adult's slice is \( 2x \), so the total volume of the slices for the adults is:
\[ 2(2x) = 4x \]

The percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is calculated by dividing the volume of each adult's slice by the total volume of the watermelon and then multiplying by 100:
\[ \text{Percentage for each adult} = \left( \frac{4x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, each adult gets 50% of the watermelon."
"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on inpatient rounds. He has 9 inpatients, and each round takes 20 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent on inpatient rounds is:
\[ 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes per inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time spent on appointments. He has 10 appointments, and each appointment takes 30 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent on appointments is:
\[ 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes per appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's add the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments to find the total time spent on these activities:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 480 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Doctor Jones works for 9 hours at the clinic, we need to convert this time into minutes to compare it with the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments:
\[ 9 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 540 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's find out how much time Doctor Jones has left to update his records by subtracting the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments from the total time he works:
\[ 540 \text{ minutes} - 480 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we need to convert the remaining time from minutes to hours:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to complete all the steps and then subtract this total from the desired serving time of 5:00 pm.

First, let's convert all times to minutes for easier calculation:
- Making the cake batter: 20 minutes
- Baking the cake: 30 minutes
- Cooling the cake: 2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes
- Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

Now, let's add up all the times:
20 minutes (batter) + 30 minutes (baking) + 120 minutes (cooling) + 10 minutes (frosting) = 180 minutes

Next, we convert the total time from minutes to hours and minutes:
180 minutes = 3 hours

Jordan wants the cake to be ready by 5:00 pm. To find the latest start time, we subtract the total time required from 5:00 pm:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, the latest time of day that Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

The final numerical answer is:

- Total sessions in a month: 12
- Total earnings in a month: $40 * 12 = $480

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"To find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we first need to determine the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes.

Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars. Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes is:
\[ \text{Chocolate bars per box (Peter)} = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]

Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars. Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes is:
\[ \text{Chocolate bars per box (Martha)} = \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

Now, to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we subtract the number of chocolate bars per box for Martha from the number of chocolate bars per box for Peter:

"First, let's find the number of female porcupines. Given that the number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the number of babies born each month is:

\[ \text{Number of babies per month} = 30 \times 4 = 120 \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[ \text{Total number of babies in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440 \]

The total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be the original population plus the total number of babies born in a year:

\[ \text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet.
2. Multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons needed.
3. Calculate the cost by multiplying the number of gallons by $0.10 per gallon.

First, let's calculate the volume of the pool. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is:
\[ \text{Volume} = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions:
- Width = 14 feet
- Length = 25 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

So, the volume in cubic feet is:
\[ \text{Volume} = 14 \times 25 \times 4 \]

Next, we multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:
\[ \text{Number of gallons} = \text{Volume} \times 5.9 \]

Finally, we calculate the cost:
\[ \text{Cost} = \text{Number of gallons} \times 0.10 \]

Let's perform the calculations:
\[ \text{Volume} = 14 \times 25 \times 4 = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]
\[ \text{Number of gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \text{ gallons} \]
\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 = 826 \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is $826.

"First, let's determine the number of blue sticks. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, and there are 9 red sticks, we can calculate the number of blue sticks as follows:

Number of blue sticks = Number of red sticks + 5
Number of blue sticks = 9 + 5
Number of blue sticks = 14

Next, we need to find the number of yellow sticks. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks:

Number of yellow sticks = Number of blue sticks - 3
Number of yellow sticks = 14 - 3
Number of yellow sticks = 11

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together:

Total number of sticks = Number of red sticks + Number of blue sticks + Number of yellow sticks
Total number of sticks = 9 + 14 + 11
Total number of sticks = 34

So, the total number of sticks they have is 34."
"First, we calculate the distance Matteo traveled. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Matteo:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 55 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance Shandy traveled:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} = 45 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the distance Matteo traveled from the distance Shandy traveled:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Total students: 3000
- Half of these students are over 16 years old: \( \frac{3000}{2} = 1500 \)
- One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male: \( \frac{1500}{4} = 375 \)
- Therefore, the number of female students over 16 years old: \( 1500 - 375 = 1125 \)

- The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old: \( \frac{3000}{2} = 1500 \)
- One-half of the students under 16 are male: \( \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \)
- Therefore, the number of female students under 16 years old: \( 1500 - 750 = 750 \)

Now, to find the total number of female students enrolled at the school:

- Female students over 16 years old: 1125
- Female students under 16 years old: 750

Total number of female students: \( 1125 + 750 = 1875 \)

The final numerical answer is 1875."
"First, let's determine how many laps each person can run:

- Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
- Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps.
- Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) laps.
- Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps.

Now, to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run:

- Bethany can run 10 laps, and Quinn can run 5 laps.
- Therefore, Bethany can run \(10 - 5 = 5\) more laps than Quinn.

The final numerical answer is 5."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days and then subtract this from the tank's total capacity.

First, let's calculate the amount of water Wanda pumped on the first day:
- Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity on the first day.
- The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons.
- Therefore, Wanda pumped \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons on the first day.

Next, we calculate the amount of water Ms. B pumped on the first day:
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda.
- Therefore, Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons on the first day.

Now, let's calculate the amount of water Wanda pumped on the second day:
- Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
- Therefore, Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons on the second day.

Next, we calculate the amount of water Ms. B pumped on the second day:
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
- Therefore, Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons on the second day.

Now, we sum up the total amount of water pumped into the tank over the two days:
- Total water pumped by Wanda: \( 4500 + 3000 = 7500 \) gallons.
- Total water pumped by Ms. B: \( 3375 + 1125 = 4500 \) gallons.
- Total water pumped into the tank: \( 7500 + 4500 = 12000 \) gallons.

Finally, we calculate the remaining amount of water needed to fill the tank:
- The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons.
- The total amount of water pumped into the tank is 12000 gallons.
- Therefore, the remaining amount of water needed to fill the tank is \( 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \) gallons.

"Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as \( C \).

First, we know that for the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour. This means that after each hour, the power bank retains 91% of its charge from the previous hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining can be calculated as:
\[ C \times (0.91)^5 \]

Next, for the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour, meaning it retains 93% of its charge from the previous hour. So, after these 3 hours, the charge remaining can be calculated as:
\[ C \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 \]

We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ C \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \times C \]

We can cancel \( C \) from both sides of the equation (assuming \( C \neq 0 \)):
\[ (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \]

Now, we need to calculate the left side of the equation:
\[ (0.91)^5 \approx 0.658 \]
\[ (0.93)^3 \approx 0.817 \]
\[ 0.658 \times 0.817 \approx 0.536 \]

So, we have:
\[ 0.536 = 0.28 \]

This indicates that the initial charge \( C \) must be scaled to fit the given final charge. Since the equation holds true with the given percentages, we can conclude that the initial charge \( C \) is correctly scaled to 100% of the final charge. Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park is:
\[ C = 100\% \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"First, let's calculate Janet's total weekly earnings. She earns $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, so her total weekly earnings are:

\[ 10 + 15 = 25 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are:

\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ dollars per week} \]

Next, we need to determine how much she needs to save to buy the car. The downpayment for the car is $10000. She wants to save 20% of this amount:

\[ 10000 \times 0.20 = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to save $2000 at a rate of $1000 per week:

\[ \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

So, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment for the car. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased:

- Peaches: 3 peaches * $0.50/peach = $1.50
- Pears: 4 pears * $0.50/pear = $2.00
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00/kiwi = $2.00
- Apples: 5 apples * $0.75/apple = $3.75

Now, let's sum these amounts to find the total cost of the fruits he has already bought:

Total cost of purchased fruits = $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar has $10 to spend, so the remaining amount he can spend on plums is:

Remaining amount = $10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Finally, we need to determine how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75. Since each plum costs $0.25, the number of plums he can buy is:

Number of plums = $0.75 / $0.25/plum = 3 plums

So, the final numerical answer is 3."
"First, we need to determine the total number of pieces of sweets Anne purchased. Since she bought a box containing 15 packs and each pack has 60 pieces, the total number of pieces is calculated as follows:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept 2 packs for herself. The number of pieces in these 2 packs is:

\[ 2 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

The number of pieces of sweets that Anne gave to her friends is the total number of pieces minus the pieces she kept:

\[ 900 \text{ pieces} - 120 \text{ pieces} = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne gave these 780 pieces to her 10 friends equally. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide the total number of pieces given to friends by the number of friends:

\[ \frac{780 \text{ pieces}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 78 \text{ pieces/friend} \]

So, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets. The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating growth over time. The formula is:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the future value of the carrot price.
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price of the carrot, which is $120.
- \( r \) is the annual growth rate, which is 5% or 0.05.
- \( n \) is the number of years, which is 3.

Plugging in the values:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ P = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years would be $139."
"To find out how many selfies and portraits Olivia uploaded, we first need to determine how many pictures were put into each album. Since she uploaded 72 pictures into 8 albums, we can calculate the number of pictures per album by dividing 72 by 8.

\[ \text{Pictures per album} = \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Given that 3 of the albums were selfies only and 2 of the albums were portraits, we can calculate the total number of selfies and portraits by multiplying the number of pictures per album by the number of albums for each type.

For selfies:
\[ \text{Total selfies} = 3 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures/album} = 27 \text{ selfies} \]

For portraits:
\[ \text{Total portraits} = 2 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures/album} = 18 \text{ portraits} \]

To find the total number of portraits and selfies combined:
\[ \text{Total portraits and selfies} = 27 \text{ selfies} + 18 \text{ portraits} = 45 \]

So, the total number of portraits and selfies Olivia had is 45."
"To determine how long James spends reading, we first need to find out how many minutes it takes him to read one page. Since it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can calculate the time per page as follows:

\[ \text{Time per page} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages. We can do this by multiplying the time per page by the number of pages:

\[ \text{Time to read 18 pages} = 18 \text{ pages} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, James spends 60 minutes reading."
"Initially, the hotel had 100 guests. 

24 guests checked out early, reducing the number of guests by 24:
\[ 100 - 24 = 76 \]

15 guests checked out late, reducing the number of guests by 15:
\[ 76 - 15 = 61 \]

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, twice this number is:
\[ 2 \times 15 = 30 \]

Adding these 30 guests to the current total:
\[ 61 + 30 = 91 \]

After dinner was served, 7 more people checked in:
\[ 91 + 7 = 98 \]

Therefore, the hotel now has 98 guests."

"First, let's determine the number of easy, average, and difficult questions in the quiz.

- Total questions: 60
- Easy questions: 40% of 60 = 0.40 * 60 = 24 questions
- Average and difficult questions combined: 60 - 24 = 36 questions
- Since the average and difficult questions are equally divided, each type has: 36 / 2 = 18 questions

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct. So, the number of easy questions she is sure to get is:
- Easy questions she is sure to get: 75% of 24 = 0.75 * 24 = 18 questions

She is sure to get half of the average and difficult questions correct. So, the number of average and difficult questions she is sure to get is:
- Average and difficult questions she is sure to get: 50% of 18 = 0.50 * 18 = 9 questions

Now, let's add up the questions she is sure to get:

"First, let's determine the price of a large stuffed animal. Since each small stuffed animal costs $4 and large stuffed animals cost three times as much, the price of a large stuffed animal is:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( L \). According to the problem, the number of small stuffed animals sold is twice the number of large stuffed animals sold, so the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2L \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as the sum of the earnings from the large stuffed animals and the small stuffed animals. The earnings from the large stuffed animals are \( 12L \) dollars, and the earnings from the small stuffed animals are \( 4 \times 2L = 8L \) dollars. The total earnings are given as $120, so we can set up the following equation:
\[ 12L + 8L = 120 \]
\[ 20L = 120 \]
\[ L = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

Since the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2L \), we have:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the ore mining rate with a steel pickaxe:**
   - With an iron pickaxe, a dwarf can mine twice as much as with bare hands.
   - Therefore, with an iron pickaxe, a dwarf can mine \(12 \times 2 = 24\) pounds of ore per day.
   - With a steel pickaxe, a dwarf can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe.
   - Therefore, with a steel pickaxe, a dwarf can mine \(24 \times 1.5 = 36\) pounds of ore per day.

2. **Calculate the total ore mining for 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in one day:**
   - Each dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day.
   - Therefore, 40 dwarves can mine \(36 \times 40 = 1440\) pounds of ore per day.

3. **Calculate the total ore mining for 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month:**
   - There are 30 days in the month.

The final numerical answer is 43200 pounds of ore."
"To solve this, we need to determine the price of the third package based on the given proportional relationship between the number of sandwiches and the price.

First, let's find the price per sandwich for each package:

- For the first package with 2 sandwiches for $3:
  \[
  \text{Price per sandwich} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
  \]

- For the second package with 4 sandwiches for $6:
  \[
  \text{Price per sandwich} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
  \]

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages. Therefore, the price per sandwich is $1.5.

Now, we can calculate the cost of the third package with 8 sandwiches:
\[
\text{Cost of 8 sandwiches} = 8 \times 1.5 = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12."

"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst. Sally initially had 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst.

\[ \text{Red balloons that burst} = 25 \times \frac{40}{100} = 10 \]

So, the number of red balloons remaining is:

\[ \text{Remaining red balloons} = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Next, Sally accidentally released half of the yellow balloons. She initially had 12 yellow balloons.

\[ \text{Yellow balloons released} = 12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons remaining is:

\[ \text{Remaining yellow balloons} = 12 - 6 = 6 \]

Sally found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her remaining balloons.

\[ \text{Blue balloons added} = 8 \times \frac{75}{100} = 6 \]

So, the number of blue balloons she added is 6. Now, let's sum up all the remaining balloons:

\[ \text{Total balloons carried into school} = \text{Remaining red balloons} + \text{Remaining yellow balloons} + \text{Blue balloons added} \]

"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of the different scenarios and their outcomes.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of the substitute teacher collecting the homework: 50% or 0.50
   - Therefore, the probability of the substitute teacher collecting the homework: \(0.50 \times 0.50 = 0.25\) or 25%

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having the normal teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension: 40% or 0.40
   - Therefore, the probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension: \(0.50 \times (1 - 0.40) = 0.50 \times 0.60 = 0.30\) or 30%

3. **Personal Extension Scenario:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension: 30% or 0.30
   - Probability of Marcus convincing the teacher his dog ate the assignment: 20% or 0.20
   - Therefore, the probability of Marcus getting a personal extension: \(0.30 \times 0.20 = 0.06\) or 6%

Now, we sum up the probabilities of the scenarios where Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
- Substitute teacher collecting: 25%
- Normal teacher not giving an extension and Marcus not getting a personal extension: \(30\% - 6\% = 24\%\)

Total probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:

"First, let's calculate the total amount Jim borrowed during his college years. He borrowed $50,000 per year for 4 years, so the total loan amount is:

\[ 50,000 \times 4 = 200,000 \]

Next, let's determine his income after college. His income tripled, so his new income is:

\[ 25,000 \times 3 = 75,000 \]

Now, let's calculate the total income he would have earned if he had not gone to college. He would have earned $25,000 per year for 4 years:

\[ 25,000 \times 4 = 100,000 \]

The total income he would have earned if he had not gone to college is $100,000. The total income he earned during his college years is the sum of his income before college and the income he earned during college:

\[ 25,000 + 200,000 = 225,000 \]

The money lost from not working while in school is the difference between the income he would have earned if he had not gone to college and the income he earned during his college years:

\[ 225,000 - 100,000 = 125,000 \]

Now, we need to determine how long it would take for him to earn back the $200,000 in loans and the $125,000 in lost income. The total amount he needs to earn is:

\[ 200,000 + 125,000 = 325,000 \]

Since his new income after college is $75,000 per year, the number of years required to earn $325,000 is:

\[ \frac{325,000}{75,000} = \frac{325}{75} = \frac{65}{15} = \frac{13}{3} \approx 4.33 \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total area of fabric required is:
\[ \text{Total area} = 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Thus, the total square feet of fabric Jim needs to buy is:
\[ 160 \]"
"To solve this problem, we will break it down into steps and calculate the number of letters delivered each day.

1. **Monday:**
   The post office delivered 425 letters.

2. **Tuesday:**
   The number of letters delivered on Tuesday is 17 more than one-fifth of the number delivered on Monday.
   \[
   \text{One-fifth of Monday's deliveries} = \frac{425}{5} = 85

   - Since he won, this is a positive amount, but for the purpose of calculating loss, we consider it as $11 lost.

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Amount won in the second race = $11.
   - 1.5 times the amount won = 1.5 * $11 = $16.5.
   - Amount lost in the third race = $16.5.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost:
- Total amount lost = Amount lost in the first race + Amount lost in the second race + Amount lost in the third race.
- Total amount lost = $5 + $11 + $16.5 = $32.5.

To find the average amount lost per race, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races:
- Number of races = 3.
- Average amount lost per race = Total amount lost / Number of races.
- Average amount lost per race = $32.5 / 3 = $10.8333...

Rounding to the nearest cent, the average amount lost per race is $10.83.

The final numerical answer is:
$10.83"
"To find the total population in South America, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities per country and then multiply that by the number of people per city.

Number of countries in South America = 26
Number of cities per country = 5
Number of people per city = 1000

Total population = Number of countries * Number of cities per country * Number of people per city
Total population = 26 * 5 * 1000

Now, let's calculate the total population.
Total population = 26 * 5 * 1000 = 130,000

The final numerical answer is 130,000."
"First, we need to convert all measurements to the same unit for easier comparison. Let's use inches.

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, Xavier's height in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Xavier grew 3 inches, so his current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole's initial height was 50 inches. Cole grew 2 inches, so his current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier’s height now is:
\[ 1 \text{ inch} \]"
"Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( 420 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 420 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps:

1. **Determine the total number of days the painters worked:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - The painters worked for 3 weeks.
   - Therefore, the total number of days worked is \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \) days.

2. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by the team:**
   - Each day, the team worked \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day.
   - Therefore, the total number of hours worked by the team is \( 21 \times \frac{3}{8} \).

3. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by the team:**
   \[
   21 \times \frac{3}{8} = \frac{63}{8} = 7.875 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of hours each painter worked:**
   - There are 4 painters.
   - Therefore, each painter worked \( \frac{7.875}{4} \) hours.

5. **Calculate the number of hours each painter worked:**
   \[
   \frac{7.875}{4} = 1.96875 \text{ hours}
   \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, Rory retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x + 4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now that we know \( x = 6 \), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

So, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we can use the formula for exponential decay, which is given by:

\[ P(t) = P_0 \times (1 - r)^t \]

where:
- \( P(t) \) is the price of the car at time \( t \),
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price of the car,
- \( r \) is the rate of depreciation,
- \( t \) is the time in years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 20000 \) dollars,
- \( r = 0.21 \),
- \( t = 2010 - 2007 = 3 \) years.

Now, we substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P(3) = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ P(3) = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]

Calculating \( (0.79)^3 \):

\[ (0.79)^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.493039 \]

Now, we multiply this by the initial price:

\[ P(3) = 20000 \times 0.493039 = 9860.78 \]

So, the price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9860.78."
"First, let's find out how many books are written in English. Since half of the 50 books are in English, we calculate:

\[ \text{English books} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

Next, we find out how many books are written in German. Since 10% of the books are in German, we calculate:

\[ \text{German books} = 10\% \times 50 = 0.10 \times 50 = 5 \]

Now, to find out how many books are written in Spanish, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:

\[ \text{Spanish books} = 50 - \text{English books} - \text{German books} = 50 - 25 - 5 = 20 \]

So, the number of Spanish books is 20."
"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we first need to calculate the total distance she has already covered. Bernice drove 325 kilometers over 4 days. 

Total distance already covered = 325 kilometers

The total distance from San Diego to New York City is approximately 1955 kilometers. To find out how much more she needs to drive, we subtract the distance she has already covered from the total distance.

Distance remaining = Total distance - Distance already covered
Distance remaining = 1955 kilometers - 325 kilometers
Distance remaining = 1630 kilometers

So, Bernice will still need to drive 1630 kilometers."
"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cups of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days.
2. Convert the total number of cups into gallons.

First, we calculate the total number of cups of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days:
\[ \text{Total cups in 30 days} = 8 \, \text{cups/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 240 \, \text{cups} \]

Next, we convert the total number of cups into gallons. Since there are 16 cups in a gallon:
\[ \text{Total gallons} = \frac{240 \, \text{cups}}{16 \, \text{cups/gallon}} = 15 \, \text{gallons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

3. **Second stop:**
   - People who descended: \(50\)
   - People who boarded: \(2 \times 50 = 100\)
   \[
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190
   \]

4. **Third stop:**
   - People who descended: \(80\)
   \[
   190 - 80 = 110

"First, let's determine the cost of each item Alison bought:

1. Tank top: $10
2. Running shorts: $5 more than the tank top, so $10 + $5 = $15
3. Tennis shoes: Originally $48, but on sale for half price, so $48 / 2 = $24
4. Athletic socks: $8 original price, but with a $2 off coupon, so $8 - $2 = $6

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:

Total cost = Cost of tank top + Cost of running shorts + Cost of tennis shoes + Cost of athletic socks
Total cost = $10 + $15 + $24 + $6

Now, let's calculate the total cost:

Total cost = $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55

So, Alison spent $55 on athletic gear."
"To determine the cost of renovating the kitchen floor, we first need to calculate how many tiles are required to cover the 200 SqFt area. Since each tile is a square with a side length of 1ft, each tile covers 1 SqFt.

Therefore, the number of tiles needed is equal to the total area of the kitchen floor, which is 200 tiles.

Each tile costs $12, so the total cost will be the number of tiles multiplied by the cost per tile:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 200 \text{ tiles} \times \$12/\text{tile} = \$2400 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\$2400"
"To calculate how much James pays for insurance a year after an accident, we first need to determine the increased monthly cost. The normal cost is $120 a month, and it increased by 60%. 

First, calculate the increase in cost:
\[ \text{Increase} = 120 \times \frac{60}{100} = 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the increased monthly cost is:
\[ \text{Increased Monthly Cost} = 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Now, to find out how much he pays in a year, we multiply the increased monthly cost by 12:
\[ \text{Annual Cost} = 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, James pays $2304 a year for insurance."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of laundry loads Greg does each week and then calculate the annual amount.

First, let's break down the weekly laundry:
- Greg has 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed.
- Each twin bed set requires 1 load of laundry.
- The king size bed requires 1 load of laundry.
- His laundry machine can handle 2 twin sets at a time and 1 king set at a time.

Since he needs to do 4 twin sets and 1 king set each week:
- For the twin sets, he needs 4 loads (since 2 twin sets per load).
- For the king set, he needs 1 load.

So, in one week, Greg does a total of 4 (twin sets) + 1 (king set) = 5 loads of laundry.

Now, to find out how many loads he does in a year:
- There are 52 weeks in a year.
- Therefore, the total number of loads in a year is 5 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 260 loads/year.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Movies watched on Saturday**: Jill and her friends watch 4 movies.
2. **Movies watched on Sunday**: They watch half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday. Therefore, they watch \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) movies on Sunday.
3. **Total movies watched in one weekend**: The total number of movies watched in one weekend (Saturday and Sunday) is \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) movies.
4. **Total movies watched in 4 weeks**: Since they watch movies every weekend, in 4 weeks they will have 4 weekends. Therefore, the total number of movies watched in 4 weeks is \( 6 \times 4 = 24 \).

The final numerical answer is 24."
"Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers. Last year, he collected 50 more stickers, so his collection increased to 100 + 50 = 150 stickers. This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which means he collected 50 * 2 = 100 stickers. Therefore, the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection now is 150 + 100 = 250 stickers.

The final numerical answer is 250."
"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we first need to calculate the total amount of cat food Imma's cats consume per day.

Imma has 3 cats, and each cat is fed 60 grams of cat food twice a day. Therefore, the total amount of cat food consumed per day is:

\[ 3 \text{ cats} \times 60 \text{ grams/cat} \times 2 \text{ feedings/day} = 360 \text{ grams/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last if 360 grams are consumed per day. We do this by dividing the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:

\[ \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams/day}} = 2 \text{ days} \]

So, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days."
"First, let's determine how many slices Jake ate. We know that Becky ate 10 slices and that she ate 3 more slices than Jake. Therefore, Jake ate:

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we know that Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake. Therefore, Silvia ate:

\[ 2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by adding the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:

\[ 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 \text{ slices} \]

So, the total number of slices they ate is:

\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time for both parts is 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part took \( D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \) minutes.

The final numerical answer is 58."
"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to add up the costs of the cast, the visit, the painkillers, and the parking.

1. The cost of the cast is $200.
2. The cost of the visit is $300/hour for 30 minutes. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the cost is $300 * 0.5 = $150.
3. The cost of the painkillers is $4/pill for 30 pills. So, the cost is $4 * 30 = $120.
4. The cost of parking is $6/hour for a minimum of 2 hours. So, the cost is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, we add these amounts together:
$200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482.

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"First, we need to determine how many emails James doesn't respond to in a day. Since 20% of the 80 emails don't require any response, we calculate 20% of 80:

\[ 20\% \times 80 = 0.20 \times 80 = 16 \]

So, James doesn't respond to 16 emails a day. This means he responds to the remaining emails:

\[ 80 - 16 = 64 \]

James responds to 64 emails each day. To find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of emails he responds to in a day by 5:

\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 320."
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to calculate the number of classes for each day and then sum them up.

- Wednesday: Three times as many as Monday, so \(3 \times 32 = 96\) classes
- Thursday: 30 classes
- Friday: 25 classes

Now, we sum these numbers:

\[ 32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 \]

Let's add these step by step:

\[ 32 + 64 = 96 \]
\[ 96 + 96 = 192 \]
\[ 192 + 30 = 222 \]
\[ 222 + 25 = 247 \]

So, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is 247."

"First, let's calculate how many pizzas the glee club ate. They ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them:

\[ \text{Pizzas eaten by glee club} = 20 \times \frac{70}{100} = 14 \]

So, the glee club has:

\[ \text{Pizzas left by glee club} = 20 - 14 = 6 \]

Next, let's calculate how many pizzas the football team ordered. They ordered twice as many as the glee club:

\[ \text{Pizzas ordered by football team} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

The football team ate 80% of their pizzas:

\[ \text{Pizzas eaten by football team} = 40 \times \frac{80}{100} = 32 \]

So, the football team has:

\[ \text{Pizzas left by football team} = 40 - 32 = 8 \]

Now, let's add the pizzas left from both groups:

\[ \text{Total pizzas left} = 6 + 8 = 14 \]

"First, let's determine the number of big coupons Anthony wants to send. Since he wants to send twice as many big coupons as small coupons, and he wants to send 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is:

\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost for the small coupons is:

\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for the big coupons is:

\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of mailing all the coupons, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the cost of mailing the big coupons:

\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:

So, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:

\[ \boxed{245} \]"
"First, let's determine how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney ordered. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which means she ordered \(10 - 3 = 7\) meatball sub sandwiches.

Next, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. So, the number of meatball sub sandwiches left after Mark ate is \(7 - 4 = 3\).

Then, Sidney ordered another three meatball sub sandwiches. So, the total number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney had after ordering the additional ones is \(3 + 3 = 6\).

Since each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is \(6 \times 4 = 24\).

"Initially, Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks, each carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. Therefore, the total amount of fertiliser dispatched was:

\[ 20 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 400 \text{ tons} \]

A quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures, which means:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks} \]

These 5 trucks could not deliver the fertiliser. Therefore, the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks} \]

The total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:

\[ 15 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 300 \text{ tons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the cost for Dennis to purchase the butter, we first need to calculate the total amount of butter he needs. Since he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants and he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need:

\[ 6 \text{ dozen croissants} \times 1 \text{ pound of butter per dozen} = 6 \text{ pounds of butter} \]

Next, we need to consider the promotion at the grocery store, which is ""buy one pound of butter get one half off."" This means for every 2 pounds of butter, Dennis only pays for 1 pound. Therefore, for 6 pounds of butter, he will pay for 3 pounds (since 6 pounds divided by 2 equals 3 pounds).

The cost of butter is $4.00 per pound. So, the cost for 3 pounds of butter will be:

\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pound} = \$12.00 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$12.00 \]"

"First, let's determine the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats:
\[ 10 + 4 = 14 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Together, the first and second monkeys eat:
\[ 10 + 14 = 24 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Mr. Robles has 315 bananas in total, which is enough to feed the monkeys for a week. Therefore, the total number of bananas eaten by the three monkeys in a day is:
\[ \frac{315}{7} = 45 \text{ bananas each day} \]

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we subtract the number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day:
\[ 45 - 24 = 21 \text{ bananas each day} \]

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day."

"First, let's calculate the cost of the roses Jenny bought. She bought 15 roses, and since roses cost $2 each, the total cost for the roses is:
\[ 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of the dozen roses. Since a dozen roses cost $15, and she bought 15 roses, she bought 1.25 dozen roses (since 15 roses is 1.25 dozen). However, since the florist only sells roses by the dozen, she would need to buy 2 dozen roses to get 15 roses. The cost for 2 dozen roses is:
\[ 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which totals:
\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the total cost of the roses is $30, she needs an additional $5 to pay for the roses. She doesn't have this $5, so she can't buy the roses with the money she has. However, the question asks how many quarters she would receive as change if she had enough money to buy the roses. Since she doesn't have the money, we assume she would receive no change.

Therefore, the number of quarters she would receive is:
\[ 0 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 0 \]"
"To calculate the total money Terry makes, we need to calculate the earnings from each item separately and then sum them up.

   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays in the station for 20 minutes.
   - Departure time: 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives half an hour after the first train leaves (30 minutes).
   - Stays in the station for a quarter of the first train's stay time (20 minutes / 4 = 5 minutes).
   - Departure time: 30 + 5 = 35 minutes.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives an hour after the second train leaves (35 minutes).
   - Leaves immediately after it arrives.
   - Departure time: 35 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves (35 minutes).
   - Departure time: 35 + 20 = 55 minutes.

Paul's train is the fourth train, which arrives at 55 minutes. Since Paul arrives at the station at the first train's arrival time (10 minutes), he will wait for his train from 10 minutes to 55 minutes.

The time Paul waits is:
\[ 55 - 10 = 45 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 45 \]"
"First, let's calculate how many toothpicks Melanie has saved so far. She has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks.

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie needs a total of 200 toothpicks. She has already saved 120 toothpicks. Therefore, she still needs:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks, we divide the number of toothpicks she needs by the number of toothpicks she saves each week:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks."
"First, let's calculate the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch. The watch was sold at 75% of its original price, so:

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers paid} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for:

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers sold it for} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

Now, to find the percentage discount Mr. Rogers's friend obtained from the original price, we need to calculate the discount amount and then express it as a percentage of the original price:

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

\[ \text{Percentage discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers's friend from the original price is 10%."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs over a period of 4 hours. Given that each spring creates one jellyfish every second, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. **Determine the number of jellyfish created by one spring in one hour:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are \(60 \times 60 = 3600\) seconds in an hour.
   - Since one spring creates one jellyfish every second, in one hour, one spring will create \(3600\) jellyfish.

2. **Determine the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates 3600 jellyfish in one hour, then in 4 hours, one spring will create \(3600 \times 4 = 14400\) jellyfish.

3. **Determine the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates 14400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create \(14400 \times 5 = 72000\) jellyfish in 4 hours.

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs working at the same rate in 4 hours is 72000."
"To find Frankie's score, we can use the information given in the question. According to the problem, Frankie's score is 15 more than twice Binkie's score. Binkie's score is given as 90.

First, we calculate twice Binkie's score:
\[ 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Next, we add 15 to this result to find Frankie's score:
\[ 180 + 15 = 195 \]

So, Frankie's score is 195.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 195 \]"
"First, let's determine the total distance James walked. The distance from his home to the store is 4 miles, so halfway is 2 miles. He had to walk back 2 miles to get back home, and then he had to walk the full 4 miles to the store again. Therefore, the total distance he walked is:

\[ 2 \text{ miles (halfway)} + 2 \text{ miles (back to home)} + 4 \text{ miles (to the store)} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

James walks at a rate of 4 miles per hour. To find the total time it took him to walk 8 miles, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Rate}} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually.

Jenny buys 10 bunches, and each bunch has 4 bananas. Therefore, the total number of bananas is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

The cost of buying 40 bananas individually at $0.80 each is:
\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches.

Jenny buys 10 bunches at $3.00 each, so the total cost is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

Now, we find the savings by subtracting the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually:
\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, Jenny saved:
\[ \$2.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$2.00 \]"
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) and the amount Harry gets as \( H \). According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so we can write:

\[ H = S + 60 \]

Since the total amount of fence is 100 feet, we also have:

\[ S + H = 100 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Subtract 60 from both sides:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"To determine how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to find the growth rate per year. The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, so the growth rate per year is:

\[ \text{Growth rate per year} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \]

Now, to find out how many inches it will grow in 13 years, we multiply the growth rate per year by 13:

\[ \text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 26 inches."
"First, let's determine the number of each type of bike sold:

- The number of Trekking bikes sold is half of the total bikes sold, which is \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \) bikes.
- The number of BMX bikes sold is 15% of the total bikes sold, which is \( 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \) bikes.
- The rest of the bikes sold are MTB bikes. Therefore, the number of MTB bikes sold is \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 65 \) bikes.

Next, we calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:

- The price of one MTB bike is $500, so the total earnings from MTB bikes is \( 65 \times 500 = 32500 \) dollars.
- The price of one BMX bike is half the price of an MTB bike, which is \( \frac{500}{2} = 250 \) dollars, so the total earnings from BMX bikes is \( 45 \times 250 = 11250 \) dollars.
- The price of one Trekking bike is $450, so the total earnings from Trekking bikes is \( 150 \times 450 = 67500 \) dollars.

Finally, we sum up the earnings from all types of bikes to find the total earnings for the month:

\[ 32500 + 11250 + 67500 = 111250 \]

So, Marcel earned $111,250 from selling bicycles during that month."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net number of bales of hay that are being added to and removed from the field each hour, and then multiply by the number of hours they work.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, and the truck picks up 3 bales per hour. So, the net number of bales added to the field each hour is:
\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \text{ bales per hour} \]

Since they work for 6 hours, the total number of bales added to the field is:
\[ 2 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ bales} \]

Therefore, the number of bales of hay left in the field after 6 hours is:
\[ 12 \text{ bales} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"To solve this, let's break down the time John spends on classes and learning each week.

1. **Number of periods John has to take each day:**
   - Normal student has 6 periods.
   - John has 2 extra classes, so he has \(6 + 2 = 8\) periods each day.

2. **Time spent in class each day:**
   - Each class is 40 minutes long.
   - With 8 periods each day, the total time spent in class each day is \(8 \times 40 = 320\) minutes.

3. **Time spent in class each week:**
   - John goes to class 5 days a week.
   - So, the total time spent in class each week is \(320 \times 5 = 1600\) minutes.

4. **Time spent on Saturday and Sunday:**
   - John spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday.
   - First, we need to find out how many minutes he spends on class each week.
   - Total minutes spent in class each week is 1600 minutes.
   - Therefore, the total weekly minutes (including class and extra learning time) is \(1600 + \text{extra learning time}\).
   - Since he spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday, the extra learning time is \(\frac{1600}{16} = 100\) minutes.
   - So, the total weekly minutes is \(1600 + 100 = 1700\) minutes.

5. **Time spent learning each week:**
   - The time spent learning each week is 100 minutes.

6. **Convert minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - So, the time spent learning each week in hours is \(\frac{100}{60} = \frac{5}{3}\) hours.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\(\frac{5}{3}\) hours"
"First, we need to determine the initial height from which the ball is dropped. Since the ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony and each story is 24 feet high, the height from the third-floor balcony is:

\[ 24 \text{ feet/story} \times 3 \text{ stories} = 72 \text{ feet} \]

The ball bounces to 2/3 of its starting height with each bounce. Therefore, on the first bounce, the ball will reach:

\[ 72 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

On the second bounce, the ball will again bounce to 2/3 of its height from the first bounce, so:

\[ 48 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the height the ball reaches on its second bounce is:

\[ 32 \text{ feet} \]"
"First, let's convert the height of the first child from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child who is 6 feet tall is:

\[ 6 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 72 \text{ inches} \]

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so:

\[ 72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches} \]

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so:

\[ 74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches} \]

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so:

\[ 69 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height of the fourth child is 72 inches."
"First, we need to determine how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we divide the total number of apples sold by the number of apples per bag:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total number of apples}}{\text{Number of apples per bag}} = \frac{2000}{10} = 200 \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags sold by the price per bag:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of bags} \times \text{Price per bag} = 200 \times 5 = 1000 \]

So, the orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag.

The final numerical answer is 1000."
"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

The T-Rex ate half of the meat, so the remaining meat was \( \frac{x}{2} \).

The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so they took \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.

The lazy Allosaurus then ate the remaining 270 kilograms, which means \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \).

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]
\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

So, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 kilograms.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to calculate the total area of the walls that Tony needs to paint. The north and south walls are each 10 feet by 8 feet, so the area of each is:

\[ 10 \times 8 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is:

\[ 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The east and west walls are each 5 feet by 8 feet, so the area of each is:

\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ square feet} \]

Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is:

\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Adding the areas of all four walls together gives the total area to be painted:

\[ 160 + 80 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:

\[ \frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost of the paint. Since each gallon costs $12, the total cost is:

\[ 12 \times 12 = 144 \]

So, the total cost to paint the room is:

\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda.

Initially, Ellen has:
- 3 shaken sodas
- 9 unshaken sodas

Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving:
- 3 shaken sodas
- 8 unshaken sodas

Her brother then takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving:
- 2 shaken sodas
- 6 unshaken sodas

Now, Ellen's friend comes along. There are 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas left. The total number of sodas left is 8.

The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left:
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \]

To express this probability as a percentage:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100\% = 25\% \]

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 25%."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours and then sum these distances since the trains are traveling in opposite directions.

The first train travels at 60 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will travel:
\[ 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \]

The second train travels at half the speed of the first train, which is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]
In 3 hours, it will travel:
\[ 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles} \]

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each train has traveled:
\[ 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this, we first need to calculate the total time Bobby spends on his lunches and breaks per day, and then multiply that by the number of days.

Bobby's daily break time is 30 minutes (lunch) + 2 * 15 minutes (breaks) = 30 + 30 = 60 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour.

So, Bobby spends 1 hour on his lunches and breaks each day.

Over 5 days, the total time spent on lunches and breaks is 1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours.

Thus, the total time Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to after 5 days is 5 hours."
"First, let's calculate how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's miles as follows:

\[ \text{Micah's miles} = 3.5 \times 8 \]

Now, let's calculate the total miles run by Amber and Micah:

\[ \text{Total miles by Amber and Micah} = 8 + (3.5 \times 8) \]

Finally, to find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the total miles run by Amber and Micah from the overall total miles:

\[ \text{Ahito's miles} = 52 - \text{Total miles by Amber and Micah} \]

Let's do the calculations:
\[ \text{Micah's miles} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \]
\[ \text{Total miles by Amber and Micah} = 8 + 28 = 36 \]
\[ \text{Ahito's miles} = 52 - 36 = 16 \]

So, Ahito ran 16 miles."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the items after the returns and purchases:

1. Sheila initially charged $85.00.
2. She returned an item that cost $15.00, so the charge is reduced by $15.00.
3. The new balance after the return is $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the items she bought:

1. The frying pan was on sale for 20% off $20.00. The discount is 20% of $20.00, which is $20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00. So, the frying pan cost $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.
2. The set of towels was 10% off $30.00. The discount is 10% of $30.00, which is $30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00. So, the set of towels cost $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

Now, let's add the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels to the new balance:

1. The new balance is $70.00.
2. Adding the frying pan ($16.00) and the set of towels ($27.00) to the new balance gives $70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00.

Therefore, the new balance on her credit card is $113.00."
"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{1}{5}J \).

A third of the large jellyfish change color under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{5}J = \frac{1}{15}J \).

We are told that when the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{1}{15}J = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 15:

\[ J = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ J = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

\[
\boxed{90}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Lauren saves each year, how much she plans to live on each year, and then calculate how many years she needs to work to save enough for her retirement.

1. **Calculate Lauren's annual savings:**
   - Lauren saves 20% of her annual salary.
   - Her current annual salary is $100,000.
   - Annual savings = 20% of $100,000 = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000.

2. **Calculate the amount Lauren plans to live on each year:**
   - Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary.
   - Annual living expenses = 40% of $100,000 = 0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000.

3. **Calculate the net amount Lauren needs to save each year:**
   - Net amount to save each year = Annual savings - Annual living expenses
   - Net amount to save each year = $20,000 - $40,000 = -$20,000.

Since Lauren's living expenses exceed her savings, she does not need to save any money for retirement. Therefore, she does not need to work any more years to save for retirement.

The final numerical answer is 0 years."
"To find out the length of each final cut, we need to follow these steps:

There are a total of 6 heels (3 of each height). The average height of the heels is:
\[ \frac{18}{6} = 3 \text{ inches} \]

So, the average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches."
"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days in June.
2. Determine the total number of miles Soledad plans to hike in June.
3. Calculate the number of miles Soledad plans to hike per day.
4. Determine the difference between the planned miles per day and the required miles per day.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days in June.**
June has 30 days.

**Step 2: Determine the total number of miles Soledad plans to hike in June.**
Soledad plans to hike 9,300 miles.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of miles Soledad plans to hike per day.**
Soledad plans to hike twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. Therefore, the total miles per day is:
\[ 125 \text{ miles/hike} \times 2 \text{ hikes/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

**Step 4: Determine the difference between the planned miles per day and the required miles per day.**
To complete the 9,300 miles in 30 days, Soledad needs to hike:
\[ \frac{9,300 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 310 \text{ miles/day} \]

The difference between the required miles per day and the planned miles per day is:
\[ 310 \text{ miles/day} - 250 \text{ miles/day} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

Soledad must hike 60 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 60 \]"
"To calculate the total amount the store will have received after selling all the balls, we need to multiply the number of each color of ball by its respective cost and then sum these amounts.

For the red balls:
3 red balls * $9 per red ball = $27

For the blue balls:
11 blue balls * $5 per blue ball = $55

For the green balls:
25 green balls * $3 per green ball = $75

Now, we add these amounts together:
$27 + $55 + $75 = $157

Therefore, the store will have received $157 after all the balls are sold."
"First, let's determine how many kilograms of apples each person wants:

"To find the number of students enrolled this year after a 20% increase, we first calculate 20% of last year's enrollment and then add that to last year's total.

20% of 50 students is calculated as:
\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

Adding this increase to last year's enrollment:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \]

So, the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class is 60."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the rate at which the lighthouse's light blinks. We know that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. Therefore, the rate of blinking is:

\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times. We can use the rate we just calculated to find the time required:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} \]

Now, let's perform the calculation:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459}{51} = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times."
"First, let's calculate the total number of male and female guppies and goldfishes Tate has after the purchase.

Initially, Tate has:
- 4 male guppies
- 7 female guppies
- 3 male goldfishes
- 5 female goldfishes

After buying more fish, Tate has:
- 4 (initial male guppies) + 2 (additional male guppies) = 6 male guppies
- 7 (initial female guppies) + 1 (additional female guppy) = 8 female guppies
- 3 (initial male goldfishes) + 2 (additional male goldfishes) = 5 male goldfishes
- 5 (initial female goldfishes) + 3 (additional female goldfishes) = 8 female goldfishes

Now, let's calculate the total number of male and female fishes:
- Total male fishes = 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfishes) = 11 male fishes
- Total female fishes = 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfishes) = 16 female fishes

Finally, to find out how many more female fishes than male fishes Tate has, we subtract the total number of male fishes from the total number of female fishes:
- Difference = 16 (female fishes) - 11 (male fishes) = 5

So, Tate has 5 more female fishes than male fishes."
"First, let's determine the time each person took to complete their chores:

- Amalia mowed the lawn, which took her 4 hours.
- Megan walked the dog, which took her 2 hours longer than Amalia. Therefore, Megan's chore took her \(4 + 2 = 6\) hours.
- Dior did the laundry, which took her well over 4 hours longer than Amalia. Since Amalia's chore took 4 hours, Dior's chore took her \(4 + 10 = 14\) hours (assuming ""well over 4 hours longer"" means more than 4 hours but not specified exactly, we can use 10 hours as a reasonable assumption).

Now, we sum up the time each person took to complete their chores:
- Amalia: 4 hours
- Megan: 6 hours
- Dior: 14 hours

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is:
\[ 4 + 6 + 14 = 24 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total distance John drives each month for his visits to his parents.

First, we calculate the distance for a one-way trip:
- Speed = 70 mph
- Time = 2 hours

Distance for one-way trip = Speed × Time
Distance for one-way trip = 70 mph × 2 hours = 140 miles

Since John makes a round trip, we need to double this distance:
Total distance for round trip = 140 miles × 2 = 280 miles

John visits his parents twice a month, so we need to multiply the round trip distance by the number of visits per month:
Total monthly distance = 280 miles × 2 = 560 miles

Therefore, the total number of miles John drives each month when visiting his parents is 560 miles."
"If Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day for 7 days, she will walk a total of 10 * 7 = 70 miles in 7 days.

Given that in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian, Brian will walk half the distance of what Sofie walks in 7 days. Therefore, Brian will walk 70 / 2 = 35 miles in 7 days.

The final numerical answer is 35."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers and then determine how many toys the fifth worker needs to produce per hour to meet the order requirements.

First, let's calculate the production rate of the first two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 6 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(6 \times 2 = 12\) toys per hour.

Next, let's calculate the production rate of the next two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 4 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(4 \times 2 = 8\) toys per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by all four workers in a 10-hour shift:
- The first two workers produce \(12 \times 10 = 120\) toys.
- The next two workers produce \(8 \times 10 = 80\) toys.
- Therefore, the total number of toys produced by all four workers in 10 hours is \(120 + 80 = 200\) toys.

The toy manufacturer received an order for 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, they still need 20 toys to ship the order. This means that the number of toys produced by the four workers is:
\[ 400 - 20 = 380 \text{ toys} \]

Since the four workers produced 200 toys in 10 hours, the fifth worker must have produced:
\[ 380 - 200 = 180 \text{ toys} \]

To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours in the shift:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys per hour} \]

Therefore, the fifth worker produces \(\boxed{18}\) toys per hour."
"First, let's determine the weight of Elijah's dogs based on the information given.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah's dog that is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog would weigh:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's dog that is half the weight of Kory's dog would weigh:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add the weights of Elijah's dogs to find the total weight of Elijah's dogs:
\[ 15 + 30 = 45 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we add the weight of Kory's dog to find the total weight of both dogs:
\[ 45 + 60 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of Elijah and Kory’s dogs altogether is:
\[ 105 \text{ pounds} \]"
"Let's denote the number of stickers Seth had initially as \( S \).

1. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
2. Luis used half of his stickers and gave the rest to Kris. Therefore, Luis gave \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers to Kris.
3. Kris received \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers and kept 9 of them. This means Kris received 9 more stickers than he kept, so \( \frac{S}{4} = 9 + 7 \). Simplifying, we get \( \frac{S}{4} = 16 \).
4. Solving for \( S \), we multiply both sides by 4: \( S = 16 \times 4 = 64 \).

Therefore, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning.

The final numerical answer is 64."
"First, we need to calculate the total weight of the M&Ms John has. He buys 3 large bags, each weighing 10 ounces. Therefore, the total weight is:

\[ 3 \text{ bags} \times 10 \text{ ounces per bag} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to determine how many M&Ms are in these 30 ounces. We know that 1 ounce of M&Ms contains 30 M&Ms. Therefore, the total number of M&Ms is:

\[ 30 \text{ ounces} \times 30 \text{ M&Ms per ounce} = 900 \text{ M&Ms} \]

Now, John wants to put 10 M&Ms in each small bag. To find out how many small bags he can make, we divide the total number of M&Ms by the number of M&Ms per small bag:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ M&Ms}}{10 \text{ M&Ms per small bag}} = 90 \text{ small bags} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find the speed of the faster car, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the speed of the 2nd fastest car.
2. Use the speed of the 2nd fastest car to find the speed of the faster car.

First, we know the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. Therefore, the speed of the 2nd fastest car is:
\[ 120 \times 5 = 600 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. Therefore, the speed of the faster car is:
\[ 600 \times 1.25 = 750 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the speed of the faster car is 750 miles per hour."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Liam's age two years ago:**
   - Liam is currently 16 years old.
   - Two years ago, Liam was \( 16 - 2 = 14 \) years old.

2. **Set up the relationship between Liam's and Vince's ages:**
   - Two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince.
   - Let \( V \) represent Vince's age two years ago.
   - According to the problem, \( 14 = 2V \).

3. **Solve for Vince's age two years ago:**
   - Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to find \( V \):
     \[
     V = \frac{14}{2} = 7
     \]
   - So, Vince was 7 years old two years ago.

4. **Determine Vince's current age:**

     \[
     7 + 2 = 9
     \]

Therefore, Vince is currently 9 years old."
"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline as \( A \). Since they painted the same number of eggs, the total painted by Arnold and Madeline is \( 2A \).

Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Sarah as \( S \). Therefore, the number of eggs painted by Camden is \( S + 12 \). The total painted by Camden and Sarah is given by:
\[ S + (S + 12) = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]
So, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

Now, we know the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. Therefore, the number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline together is:
\[ 2A = 56 - (9 + 21) = 56 - 30 = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]
So, Arnold painted 13 eggs, and Madeline also painted 13 eggs.

We need to find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ 21 - 13 = 8 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"First, we need to determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons. This can be calculated as:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups} \]

Each group of 8 crayons will be placed in a box, and each box weighs 8 ounces. Since there are 25 groups, there will be 25 boxes. The total weight of the boxes is:

\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, and there are 200 crayons, so the total weight of the crayons is:

\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together gives:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces} + 200 \text{ ounces} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

To convert the total weight from ounces to pounds, we use the conversion factor that 16 ounces equals 1 pound:

\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 25 \text{ pounds} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many 4-foot logs John can make from the 80-foot tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, the length of the logs he can make is:

\[ 80 \text{ feet} \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 4-foot logs he can cut from 64 feet of wood:

\[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

Now, we need to determine how many planks John can get from these 16 logs. Since he cuts 5 planks from each log:

\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

Finally, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling these planks. Since each plank is sold for $1.2:

\[ 80 \text{ planks} \times 1.2 \text{ dollars/plank} = 96 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 96 \]"
"First, let's find out how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns half of what her brother earns, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Valerie's salary} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

Given that Valerie earns $5000 per month, we can solve for her brother's salary:

\[ 5000 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

\[ \text{Brother's salary} = 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Now, we know Valerie's brother earns $10000 per month. Next, we need to find out how much their mother earns. Their mother earns twice their combined salary. First, we calculate their combined salary:

\[ \text{Combined salary} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} \]

\[ \text{Combined salary} = 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Their mother earns twice this amount:

\[ \text{Mother's salary} = 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \]

Now, to find the total amount of money they all have together, we add up their individual salaries:

\[ \text{Total amount} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} + \text{Mother's salary} \]

\[ \text{Total amount} = 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

So, the total amount of money they all have together is $45000."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk, and then sum these times to find the total time for the 3-mile walk.

First, let's denote the speed on the beach as \( v \) miles per minute. Since Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes, we can write:
\[ v = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} \]

On the sidewalk, Grandma walks at twice the speed, so her speed on the sidewalk is:
\[ 2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Next, we calculate the time spent on the sidewalk. Since the distance on the sidewalk is 1 mile and her speed is \(\frac{1}{10}\) miles per minute, the time spent on the sidewalk is:
\[ \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we sum the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk to find the total time for the 3-mile walk:
\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes (beach)} + 10 \text{ minutes (sidewalk)} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:
\[ 50 \text{ minutes} \]"
"Jane has already saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so she has saved:

\[ 4 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 8 \, \text{weeks} = 32 \, \text{dollars} \]

She needs to save a total of $60, so she still needs to save:

\[ 60 \, \text{dollars} - 32 \, \text{dollars} = 28 \, \text{dollars} \]

If she saves $4 each week, the number of additional weeks required to save the remaining $28 is:

\[ \frac{28 \, \text{dollars}}{4 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 7 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take her 7 more weeks to save a total of $60."
"To find the total number of blue birds, we can break down the problem into parts and then sum them up.

"First, let's determine how many marbles Bob currently has. If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen is equal to 24 marbles, we can set up the following equation to find out how many marbles Bob currently has:

\[ \text{Current marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

Subtracting 24 from both sides of the equation gives:

\[ \text{Current marbles} = 60 - 24 \]
\[ \text{Current marbles} = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles. If he loses 10 of the marbles he has, the number of marbles he will have is:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the second mug of water such that after Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle, the resulting water can be drunk (i.e., at least 40 degrees).

Let's denote the temperature of the second mug of water as \( T \) degrees.

1. Initially, the 33-degree mug has 4 ounces of water, and the second mug has \( x \) ounces of water.
2. After pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug, the remaining water in the 33-degree mug is \( 4 - 4 = 0 \) ounces, and the temperature of the remaining water is still 33 degrees.
3. After pouring 1 ounce from the second mug, the remaining water in the second mug is \( x - 1 \) ounces, and the temperature of the remaining water is \( \frac{T \cdot 1 + (x-1) \cdot 33}{x} = \frac{T + 33x - 33}{x} \) degrees.

The resulting mixture in Donny's water bottle will have a total of 5 ounces of water (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug). The temperature of this mixture should be at least 40 degrees. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{T + 33x - 33}{x} \geq 40
\]

To find the minimum temperature \( T \), we need to consider the worst-case scenario where \( x \) is maximized. However, since \( x \) can be any positive value, we can simplify the problem by assuming \( x \) is large enough to make the term \( 33x \) dominate. For simplicity, let's assume \( x \) is very large, so the term \( 33x - 33 \) will be approximately \( 33x \). Thus, the equation simplifies to:

\[
\frac{33x}{x} \geq 40
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
33 \geq 40
\]

This is not possible, so we need to consider the case where the remaining water in the second mug is not negligible. Let's solve the equation directly:

\[
T + 33x - 33 \geq 40x
\]

Rearranging terms, we get:

\[
T \geq 40x - 33x + 33
\]

\[
T \geq 7x + 33
\]

Since \( x \) can be any positive value, the minimum value of \( T \) occurs when \( x \) is minimized. However, since \( x \) can be any positive value, the minimum value of \( T \) that satisfies the condition for all possible \( x \) is when \( x \) is just large enough to make the term \( 33x \) significant. The minimum value of \( T \) that satisfies the condition for all \( x \) is when \( x \) is 1 ounce, so:

\[
T \geq 7 \cdot 1 + 33 = 40
\]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the second mug of water is 40 degrees.

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{40}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the number of days in three weeks:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cows and chickens added to the farm over these 21 days:
- Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day:
\[ 20 \text{ cows/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 420 \text{ cows} \]

- Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day:
\[ 10 \text{ chickens/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ chickens} \]

Now, we add the initial number of animals to the number of animals added over the 21 days:
- Initial number of cows: 50
- Initial number of chickens: 20
- Total cows after 21 days: \( 50 + 420 = 470 \)
- Total chickens after 21 days: \( 20 + 210 = 230 \)

Finally, we find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks:
\[ 470 \text{ cows} + 230 \text{ chickens} = 700 \text{ animals} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 700 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount:

Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs cost:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Since he gets a 10% discount for ordering 4 packs, the discount amount is:
\[ 40 \times 0.10 = 4 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \]

Now, let's find out the total number of bagels he gets:
\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times 9 \text{ bagels per pack} = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

To find the cost per bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels:
\[ \frac{36}{36} = 1 \]

So, the cost per bagel is $1.00.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. According to the question, Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, we calculate:

\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 1 less than 3 is 2 scoops, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. The question states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, 1 less than 3 scoops is 2 scoops, and 3 less than 6 potatoes is 3 potatoes. Therefore, 2 scoops of mashed potatoes require 3 potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes are required for 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 2 scoops require 3 potatoes, 18 scoops would require:

\[ \frac{18}{2} \times 3 = 9 \times 3 = 27 \]

So, Gomer ate 27 potatoes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 27 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days:
- Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days.
- Total eggs in the first 30 days = 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs.

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the next 30 days:
- Chester eats 5 eggs a day for 30 days.
- Total eggs in the next 30 days = 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.

Now, let's add the total number of eggs from both periods:
- Total eggs for 60 days = 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.

Finally, we need to convert the total number of eggs into dozens. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs:
- Total dozens of eggs = 240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens.

The final numerical answer is 20 dozens."
"First, let's determine the number of red jelly beans. Since there are twice as many red jelly beans as green jelly beans, and there are 17 green jelly beans, the number of red jelly beans is:

\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \]

Next, we know the total number of jelly beans is 60. We can find the number of blue jelly beans by subtracting the number of green and red jelly beans from the total number of jelly beans:

\[ 60 - (17 + 34) = 60 - 51 = 9 \]

So, the number of blue jelly beans is:

\[ 9 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of lemons collected from one tree in a year.
2. Determine the number of lemons collected from all trees in a year.
3. Determine the number of lemons collected in a decade (10 years).

Step 1: Tim collects 6 lemons from each tree each year.
Step 2: Tim has 5 trees, so the total number of lemons collected from all trees in a year is:
\[ 6 \text{ lemons/tree} \times 5 \text{ trees} = 30 \text{ lemons/year} \]

Step 3: To find out how many lemons he collects in a decade (10 years), we multiply the number of lemons collected in a year by 10:
\[ 30 \text{ lemons/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 300 \text{ lemons} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 300 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the initial number of men and women on the bus based on the given ratio and total number of passengers.

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, which means for every 5 men, there are 9 women. The total parts of the ratio are 5 + 9 = 14 parts.

Given that the total number of passengers is 84, we can find out how many passengers each part of the ratio represents:
\[ \text{Number of passengers per part} = \frac{84}{14} = 6 \]

Now, we can find the initial number of men and women:
- Number of men = 5 parts * 6 passengers per part = 30 men
- Number of women = 9 parts * 6 passengers per part = 54 women

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:
\[ \text{Remaining women} = 54 - 20 = 34 \]

So, the number of women remaining on the bus is 34."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of sunflowers sold per day and then calculate the total for 3 days.

First, let's find out how many bouquets Faraday sold per day. Since each bouquet costs $8 and he earned $56 from bouquets per day, we can calculate the number of bouquets sold per day as follows:
\[ \text{Number of bouquets sold per day} = \frac{\$56}{\$8} = 7 \text{ bouquets} \]

Next, we know that each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers. Therefore, the number of sunflowers sold per day is:
\[ \text{Number of sunflowers sold per day} = 7 \text{ bouquets} \times 12 \text{ sunflowers per bouquet} = 84 \text{ sunflowers} \]

Now, to find out how many sunflowers were sold in 3 days, we multiply the number of sunflowers sold per day by 3:
\[ \text{Number of sunflowers sold in 3 days} = 84 \text{ sunflowers per day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 252 \text{ sunflowers} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 252 \]"
"First, let's determine how many rocks Adam can buy with his $100. Each rock costs $5.

\[ \text{Number of rocks} = \frac{\$100}{\$5/\text{rock}} = 20 \text{ rocks} \]

Adam then sells 60% of his inventory. So, the number of rocks he sells is:

\[ \text{Number of rocks sold} = 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ rocks} \]

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling these rocks. Each rock is sold for $7.

\[ \text{Revenue} = 12 \text{ rocks} \times \$7/\text{rock} = \$84 \]

Adam initially invested $100. The loss is the difference between the initial investment and the revenue from selling the rocks.

\[ \text{Loss} = \$100 - \$84 = \$16 \]

So, Adam loses $16."
"To determine the total number of days Lauren will need to complete the project, we need to calculate the number of days required for each type of picture scene separately and then sum them up.

For the large-sized picture scenes:
Lauren can draw 5 large-sized scenes per day.
She needs to draw 45 large-sized scenes.
The number of days required for large-sized scenes is \( \frac{45}{5} = 9 \) days.

For the medium-sized picture scenes:
Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized scenes per day.
She needs to draw 36 medium-sized scenes.
The number of days required for medium-sized scenes is \( \frac{36}{6} = 6 \) days.

For the small-sized picture scenes:
Lauren can draw 7 small-sized scenes per day.
She needs to draw 49 small-sized scenes.
The number of days required for small-sized scenes is \( \frac{49}{7} = 7 \) days.

Now, we sum the days required for each type of scene:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability of both tickets being winners.

First, let's denote the probability of the first ticket being a winner as \( P(W_1) \). According to the problem, \( P(W_1) = 20\% = 0.20 \).

The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of the second ticket being a winner, \( P(W_2) \), is:
\[ P(W_2) = 3 \times P(W_1) = 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60 \]

Since the events are independent, the probability that both tickets are winners is the product of their individual probabilities:
\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = P(W_1) \times P(W_2) = 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

Thus, the probability that both tickets are winners is:
\[ \boxed{12\%} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine how many seashells Carlos collected:**
   - Jim collected 27 seashells.
   - Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos.
   - Therefore, Carlos collected \(27 - 5 = 22\) seashells.

2. **Determine how many seashells Carrey collected:**
   - Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey.
   - Therefore, Carrey collected \(22 / 2 = 11\) seashells.

3. **Calculate the total number of seashells collected:**
   - Carlos collected 22 seashells.
   - Jim collected 27 seashells.
   - Carrey collected 11 seashells.
   - Total seashells = \(22 + 27 + 11 = 60\) seashells.

4. **Divide the total seashells equally among the three people:**
   - Total seashells = 60.
   - Number of people = 3.
   - Each person gets \(60 / 3 = 20\) seashells.

Therefore, each person gets 20 seashells.

"To calculate the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to consider the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the number he eats on weekends.

Mason eats 4 carrots each weekday. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is:
\[ 4 \text{ carrots/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ carrots} \]

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he eats 5 carrots each day. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is:
\[ 5 \text{ carrots/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ carrots} \]

Adding the carrots eaten on weekdays and weekends gives us the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week:
\[ 20 \text{ carrots} + 10 \text{ carrots} = 30 \text{ carrots} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many more bottles of juices Hortex needs to produce to meet the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total daily energy demand for 2300 people.
2. Determine how many bottles are needed to meet this demand.
3. Subtract the current daily production from the required production to find out how many more bottles are needed.

First, calculate the total daily energy demand for 2300 people:
- Each person's daily energy demand is covered by 20% of a bottle.
- Therefore, 100% of a person's daily energy demand is covered by 5 bottles (since 100% / 20% = 5).

So, the total daily energy demand for 2300 people is:
\[ 2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, determine how many more bottles are needed:
- Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day.
- To meet the demand of 11500 bottles, they need to produce:
\[ 11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, the number of additional bottles Hortex needs to produce is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of babies dressed in purple and blue, and then calculate the probability based on the given conditions.

First, let's find the number of babies dressed in purple and blue:
- Total babies = 8
- Babies dressed in purple = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- Babies dressed in blue = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we calculate the number of babies who wear bows:
- Babies wearing bows among the blue-wearers = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 2 = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.6667 \) (rounding to the nearest whole number, 1 baby)
- Babies wearing bows among the purple-wearers = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is \( 1 + 2 = 3 \).

Now, we need to find the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. This is given by the ratio of the number of purple-wearers wearing bows to the total number of babies wearing bows:
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of purple-wearers wearing bows}}{\text{Total number of babies wearing bows}} = \frac{2}{3} \]

To convert this probability to a percentage:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 100\% = 66.67\% \]

Therefore, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is \( 66.67\% \).

\[
\boxed{66.67\%}

"To find out how many reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and on Thursday and Friday, from the total number of reports received last week.

Total reports received last week = 5168
Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

Reports received on Wednesday = Total reports - (Reports on Monday and Tuesday + Reports on Thursday and Friday)

Let's calculate it:

Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - (1907 + 2136)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043
Reports received on Wednesday = 1125

So, the number of reports received on Wednesday is 1125."
"First, let's determine how much land Abraham sold in each transaction.

1. Abraham initially owned 80 square meters of land.
2. He sold half of his land for $50. Half of 80 square meters is 40 square meters. So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.
3. After a month, he sold another 1/4 of his land. A quarter of 80 square meters is 20 square meters. So, he sold 20 square meters for $30.
4. The remaining land is the total land minus the land sold in the first and second transactions. The land sold in the first transaction was 40 square meters, and in the second transaction, it was 20 square meters. So, the total land sold is 40 + 20 = 60 square meters. Therefore, the remaining land is 80 - 60 = 20 square meters. He sold this remaining land for $3 per square meter.

Now, let's calculate the total money Abraham earned from each transaction:

- From the first transaction: $50
- From the second transaction: $30
- From the remaining land: 20 square meters * $3/square meter = $60

Adding these amounts together gives the total money Abraham earned:

$50 + $30 + $60 = $140

"First, let's determine the total number of eggs Cole hid in the yard. Since a dozen equals 12, 3 dozen eggs equal 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Next, we'll calculate how many eggs each person found:
- Lamar found 5 eggs.
- Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy found 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.
- Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie found 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
- Mei found half as many as Charlie, so Mei found 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's sum up the total number of eggs found by all four individuals:
- Eggs found by Lamar: 5
- Eggs found by Stacy: 10
- Eggs found by Charlie: 8
- Eggs found by Mei: 4

Total eggs found = 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

"Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters, the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters, and the red rope as \( R \) centimeters.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, substitute \( B \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ R = 4(Y - 7) \]

Now substitute \( B \) and \( R \) into the third equation:
\[ 4(Y - 7) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]

Add 35 to both sides:
\[ 6Y = 72 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now, find \( B \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \]

"Let's denote the amount of money given to Rissa as \( R_r \) and the amount given to Ronnie as \( R_n \). According to the problem, Rissa was given three times as much as Ronnie, so we have:

\[ R_r = 3 \times R_n \]

Ronnie was given $5, so:

\[ R_n = 5 \]

Therefore, Rissa was given:

\[ R_r = 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Let's denote the amount of money each of them gave to their sister as \( x \). After giving \( x \) dollars to their sister, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her money. So, we can write:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4 \times 15}{5} = \frac{60}{5} = 12 \]

From this, we can solve for \( x \):

\[ 15 - x = 12 \]
\[ x = 15 - 12 = 3 \]

So, each of them gave $3 to their sister. Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left. Initially, Ronnie had $5, and he gave $3 to his sister:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Total Paint Used**: The mural uses 12 pints of paint in all.

2. **Equal Amounts of Red, White, and Purple Paint**: Let's denote the amount of red paint as \( R \). Since the amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal, the amount of white paint is also \( R \) and the amount of purple paint is also \( R \).

3. **Yellow Paint**: Half the mural is yellow, which means the yellow paint is \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) pints.

4. **Total Paint Calculation**: The total amount of paint used is the sum of the red, white, purple, and yellow paints. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   R + R + R + 6 = 12

"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. The area of one bedroom is given by the product of its length and width:

\[ \text{Area of one bedroom} = 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

\[ \text{Total area of bedrooms} = 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so:

\[ \text{Area of the living room} = 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

\[ \text{Total area of the house} = 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

So, the total area of the house is:

20% of 100 pods is \(100 \times 0.20 = 20\) pods.

So, the special size box has \(100 + 20 = 120\) pods.

The cost of the special size box is the same as the regular box, which is $12. We need to find out how many cycles we can run with $1 if we use 1 pod per cycle.

The cost per pod is \(\frac{12}{100} = 0.12\) dollars per pod.

For $1, the number of pods we can buy is \(\frac{1}{0.12} = \frac{100}{12} = \frac{25}{3} \approx 8.33\) pods.

Since we can only run full cycles with whole pods, we can run 8 cycles with $1.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 8."
"First, we determine the number of 20 dollar bills Thomas initially withdraws from the bank. Since he withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \]

So, Thomas initially has 50 twenty-dollar bills.

Next, he loses 10 bills while getting home. The number of remaining bills is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Thomas then uses half of the remaining 40 bills to pay for a bill. The number of bills used is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, the number of bills left is:

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \]

Thomas then triples the remaining 20 bills. The total amount of money he has now is:

\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \]

Thomas then converts all his money to 5 dollar bills. The number of 5 dollar bills he has is:

\[ \frac{400}{5} = 80 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 80 \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

- In the first half, team A scores 4 goals.
- Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals in the first half.
- In the second half, team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half.
- Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals in the second half.
- Therefore, team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals in the second half.

Now, let's calculate the total goals scored by each team:

- Team A scores \(4 + 2 = 6\) goals in the match.
- Team B scores \(2 + 8 = 10\) goals in the match.

Finally, the total number of goals scored in the match is the sum of the goals scored by both teams:

\[6 + 10 = 16\]

The final numerical answer is 16."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chalk the teacher has left and then calculate how many days he can continue using only 20% of the chalk each day before he has to recycle it.

1. **Determine the amount of chalk used on Monday:**
   - The teacher used 45% of the chalk by the end of Monday.
   - The chalk used is 45% of 5 inches, which is \(0.45 \times 5 = 2.25\) inches.

2. **Determine the amount of chalk remaining after Monday:**
   - The chalk remaining is \(5 - 2.25 = 2.75\) inches.

3. **Determine how much chalk the teacher will use each day if he uses only 20% of the chalk:**
   - If the teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, he will use \(0.20 \times 2.75 = 0.55\) inches of chalk each day.

4. **Calculate how many days the teacher can continue using the chalk before he has to recycle it:**
   - The teacher can continue using the chalk for \( \frac{2.75}{0.55} \) days.
   - This calculation is \( \frac{2.75}{0.55} = 5 \) days.

So, the teacher has 5 days before he has to recycle this piece of chalk.

"First, let's determine the number of girls on varsity. Since one-third of the girls are on varsity, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of girls on varsity} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
\]

Next, let's determine the number of boys on varsity. Since one-fourth of the boys are on varsity, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of boys on varsity} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3
\]

Now, we can find the total number of students on varsity by adding the number of girls and boys on varsity:

\[
\text{Total number of students on varsity} = 4 + 3 = 7
\]

To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students in the class. The total number of students in the class is:

\[
\text{Total number of students} = 12 \text{ boys} + 12 \text{ girls} = 24
\]

Therefore, the number of students not on varsity is:

\[
\text{Number of students not on varsity} = 24 - 7 = 17

"First, let's determine how many face masks Mike bought. According to the problem, Mike bought 5 face masks.

Next, we need to calculate how many face masks Johnny bought. The problem states that Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike. We can express this mathematically as:

\[ \text{Number of masks Johnny bought} = 3 \times (\text{Number of masks Mike bought}) + 2 \]

Substituting the number of masks Mike bought (5):

\[ \text{Number of masks Johnny bought} = 3 \times 5 + 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of masks Johnny bought} = 15 + 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of masks Johnny bought} = 17 \]

So, Johnny bought 17 face masks.

"First, let's determine the total number of teeth James's dentist fixes. We know that the dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills. Therefore, the number of teeth capped is:

\[ 4 + 7 = 11 \]

So, the total number of teeth fixed by the dentist is:

\[ 4 + 11 = 15 \]

Now, to find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the milk Mr. Marcellus initially purchased. The cost per gallon is $3.5 and he bought 4000 gallons.

\[
\text{Total cost} = 4000 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5/\text{gallon} = \$14000
\]

Next, we need to determine how much milk had passed the expiry date. Mr. Marcellus returned 2/5 of the milk.

\[
\text{Milk returned} = \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \text{ gallons} = 1600 \text{ gallons}
\]

The refund amount is calculated by multiplying the number of gallons returned by the cost per gallon.

\[
\text{Refund amount} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5/\text{gallon} = \$5600
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

We now have two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, we substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5(C + 7)) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5(C + 7)}{3} \]

Next, we eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Now, we solve for \( C \) by isolating it on one side of the equation:
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"First, we need to determine how many books Bob can buy with the total amount of $27,000. We know that he can buy 100 books for $500. Therefore, the cost per book is:

\[ \text{Cost per book} = \frac{500}{100} = 5 \text{ dollars per book} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27,000:

\[ \text{Total number of books} = \frac{27000}{5} = 5400 \text{ books} \]

Since Bob is distributing the money between 3 schools, we need to find out how many books he can distribute to each school:

\[ \text{Books per school} = \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \text{ books per school} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1800 \]"
"Let's break down the sequence of events and calculate the number of apples Newton brought home:

1. Initially, 2 apples fell out of the tree.
2. One of these apples landed on Newton's head, so he now has 1 apple.
3. Newton picked up the 2 apples that fell, put one in his pocket, and threw the other into the tree. This caused 5 more apples to fall out of the tree.
4. Now, Newton has 1 (from his head) + 5 (newly fallen) = 6 apples.
5. He picked up these 6 apples, put all but one in his pocket, and threw the remaining one at the tree. This caused 6 more apples to fall out of the tree.
6. Now, Newton has 1 (from his pocket) + 6 (newly fallen) = 7 apples.

Therefore, Newton brought home 7 apples.

"First, we need to calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed by Kate's friends. Since each of the 6 friends eats 6 slices of cheese pizza, the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed is:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed by Kate's friends. Since each of the 6 friends eats 4 slices of pepperoni pizza, the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed is:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we need to determine how many whole cheese pizzas Kate needs to buy. Since each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, the number of cheese pizzas needed is:
\[ \lceil \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} \rceil = \lceil 3 \rceil = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Next, we determine how many whole pepperoni pizzas Kate needs to buy. Since each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, the number of pepperoni pizzas needed is:
\[ \lceil \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} \rceil = \lceil 3 \rceil = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas. The total number of pizzas she needs to buy is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many snowballs Jay can effectively make in an hour, accounting for the ones that melt.

Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Therefore, in 15 minutes, 2 snowballs melt, leaving him with 18 snowballs.

To find out how many snowballs he makes in 15 minutes, we subtract the melted ones from the ones he builds:
\[ 20 \text{ (built)} - 2 \text{ (melted)} = 18 \text{ (effective)} \]

Now, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are required to reach 60 snowballs. We can do this by dividing the target number of snowballs by the number of effective snowballs made in 15 minutes:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ (target)}}{18 \text{ (effective per 15 minutes)}} = \frac{60}{18} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \]

Since Jay can't work for a fraction of a 15-minute interval, we round up to the next whole number, which is 4 intervals. Each interval is 15 minutes, so 4 intervals will be:
\[ 4 \times 15 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to determine how many snowballs Jay will have after 60 minutes. Since he makes 18 effective snowballs every 15 minutes, in 60 minutes (which is 4 intervals), he will have:
\[ 4 \times 18 = 72 \text{ snowballs} \]

Therefore, it will take Jay 60 minutes to have at least 60 snowballs, but he will have 72 snowballs by then.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} \]"
"If John is currently 28 years old and he is twice as old as Jim when the Digimon series came out, we can determine Jim's age at that time by dividing John's age by 2. 

So, Jim's age at that time was \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \) years old.

Since the question asks for Jim's current age, and no information is given about the passage of time since the series came out, we can only conclude that Jim was 14 years old when the series came out. Without additional information about how much time has passed since then, we cannot determine Jim's current age. 

However, if we are to provide the age Jim was at the time the series came out, the answer is 14 years old."
"First, let's determine how many slices each person ate:

- Doxa ate 1 slice.
- Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so her sister ate \(1 + 1 = 2\) slices.
- Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so her brother ate \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices.

Now, let's add up the slices they all ate:

- Doxa: 1 slice
- Sister: 2 slices
- Brother: 3 slices

Total slices eaten = \(1 + 2 + 3 = 6\)

"Let's break down the problem day by day to find out how many bandages were used and how many were left at the end of each day.

**First Day:**
- They used 38 bandages.
- They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
- Total bandages at the end of the first day: \(38 - 38 + 50 = 50\).

**Second Day:**
- They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
- Total bandages at the end of the second day: \(50 - 28 = 22\).

**Third Day:**
- They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered \(2 \times 50 = 100\) bandages.
- They used half a pack, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.
- Total bandages at the end of the third day: \(22 - 25 + 100 = 97\).

According to the problem, they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means there was a discrepancy in the calculation. Let's correct it:

- They used 25 bandages on the third day, so the correct calculation should be: \(22 - 25 + 100 = 97\), but since they ended up with 78, it means they actually used 19 bandages on the third day (since \(100 - 19 = 81\) and \(81 - 22 = 59\), and \(59 - 78 = -19\), which means they used 19 bandages).

So, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is 50.

"First, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut. May's hair length decreased from 10 inches to 8 inches, which means she got a haircut of 10 - 8 = 2 inches. The cost for the haircut is $30 per inch, so the cost for the haircut is 2 * $30 = $60. 

Next, we add the cost of the hair color, which is $40. Therefore, the total cost for the haircut and color is $60 + $40 = $100.

The final numerical answer is $100."
"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to consider her regular pay and the additional attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her regular pay:
- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- She works 6 days a week.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

So, her daily pay is \(7.5 \times 1.5 = 11.25\) dollars.
Her weekly pay is \(11.25 \times 6 = 67.5\) dollars.

Since there are exactly 4 weeks in April, her total pay for April is \(67.5 \times 4 = 270\) dollars.

Additionally, since she had complete attendance for the month, she receives an extra $10 for each week, which amounts to \(10 \times 4 = 40\) dollars.

Therefore, her total earnings for April are \(270 + 40 = 310\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:

"Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, which means she bought 5 * 5 = 25 red pens. She bought twice the amount of black pens, which means she bought 5 * 2 = 10 packs of black pens. Therefore, she bought 10 * 5 = 50 black pens. In total, Alain has 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens. 

The final numerical answer is 75."
"First, let's find out the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600, so the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \]

Next, we need to find the cost per bottle of cognac. The cognac costs 50% more per bottle than the scotch, so:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 \times 1.5 = 90 \]

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

The total cost for the cognac is:

\[ \text{Total cost of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \]

Now, we can find the total amount John spends on everything by adding the cost of the scotch and the cost of the cognac:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Day Planting:**
   - Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
   - He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which means he planted \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

2. **Second Day Planting:**
   - On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day, so he planted \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
   - He planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day. The number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the first day was 40, so \(\frac{1}{4}\) more than 40 is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10\). Therefore, he planted \(40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

3. **Total Trees Planted:**
   - Total White Oak trees planted: \(20 + 30 = 50\)
   - Total Lodgepole Pine trees planted: \(40 + 50 = 90\)
   - Total trees planted: \(50 + 90 = 140\)

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 140."
"To find out how much root beer was available for each person to drink during the party, we need to calculate the total amount of root beer remaining after all the consumption and spillage.

Starting with 24 gallons:
- On the first day, 4 gallons were drunk by Fred's children, so we subtract 4 gallons: \(24 - 4 = 20\) gallons.
- On the second day, 7 gallons were accidentally spilled by Barbie, so we subtract 7 gallons: \(20 - 7 = 13\) gallons.
- On the third day, 5 gallons were taken by Ronnie, so we subtract 5 gallons: \(13 - 5 = 8\) gallons.

On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party, and the remaining 8 gallons were shared equally among them. Therefore, each person would get:
\[ \frac{8}{3} \text{ gallons} \]

To provide the final numerical answer:

"First, let's calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had:

- Two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors
- Three makeup sets with six colors each: \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors

So, the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had is \(8 + 18 = 26\) colors.

Her sister steals one of the palettes, so Amy loses 4 colors:
\[26 - 4 = 22\] colors.

Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which means she uses up 3 colors (since half of 6 is 3):

Therefore, the final number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is 19."
"First, let's determine the height of Mattison's house. Since Mattison is 60 inches tall and his house is 7 times as high as he is, the height of the house is:

\[ 60 \times 7 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to find the height of the first floor. The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison is, so:

\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Since the house is two stories tall, the height of the second floor is the total height of the house minus the height of the first floor:

\[ 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height of the roof from the floor of the second floor is the height of the second floor, which is:

\[ \text{Shells found by Alphas} = 700 \times \frac{40}{100} = 280 \]

Next, we calculate the remaining shells after team Alphas found theirs.

\[ \text{Remaining shells} = 700 - 280 = 420 \]

Team The finders then found 60% of the remaining 420 shells.

\[ \text{Shells found by The finders} = 420 \times \frac{60}{100} = 252 \]

Finally, to find out how many shells team Gogetters found, we subtract the shells found by Alphas and The finders from the total number of shells.

\[ \text{Loan Amount} = 250,000 \times \frac{40}{100} = 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much John uses to pay off his debts. He uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts.

\[ \text{Amount Used to Pay Off Debts} = 100,000 \times \frac{60}{100} = 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

To find out how much money John has leftover after paying off his debts, we subtract the amount used to pay off his debts from the loan amount.

\[ \text{Money Leftover} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 40,000 \]"
"First, we need to find the total weight of the tunas Deandre caught. The weights of the tunas are 56 kg, 46 kg, and 26 kg. We add these weights together:

\[ 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 \text{ kg} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total earnings from selling the tunas. Since each kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we multiply the total weight by the price per kilogram:

\[ 128 \text{ kg} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/kg} = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 64 \]"
"First, we need to calculate the selling price of the magazines. Trinity sells the magazines at 11/8 of the price she bought them. The price she bought the magazines at is $72.

To find the selling price, we calculate:
\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8} \]

Let's perform the multiplication:
\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times 1.375 = 99 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the cost price from the selling price:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price} \]
\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 = 27 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 27 \]"
"To find the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed per setting and then sum these amounts.

1. **Low setting:**
   - Removes 1 liter of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed at low setting = 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters.

2. **Medium setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the low setting.
   - Therefore, it removes 2 liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed at medium setting = 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters.

3. **High setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting.
   - Therefore, it removes 4 liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 5 days.
   - Total water removed at high setting = 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters.

Now, we sum the water removed at each setting to find the total amount of water removed:

- Total water removed = Water removed at low setting + Water removed at medium setting + Water removed at high setting
- Total water removed = 3 liters + 6 liters + 20 liters = 29 liters.

The total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in his basement is 29 liters."

"First, we need to determine the capacity of Ali's class, which is given as 120 students.

Next, we calculate the capacity of John's classes. Since each of John's classes has \( \frac{1}{8} \) the capacity of Ali's class, we can find the capacity of one of John's classes by dividing the capacity of Ali's class by 8:
\[ \text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{120}{8} = 15 \text{ students} \]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of John's classes is:
\[ \text{Total capacity of John's classes} = 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ students} \]

Now, we add the capacity of Ali's class to the total capacity of John's classes to find the combined capacity of both schools:
\[ \text{Combined capacity} = 120 + 30 = 150 \]

The combined capacity of both schools is:
\[ 150 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen promised to return to his sister. He borrowed $300 and promised to return it with an additional 2% interest. 

The interest amount is calculated as:
\[ \text{Interest} = 300 \times \frac{2}{100} = 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen promised to return is:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Stephen will pay over the 11 months. He will pay $25 per month for 11 months:
\[ \text{Total Payment for 11 months} = 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

The remaining amount, which includes the interest, will be paid in the twelfth month. This remaining amount is the total amount Stephen promised to return minus the amount he will have paid in the first 11 months:
\[ \text{Remaining Amount} = 306 - 275 = 31 \]

Therefore, Stephen will pay \(\boxed{31}\) in the twelfth month."
"To determine how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of diaper changes per day for both children.
2. Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, the total number of diaper changes per day for both children is:
   \[
   5 \text{ changes/child} \times 2 \text{ children} = 10 \text{ changes/day}
   \]
3. Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers. Therefore, the number of diapers changed by Jordan's wife per day is:
   \[
   \frac{10 \text{ changes/day}}{2} = 5 \text{ changes/day}
   \]
4. Consequently, the number of diapers changed by Jordan per day is the remaining half:
   \[
   5 \text{ changes/day}
   \]

So, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the volume of the jar, the number of jelly beans that fit in the jar based on the packing efficiency, and then estimate the number of red jelly beans.

1. **Volume of the jar**: The jar is a cube with a side length of 6 inches.
   \[
   \text{Volume} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Number of jelly beans that fit in the jar**: Given the efficiency of packing is 80%, we need to find the volume occupied by the jelly beans.
   \[
   \text{Volume occupied by jelly beans} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]
   Given that each jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches,

"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly made as \( C \) and the number of brownies as \( B \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, which can be written as:
\[ B = 3C - 2 \]

Carly's class has 5 people, and each person gets 2 treats. Therefore, the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

The total number of treats is the sum of the cupcakes and brownies:
\[ C + B = 10 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]

Adding 2 to both sides:
\[ 4C = 12 \]

Dividing both sides by 4:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure before the discount:

Cost of manicure = $35
Cost of pedicure = $40

Total cost before discount = Cost of manicure + Cost of pedicure
Total cost before discount = $35 + $40 = $75

Now, we apply the 20% discount for getting both services:

Discount amount = 20% of $75
Discount amount = 0.20 * $75 = $15

Total cost after discount = Total cost before discount - Discount amount
Total cost after discount = $75 - $15 = $60

Next, we calculate the cost of nail art. Karen has 10 fingers (2 fingers per hand), and each nail art costs $3:

Cost of nail art = 10 fingers * $3 per finger
Cost of nail art = $30

Finally, we add the cost of nail art to the total cost after the discount:

Total cost = Total cost after discount + Cost of nail art
Total cost = $60 + $30 = $90

So, Karen would pay $90 in all."

"To find the final price of the toy after the changes in price, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price of the toy in December after an 80% increase.
2. Calculate the price of the toy in January after a 50% decrease from the December price.

**Step 1: Calculate the price in December.**

The price in November was $40. An 80% increase means the price increased by 80% of $40.

\[ \text{Increase in December} = 40 \times \frac{80}{100} = 40 \times 0.8 = 32 \]

So, the price in December is:

\[ \text{Price in December} = 40 + 32 = 72 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the price in January.**

The price in December was $72. A 50% decrease means the price decreased by 50% of $72.

\[ \text{Decrease in January} = 72 \times \frac{50}{100} = 72 \times 0.5 = 36 \]

So, the price in January is:

\[ \text{Price in January} = 72 - 36 = 36 \]

The final numerical answer is 36."
"First, let's calculate the standard fee for a lesson:
\[ \text{Standard fee} = \$80 \]

Next, we calculate the reduced fee for a lesson to a veteran, which is 25% off the standard fee:
\[ \text{Reduced fee} = \$80 - (0.25 \times \$80) = \$80 - \$20 = \$60 \]

Now, we calculate the total earnings from the 4 lessons at the standard rate:
\[ \text{Earnings from standard lessons} = 4 \times \$80 = \$320 \]

Then, we calculate the total earnings from the 2 lessons to veterans:
\[ \text{Earnings from veteran lessons} = 2 \times \$60 = \$120 \]

Finally, we add the earnings from both types of lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day:

"To find the percentage of the distance Michael has covered, we first need to calculate the total distance he travels in 3 days.

Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr. There are 24 hours in a day, so in 3 days, the total number of hours is:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 72 \text{ hours} \]

The total distance he travels in 72 hours at 50 km/hr is:
\[ 50 \text{ km/hr} \times 72 \text{ hours} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

The distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. To find the percentage of the total distance that Michael has covered, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{\text{Distance covered}}{\text{Total distance}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 0.6 \times 100 = 60\% \]

"First, let's calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms. Since it takes 15 minutes per classroom, the total time required is:
\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert the total time into hours to match the workday format. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total time in hours is:
\[ 1200 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

The custodian works 8 hours per day. To find out how many days it will take to complete the cleaning, we divide the total hours required by the hours worked per day:
\[ 20 \text{ hours} \div 8 \text{ hours/day} = 2.5 \text{ days} \]

Since the custodian has 5 days to complete the cleaning, they will have 2.5 days to clean all classrooms, which is within the given timeframe.

Now, to find out what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning classrooms, we need to calculate the total time spent cleaning per day and then find the percentage of that time relative to the 8-hour workday.

Since the total time required is 20 hours and they have 5 days to complete it, the average time spent cleaning per day is:
\[ 20 \text{ hours} \div 5 \text{ days} = 4 \text{ hours/day} \]

To find the percentage of the day spent cleaning, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent cleaning per day}}{\text{Total hours in a workday}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{4 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning classrooms is:
\[ 50\% \]"

- Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase:

- The total capacity of one bookcase is the sum of the capacities of all the shelves: \(10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books.

Given that Elly has 110 books, we need to determine how many bookcases are required to hold all 110 books:

- The number of bookcases needed is the total number of books divided by the capacity of one bookcase: \(110 \div 55 = 2\).

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs Rose bought. Since she bought five dozens of eggs and each dozen costs $2.40, the total cost is:

\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12.00 \]

Next, let's determine the total number of eggs Rose bought. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, let's calculate how much Rose will earn by selling the eggs. She sells the eggs at the rate of $1 for 3 eggs. Therefore, the total earnings from selling 60 eggs can be calculated as follows:

\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ sets of 3 eggs} \]

Since each set of 3 eggs is sold for $1, the total earnings are:

\[ 20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find Rose's profit, we subtract the total cost from the total earnings:

\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \]

So, Rose's profit is:

\[ 8 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Hats**: Skyler has 100 hats.

2. **Red Hats**: Half of the hats are red.
   \[
   \text{Red Hats} = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50
   \]

3. **Remaining Hats After Red**: After removing the red hats, we have:
   \[
   \text{Remaining Hats} = 100 - 50 = 50
   \]

4. **Blue Hats**: 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue.
   \[
   \text{Blue Hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]

5. **White Hats**: The rest of the hats are white. To find the number of white hats, we subtract the number of red and blue hats from the total number of hats.
   \[
   \text{White Hats} = 100 - (\text{Red Hats} + \text{Blue Hats}) = 100 - (50 + 30) = 20
   \]

So, the number of white hats Skyler has is 20."
"First, let's determine the cost of the beef jerky bag after the discount. The original price of the bag is $18.00, and there is a $3.00 discount. So, the price Archie will pay is:

\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many sticks of beef jerky are in the bag. Since there are 30 sticks per bag, we can calculate the cost per stick by dividing the total cost by the number of sticks:

\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

The cost per stick is $0.50, which is equivalent to 50 cents. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 50 \]"
"First, let's calculate how many questions Audrey got correct on the first test. The first test has 70 questions and she got 60% of them correct.

\[ \text{Correct answers on the first test} = 70 \times \frac{60}{100} = 70 \times 0.6 = 42 \]

To move on to 7th grade, Audrey needs to correctly answer 70% of the total questions. The total number of questions in both tests is:

\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]

So, she needs to correctly answer 70% of 110 questions to move on to 7th grade.

\[ \text{Total correct answers needed} = 110 \times \frac{70}{100} = 110 \times 0.7 = 77 \]

Audrey has already answered 42 questions correctly on the first test. Therefore, the number of questions she needs to answer correctly on the second test is:

\[ \text{Correct answers needed on the second test} = 77 - 42 = 35 \]

So, Audrey needs to get 35 questions correct on the second test to move onto 7th grade.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is given by the equation:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

The total number of ice cubes is the sum of strawberry and blueberry cubes:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:
\[ S = 20 \]

Now, substituting \( S = 20 \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is:

"Brendan initially had 10 marbles. When he dropped half of them, he dropped 10 / 2 = 5 marbles. This means he had 10 - 5 = 5 marbles left. After searching, he found 3 marbles, so he had 5 + 3 = 8 marbles. Since one of the marbles he found was actually a bead, he got rid of that one, leaving him with 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

The final numerical answer is 7."
"To determine how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we can break down the problem into the steps based on the given averages.

1. **Cars Sold from Phone Calls:**
   - For every 25 telephone calls, Jason gets 1 customer.
   - To find out how many customers he needs to get to sell 15 cars, we use the ratio:
     \[
     \text{Customers needed} = \frac{15 \text{ cars}}{1 \text{ customer}} = 15 \text{ customers}
     \]
   - Since he gets 1 customer for every 25 calls, the number of telephone calls needed is:
     \[
     \text{Telephone calls needed} = 15 \text{ customers} \times 25 \text{ calls/customer} = 375 \text{ calls}
     \]

2. **Customers to Car Sales:**
   - For every 2 customers, 1 customer buys a car.
   - To find out how many customers he needs to get to sell 15 cars, we use the ratio:
     \[
     \text{Customers needed} = 15 \text{ cars} \times 2 \text{ customers/car} = 30 \text{ customers}
     \]
   - Since he gets 2 customers for every 1 car sale, the number of telephone calls needed is:
     \[
     \text{Telephone calls needed} = 30 \text{ customers} \times 25 \text{ calls/customer} = 750 \text{ calls}
     \]

Since the number of telephone calls needed to get the customers (375 calls) is less restrictive than the number of telephone calls needed to get the car sales (750 calls), Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to ensure he gets the necessary customers to sell 15 cars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"First, let's determine the number of flashlights. There are 4 people in the house, so there are 4 flashlights for them. Additionally, there are 2 flashlights per room, and there are 8 rooms. Therefore, the number of additional flashlights is 2 * 8 = 16. Adding these together, the total number of flashlights is 4 + 16 = 20.

Next, let's determine the number of candles. There are 8 rooms, so half of the rooms is 8 / 2 = 4 rooms. In these 4 rooms, there are 4 small candles each, so the total number of small candles is 4 * 4 = 16. The other half of the rooms, which is also 4 rooms, have 5 medium candles each, so the total number of medium candles is 4 * 5 = 20.

Adding the total number of small and medium candles together, we get 16 + 20 = 36 candles.

Now, we can find the total number of candles and flashlights by adding the number of flashlights and the number of candles together: 20 flashlights + 36 candles = 56.

The final numerical answer is 56."

"First, we need to determine how many minutes Tim works each day. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the total minutes Tim works each day as follows:

\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 360 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calls he can handle in a day. Since it takes him 15 minutes to handle one call, we can calculate the number of calls he can handle in a day by dividing the total minutes he works each day by the time it takes to handle one call:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ minutes/day}}{15 \text{ minutes/call}} = 24 \text{ calls/day} \]

Now, to find out how many calls he deals with during his 5-day work week, we multiply the number of calls he handles each day by the number of days in the work week:

\[ 24 \text{ calls/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 120 \text{ calls/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much longer it will take for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish, we need to calculate the drying time for both scenarios and then find the difference.

For the old varnish:
- It takes 7 minutes for one painting to dry.
- For 6 paintings, the total drying time is \(7 \text{ minutes/painting} \times 6 \text{ paintings} = 42 \text{ minutes}\).

For the new varnish:
- It takes 12 minutes for one painting to dry.
- For 6 paintings, the total drying time is \(12 \text{ minutes/painting} \times 6 \text{ paintings} = 72 \text{ minutes}\).

Now, we find the difference in drying times:
- The difference is \(72 \text{ minutes} - 42 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}\).

So, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry as it would with the old varnish."

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time Phineas spends hopping and swimming.

Phineas needs to travel a total of 200 yards. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, he will travel 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.

The time taken to hop 100 yards on land at a speed of 20 yards per minute is:
\[ \text{Time hopping} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

The time taken to swim 100 yards in water at a speed of 10 yards per minute is:
\[ \text{Time swimming} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards/minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of people Conor saw each day and then find the total for the week.

1. **First Day**: Conor saw 50 people.
2. **Second Day**: Conor saw 20 more people than on the first day, which is \(50 + 20 = 70\) people.
3. **Third Day**: The total number of people was twice the number on the second day, which is \(2 \times 70 = 140\) people.

Now, we need to find out how many people Conor saw on the remaining days of the week (fourth, fifth, and sixth days). We know the average number of people seen each day for the week is 60. Therefore, the total number of people seen over the week is \(60 \times 7 = 420\).

Let's denote the number of people seen on the fourth, fifth, and sixth days as \(x\). The total number of people seen over the week can be expressed as:
\[50 + 70 + 140 + x + x + x = 420\]
\[260 + 3x = 420\]
\[3x = 420 - 260\]
\[3x = 160\]
\[x = \frac{160}{3}\]
\[x = 53.33\]

Since the number of people must be a whole number, we can assume the problem implies rounding or the context allows for fractional people, but typically, we would consider the exact calculation. However, for the sake of this problem, we will use the exact value to find the total number of people seen.

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is:
\[50 + 70 + 140 + 53.33 + 53.33 + 53.33 = 420\]

Therefore, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of popped kernels in each 30-second interval and then sum them up, including the additional popped kernels from residual heat.

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount pop, which is \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels.
3. In the next 30 seconds, four times the initial amount pop, which is \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels.
4. In the final 30 seconds, half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, which is \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) kernels.

Now, we sum the kernels popped in the first three intervals:
\[20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200\]

After the pan is taken off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds pop from the residual heat. The number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds is 40, so a quarter of this amount is:
\[\frac{40}{4} = 10\]

Adding these additional popped kernels to the total:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance Elvis traveled in each part of his journey and then determine his net distance from his house.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled west:
- Elvis drives west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance west = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled east:
- Elvis drives east for 8 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance east = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles

Now, we need to find the net distance from Elvis's house. Since he traveled west first and then east, we subtract the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east:
- Net distance = Distance east - Distance west
- Net distance = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

Therefore, Elvis is 54 miles from his house now."
"To find the value of the boat after three years of depreciation, we need to calculate the depreciation year by year.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   - The boat depreciates by 30% in the first year.
   - Depreciation amount = 30% of $9000 = 0.30 * $9000 = $2700.
   - Value after first year = Original value - Depreciation amount = $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

2. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   - The boat depreciates by 30% in the second year.
   - Depreciation amount = 30% of $6300 = 0.30 * $6300 = $1890.
   - Value after second year = Value after first year - Depreciation amount = $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

3. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   - The boat depreciates by 20% in the third year.
   - Depreciation amount = 20% of $4410 = 0.20 * $4410 = $882.

- One night at the hotel costs $80.

Next, let's calculate the cost of one bus trip:
- One bus trip costs 10% of the price of one night at the hotel.
- 10% of $80 is calculated as \( 0.10 \times 80 = 8 \) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the hotel:
- Helen stayed for 3 nights.
- The total cost for the hotel is \( 3 \times 80 = 240 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the bus trips:
- Helen rode the bus 7 times.
- The total cost for the bus trips is \( 7 \times 8 = 56 \) dollars.

Finally, let's calculate the total cost for the hotel and bus trips:
- The total cost is the sum of the hotel cost and the bus cost.
- Total cost is \( 240 + 56 = 296 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many marbles Dallas has after dropping 4 of them. Dallas initially had 21 marbles and then dropped 4, so:

\[ 21 - 4 = 17 \]

This means Dallas has 17 marbles after the drop. Since Dallas originally had 21 marbles and ended up with 17, the 4 marbles that were dropped were not given to Darla. Therefore, the total number of marbles Dallas and Darla have together is still 21.

Mazie started with 52 marbles and ended up with 0 marbles (since she gave all of them to Dallas and Darla). So, the total number of marbles given to Dallas and Darla is 52. Since Dallas has 17 marbles, Darla must have:

\[ 52 - 17 = 35 \]

Therefore, the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla is 35."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the tickets:
- The cost for 2 adult tickets is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dollars.
- The cost for 1 child ticket is \(1 \times 8 = 8\) dollars.

So, the total cost for the tickets is \(24 + 8 = 32\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the popcorns:
- The cost for 2 popcorns is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the tickets and the cost of the popcorns to find the total amount paid:
- Total cost = Cost of tickets + Cost of popcorns = \(32 + 6 = 38\) dollars.

Therefore, the family pays a total of 38 dollars."
"First, we need to calculate the total weight of the car and its contents. The car weighs 1200 pounds and the luggage weighs 250 pounds. John also has two children, each weighing 75 pounds, so the total weight of the children is \(75 \times 2 = 150\) pounds. Adding these together gives the total weight:

\[1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 \text{ pounds}\]

The force required to move the car is 1% of its total weight. To find 1% of 1600 pounds, we calculate:

\[0.01 \times 1600 = 16 \text{ pounds}\]

So, the force John needs to push the car is:

\[\boxed{16}\]"

Given the dimensions of the fence:
- Length (\( l \)) = 20 feet
- Width (\( w \)) = 15 feet

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (20 + 15) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 35 \]
\[ P = 70 \]

Therefore, James needs to buy 70 feet of crepe paper."
"To find the average age of Mia and Emma, we first need to determine Emma's age. Since Mia is 40 years old and they are 16 years apart in age, with Mia being younger, we can calculate Emma's age as follows:

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 + 16
Emma's age = 56

Now that we know Emma is 56 years old, we can calculate the average of their ages:

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 + 56) / 2
Average age = 96 / 2
Average age = 48

The final numerical answer is 48."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the daily feed consumption for one pig:**
   Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day.
   \[
   4 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds per day}
   \]

2. **Calculate the daily feed consumption for all five pigs:**
   \[
   8 \text{ pounds per day} \times 5 \text{ pigs} = 40 \text{ pounds per day}
   \]

3. **Calculate the weekly feed consumption for all five pigs:**
   There are 7 days in a week.
   \[
   40 \text{ pounds per day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 280 \text{ pounds per week}
   \]

4. **Determine the amount of feed left after a week:**
   Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed.
   \[
   300 \text{ pounds} - 280 \text{ pounds} = 20 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Therefore, the number of pounds of feed left after a week is 20."
"First, we need to calculate the total number of hot dogs required for the party. Since there are 20 guests and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs, the total number of hot dogs needed is:
\[ 20 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ hot dogs/guest} = 40 \text{ hot dogs} \]

John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party, so the number of hot dogs he still needs to buy is:
\[ 40 \text{ hot dogs} - 4 \text{ hot dogs} = 36 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Each pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs and costs $2. To find out how many packs he needs to buy, we divide the number of hot dogs he needs by the number of hot dogs per pack:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ hot dogs}}{6 \text{ hot dogs/pack}} = 6 \text{ packs} \]

Since each pack costs $2, the total cost for the packs is:
\[ 6 \text{ packs} \times 2 \text{ dollars/pack} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, John needs to spend \(\boxed{12}\) dollars on hot dogs."
"First, let's calculate the total money Frances earns from selling cupcakes and cookies.

Frances sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each:
\[ 20 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$2/\text{cupcake} = \$40 \]

She sells 40 cookies at $1 each:
\[ 40 \text{ cookies} \times \$1/\text{cookie} = \$40 \]

So, the total money earned from cupcakes and cookies is:
\[ \$40 + \$40 = \$80 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the five trays of cookies:
\[ 5 \text{ trays} \times \$4/\text{tray} = \$20 \]

Now, we subtract the total cost of the trays from the total money earned to find out how much money Frances has left:
\[ \$80 - \$20 = \$60 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$60 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Street**: There are 5 children.
2. **Second Street**: Each of the 5 children is joined by another child. Therefore, the number of children becomes \(5 + 5 = 10\).
3. **Third Street**: Each of the 10 children is joined by another 2 children. Therefore, the number of children becomes \(10 + (10 \times 2) = 10 + 20 = 30\).

On the third street, the original 5 children then give up and leave the group. So, we subtract these 5 children from the total of 30 children.

Thus, the number of children now following the truck is \(30 - 5 = 25\).

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to subtract the number of meals she has already given out from the total number of meals she has.

First, let's add up the meals given out:
- Meals given out on Friday: 64
- Meals given out on Saturday: 30
- Meals given out on Sunday: 48

Total meals given out = 64 + 30 + 48

Now, let's calculate the total:
64 + 30 = 94
94 + 48 = 142

So, Mamou has given out 142 meals in total.

Now, we subtract the total meals given out from the initial number of meals:
1,360 - 142 = 1,218

Therefore, the number of meals left to distribute is 1,218."

"First, let's calculate the time Charisma spends meditating each day. She meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes in the evening, which totals to 30 minutes per day.

Next, we calculate the time she spends on yoga each week. She practices yoga 5 days a week for 1 hour each day, which totals to 5 hours per week.

Now, we calculate the total time spent on yoga in 4 weeks:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Then, we calculate the total time spent on meditation in 4 weeks. Since she meditates 5 days a week for 30 minutes each day, the total meditation time per week is:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 150 \text{ minutes/week} \]
Converting this to hours:
\[ 150 \text{ minutes/week} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 2.5 \text{ hours/week} \]
For 4 weeks:
\[ 2.5 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we add the total time spent on yoga and meditation:

"First, let's determine the number of seeds in a large sunflower. A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since one dozen equals 12, a small sunflower has:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds} \]

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36 seeds, we calculate:

\[ 0.50 \times 36 = 18 \text{ seeds} \]

Adding this to the 36 seeds of the small sunflower gives the number of seeds in a large sunflower:

\[ 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds} \]

Now, to find the total number of seeds in both a small and a large sunflower, we add the seeds from both:

\[ 36 + 54 = 90 \text{ seeds} \]

So, the total number of sunflower seeds altogether is:

So, the company will receive $140000 for selling the produced chocolate bars during two weeks."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts with the buy one get one 50% off deal.

The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, he gets the second T-shirt at 50% off the original price.

The discounted price of the second T-shirt is:
\[ 8 \times 0.5 = 4 \]

So, the total cost for the 2 T-shirts is:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes after the 40% discount.

The original price of the shoes is $40. The discount is 40%, so the price Jake pays is:
\[ 40 \times (1 - 0.4) = 40 \times 0.6 = 24 \]

Now, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends:
\[ 12 + 24 = 36 \]

The total amount of money Jake spends at the store is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate returns, the dog continues to dig 6 holes a day, but Nate starts filling in 9 holes a day. The net effect is that 3 holes are filled each day (since 9 holes are filled minus 6 holes are dug):

\[ 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/day} = 3 \text{ holes/day filled} \]

Now, we need to determine how many days it will take to fill in all 84 holes. Since 3 holes are filled each day, the number of days required to fill in all the holes is:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

To find out how many weeks it takes, we divide the number of days by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes. The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to find the average enrollment at Butler High School. Since Butler High School enrolls an average of \( \frac{3}{4} \) as many students as Norman High School, we can calculate the enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

\[ \text{Enrollment at Butler High School} = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Enrollment at Norman High School} \]

Given that the enrollment at Norman High School is 4000 students, we substitute this value into the equation:

\[ \text{Enrollment at Butler High School} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 = 3000 \]

Next, we need to find how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School. We do this by subtracting the enrollment at Butler High School from the enrollment at Norman High School:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Enrollment at Norman High School} - \text{Enrollment at Butler High School} \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Difference} = 4000 - 3000 = 1000 \]

Therefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School. The final numerical answer is:

"If there are 10 eggs in the first basket, then there are 2 * 10 = 20 eggs in the second basket. Therefore, the total number of eggs in both baskets is 10 + 20 = 30.

The final numerical answer is 30."
"First, let's determine how much money each person raised individually.

Alexandra raised $430.

Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so:
\[ \text{Kim's amount} = 430 + 320 = 750 \]

Sarah raised $300.

Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so:
\[ \text{Maryam's amount} = 300 + 400 = 700 \]

Now, let's add up the total amount of money raised by all of them:
\[ \text{Total amount} = 430 + 750 + 300 + 700 \]

Adding these amounts together:
\[ 430 + 750 = 1180 \]
\[ 1180 + 300 = 1480 \]
\[ 1480 + 700 = 2180 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they all raised is:
\[ 2180 \]"
"First, let's determine Aaron's speed. If Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, and Vanessa ran 4 miles, then Aaron ran 2 miles (since Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron).

Given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, we can calculate his speed. Since Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes, his speed is:
\[ \text{Speed of Aaron} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \]

Since Aaron's speed is half of Vanessa's speed, we can find Vanessa's speed:
\[ \text{Speed of Vanessa} = 2 \times \text{Speed of Aaron} = 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{4 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, we know Vanessa ran 4 miles. Using her speed, we can calculate the time it took her to complete her part of the race:
\[ \text{Time taken by Vanessa} = \text{Distance} \times \text{Speed} = 4 \text{ miles} \times \frac{4 \text{ minutes}}{1 \text{ mile}} = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Vanessa took 16 minutes to complete her part of the race."
"First, we need to calculate how much line is needed for the entire dock. Since the caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, for 200 feet of dock, he needs:

\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Next, we need to determine how much more line he needs to buy. He currently has 6 feet of new line, so the additional line required is:

\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"To determine how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, calculate the cost of the meals and wine per reservation:
- Each reservation includes 2 meals at $5 each and 1 bottle of wine at $5.
- The total cost per reservation is \(2 \times 5 + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15\) dollars.

Next, calculate the total cost per night:
- The restaurant gets 6 reservations per night.
- The total cost per night is \(6 \times 15 = 90\) dollars.

Now, calculate the total cost per week:
- The restaurant is open 2 days a week.
- The total cost per week is \(2 \times 90 = 180\) dollars.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
180"
"First, we need to calculate the total selling price of the 50 watermelons. The vendor made a 25% profit on the $80 worth of watermelons he bought.

The profit amount is calculated as:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Cost Price} \times \text{Profit Percentage} = 80 \times \frac{25}{100} = 80 \times 0.25 = 20 \]

So, the total selling price is:
\[ \text{Selling Price} = \text{Cost Price} + \text{Profit} = 80 + 20 = 100 \]

Now, to find the selling price per watermelon, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:
\[ \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{\text{Selling Price}}{\text{Number of Watermelons}} = \frac{100}{50} = 2 \]

So, each watermelon was sold for $2."
"First, let's determine James's current age. Since Dora will be 12 in 3 years, she is currently 9 years old. James is now twice as old as Dora, so James is currently \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

Next, we need to find out how old John is now. We know that John was 19 when James was born. Since James is currently 18, John must be \(19 + 18 = 37\) years old now.

Now, we need to find out how old John's youngest son is. The youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest son is currently \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old.

In 3 years, the youngest son will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

The final numerical answer is:
8"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many oranges each person can peel in one hour and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate how many oranges Ana can peel in one hour:
- Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour = 60 minutes / 3 minutes/orange = 20 oranges.

Next, let's calculate how many oranges Jane can peel in one hour:
- Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour = 60 minutes / 4 minutes/orange = 15 oranges.

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane in one hour:
- Difference = Number of oranges peeled by Ana - Number of oranges peeled by Jane = 20 oranges - 15 oranges = 5 oranges.

So, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane. The final numerical answer is:
5"
"First, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400, and Mark gets it at 80% off. So, the discount amount is:

\[ 400 \times \frac{80}{100} = 400 \times 0.8 = 320 \]

Subtracting the discount from the original price gives the discounted price of the radiator:

\[ 400 - 320 = 80 \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost of hiring the mechanic to install the radiator. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator. Therefore, the installation cost is:

\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the radiator after the discount to the installation cost to find the total amount Mark paid:

\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, the total amount Mark paid is:

\[ 230 \]"
"Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( K \).

We know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

From the first piece of information, we can write the equation:
\[ C + K = 20 \]

From the second piece of information, we know that chickens have 2 legs each and cows have 4 legs each, so we can write the equation:
\[ 2C + 4K = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

To solve this system, we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ C + 2K - C - K = 15 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 20 - 15 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is 5.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of slices available from the 7 pizzas. Since each pizza is cut into 8 slices, we can calculate the total number of slices as follows:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to divide the total number of slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends, which makes a total of 4 people. So, we divide the total number of slices by 4:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Thus, each of them can have 14 slices. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 14 \]"
