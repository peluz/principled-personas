"First, let's determine how many eggs Janet has left after eating and baking.

Janet starts with 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and bakes 4 eggs. So, the number of eggs left for the farmers' market is calculated as follows:

\[ 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 \]

Janet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg. Therefore, her daily earnings from selling the eggs are:

\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

So, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market."
"To solve this problem, we need to add the amount of blue fiber to the amount of white fiber used for the robe.

Given:
- The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.
- The robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber, which means it takes \( \frac{1}{2} \times 2 = 1 \) bolt of white fiber.

Now, we add the bolts of blue and white fiber together:
- Blue fiber: 2 bolts
- White fiber: 1 bolt

Total bolts of fiber used:
\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \]

Therefore, the total number of bolts of fiber needed is 3."
"First, we need to calculate the new value of the house after the repairs and the increase in value. The original value of the house is $80,000. Josh adds $50,000 in repairs, so the total cost before the increase is:

\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

The value of the house increases by 150%. To find out how much the value increases, we calculate 150% of $130,000:

\[ 130,000 \times 1.5 = 195,000 \]

Adding this increase to the original cost gives the new value of the house:

\[ 130,000 + 195,000 = 325,000 \]

Josh sells the house for $325,000. To find the profit, we subtract the total cost (original price plus repairs) from the selling price:

\[ 325,000 - 130,000 = 195,000 \]

So, the profit Josh made is:

\[ 195,000 \]

Final numerical answer:
195000"
"James runs 3 sprints each day, and each sprint is 60 meters. Therefore, in one day, he runs:
\[ 3 \text{ sprints/day} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 180 \text{ meters/day} \]

Since he runs 3 times a week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
\[ 180 \text{ meters/day} \times 3 \text{ days/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week} \]

The final numerical answer is 540."
"To determine the total amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon.
2. Multiply the total daily feed by the number of chickens.
3. Subtract the morning and afternoon feed from the total daily feed to find the final meal's feed.

First, let's calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon:
- Morning feed: 15 cups
- Afternoon feed: 25 cups

Total feed given in the morning and afternoon:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we calculate the total daily feed for 20 chickens:
- Each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per day.
- Total daily feed for 20 chickens:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we subtract the morning and afternoon feed from the total daily feed to find the final meal's feed:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:
\[ 20 \text{ cups} \]"
"To solve this, we need to calculate the cost for 16 glasses, considering the pricing structure.

1. The first glass costs $5.
2. Every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $5 * 0.60 = $3.

So, for every pair of glasses, the cost is $5 + $3 = $8.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can divide the total number of glasses by 2 to find out how many pairs of glasses he is buying:
\[ \frac{16}{2} = 8 \text{ pairs} \]

Now, we multiply the number of pairs by the cost per pair:
\[ 8 \times 8 = 64 \]

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses."
"To solve this problem, we will follow the relationships given and calculate the number of sheep in each city step by step.

1. **Seattle's Sheep:**
   - Seattle has 20 sheep.

2. **Charleston's Sheep:**
   - Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   - Therefore, Charleston has \( 4 \times 20 = 80 \) sheep.

3. **Toulouse's Sheep:**
   - Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   - Therefore, Toulouse has \( 2 \times 80 = 160 \) sheep.

4. **Total Sheep:**
   - To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we add the number of sheep in each city.
   - Total = Seattle's Sheep + Charleston's Sheep + Toulouse's Sheep
   - Total = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260

The final numerical answer is 260."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the time taken for each part of the download.

1. **First 40% of the file:**
   - The file size is 200 GB.
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 0.40 \times 200 = 80 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) minutes.

2. **Windows update restart:**
   - This takes 20 minutes.

3. **Restarting the download:**
   - After the restart, Carla has to start downloading the remaining 120 GB (200 GB - 80 GB).
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download the remaining 120 GB is \( \frac{120}{2} = 60 \) minutes.

Now, we sum up the time taken for each part:
- Time for the first 40%: 40 minutes
- Time for the Windows update restart: 20 minutes
- Time to restart and download the remaining 120 GB: 60 minutes

Total time = \( 40 + 20 + 60 = 120 \) minutes.

The final numerical answer is 120 minutes."
"To calculate the total distance John traveled, we need to break down his journey into segments and calculate the distance for each segment.

1. **First Segment:**
   - Time: 3 hours
   - Speed: 60 mph
   - Distance: \(3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ mph} = 180 \text{ miles}\)

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Time: 2 hours (in traffic)
   - Speed: 0 mph
   - Distance: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 0 \text{ mph} = 0 \text{ miles}\)

3. **Third Segment:**
   - Time: 0.5 hours
   - Speed: 30 mph
   - Distance: \(0.5 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ miles}\)

4. **Fourth Segment:**
   - Time: 3.5 hours (since 4 hours total - 2 hours traffic - 0.5 hours at 30 mph = 3.5 hours)
   - Speed: 80 mph
   - Distance: \(3.5 \text{ hours} \times 80 \text{ mph} = 280 \text{ miles}\)

Now, we sum up the distances from all segments to find the total distance traveled:
\[180 \text{ miles} + 0 \text{ miles} + 15 \text{ miles} + 280 \text{ miles} = 475 \text{ miles}\]

Therefore, the total distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours is 475 miles."
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break it down into regular hours and overtime hours.

Eliza's regular rate is $10 per hour. For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
\[ 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \]

For the overtime hours, she works 5 hours over the regular 40 hours. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate:
\[ 1.2 \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$12/\text{hour} \]
So, her earnings for the 5 overtime hours are:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

Adding the earnings from regular hours and overtime hours gives us her total earnings for the week:
\[ \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \]

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are:
\[ \$460 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Month Downloads**: The program had 60 downloads.
2. **Second Month Downloads**: The number of downloads in the second month was three times the first month. Therefore, the downloads in the second month are:
   \[
   60 \times 3 = 180
   \]
3. **Third Month Downloads**: The number of downloads in the third month was reduced by 30% from the second month. To find the reduced number of downloads, we calculate 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180:
   \[
   180 \times 0.30 = 54
   \]
   \[
   180 - 54 = 126
   \]

Now, to find the total number of downloads over the three months, we sum the downloads from each month:
\[
60 + 180 + 126 = 366
\]

The total number of downloads over the three months is:
\[
\boxed{366}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts:
- Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
- Each dozen of donuts costs $68.
- Therefore, the cost for the donuts is \(3 \times 68 = 204\).

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:
- Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
- Each dozen of mini cupcakes costs $80.
- Therefore, the cost for the mini cupcakes is \(2 \times 80 = 160\).

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes:
- Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
- Each dozen of mini cheesecakes costs $55.
- Therefore, the cost for the mini cheesecakes is \(6 \times 55 = 330\).

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total cost:
- Total cost = cost of donuts + cost of mini cupcakes + cost of mini cheesecakes
- Total cost = 204 + 160 + 330 = 694.

The final numerical answer is 694."
"To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point at which this profit becomes positive.

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:
- Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons.
- Each lemon is sold for $1.5.

Annual revenue from lemons = 7 lemons/year * $1.5/lemon = $10.5/year.

Next, we calculate the annual cost:
- The cost to plant the tree is $90.
- The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.

Annual cost = $90 (initial cost) + $3 (annual cost) = $93/year.

Now, we find the net profit each year by subtracting the annual cost from the annual revenue:
Net profit per year = Annual revenue - Annual cost
Net profit per year = $10.5 - $93 = -$82.5/year.

Since the net profit is negative every year, Carlos will never start earning money on the lemon tree. The tree will always incur a loss.

Therefore, the number of years it will take before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree is 0.

Final numerical answer:
0"
"Let's denote the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this is \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \).

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this is \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \).

3. She then sold half of what was left at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \). The number of vacuum cleaners left after this is \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \).

We know that after all these sales, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

Let's solve this equation step by step:

First, simplify the expression inside the parentheses:

\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2x}{3} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{x}{3} + 1 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{2x - x}{3} - 1 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{x}{3} = 6 \]
\[ x = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners. Let's verify this by working backwards:

1. She started with 18 vacuum cleaners.
2. She sold \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) at the green house, leaving her with \( 18 - 6 = 12 \) vacuum cleaners.
3. She sold 2 more at the red house, leaving her with \( 12 - 2 = 10 \) vacuum cleaners.
4. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \), leaving her with \( 10 - 5 = 5 \) vacuum cleaners.

Since the final number of vacuum cleaners left is 5, our solution is correct. The final numerical answer is:

18"
"First, let's calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we have:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after those who enrolled in contemporary dance have been accounted for:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Now, 25% of these remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Finally, the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is the remaining students after those who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance have been accounted for:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance, we calculate:

\[ \frac{12}{20} \times 100\% = 0.60 \times 100\% = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the entire students that enrolled in hip-hop dance is 60%."
"To determine which purchase plan maximizes profit, we need to calculate the future value of each item based on the expected market growth and then compare the profit from each.

For the jewelry:
- Current value: $5,000
- Expected growth: 2.5%

The future value of the jewelry can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Future Value of Jewelry} = \text{Current Value} \times (1 + \text{Growth Rate}) \]
\[ \text{Future Value of Jewelry} = 5000 \times (1 + 0.025) \]
\[ \text{Future Value of Jewelry} = 5000 \times 1.025 \]
\[ \text{Future Value of Jewelry} = 5125 \]

For the electronic gadgets:
- Current value: $8,000
- Expected growth: 1.2%

The future value of the electronic gadgets can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Future Value of Gadgets} = \text{Current Value} \times (1 + \text{Growth Rate}) \]
\[ \text{Future Value of Gadgets} = 8000 \times (1 + 0.012) \]
\[ \text{Future Value of Gadgets} = 8000 \times 1.012 \]
\[ \text{Future Value of Gadgets} = 8096 \]

Now, we calculate the profit for each option:
- Profit from jewelry: \( \text{Future Value of Jewelry} - \text{Current Value} \)
\[ \text{Profit from Jewelry} = 5125 - 5000 = 125 \]

- Profit from electronic gadgets: \( \text{Future Value of Gadgets} - \text{Current Value} \)
\[ \text{Profit from Gadgets} = 8096 - 8000 = 96 \]

Comparing the profits:
- Profit from jewelry: $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets: $96

The merchant would maximize profit by choosing to purchase the jewelry, which would yield a profit of $125."
"To determine the total distance covered by each train over the two days, we need to add the distances traveled in both directions.

1. The first day, the train travels 80 miles west.
2. The second day, the train travels 150 miles north.

The total distance covered by each train is the sum of these two distances:
\[ 80 \text{ miles} + 150 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles."
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to break down her earnings from both teaching and coaching and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her annual earnings from teaching:
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual teaching earnings = 35 hours/week * $20/hour * 50 weeks/year

Next, let's calculate her annual earnings from coaching:
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She gets paid $30 per coaching session.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual coaching earnings = 15 hours/week * $30/session * 50 weeks/year

Now, let's sum up her annual earnings from both teaching and coaching to get her total annual salary.

Let's do the calculations:

Annual teaching earnings = 35 * 20 * 50 = $35,000
Annual coaching earnings = 15 * 30 * 50 = $22,500

Total annual salary = Annual teaching earnings + Annual coaching earnings
Total annual salary = $35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500

So, Jill's annual salary is $57,500."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many eggs Claire uses in one day.
2. Calculate how many eggs she uses in one week.
3. Calculate how many eggs she uses in four weeks.
4. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.

Step 1: Claire uses 3 eggs per day.

Step 2: There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, she uses:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Step 3: For four weeks, she uses:
\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Step 4: Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we convert 84 eggs into dozens:
\[ \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 7 dozens."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

First, let's calculate the total time Marissa has already spent hiking:
- She took 1 hour for the first 4 miles.
- She took another 1 hour for the next 2 miles.
So, she has already spent 2 hours hiking.

The total distance of the trail is 12 miles. Therefore, the remaining distance is:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 4 \text{ miles} - 2 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour over the entire 12-mile trail. To find the total time she needs to spend hiking to achieve this average speed, we use the formula for average speed:
\[ \text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} \]

Rearranging to solve for total time:
\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already spent 2 hours hiking, so the remaining time she needs to spend hiking is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Now, we need to find the speed required to cover the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Thus, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \]"
"First, let's calculate the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink. Since two-thirds of the orange drink is water, we can calculate the amount of water as follows:

\[ \text{Water in orange drink} = \frac{2}{3} \times 10 \text{ liters} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ liters} \]

Next, let's calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since three-fifths of the pineapple drink is water, we can calculate the amount of water as follows:

\[ \text{Water in pineapple drink} = \frac{3}{5} \times 15 \text{ liters} = \frac{45}{5} \text{ liters} = 9 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we add the water from both drinks before any spillage:

\[ \text{Total water before spillage} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ liters} + 9 \text{ liters} = \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3} \text{ liters} \]

Since one liter of orange drink is spilled, the total volume of the mixture is reduced by one liter:

\[ \text{Total volume after spillage} = 10 \text{ liters} - 1 \text{ liter} + 15 \text{ liters} = 24 \text{ liters} \]

The total amount of water remains the same, so the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:

\[ \text{Water in remaining mixture} = \frac{47}{3} \text{ liters} \]

To express this as a numerical value:

\[ \frac{47}{3} \approx 15.67 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 15.67 \text{ liters} \]"
"First, let's determine Raymond's current age. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha and Samantha is currently 31 years old, Raymond is currently \(31 - 6 = 25\) years old.

Raymond had a son at the age of 23. Therefore, Raymond's son was born when Raymond was 23 years old. Since Raymond is currently 25 years old, his son was born \(25 - 23 = 2\) years ago.

"To determine the total number of DVDs Billy sold on Tuesday, we need to sum the number of DVDs bought by each group of customers.

- The first 3 customers each bought 1 DVD, so that's \(3 \times 1 = 3\) DVDs.
- The next 2 customers each bought 2 DVDs, so that's \(2 \times 2 = 4\) DVDs.
- The last 3 customers did not buy any DVDs, so that's \(3 \times 0 = 0\) DVDs.

Adding these together, the total number of DVDs sold is \(3 + 4 + 0 = 7\).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 7."
"To determine how many centimeters shorter the candle will be after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, we need to calculate the total burning time and then use the rate of melting to find the total reduction in length.

The burning time from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is 4 hours.

Given that the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, the total reduction in length over 4 hours is:
\[ 2 \, \text{cm/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 8 \, \text{cm} \]

Thus, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the original price of the book, we need to understand that Kyle paid 75% of the original price (since he got a 25% discount). Let's denote the original price by \( P \). Therefore, we have:

\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we need to solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's calculate the value of \( P \).
```python
# Calculation
original_price = 19.50 / 0.75
original_price
```
```output
RuntimeError
```
It seems there was an error in the execution environment. Let's perform the calculation manually:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} = 26.00 \]

So, the original price of the book was \( \$26.00 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{26.00} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered except for the boxes of pizza.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
The cost of 4 apples is \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Now, let's add these costs together:
\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\] dollars.

Marie paid a total of $50. If we subtract the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples from the total amount paid, we can find out how much she spent on the boxes of pizza:
\[50 - 33 = 17\] dollars.

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, we can determine the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered by dividing the amount spent on pizza by the cost per box:
\[17 \div 8.50 = 2\]

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

The final numerical answer is:
2"
"To find out how much Mishka spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of each type of clothing item separately and then sum them up.

The cost of the shorts is:
3 pairs * $16.50 per pair = $59.50

The cost of the pants is:
3 pairs * $22.50 per pair = $67.50

The cost of the shoes is:
3 pairs * $42 per pair = $126.00

Now, we add these amounts together to find the total cost:
$59.50 + $67.50 + $126.00 = $253.00

So, Mishka spent $253.00 on all the clothing items."
"To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.
2. Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.**

Cynthia eats 1 serving of ice cream every night. There are 60 days in the period.

\[
\text{Total servings} = 1 \text{ serving/day} \times 60 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ servings}
\]

**Step 2: Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need.**

Each carton contains 15 servings.

\[
\text{Number of cartons} = \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.**

Each carton costs $4.00.

\[
\text{Total cost} = 4 \text{ cartons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total amount Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days is:

\[
\boxed{16}

"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

The cost of one pair of high heels is $33, and the other pair costs twice as much, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

According to the problem, the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ B = 99 + 5 \]

Now, let's solve for \( B \):

\[ B = 104 \]

So, the boots cost \( 104 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 104 \]"
"To solve this problem, we start by defining the ages of Darrell and Allen in terms of a variable. Let's denote the common ratio factor by \( x \). Therefore, Darrell's age can be represented as \( 7x \) and Allen's age as \( 11x \).

Given that their total age is 162, we can set up the following equation:
\[
7x + 11x = 162
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
18x = 162
\]

Solve for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{162}{18} = 9
\]

Now, we can find the individual ages:
- Darrell's age: \( 7x = 7 \times 9 = 63 \)
- Allen's age: \( 11x = 11 \times 9 = 99 \)

Next, we need to determine Allen's age 10 years from now:
\[
99 + 10 = 109
\]

Thus, Allen's age 10 years from now is:
\[
\boxed{109}

"To find the average guess, we first need to determine each friend's guess and then calculate the average.

1. The first friend's guess is 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half of the first friend's guess:
   \[
   \text{Second friend's guess} = \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60
   \]
3. The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess:
   \[
   \text{Third friend's guess} = 80 + (0.25 \times 80) = 80 + 20 = 100
   \]

Now, we calculate the average of these guesses:
\[
\text{Average guess} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs each week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. First, calculate the total hours John spends on one dog per day:
   \[
   0.5 \text{ hours/dog/day}
   \]

2. Next, calculate the total hours John spends on all 10 dogs per day:
   \[
   0.5 \text{ hours/dog/day} \times 10 \text{ dogs} = 5 \text{ hours/day}
   \]

3. Finally, calculate the total hours John spends on all 10 dogs per week (assuming 7 days in a week):
   \[
   5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week}
   \]

So, the total number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs each week is 35 hours."
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these as the following equations:
\[ S + G = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins \( S \) is 40, we can find the number of gold coins \( G \) using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins."
"First, let's find out how many jewels Aaron has. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Since Raymond has 40 jewels, half of Raymond's jewels is:

\[

\]

So, Aaron has:

\[
20 + 5 = 25
\]

Jewels.

Next, we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. The problem states that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Since Aaron has 25 jewels, Siobhan has:

"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points he scores in the second 20 minutes, we calculate 25% of 4 points and add it to the original 4 points.

25% of 4 points is \( 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \) point.

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) points.

Therefore, the total points Mike scored are \( 4 + 5 = 9 \) points.

The final numerical answer is 9."
"First, let's determine the cost of one yogurt. Since 4 yogurts cost $5.00, the cost of one yogurt is:

\[ \text{Cost of one yogurt} = \frac{5.00}{4} = 1.25 \]

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so the cost of 2 yogurts per day is:

\[ \text{Cost of 2 yogurts per day} = 2 \times 1.25 = 2.50 \]

Over 30 days, the total cost for Terry would be:

\[ \text{Total cost over 30 days} = 2.50 \times 30 = 75.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 75.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John makes from selling his lego sets. He has 13 lego sets and sells each for $15.

\[ \text{Total money from lego sets} = 13 \times 15 = 195 \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money John spends on the video games. He buys 8 video games for $20 each.

\[ \text{Total money spent on video games} = 8 \times 20 = 160 \]

Now, we know that after buying the video games, John has $5 left. We can find out how much money he had initially by adding the money he spent on video games and the money he has left.

\[ \text{Initial money} = \text{Total money from lego sets} + \text{Money left} = 195 + 5 = 200 \]

Since the initial money John had is $200 and he spent $160 on video games, we can confirm that he indeed has $5 left.

Finally, since John sold all his lego sets and did not keep any, the number of lego sets he still has is:

\[ \text{Number of lego sets he still has} = 0 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 0 \]"
"To find John's speed, we need to determine the total distance he runs and the total time he spends running.

John runs 60 miles a week over 3 days. He runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. So, on the second and third days, he runs 3/2 = 1.5 hours each day.

The total time spent running in a week is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours (first day)} + 1.5 \text{ hours (second day)} + 1.5 \text{ hours (third day)} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

The total distance he runs in a week is 60 miles.

Speed is calculated as distance divided by time. So, John's speed is:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how far Dana can travel in six hours given her running, walking, and skipping speeds, and the time she spends on each activity.

First, let's find Dana's walking speed. We know that Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, and this speed is half of her running speed. Therefore, her running speed is:
\[ \text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 3 \text{ miles per hour} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine the time she spends running and walking. Since she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, and the total time is six hours, we can calculate the time spent on each activity:
\[ \text{Time spent running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Time spent walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the distance she covers while running and walking:
\[ \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time spent running} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time spent walking} \]

To find the walking speed, we use the fact that her walking speed is one-fourth of her running speed:
\[ \text{Walking speed} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Running speed} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6 \text{ miles per hour} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Distance walking} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is the sum of the distances she covers while running and walking:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance walking} = 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\]

The dragon's reach is 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone.

\[
\text{Distance outside reach} = 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet}

"To solve this, we need to determine how many calories are left for the day and then figure out how many grams of chips can be consumed based on the calorie intake.

First, calculate the remaining calories for the day:
\[ \text{Remaining calories} = \text{Daily calorie target} - \text{Calories already consumed} \]
\[ \text{Remaining calories} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Next, determine how many calories come from one serving of chips:
\[ \text{Calories per serving} = 250 \text{ calories} \]

Now, calculate how many servings can be consumed with the remaining calories:
\[ \text{Servings that can be consumed} = \frac{\text{Remaining calories}}{\text{Calories per serving}} \]
\[ \text{Servings that can be consumed} = \frac{200}{250} = 0.8 \text{ servings} \]

Since each serving is 300 grams, we can find out how many grams can be consumed:
\[ \text{Grams that can be consumed} = \text{Servings that can be consumed} \times \text{Grams per serving} \]
\[ \text{Grams that can be consumed} = 0.8 \times 300 = 240 \text{ grams} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the cost of making the candles. Charlie can make 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax. Therefore, to make 20 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax.

The cost of 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00. Therefore, the cost for 2 pounds of beeswax is:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles at $2.00 each:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we can find the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the net profit if Charlie makes and sells 20 candles is:
\[ 20 \text{ dollars} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days.

First, let's determine the number of articles she wrote each day:

- **Monday**: She wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday**: She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.
- **Wednesday**: She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. This means she wrote \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles.

Next, we calculate the total number of articles written over the three days:
\[ 5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles} \]

Each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write about. Therefore, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:

"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Given that each blue tie costs $40 and he spent a total of $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of each red tie. Since red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, the cost of each red tie is:

\[ \text{Cost per red tie} = \text{Cost per blue tie} + 0.5 \times \text{Cost per blue tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60 \]

Now, we can calculate the total amount John spent on red ties:

\[ \text{Total spent on red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

Finally, the total amount John spent on ties is the sum of the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:

\[ \text{Total spent on ties} = \text{Total spent on blue ties} + \text{Total spent on red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800 \]

So, Lloyd makes $294 on eggs per week."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Tom to travel back from his destination. We know his speed on the return trip is 6 mph, but we need to know the distance he traveled to get to his destination first.

From 1 to 4 PM, Tom travels for 3 hours at a speed of 10 mph. The distance he covers during this time is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, he travels back the same 30 miles at a speed of 6 mph. The time it takes to travel back is:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{mph}} = 5 \, \text{hours} \]

So, the time it takes him to get back is 5 hours."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, and he removes 30 comic books.

\[ \text{Total weight of comic books} = 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we know that Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. Since 7.5 pounds of comic books have already been removed, the remaining weight that needs to be removed is:

\[ \text{Remaining weight to be removed} = 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound, so to find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

   - The reduced monthly charge = $140 - (10% of $140) = $140 - $14 = $126.
   - Total cost for the second half of the year = $126 * 6 = $756.

3. **Total Cost for the Year:**
   - Total cost = Cost for the first half + Cost for the second half = $840 + $756 = $1596.

Therefore, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $1596."
"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we can use the information given to calculate the fuel efficiency of her car and then apply that to the full capacity of the tank.

First, we calculate the fuel efficiency of her car. She has traveled 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas. Therefore, the fuel efficiency is:

\[ \text{Fuel Efficiency} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

Next, we use this fuel efficiency to find out how far she can drive on a full tank of gas. Since her tank holds 12 gallons of gas, the total distance she can drive is:

\[ \text{Total Distance} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 300 \]"
"First, let's determine how long Jim spends on TV and reading in one session. He spends 2 hours watching TV and then reads for half as long as he watches TV. Therefore, he spends:

\[ \text{Reading time} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, in one session, he spends:

\[ \text{Total time} = 2 \text{ hours (TV)} + 1 \text{ hour (reading)} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total time spent in one week is:

\[ \text{Total weekly time} = 3 \text{ hours/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week} \]

To find out how many hours he spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly total by 4:

\[ \text{Total time in 4 weeks} = 9 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 36 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 36 \]"
"To determine the total number of people sent by all the schools, we need to consider the players and coaches from both the girls' and boys' teams.

Each school sends:
- 5 players from the girls' team
- 5 players from the boys' team
- 1 coach for the girls' team
- 1 coach for the boys' team

So, for each school, the total number of people sent is:
\[ 5 \text{ (girls' players)} + 5 \text{ (boys' players)} + 1 \text{ (girls' coach)} + 1 \text{ (boys' coach)} = 12 \text{ people} \]

Since there are 4 schools, the total number of people sent by all the schools is:
\[ 4 \text{ (schools)} \times 12 \text{ (people per school)} = 48 \text{ people} \]

Thus, the total number of people sent by all the schools is 48."
"First, let's determine the number of each type of gem:

- The number of diamonds is given as 175.
- The number of rubies is 35 fewer than the number of diamonds, so:
  \[
  \text{Number of rubies} = 175 - 35 = 140
  \]
- The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies, so:
  \[
  \text{Number of emeralds} = 2 \times 140 = 280
  \]

Now, let's find the total number of gems by adding the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds:
\[
\text{Total number of gems} = 175 + 140 + 280
\]

Adding these together:
\[
175 + 140 = 315
\]
\[
315 + 280 = 595

"To find out how much money Bailey started with, we first need to calculate how much she received from her weekly allowance over 8 weeks.

Bailey receives $5 per week for 8 weeks, so the total allowance is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

Bailey has a total of $100 at the end of 8 weeks. This total includes her initial amount of money plus the $40 she received from her allowance. Let's denote her initial amount of money as \( x \). Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 40 = 100 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 100 - 40 \]
\[ x = 60 \]

So, Bailey started with $60."
"To calculate the total amount of money Judy makes in one week, we need to follow these steps:

2. Calculate the number of classes Judy teaches on Saturday.
3. Calculate the total number of students she teaches in a week.
4. Calculate the total amount of money she makes by multiplying the total number of students by the charge per student.

Let's start with the calculations:

1. Judy teaches 5 classes every day on weekdays. There are 5 weekdays in a week.
   \[
   \text{Total classes on weekdays} = 5 \text{ classes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 25 \text{ classes}
   \]

2. Judy teaches 8 classes on Saturday.
   \[
   \text{Total classes on Saturday} = 8 \text{ classes}
   \]

3. Calculate the total number of students she teaches in a week:
   \[
   \text{Total students} = \text{Total classes on weekdays} + \text{Total classes on Saturday} = 25 \text{ classes} + 8 \text{ classes} = 33 \text{ classes}
   \]
   Since each class has 15 students:
   \[
   \text{Total students} = 33 \text{ classes} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 495 \text{ students}
   \]

4. Calculate the total amount of money she makes:
   \[
   \text{Total money} = \text{Total students} \times \text{Charge per student} = 495 \text{ students} \times \$15.00/\text{student} = \$7425.00

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the cell phones before interest:

Cost of one cell phone = $150
Number of cell phones = 5

Total cost before interest = $150 * 5 = $750

Next, let's calculate the total interest for all five cell phones:

Interest rate = 2% = 0.02

Total interest = $750 * 0.02 = $15

Now, let's calculate the total cost including interest:

Total cost including interest = $750 + $15 = $765

Finally, Shiela will pay this total amount over 3 months:

Monthly payment = Total cost including interest / Number of months
                = $765 / 3
                = $255

So, Shiela will pay $255 each month for 3 months."

"Let's denote the number of games they lost as \( L \) and the number of games they won as \( W \).

According to the problem, the team played 22 games in total, so:
\[ W + L = 22 \]

It is also given that they won 8 more games than they lost, so:
\[ W = L + 8 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the number of games they lost, we can find the number of games they won by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( W = L + 8 \):
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

"Gene is 34 years old and has been vacationing since he was 23, which means he has been vacationing for 34 - 23 = 11 years. Since he has one shirt (quilt block) from each vacation, he has 11 quilt blocks from his first vacation. For each subsequent year of vacation, he adds another quilt block. Therefore, for 11 years, he has 11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 quilt blocks. This is the sum of the first 11 positive integers.

The sum of the first \( n \) positive integers is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Sum} = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \]

For \( n = 11 \):

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of times the alarm rang by considering the duration of each ring.

1. The first time the alarm went off, it rang 4 times.
2. The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time. Therefore, it rang \(4 \times 3 = 12\) times.
3. The third time it went off, it rang for half as long as the second time. Therefore, it rang \(12 \div 2 = 6\) times.

Now, we sum up the total number of rings:
- First ring: 4 times
- Second ring: 12 times
- Third ring: 6 times

Total number of rings = \(4 + 12 + 6 = 22\)

The final numerical answer is 22."
"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the initial salary.
2. Calculate the increase in salary after 5 years.
3. Calculate the salary after 3 more years of service.

"Let's define the ages of the kids based on the information given:

- Let \( J \) be Jackson's age.
- Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Amy's age is \( J + 5 \).
- Amy is also 2 years younger than Corey, so Corey's age is \( J + 5 + 2 = J + 7 \).
- James is 10 years old and 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey's age is \( 10 + 1 = 11 \).

Since Corey's age is 11, we can set up the equation:
\[ J + 7 = 11 \]

Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 11 - 7 \]
\[ J = 4 \]

So, Jackson is 4 years old.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how fast Lee used to run the 400-meter hurdles. We know that Lee runs it 2 seconds faster than Gerald's new time. If Lee's new time is 38 seconds, then his old time was:

\[ 38 + 2 = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, we know that Gerald's new speed is 10% faster than his old speed. This means that if Gerald's old time was \( T \) seconds, his new time is \( 0.9T \) seconds. We know his new time is 38 seconds, so:

\[ 0.9T = 38 \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):

\[ T = \frac{38}{0.9} \]

\[ T = \frac{380}{9} \]

\[ T \approx 42.22 \text{ seconds} \]

So, Gerald's old time was approximately 42.22 seconds. With his improved diet, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds."
"Let's denote the number of dogs as \( D \), the number of cats as \( C \), and the number of rabbits as \( R \).

Given:
- The number of dogs \( D = 60 \).
- The number of cats \( C = 2D \) (since there are two cats for every dog).
- The number of rabbits \( R \) is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats.

First, calculate the number of cats:
\[ C = 2D = 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

Next, calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:
\[ D + C = 60 + 120 = 180 \]

Given that the number of rabbits \( R \) is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats:
\[ R = (D + C) - 12 = 180 - 12 = 168 \]

Now, calculate the total number of pets in the neighborhood:

The number of boys is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of 200 students:
\[ \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

Since the total number of students is 200, the number of girls is:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. According to the problem, \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the girls are in the girl scout:
\[ \text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[ \text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40 \]

So, the number of girls not in the girl scout is 40."
"First, we need to find out how many hours James slept. Since James slept only 2/3 of what Harry slept, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Hours James slept} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 \]

\[ \text{Hours James slept} = 6 \]

Now, to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we subtract the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:

1. **Determine the volume of tomatoes before cooking:**
   - The sauce made 32 ounces after losing half its volume during cooking.
   - Therefore, before cooking, the volume of the sauce was \(32 \times 2 = 64\) ounces.

2. **Calculate the total volume of tomatoes used:**
   - Each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes.
   - Since 64 ounces of sauce were made from the tomatoes, we need to find out how many 16-ounce cans of tomatoes were used.
   - The number of 16-ounce cans used is \(64 \div 16 = 4\) cans.

3. **Calculate the total number of tomatoes used:**
   - Each can contains 3 tomatoes.
   - Therefore, the total number of tomatoes used is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) tomatoes.

The final numerical answer is:
12"
"Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- \( x \) cars drove through in the first 15 minutes.
- 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes.
- 5 cars exited the motorway before the traffic jam ended.

The original number of cars was 30. After the traffic jam ended, the number of cars remaining on the motorway would be:
\[ x + 20 - 5 = x + 15 \]

Since this remaining number of cars is what was left after the traffic jam ended, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 15 = 30 - \text{(cars that drove through)} \]

But we know that the cars that drove through are exactly the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the additional 20 cars:
\[ x + 20 \]

So, the equation simplifies to:
\[ x + 15 = 30 - (x + 20) \]

Simplifying the right side:
\[ x + 15 = 30 - x - 20 \]
\[ x + 15 = 10 - x \]

Adding \( x \) to both sides:
\[ 2x + 15 = 10 \]

Subtracting 15 from both sides:
\[ 2x = -5 \]

Dividing by 2:
\[ x = -\frac{5}{2} \]

Since the number of cars cannot be negative, we need to re-evaluate the setup. The correct interpretation should be:
\[ x + 15 = 30 - (x + 20 - 5) \]
\[ x + 15 = 30 - (x + 15) \]
\[ x + 15 = 30 - x - 15 \]
\[ x + 15 = 15 - x \]
\[ 2x = 0 \]
\[ x = 0 \]

This indicates an error in the setup. Let's correct it:
\[ x + 15 = 30 - (x + 20 - 5) \]
\[ x + 15 = 30 - (x + 15) \]
\[ x + 15 = 15 - x \]
\[ 2x = 0 \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \( 10 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of potted plants Mary currently has. She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so:

\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Next, Mary will give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges tomorrow. So, she will give away:

\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Now, to find out how many potted plants Mary will remain with, we subtract the number of plants she will give away from the number of plants she currently has:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

So, the final number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. So, the second friend pressed the doorbell \(20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25\) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. So, the third friend pressed the doorbell \(60 + 10 = 70\) times.

Now, let's sum up all the doorbell presses:

- First friend: 20 times
- Second friend: 25 times
- Third friend: 70 times
- Fourth friend: 60 times

Total doorbell presses = \(20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175\)

The final numerical answer is 175."
"First, let's calculate the total number of pages Solo needs to read:

- Science: 4 pages
- Social Studies: 20 pages
- History: 7 pages
- Geography: 8 pages

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday. Therefore, the remaining pages he needs to read are:

Remaining pages = Total pages - Pages read on Monday
Remaining pages = 39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read, on average, in one day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days left:

Pages per day = Remaining pages / Number of days left
Pages per day = 24 / 4 = 6 pages

So, Solo needs to read, on average, 6 pages per day."
"To determine how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to break down his water consumption by weekdays and weekends.

John drinks water with each meal on weekdays (Monday through Friday). Since he has water with breakfast, lunch, dinner, and before bed, that's 4 glasses of water per day on weekdays.

So, for 5 weekdays:
\[ 4 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ glasses} \]

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he drinks a soda with dinner instead of water. So, he drinks 0 glasses of water on each of the weekend days.

So, for 2 weekend days:
\[ 0 \text{ glasses/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 0 \text{ glasses} \]

Adding the glasses of water he drinks on weekdays and weekends:
\[ 20 \text{ glasses} + 0 \text{ glasses} = 20 \text{ glasses} \]

Therefore, the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is 20."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time it takes for the fog bank to cover the entire city. We know that the fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. First, we calculate the number of 3-mile segments in the 42-mile city:

\[ \text{Number of segments} = \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/segment}} = 14 \text{ segments} \]

Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each 3-mile segment, the total time to cover the entire city is:

\[ \text{Total time} = 14 \text{ segments} \times 10 \text{ minutes/segment} = 140 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to determine the inner dimensions of a single box and then calculate its volume. After that, we multiply the volume of one box by 3.

The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side) to get the inner dimensions.

So, the inner dimensions of each box are:
- Length: 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches

The volume of one box is calculated as:
\[ \text{Volume} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since John has 3 boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:
\[ \text{Total Volume} = 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ cubic inches} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 72 \]"
"Let's break down the time Frankie spent watching TV each day:

- Monday and Tuesday: 1 hour each day, so \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours.
- Wednesday: 30 minutes (which is 0.5 hours).
- Thursday: 1 hour for a 1-hour episode and 0.5 hours for a 30-minute episode, so \(1 + 0.5 = 1.5\) hours.
- Friday: 2 hours for two 1-hour episodes.

Now, let's sum up the hours spent watching TV from Monday to Friday:
\[2 \text{ (Monday and Tuesday)} + 0.5 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 1.5 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Friday)} = 6 \text{ hours}\]

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. The difference between the total hours watched and the hours calculated from the given information will be the time spent watching the 30-minute episodes on Wednesday.

\[7 - 6 = 1 \text{ hour}\]

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, the number of 30-minute episodes watched on Wednesday is:
\[1 \div 0.5 = 2\]

So, Frankie watched 2 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry meant to bake as \( x \). According to the problem, he actually baked twice as many as he meant to, plus 15 more cookies. So, the number of cookies he actually baked is \( 2x + 15 \).

After baking, he drops 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \). We know that after dropping 5 cookies, he has a total of 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Next, we subtract 10 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 50 \]

So, Henry meant to bake 50 cookies. Since he actually baked twice as many as he meant to, plus 15 more, we can verify the number of cookies he baked:

\[ 2 \times 50 + 15 = 100 + 15 = 115 \]

After dropping 5 cookies, he has:

\[ 115 - 5 = 110 \]

This confirms that the number of cookies Henry baked last year is indeed 50. The final numerical answer is:

"To find the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate, we first need to calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups each of them ate.

Marcell's fruit roll-ups:
Width: 3 roll-ups
Length: 14 roll-ups
Total for Marcell = 3 * 14 = 42 roll-ups

Beatrice's fruit roll-ups:
Width: 2 roll-ups
Length: 24 roll-ups
Total for Beatrice = 2 * 24 = 48 roll-ups

Now, we add the total number of fruit roll-ups they both ate:
Total roll-ups = 42 + 48 = 90 roll-ups

To find the average, we divide the total number of roll-ups by the number of people (which is 2):
Average = 90 / 2 = 45 roll-ups

The final numerical answer is 45."
"First, let's determine the rate at which the boat is taking on water. The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. Since Julia took 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can calculate the rate of water intake per second.

The rate of water intake per second is:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} \times \frac{1 \text{ second}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{2}{10 \times 16} = \frac{2}{160} = \frac{1}{80} \text{ liters per second} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes Julia to row the entire 64 seconds distance to the shore. Since it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, the total time to row 64 seconds is:
\[ \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds per 20 feet}} = 4 \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we can calculate the total amount of water the boat took on by multiplying the total distance by the rate of water intake:
\[ 80 \text{ feet} \times \frac{1}{80} \text{ liters per foot} = 1 \text{ liter} \]

So, the total amount of water the boat took on by the time Julia reached the shore is:
\[ 1 \text{ liter} \]

"First, let's determine the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold. Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, and Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, we can set up the following equation to find the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold:

\[ 6 \times \text{Number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold} = 1800 \]

Solving for the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold:

\[ \text{Number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold} = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \]

Next, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let's denote the number of birds in Jamal's photograph as \( B \). Therefore, we can write:

\[ 300 = B + 50B \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 300 = 51B \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = \frac{300}{51} = \frac{100}{17} \approx 5.88 \]

Since the number of birds must be a whole number, and given the context of the problem, we can conclude that the number of birds in Jamal's photograph is 5 (as it's the closest whole number that fits the context of the problem).

Therefore, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is:

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the ratio and how it applies to the total amount of sugar and water used.

The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total number of parts in the ratio is 7 + 13 = 20 parts.

Given that the total amount of sugar and water used is 120 parts, we can set up a proportion to find out how many parts of the total are sugar.

The proportion is:
\[ \frac{7}{20} = \frac{\text{number of teaspoons of sugar}}{120} \]

Let's solve for the number of teaspoons of sugar:
\[ \text{number of teaspoons of sugar} = \frac{7}{20} \times 120 \]

\[ \text{number of teaspoons of sugar} = 7 \times 6 \]

\[ \text{number of teaspoons of sugar} = 42 \]

So, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used is 42."

The hospital makes a profit of **$10000 per day**."
"First, we need to determine how many elves quit after children vomit on them. Since a third of the elves quit, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
\]

So, 20 elves quit after children vomit on them. This leaves:

\[
60 - 20 = 40
\]

elves remaining.

Next, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. Therefore, the number of elves left is:

\[
40 - 10 = 30

Now, let's add the total tickets used by Pam and Fred.

Total tickets used by Pam and Fred: \(24 + 36 = 60\) tickets

The final numerical answer is 60."
"First, let's calculate the number of miles Walt walked on Tuesday. Since he walked 6 times as many miles on Tuesday as he did on Monday, and he walked 4 miles on Monday, we can calculate the miles for Tuesday as follows:

\[ \text{Miles on Tuesday} = 6 \times \text{Miles on Monday} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know the total mileage for Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. We can use this information to find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday. We already know the miles for Monday and Tuesday, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Miles on Monday} + \text{Miles on Tuesday} + \text{Miles on Wednesday} = 41 \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ 4 + 24 + \text{Miles on Wednesday} = 41 \]

Now, we solve for the miles Walt walked on Wednesday:

\[ 28 + \text{Miles on Wednesday} = 41 \]
\[ \text{Miles on Wednesday} = 41 - 28 \]
\[ \text{Miles on Wednesday} = 13 \]

So, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 13 \]"
"To calculate the total amount Tom pays in a year for car washes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of car washes Tom gets in a year. Since he gets 4 car washes a month, in a year (which has 12 months), he gets:
   \[
   4 \text{ car washes/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 48 \text{ car washes/year}
   \]

2. Calculate the total cost for the year by multiplying the number of car washes by the cost per car wash. Each car wash costs $15, so:
   \[
   48 \text{ car washes/year} \times 15 \text{ dollars/car wash} = 720 \text{ dollars/year}
   \]

Therefore, the total amount Tom pays in a year for car washes is $720."
"First, let's determine how many video games Brian has after losing 5 of them. Brian originally has 20 video games, but he lost 5, so:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Now, we know that Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian has. Since Brian now has 15 video games, we calculate 3 times that number:

\[ 3 \times 15 = 45 \]

Then, we subtract 5 from this number to find out how many video games Bobby has:

\[ 45 - 5 = 40 \]

So, Bobby has 40 video games."
"To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we first need to determine how many unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands. Given that one third of the 27 unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of Scottish unicorns} = \frac{1}{3} \times 27 = 9
\]

Next, we need to find out how many of these Scottish unicorns are female. Since two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of female Scottish unicorns} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6
\]

Thus, the number of female Scottish unicorns is:

Now, let's add up the cost of the subs, chips, and cookies:
\[ \$15.00 + \$3.00 + \$2.00 = \$20.00 \]

The delivery fee is 20% of the subtotal:
\[ 20\% \times \$20.00 = 0.20 \times \$20.00 = \$4.00 \]

Adding the delivery fee to the subtotal:
\[ \$20.00 + \$4.00 = \$24.00 \]

"First, let's calculate how many questions Mark completed on each test based on the time he had to complete them.

For the first test:
- Total questions: 75
- Rate: 5 questions per hour
- Time available: 8 hours

Questions completed on the first test:
\[ \text{Questions completed} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time available} = 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

Questions left incomplete on the first test:
\[ \text{Incomplete questions} = \text{Total questions} - \text{Questions completed} = 75 - 40 = 35 \]

For the second test:
- Total questions: 100
- Rate: 5 questions per hour
- Time available: 6 hours

Questions completed on the second test:

"First, we need to determine the number of semi-automatic cars. We know there are 20 cars in total, 12 of which are automatic and 4 are manual. Therefore, the number of semi-automatic cars is:

\[ 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 \]

Next, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of the cars that are semi-automatic is 20%."
"Let's denote the number of queens as \( Q \), the number of baby bees as \( B \), and the number of worker bees as \( W \).

According to the problem:
1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so \( W = 2B \).
2. There are twice as many baby bees as queens, so \( B = 2Q \).
3. The total number of bees is 700, so \( W + B + Q = 700 \).

First, we can express \( W \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Q \):
- From \( B = 2Q \), we get \( W = 2B = 2(2Q) = 4Q \).

Now, substituting \( W \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Q \) into the total number of bees equation:
\[ 4Q + 2Q + Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now that we have the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees and worker bees:
- Number of baby bees \( B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200 \).
- Number of worker bees \( W = 4Q = 4(100) = 400 \).

So, the number of worker bees is \( 400 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of nonfood items before tax:
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

Total cost of nonfood items = $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $15

Next, we calculate the tax on the nonfood items. The tax rate is 10%:
Tax = 10% of $15 = 0.10 * $15 = $1.50

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of nonfood items to get the final cost:
Final cost = Total cost of nonfood items + Tax
Final cost = $15 + $1.50 = $16.50

The final numerical answer is $16.50."

"To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of harvests John can have in a year.
2. Determine the total number of pineapples harvested based on the number of harvests.

First, since John harvests his pineapples every 3 months, we need to find out how many 3-month periods there are in a year:
\[ \text{Number of harvests in a year} = \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests} \]

Next, we know that John has 100 pineapples per hectare and he has 10 hectares:
\[ \text{Total pineapples per hectare per harvest} = 100 \]
\[ \text{Total pineapples per hectare per year} = 100 \times 10 = 1000 \]

Since John harvests 4 times a year:
\[ \text{Total pineapples harvested in a year} = 1000 \times 4 = 4000 \]

Therefore, the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year is:
\[ 4000 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of pieces in the second lego set. Since it has 3 times more pieces than the 500-piece set, we multiply 500 by 3:

\[ 500 \times 3 = 1500 \]

Next, we calculate the number of pieces in the third lego set. This set has 1/4 the number of pieces as the 500-piece set, so we divide 500 by 4:

\[ 500 \div 4 = 125 \]

Now, we add up all the pieces from the three sets to find the total number of lego pieces Johnny has to pick up:

\[ 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125 \]

So, the total number of lego pieces Johnny picks up is 2125."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Bees leaving the hive in the first 6 hours:**
   Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.

2. **Bees returning in the next 6 hours:**
   In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the 30 bees that left return. Therefore, the number of bees returning is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \text{ bees}
   \]

3. **Bees leaving the hive in the next 6 hours:**
   In the next 6 hours, Debra sees twice as many bees leave as the number that left in the first 6 hours. Therefore, the number of bees leaving is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ bees}
   \]

4. **Bee returns in the last 6 hours:**
   In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left in the first two 6-hour periods return to the hive. The total number of bees that left in the first two 6-hour periods is:
   \[
   30 \text{ (first 6 hours)} + 60 \text{ (next 6 hours)} = 90 \text{ bees}

   Converting cents to dollars:
   \[
   250 \text{ cents} = 2.50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. For the tricycles: Each tricycle has 3 tires, and each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. Since 3 people came with tricycles, the total cost for the tricycles is:
   \[
   3 \text{ tricycles} \times 3 \text{ tires/tricycle} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 3 \times 3 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 225 \text{ cents}

"To calculate the total hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly class schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the hours he spends on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:
- He has 3 classes each day, and each class is 1 hour long.
- Therefore, each of these days he spends \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours in class.
- Since there are 3 such days (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), the total for these days is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.

Next, let's calculate the hours he spends on Tuesdays and Thursdays:
- He has 2 classes each day, and each class is 2 hours long.
- Therefore, each of these days he spends \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours in class.
- Since there are 2 such days (Tuesday and Thursday), the total for these days is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) hours.

Now, we add the hours from both sets of days to get the total weekly hours:
- Total weekly hours = hours on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday + hours on Tuesday and Thursday
- Total weekly hours = 9 + 8 = 17 hours.

Finally, we multiply the total weekly hours by the number of weeks in the semester:
- Total semester hours = total weekly hours \(\times\) number of weeks
- Total semester hours = 17 \(\times\) 16 = 272 hours.

Thus, Kimo spends 272 hours attending classes in one semester."
"First, let's convert all the lengths to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll use inches for this purpose.

Each roll is 4 inches long, and Bill bakes 300 rolls every day. So, the total length of the rolls in inches is:
\[ 300 \text{ rolls} \times 4 \text{ inches/roll} = 1200 \text{ inches} \]

Each croissant is 6 inches long, and Bill bakes 120 croissants every day. So, the total length of the croissants in inches is:
\[ 120 \text{ croissants} \times 6 \text{ inches/croissant} = 720 \text{ inches} \]

Each baguette is 2 feet long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is:
\[ 2 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 24 \text{ inches} \]
Bill bakes 60 baguettes every day. So, the total length of the baguettes in inches is:
\[ 60 \text{ baguettes} \times 24 \text{ inches/baguette} = 1440 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we add the lengths of all the baked goods in inches:
\[ 1200 \text{ inches} + 720 \text{ inches} + 1440 \text{ inches} = 3360 \text{ inches} \]

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[ \frac{3360 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 280 \text{ feet} \]

So, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is 280 feet."
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order to last for 2 months, we first need to calculate the total number of bananas required by each type of ape per month and then multiply by 2.

- Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
- Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
- Baboons need 100 bananas per month.

First, we calculate the total number of bananas needed per month for all the apes:
\[ 200 \text{ (monkeys)} + 400 \text{ (gorillas)} + 100 \text{ (baboons)} = 700 \text{ bananas per month} \]

Since the zookeeper needs to order enough bananas to last for 2 months, we multiply the monthly total by 2:
\[ 700 \text{ bananas per month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 1400 \text{ bananas} \]

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance each person runs and then compare the distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs:
- Blake runs back and forth 15 times.
- Each round trip is 200 yards (100 yards to the end and 100 yards back).
- Total distance for Blake = 15 * 200 yards = 3000 yards.

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs:
- Kelly runs back and forth once, covering 200 yards.
- Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards (40 yards to the 40-yard line and 40 yards back).
- Total distance for Kelly = 200 yards + 80 yards * 34 = 200 + 2720 = 2920 yards.

Now, we compare the distances:
- Blake runs 3000 yards.
- Kelly runs 2920 yards.

The difference in distance is:
- 3000 yards - 2920 yards = 80 yards.

The winner runs 80 yards farther than the loser."

2. Calculate the depth of the water on Wednesday based on the depth on Tuesday.

First, we know the depth of the water on Monday is 17 feet. On Tuesday, the depth increased by 7 feet:
\[ \text{Depth on Tuesday} = 17 + 7 = 24 \text{ feet} \]

Next, on Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday:
\[ \text{Depth on Wednesday} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ feet} \]

So, the tank’s water depth on Wednesday is:
\[ 16 \text{ feet} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of each type of fish caught by Locsin:

- Starfish: Anakin caught 10 starfish, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.
- Sea horses: Anakin caught 6 sea horses, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
- Clownfish: Anakin caught 3 clownfish, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's add up the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin:

- Starfish: 10 (Anakin) + 5 (Locsin) = 15 starfish.
- Sea horses: 6 (Anakin) + 3 (Locsin) = 9 sea horses.
- Clownfish: 3 (Anakin) + 5 (Locsin) = 8 clownfish.

Finally, the total number of fish caught is the sum of the starfish, sea horses, and clownfish:

15 (starfish) + 9 (sea horses) + 8 (clownfish) = 32 fish.

So, the final numerical answer is 32."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the price increase step by step over the 36 months. The price increases by 20% every two months. Let's break it down:

2. **Price after 2 months**: The price increases by 20% of $20.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 20 \times \frac{20}{100} = 4
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 20 + 4 = 24
   \]
3. **Price after 4 months**: The price increases by 20% of $24.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 24 \times \frac{20}{100} = 4.8
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 24 + 4.8 = 28.8
   \]
4. **Price after 6 months**: The price increases by 20% of $28.8.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 28.8 \times \frac{20}{100} = 5.76
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 28.8 + 5.76 = 34.56
   \]
5. **Price after 8 months**: The price increases by 20% of $34.56.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 34.56 \times \frac{20}{100} = 6.912
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 34.56 + 6.912 = 41.472
   \]
6. **Price after 10 months**: The price increases by 20% of $41.472.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 41.472 \times \frac{20}{100} = 8.2944
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 41.472 + 8.2944 = 49.7664
   \]
7. **Price after 12 months**: The price increases by 20% of $49.7664.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 49.7664 \times \frac{20}{100} = 9.95328
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 49.7664 + 9.95328 = 59.71968
   \]

We can see that the price increases by 20% every two months. Since 36 months is equivalent to 18 two-month periods, we can generalize the price after 36 months as follows:

\[
\text{Price after 36 months} = 20 \times (1 + \frac{20}{100})^{18}
\]

\[
\text{Price after 36 months} = 20 \times (1.2)^{18}
\]

Now, we calculate \( (1.2)^{18} \):

\[
(1.2)^{18} \approx 10.488
\]

\[
\text{Price after 36 months} = 20 \times 10.488 \approx 209.76
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{209.76}
\]"
"First, let's determine the cost of one red car. We know that one red car costs $4 and that one red car is worth as much as 3 action figures. Therefore, the cost of 3 action figures is $4. Since one action figure costs $5, we can confirm that 3 action figures cost $15 (because 3 * $5 = $15).

Now, we know that one red car costs $4 and that the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, which is $15. So, the doll costs $15.

Next, we calculate the total cost of all the toys:
- The cost of 5 red cars is 5 * $4 = $20.
- The cost of 3 action figures is $15.
- The cost of the doll is $15.

Adding these together, the total cost of all the toys is $20 + $15 + $15 = $50.

Therefore, the total worth of all the toys is $50."
"First, we need to determine the missed income if Jackie does her taxes herself. She loses $35/hour for 3 fewer hours of freelance work. So, the missed income is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Missed Income} = 3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105 \]

Next, we need to find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant. The accountant charges $90, which is the amount she would lose by doing her own taxes. Therefore, if she hires the accountant, she will have $90 more.

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$90 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the computer accessories Elvira bought:

- Screen: €1090
- Keyboard and mouse: €157
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Total cost = €1090 + €157 + €157 + €74 + €102

Now, let's add these amounts:

Total cost = €1090 + €157 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1580

Elvira's budget is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost of the accessories from her budget:

Money left = €1500 - €1580

Since the total cost of the accessories exceeds her budget, she will not have any money left for her clothing. In fact, she will be short by:

Shortage = €1580 - €1500 = €80

So, the final numerical answer is:
-€80"
"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit to make 15 Spanish flans, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs required.

Each flan requires 3 eggs, so for 15 flans, the total number of eggs needed is:
\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Sandra receives 9 eggs each time she babysits. To find out how many times she needs to babysit to get 45 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she receives per babysitting session:
\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysitting sessions} \]

Thus, Sandra has to babysit 5 times to make 15 Spanish flans."
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write:
\[ S = 2B \]

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write:
\[ (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \]

Substituting \( S = 2B \) into the equation, we get:
\[ (B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28 \]
\[ 3B + 4 = 28 \]

Subtract 4 from both sides:
\[ 3B = 24 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ B = 8 \]

Now, we can find Seth's current age using \( S = 2B \):
\[ S = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 16 \]"
"First, let's determine twice the amount of money Ethel has. Since Ethel has $8, twice that amount is:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Jimmy has $2 more than this amount. Therefore, Jimmy has:

\[ 16 + 2 = 18 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 18 \]"
"To calculate the total miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to consider his daily walking distance and the number of days he walks that distance.

From Monday to Friday, he walks 20 miles each day. So for 5 days, he walks:
\[ 20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles} \]

On Saturday and Sunday, he walks 10 miles each day. So for 2 days, he walks:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Adding these together gives the total miles walked in a week:
\[ 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 120 \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of each item:
- The cost of the hat is $25.
- The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat, so it is \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.
- The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket. The average is calculated as \(\frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50\) dollars.

Now, to find the total cost of each uniform, we add the cost of the hat, the jacket, and the pants:
\[ 25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \]

So, the total cost of each uniform is $150."
"To find the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to calculate the legs from each group of creatures separately and then sum them up.

For the spiders:
\[ 80 \text{ spiders} \times 8 \text{ legs per spider} = 640 \text{ legs} \]

For the insects:
\[ 90 \text{ insects} \times 6 \text{ legs per insect} = 540 \text{ legs} \]

For the rare mutant invertebrates:
\[ 3 \text{ invertebrates} \times 10 \text{ legs per invertebrate} = 30 \text{ legs} \]

Now, we add the legs from all groups together:
\[ 640 \text{ legs} + 540 \text{ legs} + 30 \text{ legs} = 1210 \text{ legs} \]

So, the total number of legs Jake sees is:
\[ 1210 \]"
"First, let's establish the ages based on the information given:

1. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, we can calculate the total age of the four birds:

\[
\text{Total age} = \text{Age of Caboose} + \text{Age of Sally Two} + \text{Age of Granny Red} + \text{Age of Sally Four}
\]

Since the age of the Caboose is not specified, we will assume it is 0 for the purpose of calculating the total age of the birds.

\[
\text{Total age} = 0 + 19 + 16 + 8 = 43
\]

The total age of the four birds is 43."
"To calculate the total amount Jessica pays in a year if she pays 50% more than the minimum, we first need to find out the amount she pays each month and then multiply that by 12 (the number of months in a year).

The minimum payments are:
- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

First, we calculate 50% more than the minimum payment for each debt:
- Student loans: $300 + (0.5 * $300) = $300 + $150 = $450/month
- Credit card: $200 + (0.5 * $200) = $200 + $100 = $300/month
- Mortgage: $500 + (0.5 * $500) = $500 + $250 = $750/month

Next, we add these amounts to find the total monthly payment:
- Total monthly payment = $450 + $300 + $750 = $1500/month

Finally, we calculate the total payment for a year:
- Total yearly payment = $1500/month * 12 months = $18000

So, the final numerical answer is $18000."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Billy spends on peeling and cutting the potatoes.

First, let's determine the time spent on peeling the potatoes:
- Billy takes 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.
- He has 60 potatoes to peel.
- Therefore, the total time spent peeling is \( 60 \times 1.5 \) minutes.

Next, let's determine the time spent on cutting the potatoes:
- Billy takes 5 seconds to cut one potato.
- He has 60 potatoes to cut.
- Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, 5 seconds is \( \frac{5}{60} \) minutes, which simplifies to \( \frac{1}{12} \) minutes.
- Therefore, the total time spent cutting is \( 60 \times \frac{1}{12} \) minutes.

Now, let's calculate the total time spent peeling and cutting:
- Total time spent peeling: \( 60 \times 1.5 = 90 \) minutes.
- Total time spent cutting: \( 60 \times \frac{1}{12} = 5 \) minutes.

Finally, we add the two times together to get the total time:
- Total time = 90 minutes (peeling) + 5 minutes (cutting) = 95 minutes.

The final numerical answer is 95 minutes."
"First, let's determine the total revenue and cost to find the profit.

They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, so the revenue per gallon is:
\[ 20 \text{ glasses/gallon} \times \$0.50/\text{glass} = \$10/\text{gallon} \]

The cost per gallon is the sum of the cost of lemons and sugar:
\[ \$3 \text{ (lemons)} + \$2 \text{ (sugar)} = \$5/\text{gallon} \]

The profit per gallon is the revenue minus the cost:
\[ \$10/\text{gallon} - \$5/\text{gallon} = \$5/\text{gallon} \]

Given that their total profit is $25, we can determine the number of gallons they sold:
\[ \text{Number of gallons} = \frac{\$25}{\$5/\text{gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of lemons for 5 gallons:
\[ \text{Total cost of lemons} = 5 \text{ gallons} \times \$3/\text{gallon} = \$15 \]

So, the amount they spent on lemons is:
\[ \$15 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 15 \]"
"First, let's find out how many Asians were Chinese. We know there were 240 Asians in total and 80 were Japanese. So, the number of Chinese Asians is:

240 Asians - 80 Japanese Asians = 160 Chinese Asians

We are also given that there were 60 boys on the Chinese team. Since the rest of the team members were girls, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of Chinese Asians:

160 Chinese Asians - 60 boys = 100 girls

So, the number of girls on the Chinese team is 100."
"To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount Zaid spends on rent.
2. Calculate the amount Zaid spends on car fuel.
3. Calculate the remaining amount after rent and car fuel.
4. Calculate the amount donated to charity.
5. Calculate the remaining amount after the donation.
6. Subtract the amounts given to his daughter and wife from the remaining amount.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Zaid spends \( \frac{1}{4} \) of his salary on rent. Since his salary is 6000$, the rent is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Zaid spends \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his salary on car fuel. The amount spent on car fuel is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. The remaining amount after rent and car fuel is:
   \[
   6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity. The donation amount is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. The remaining amount after the donation is:
   \[
   2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. Zaid gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$. The total amount given to his daughter and wife is:
   \[
   200 + 700 = 900 \text{ dollars}
   \]

7. The remaining amount after giving money to his daughter and wife is:
   \[
   1250 - 900 = 350 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{350}

"First, let's determine the number of crabs each person has:

Bo has 40 crabs.

Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ crabs} \]

Rani has ten more crabs than Monic, so Rani has:
\[ 36 + 10 = 46 \text{ crabs} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of crabs the three have together:
\[ 40 + 36 + 46 = 122 \]

The total number of crabs the three have together is 122."
"To calculate Lloyd's earnings for the first two weeks, we need to add the earnings from each week.

For the first week, he earned:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$10 \text{ per hour} = \$50 \]

For the second week, he earned:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times \$10 \text{ per hour} = \$80 \]

Adding the earnings from both weeks:
\[ \$50 + \$80 = \$130 \]

So, Lloyd earned a total of \$130 for the first two weeks."
"To determine the number of votes the loser received, we first need to calculate the number of votes the winner received.

The winner received \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total votes. Given that the total number of votes cast was 80, we can calculate the number of votes the winner received as follows:

\[ \text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 \]

\[ \text{Votes for the winner} = 60 \]

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser received is the total votes minus the votes the winner received:

\[ \text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 \]

\[ \text{Votes for the loser} = 20 \]

So, the number of votes the loser got is 20."
"Let's denote the number of white carnations Sandra ordered as \( C \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, so the number of red roses is \( 4C \).
2. Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which are five times the number of white carnations, so \( 5C = 200 \).

First, we solve for \( C \) using the second piece of information:
\[ 5C = 200 \]
\[ C = \frac{200}{5} \]
\[ C = 40 \]

Now that we know \( C = 40 \), we can find the number of red roses:
\[ \text{Number of red roses} = 4C = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 160 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Mark's age two years ago:**
   - Jan's current age is 30.
   - Two years ago, Jan's age was \(30 - 2 = 28\).
   - Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time.
   - Half of Jan's age two years ago was \(\frac{28}{2} = 14\).
   - Therefore, Mark's age two years ago was \(14 + 5 = 19\).

2. **Determine Mark's current age:**
   - Since Mark was 19 two years ago, his current age is \(19 + 2 = 21\).

3. **Determine Jean's current age:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark.
   - Therefore, Jean's current age is \(21 + 2 = 23\).

The final numerical answer is 23."
"First, let's calculate the total time for the faster team to complete the race. Since each member of the faster team runs their leg in 55 seconds, the total time for the race is:

\[ 55 \text{ seconds/runner} \times 4 \text{ runners} = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time for the slower team to complete the race. The first runner takes 60 seconds, the second runner takes 57 seconds (3 seconds less than the first), the third runner takes 54 seconds (3 seconds less than the second), and the fourth runner takes 51 seconds (3 seconds less than the third). The total time for the race is:

\[ 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, to find out how many seconds the faster team will win by, we subtract the total time of the faster team from the total time of the slower team:

\[ 222 \text{ seconds} - 220 \text{ seconds} = 2 \text{ seconds} \]

The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two independent events and then compare them.

First, let's determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

\[ P(\text{number greater than 3}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Next, let's determine the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:

\[ P(\text{even on first roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also:

\[ P(\text{even on second roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since these are independent events, the probability of both events happening (rolling two even numbers in a row) is the product of their individual probabilities:

\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25 \]

Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row. This is calculated by finding the difference in their probabilities and then converting that difference to a percentage:

\[ \text{Difference in probabilities} = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 \]

To express this difference as a percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage difference} = 0.25 \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, rolling a number greater than 3 is 25% more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 25\% \]"
"If Jenna's mother picked 20 apples, and Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother, then Jenna picked:

\[ \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ apples} \]

Together, they picked:

\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ apples} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 30."
"Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as \( r \).

From the problem, we know:
- There are 3 cages of rats, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is \( 3r \times 6 = 18r \).
- There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \).
- There are 20 pieces of straw distributed among the rabbits.

The total number of pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents is given as 160. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 18r + 50 + 20 = 160 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 18r + 70 = 160 \]

Subtract 70 from both sides:
\[ 18r = 90 \]

Divide both sides by 18:
\[ r = 5 \]

So, the number of rats in each cage is \( 5 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"To calculate the total amount Mandy should pay back to Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we can use the simple interest formula:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + (\text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}) \]

Where:
- Principal = $100
- Rate = 2% per month = 0.02
- Time = 3 months

Let's calculate the interest first:

\[ \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} = 100 \times 0.02 \times 3 = 6 \]

Now, we add the interest to the principal to find the total amount:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} = 100 + 6 = 106 \]

So, Mandy should give Benedict $106."
"Let's denote the number of bags the trader bought as \( x \).

The cost per bag includes the purchase price and the transportation cost, which is \( 20 + 2 = 22 \) dollars per bag.

The total cost for \( x \) bags is \( 22x \).

The selling price per bag is $30, so the total revenue from selling \( x \) bags is \( 30x \).

The trader made a total profit of $400, which means the total revenue minus the total cost equals $400. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 30x - 22x = 400 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 8x = 400 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 8:

\[ x = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 50 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food:

The cost of the tickets is $20.25.

The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, so:
\[ \text{Cost of food} = 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Next, we add the cost of the tickets and the cost of the food to find the total cost of the tickets and food:
\[ \text{Total cost of tickets and food} = 20.25 + 15.75 = 36.00 \]

Now, we add the cost of the rides. They went on 2 rides, each costing $33:
\[ \text{Total cost of rides} = 2 \times 33 = 66 \]

The total cost for all expenses is the sum of the cost of tickets and food and the cost of the rides:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 36.00 + 66 = 102.00 \]

Since they agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:
\[ \text{Cost per person} = \frac{102.00}{3} = 34.00 \]

So, each of them paid:
\[ \boxed{34.00} \]"
"To determine the total number of peaches John collects, we need to calculate the product of the number of minutes he works and the number of peaches he collects per minute.

John works for 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total number of minutes he works is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

John collects 2 peaches per minute. Therefore, the total number of peaches he collects is:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \times 2 \text{ peaches/minute} = 360 \text{ peaches} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 360 \]"
"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ten ducks need per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of insects needed per day for one duck.
2. Multiply the daily amount needed for one duck by the number of ducks in the flock.

First, we know that the total amount of insects needed per week for one duck is 3.5 pounds. Therefore, the amount needed per day for one duck is:
\[ \frac{3.5 \text{ pounds}}{7 \text{ days}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per day} \]

Now, for a flock of ten ducks, the total amount of insects needed per day is:
\[ 0.5 \text{ pounds per day per duck} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 5 \text{ pounds per day} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the net increase in trees each year**: Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees, so the net increase is \(10 - 2 = 8\) trees per year.

2. **Calculate the total number of trees after 10 years without considering the trees that die**: Starting with 50 trees, after 10 years, the number of trees would be \(50 + 8 \times 10 = 50 + 80 = 130\) trees.

3. **Calculate the number of trees that die after 10 years**: 30% of the trees die, so the number of trees that die is \(0.30 \times 130 = 39\) trees.

4. **Calculate the number of trees left after the trees die**: Subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees after 10 years. So, \(130 - 39 = 91\) trees.

The final number of trees Tom has left after 10 years is 91."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of pink flamingos on Friday morning:** 18

2. **On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos and painted them white:**
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \)
   - So, 6 pink flamingos were taken back and painted white.

3. **Number of pink flamingos left on Friday morning after the prank:**
   - \( 18 - 6 = 12 \)

4. **On Saturday morning, the neighbors put the 6 white flamingos back out:**
   - So, the total number of flamingos on Saturday morning is \( 12 + 6 = 18 \)

5. **On Sunday morning, they added another 18 pink flamingos:**
   - Total number of flamingos on Sunday morning is \( 18 + 18 = 36 \)

6. **Number of white flamingos on Sunday morning:**
   - Since 6 white flamingos were added on Sunday, the total number of white flamingos is 6.

7. **Calculate the difference between the number of pink flamingos and white flamingos on Sunday morning:**
   - Number of pink flamingos: 36
   - Number of white flamingos: 6
   - Difference: \( 36 - 6 = 30 \)

Therefore, at noon on Sunday, there were 30 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos."
"Violetta needs crayons in 5 different colors, and each crayon costs $2. Therefore, the total cost for 5 crayons is 5 * $2 = $10. Violetta prepared $20 for this purchase. The change she will get is $20 - $10 = $10."
"First, let's determine the cost of a pen. Since a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined, we add the cost of a pencil and an eraser:

Cost of a pencil = $1.20
Cost of an eraser = $0.30

Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser
Cost of a pen = $1.20 + $0.30
Cost of a pen = $1.50

Now, to find out how much 8 pens will cost, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8:

Cost of 8 pens = Cost of a pen * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $1.50 * 8
Cost of 8 pens = $12.00

Therefore, the final numerical answer is $12.00."
"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we first need to calculate the total amount of carrots distributed to the restaurants and then subtract this from the initial amount.

Each of the 40 restaurants receives 2 pounds of carrots. Therefore, the total amount of carrots distributed is:
\[ 40 \text{ restaurants} \times 2 \text{ pounds/restaurant} = 80 \text{ pounds} \]

The initial amount of carrots is 200 pounds. The amount of carrots that will not be used is:
\[ 200 \text{ pounds} - 80 \text{ pounds} = 120 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 120 \]"
"To find the number of children in Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

Total population = 23786
Number of men = 8417
Number of women = 9092

Number of children = Total population - (Number of men + Number of women)

Let's calculate the number of children.
```plaintext
Number of children = 23786 - (8417 + 9092)
                  = 23786 - 17509

The number of children in Soda is 6277."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of Pokemon cards Elaine collected each month and then sum them up with her initial number of cards.

1. **Initial number of cards**: Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.

2. **First month collection**: She collected three times the number of cards she initially had.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ cards}
   \]

3. **Second month collection**: She collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40 \text{ cards}
   \]

4. **Third month collection**: She collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months.
   \[
   2 \times (60 + 40) = 2 \times 100 = 200 \text{ cards}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the cards collected over the three months and add them to her initial number of cards:
\[
20 \text{ (initial)} + 60 \text{ (first month)} + 40 \text{ (second month)} + 200 \text{ (third month)} = 320 \text{ cards}
\]

So, the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now is:

"First, let's determine how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher each week. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers and a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits:

\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher A} \]
\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher B} \]

Next, we know that Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, the amount Mark earns from Publisher A each week is:

\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays:

\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10 \text{ cents/sentence} \]

Therefore, the amount Mark earns from Publisher B each week is:

\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

Adding the earnings from both publishers gives the total amount Mark makes in a week:

\[ 2500 \text{ cents} + 5000 \text{ cents} = 7500 \text{ cents} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 7500 \]"
"To find out how many liters of water Baldur gets every day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pails of water he gets in a day.
2. Multiply the total number of pails by the number of liters each pail contains.

First, let's calculate the total number of pails of water he gets in a day:
- In the morning, he gets 5 pails.
- In the afternoon, he gets 6 pails.
- Therefore, the total number of pails in a day is \(5 + 6 = 11\) pails.

Next, we know that each pail contains 5 liters of water. So, the total number of liters of water he gets in a day is:
- \(11 \text{ pails} \times 5 \text{ liters/pail} = 55 \text{ liters}\).

Thus, the total number of liters of water Baldur gets every day is 55 liters."
"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to consider both his weekly salary and the one-time reward from the award, as well as the annual raise.

First, let's calculate his annual salary before the raise:
- John makes $2000 per week.
- There are 52 weeks in a year.

\[ \text{Annual Salary Before Raise} = 2000 \times 52 = 104000 \]

Next, we apply the 5% raise to his annual salary:
\[ \text{Raise Amount} = 104000 \times 0.05 = 5200 \]
\[ \text{Annual Salary After Raise} = 104000 + 5200 = 109200 \]

Now, we add the one-time reward from the award:
\[ \text{Total Annual Earnings} = 109200 + 5000 = 114200 \]

So, the total amount of money John made that year is:
\[ 114200 \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total tons of grapes produced per year. Josie has 10 acres and each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year. Therefore, the total tons of grapes produced per year is:

\[ 10 \text{ acres} \times 5 \text{ tons/acre} = 50 \text{ tons} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total barrels of wine produced from these tons of grapes. Each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine. Therefore, the total barrels of wine produced per year is:

\[ 50 \text{ tons} \times 2 \text{ barrels/ton} = 100 \text{ barrels} \]

So, the total number of barrels of wine produced per year is:

\[ 100 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Sandwiches for lunch:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 5 days.
   - Each sandwich uses 2 slices of cheese.
   - Total slices of cheese used for sandwiches = 5 days * 2 slices/day = 10 slices.

2. **Omelets for breakfast:**
   - Carl ate omelets 3 days in the week.
   - He used 1 more slice of cheese per omelet than he did per sandwich.
   - Since each sandwich uses 2 slices, each omelet uses 2 + 1 = 3 slices of cheese.
   - Total slices of cheese used for omelets = 3 days * 3 slices/day = 9 slices.

3. **Macaroni and cheese for dinner:**
   - Carl used 8 slices of cheese for the big dish of macaroni and cheese.

Now, we sum up all the slices of cheese used:
- Sandwiches: 10 slices
- Omelets: 9 slices
- Macaroni and cheese: 8 slices

Total slices of cheese used = 10 + 9 + 8 = 27 slices.

The final numerical answer is 27."

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, given that Mr. Bert will remove the lowest score from the average.

First, let's calculate the sum of the scores of the first five tests:
\[ 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 440 \]

Let \( x \) be the score on the sixth test. The sum of all six test scores would then be:
\[ 440 + x \]

Mr. Bert will remove the lowest score from the average. To find the average of the remaining five scores, we need to consider the lowest score among the first five tests. The lowest score among 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86 is 71. Therefore, the average of the remaining five scores will be:
\[ \frac{440 + x - 71}{5} = \frac{369 + x}{5} \]

We want this average to be 93:
\[ \frac{369 + x}{5} = 93 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ 369 + x = 93 \times 5 \]
\[ 369 + x = 465 \]
\[ x = 465 - 369 \]
\[ x = 96 \]

Therefore, Brinley needs a score of 96 on her sixth test to get an average of 93. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the first four weeks and the next three weeks.

**First Four Weeks:**
- Micheal rides 5 times a week.
- Each ride is 25 kilometers.
- Total kilometers per week = 5 rides/week * 25 kilometers/ride = 125 kilometers/week.
- Total kilometers for 4 weeks = 4 weeks * 125 kilometers/week = 500 kilometers.

**Next Three Weeks:**
- Micheal rides 2 times a week.
- Each ride is 60 kilometers.
- Total kilometers per week = 2 rides/week * 60 kilometers/ride = 120 kilometers/week.
- Total kilometers for 3 weeks = 3 weeks * 120 kilometers/week = 360 kilometers.

**Total Kilometers:**
- Total kilometers = Kilometers from the first four weeks + Kilometers from the next three weeks.
- Total kilometers = 500 kilometers + 360 kilometers = 860 kilometers.

The final numerical answer is 860 kilometers."
"First, let's determine the weight of each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs:

\[ \text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{\text{Weight of each chocolate bar}}{2} = \frac{40g}{2} = 20g \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples:

\[ \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40g = 1000g \]
\[ \text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20g = 1600g \]

Finally, we add the total weights of the chocolate bars and the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:

\[ \text{Total weight of Joe's bag of candy} = 1000g + 1600g = 2600g \]

The total number of cakes she bought after all three days is \(4 + 12 + 60 = 76\) cakes."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates:

Half a dozen plates = 6 plates
Cost per plate = $6000
Total cost for half a dozen plates = 6 * $6000 = $36000

Now, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than $36000. Let's calculate the cost of twenty dozen cups:

Cost of twenty dozen cups = $36000 - $1200 = $34800

Now, we need to find the cost of one cup. Since twenty dozen cups is equal to 240 cups, we can calculate the cost of one cup by dividing the total cost of twenty dozen cups by 240:

Cost of one cup = $34800 / 240 = $145

The final numerical answer is $145."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate how much money Sara earns from babysitting:
- She earns $5 each time she babysits, and she babysits 4 times, so she earns \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars from babysitting.

Now, let's calculate how much money Sara earns from mowing the lawn:
- She earns $4 each time she mows the lawn.

Let's denote the number of times Sara needs to mow the lawn as \(x\). The total amount of money Sara will have after mowing the lawn is her initial savings plus the money she earns from babysitting plus the money she earns from mowing the lawn. This can be expressed as:
\[10 + 20 + 4x\]

We need this total to be at least equal to the cost of the jacket and shoes, which is $70. So, we set up the following equation:
\[10 + 20 + 4x \geq 70\]

Simplifying the left side of the inequality:
\[30 + 4x \geq 70\]

Subtract 30 from both sides:
\[4x \geq 40\]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[x \geq 10\]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn at least 10 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes. The final numerical answer is:
\[10\]"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \). According to the problem, the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs every day. Additionally, it is given that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which can be expressed as:

\[ w = r + 2 \]

The total number of eggs collected each day can be expressed as:

\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Now, substitute \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation \( 3r + 5w = 42 \):

\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 8r = 32 \]

Divide both sides by 8:

\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens. To verify, we can calculate the number of white chickens and the total eggs collected:

\[ w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \]

Total eggs collected per day:

\[ 3r + 5w = 3(4) + 5(6) = 12 + 30 = 42 \]

The calculations confirm that the solution is correct. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"To calculate the time Gary spends walking, we first need to determine the perimeter of the park. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park are 1.5 miles by 6 miles, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (1.5 + 6) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \( t \) it takes to walk a certain distance \( d \) at a speed \( v \) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Substituting the distance (15 miles) and the speed (3 miles/hour) into the formula:

\[ t = \frac{15}{3} \]
\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park."
"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of customers on the second day:
   - The number of customers on the second day is 50 more than the first day.
   - The first day had 100 customers.
   - Therefore, the second day had \(100 + 50 = 150\) customers.

2. Calculate the total number of customers over the first two days:
   - The total number of customers on the first two days is \(100 + 150 = 250\).

3. Determine the number of customers on the third day:
   - The total number of customers over the three days is 500.
   - Therefore, the number of customers on the third day is \(500 - 250 = 250\).

So, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is 250."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. 

Given that both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( S - 4 \times 4 = S - 16 \) gallons, and the big pool had \( B - 4 \times 4 = B - 16 \) gallons. According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, so we can write the equation:
\[ B - 16 = 2(S - 16) \]
Simplifying this equation:
\[ B - 16 = 2S - 32 \]
\[ B = 2S - 16 \]

Now, the current amounts of water in the pools are \( S \) for the small pool and \( B \) for the big pool. The problem states that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool, so we can write the equation:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have two equations:
1. \( B = 2S - 16 \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

We can set these two equations equal to each other to solve for \( S \):
\[ 2S - 16 = 4S \]
\[ -16 = 2S \]
\[ S = -8 \]

Since the amount of water cannot be negative, we need to recheck the setup. The correct interpretation should be that the current amount of water in the big pool is four times the current amount of water in the small pool, and the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago. Let's solve it again with the correct interpretation:

From \( B = 4S \), we substitute into the first equation:
\[ 4S = 2S - 16 \]
\[ 2S = -16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the current amount of water in the small pool is \( S = 8 \) gallons.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to make her purchase, we first need to calculate the total cost of the pair of shoes and the matching belt.

Total cost = Cost of shoes + Cost of belt
Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00
Total cost = $352.00

Lori earns $8.00 per hour. To find out how many hours she needs to work, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage.

Hours needed = Total cost / Hourly wage
Hours needed = $352.00 / $8.00
Hours needed = 44

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She promised to return the principal amount plus an additional 10% of the principal amount. The principal amount is $2000.

The additional amount is 10% of $2000, which is:
\[ 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

So, the total amount to be returned is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Janeth is paying $165 per month for 12 months. The total amount she will pay over 12 months is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we need to find out how much of the total amount she promised to return she has paid after 12 months. This is $1980. Therefore, her remaining balance is:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance by the end of 12 months will be:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack, and then calculate their ages in three years. Finally, we will find the average of their ages at that time.

Given:
- Harriet's current age = 21 years
- Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age.
- Harriet's age is half of Zack's age.

First, let's find Adrian's current age:
\[ \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years} \]

Next, let's find Zack's current age:
\[ \text{Harriet's age} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Zack's age} \]
\[ 21 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Zack's age} \]
\[ \text{Zack's age} = 21 \times 2 = 42 \text{ years} \]

Now, let's calculate their ages in three years:
- Adrian's age in three years: \( 63 + 3 = 66 \)
- Harriet's age in three years: \( 21 + 3 = 24 \)
- Zack's age in three years: \( 42 + 3 = 45 \)

Finally, we find the average age of the three in three years:

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna, and then subtract the points scored by Naomi and Yuri from the total points.

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. So, Yuri's score is \(\frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44\) points.
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna's score is \(68 + 17 = 85\) points.

Now, let's add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[68 + 44 + 85 = 197\]

The total points scored by the four students is 251. So, the points scored by Jojo can be found by subtracting the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points:
\[251 - 197 = 54\]

Therefore, Jojo scored 54 points.

2. **Travel by Car**: The travel by car takes half as many days as the bus trip. Therefore, the travel by car takes \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) days.
3. **Return Trip**: If Andrew returns from Rochester by car, the return trip will also take 3 days.

Now, to find the total number of days Andrew will travel:
- Travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus: 6 days
- Return from Rochester to New Jersey by car: 3 days

Adding these together:
\[ 6 + 3 = 9 \]

So, the total number of days Andrew will travel is 9 days."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cards James has after the changes:

- Initial fire type cards: 30
- Initial grass type cards: 20
- Initial water type cards: 40

After losing 8 water type cards:
- Water type cards left: 40 - 8 = 32

After buying 14 new grass type cards:
- Grass type cards now: 20 + 14 = 34

Now, the total number of cards James has is:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 34
- Water type: 32

So, the total number of cards is:
30 + 34 + 32 = 96

The number of water type cards left is 32. To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 = 0.3333 \times 100 = 33.33\% \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33%.

The final numerical answer is:
33"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the burrito with all the additions and the upgrade:

- Base burrito: $6.50
- Extra meat: $2.00
- Extra cheese: $1.00
- Avocado: $1.00
- 2 sauces at $0.25 each: $0.25 * 2 = $0.50

Adding these together:
\[ 6.50 + 2.00 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 0.50 = 11.00 \]

Now, adding the upgrade cost:
\[ 11.00 + 3.00 = 14.00 \]

Chad has a gift card worth $5.00, so we subtract this from the total:
\[ 14.00 - 5.00 = 9.00 \]

Therefore, Chad still owes:

"First, let's determine the combined rate at which Kalinda and her mom can place pieces on the puzzle.

Kalinda's rate is 4 pieces per minute.
Her mom's rate is half of Kalinda's rate, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

Combined, they can place \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces per minute.

The total number of pieces in the puzzle is 360.

To find the total time in minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate:
\[ \text{Time in minutes} = \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
\[ \text{Time in hours} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1 \]"
"First, let's calculate how many watermelons were ready for harvest after the first two months. Since 30% of the 120 watermelons were ready, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Ready for harvest} = 120 \times \frac{30}{100} = 120 \times 0.30 = 36 \]

So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest and Ashlyn took them home. This means the number of watermelons remaining after the first harvest is:

\[ \text{Remaining} = 120 - 36 = 84 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest two weeks later. Since 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready, we calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Ready for harvest after two weeks} = 84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 84 \times 0.75 = 63 \]

So, 63 watermelons were ready for harvest after the two weeks. This means the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:

\[ \text{Not ready} = 84 - 63 = 21 \]

Therefore, the number of melons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is 21."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the cars before tax and registration:
Cost of 12 cars = 12 * $20,000 = $240,000

Next, we calculate the tax on the cars:
Tax on cars = 10% of $240,000 = 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000

Now, we add the tax to the cost of the cars to get the total cost before registration:
Total cost before registration = $240,000 + $24,000 = $264,000

Then, we add the registration cost for all 12 cars:
Registration cost = 12 * $1,000 = $12,000

Finally, we add the registration cost to the total cost before registration to get the final amount Mark pays:
Total amount paid = $264,000 + $12,000 = $276,000

The final numerical answer is $276,000."
"On Monday, Robert collects 20 shells. Since Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, Kylie collects 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. Therefore, the number of shells Kylie collects on Tuesday is 25 * 2 = 50 shells.

The final numerical answer is 50."
"If there were 50 ants and Dax found half as many bugs as ants, then the number of bugs is:

\[ \text{Number of bugs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of ants} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \]

To find the total number of insects in the garden, we add the number of ants and the number of bugs:

\[ \text{Total number of insects} = \text{Number of ants} + \text{Number of bugs} = 50 + 25 = 75 \]

So, the total number of insects in the garden is:

\[ 75 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many penguins jump into the ocean.
2. Determine how many penguins go into the cave.
3. Subtract the number of penguins that went into the ocean and the cave from the total number of penguins.

First, we calculate one-third of the 36 penguins that jump into the ocean:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
\]
So, 12 penguins jump into the ocean.

Next, we calculate one-third of the 36 penguins that go into the cave:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
\]
So, 12 penguins go into the cave.

Now, we subtract the number of penguins that went into the ocean and the cave from the total number of penguins:
\[
36 - 12 - 12 = 12
\]

Therefore, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is:
\[
12

"First, let's determine how much Steve's girlfriend eats. Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, and Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, his girlfriend eats:

\[ \text{Steve's girlfriend's consumption} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ tomatoes per day} \]

Next, we calculate the total consumption per week. Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, so in a week (7 days), he eats:

\[ \text{Steve's weekly consumption} = 6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ tomatoes} \]

His girlfriend eats 3 tomatoes per day, so in a week, she eats:

\[ \text{Girlfriend's weekly consumption} = 3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Therefore, the total weekly consumption by both of them is:

\[ \text{Total weekly consumption} = 42 + 21 = 63 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Given that a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, the number of vines needed to produce 63 tomatoes per week is:

\[ \text{Number of vines} = \frac{63}{3} = 21 \]

So, Steve needs 21 vines."
"To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we first need to calculate the total number of pizza slices required. Since there are 20 friends and each friend will have 4 slices, the total number of slices needed is:

\[ 20 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many pizzas are required to get at least 80 slices. Since each pizza is sliced into 8 portions, we divide the total number of slices needed by the number of slices per pizza:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 10 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 10 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the process Ram uses to make new pens from the empty ones.

1. Ram starts with 25 pens.
2. He can make one new pen by mixing the ink from five empty pens.

Let's break down the process:

- Initially, Ram has 25 pens.
- After using 5 pens to make one new pen, he now has 24 pens (25 - 1) and 1 new pen.
- He can now use another 5 pens to make another new pen, leaving him with 19 pens (24 - 1) and 2 new pens.
- This process continues until he can no longer make a new pen.

To find out how many new pens he can make, we divide the number of pens he has by 5:

\[ \text{Number of new pens} = \left\lfloor \frac{25}{5} \right\rfloor = 5 \]

So, Ram can make 5 new pens from the 25 empty pens.

Now, we add the original 25 pens to the 5 new pens he made:

\[ \text{Total pens} = 25 + 5 = 30 \]

Therefore, the total number of pens Ram has is 30."
"Johnny's initial sum of money was $20 plus an extra $10, which totals $30. After investing this sum and it tripling in a year, the amount of money he had after a year is $30 * 3 = $90."
"First, let's determine the ages of Mary and Joan based on the information given:

1. Jessa's age is 20 years.
2. Joan is five years older than Jessa, so Joan's age is \(20 + 5 = 25\) years.
3. Mary is two years younger than Joan, so Mary's age is \(25 - 2 = 23\) years.

Now, we can find the sum of the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa:

\[ \text{Sum of ages} = \text{Jessa's age} + \text{Joan's age} + \text{Mary's age} = 20 + 25 + 23 \]

Let's calculate the sum:

\[ 20 + 25 + 23 = 68 \]

So, the sum of the ages of the three girls is 68."
"First, let's calculate the number of students who went out through exit A. Since 30% of the students went out through exit A, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Students through exit A} = 1000 \times \frac{30}{100} = 300 \]

Next, we need to find out how many students remain after exit A:

\[ \text{Remaining students} = 1000 - 300 = 700 \]

Then, we calculate the number of students who went out through exit B. Since 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Students through exit B} = 700 \times \frac{3}{5} = 420 \]

Finally, we find out how many students went out through exit C by subtracting the number of students who went out through exits A and B from the total number of students:

\[ \text{Students through exit C} = 1000 - 300 - 420 = 280 \]

So, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
"First, let's determine how many candies Robert has. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert and John has 54 candies, we can set up the equation:

\[ 2 \times \text{Robert's candies} = 54 \]

Solving for Robert's candies:

\[ \text{Robert's candies} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Now, we know Robert has 27 candies. Since James has 6 more candies than Robert, we can calculate the number of candies James has:

\[ \text{James's candies} = \text{Robert's candies} + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Finally, to find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's candies} - \text{James's candies} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

So, John has 21 more candies than James. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 21 \]"
"Dolly has 2 books and reads them all. She also reads Pandora's book, so she reads 2 + 1 = 3 books in total.

Collectively, they will read 3 + 2 = 5 books.

The final numerical answer is 5."
"First, let's determine how many pen pals Mike has left after stopping being pen pals with 2 of them. Initially, he had 5 pen pals, so after stopping being pen pals with 2, he has:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals left} \]

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each pen pal sends:

\[ 2 \text{ letters/week} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 10 \text{ pages/week} \]

Since there are 3 pen pals, the total number of pages sent by all pen pals in a week is:

\[ 3 \text{ pen pals} \times 10 \text{ pages/pen pal/week} = 30 \text{ pages/week} \]

Mike responds in kind, so he also writes 30 pages a week. Mike can write a page in 6 minutes, so the total time he spends writing in a week is:

\[ 30 \text{ pages/week} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 180 \text{ minutes/week} \]

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes/week}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 3 \text{ hours/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \]"
"To determine how many minutes Jason has left on his phone plan, we need to calculate the total minutes he has used and subtract that from his plan's total.

First, calculate the total minutes Jason has used:
- Jason uses 15 minutes per day for his boss.
- There are 30 days in the month.
- He also used an additional 300 minutes.

Total minutes used = (Minutes used per day * Number of days) + Extra minutes
Total minutes used = (15 * 30) + 300
Total minutes used = 450 + 300
Total minutes used = 750

Now, subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes on the plan:
Total minutes on plan = 1000
Minutes left = Total minutes on plan - Total minutes used
Minutes left = 1000 - 750
Minutes left = 250

So, Jason has 250 minutes left."
"First, let's determine how many fries Kyle took. Kyle took 5 fries.

Next, Billy took twice as many as Kyle. Therefore, Billy took \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries.

Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken. So, Colby took \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries.

Initially, Griffin had 24 fries. After Kyle took 5 fries, Griffin had \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries.

After Billy took 10 fries, Griffin had \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries.

After Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had \(9 - 2 = 7\) fries.

In the end, Griffin had 27 fries. To find out how many fries Ginger gave Griffin, we subtract the number of fries Griffin had after Billy and Colby from the final number of fries Griffin had:

\(27 - 7 = 20\)

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries."
"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( F \).

Given:
- There are 4 snails in the first aquarium.
- There are 32 snails in the second aquarium.
- The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in both aquariums.
- Both aquariums have the same number of fish.

First, calculate the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums:
\[ \text{Difference in snails} = 32 - 4 = 28 \]

According to the problem, this difference is twice the number of fish in both aquariums:
\[ 28 = 2 \times (\text{Number of fish in one aquarium}) \]

Since both aquariums have the same number of fish:
\[ 28 = 2 \times F \]

Solve for \( F \):
\[ F = \frac{28}{2} = 14 \]

Therefore, the number of fish in each aquarium is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist works for the movie:

- Hours per day: 6
- Days per week: 4
- Weeks: 5

Total hours = 6 hours/day * 4 days/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours

Next, we calculate the total cost before the discount:

- Hourly rate: $250
- Total hours: 120

Total cost before discount = 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000

Now, we apply the 10% discount:

- Discount rate: 10%
- Discount amount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.10 * $30,000 = $3,000

Finally, we calculate the total cost after the discount:

- Total cost before discount: $30,000
- Discount amount: $3,000

Total cost after discount = $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

"First, we need to calculate the total amount Isabelle spent on the party supplies. We do this by adding up all the individual expenses:

\[
12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22 = 96
\]

So, Isabelle spent a total of $96 on the party supplies.

Next, we need to determine how much each person paid. Since Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, there are a total of 3 people (Isabelle and her two parents). We divide the total cost by 3:

\[
\frac{96}{3} = 32
\]

Therefore, each person paid $32.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many cookies Sue's sister ate each day.

On Monday, her sister ate 5 cookies.

On Tuesday, her sister ate 13 cookies.

Next, we calculate how many cookies Sue ate each day based on the information given.

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Therefore, on Monday, Sue ate:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cookies} \]

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Therefore, on Tuesday, Sue ate:
\[ 2 \times 13 = 26 \text{ cookies} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of cookies Sue ate over the two days:
\[ 20 + 26 = 46 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of cookies her sister ate over the two days:
\[ 5 + 13 = 18 \text{ cookies} \]

Each cookie has 200 calories. Therefore, the total calories consumed by Sue are:
\[ 46 \times 200 = 9200 \text{ calories} \]

And the total calories consumed by her sister are:
\[ 18 \times 200 = 3600 \text{ calories} \]

Finally, we find the difference in calories consumed by Sue and her sister:
\[ 9200 - 3600 = 5600 \text{ calories} \]

So, Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister."
"First, let's calculate the total number of students in the school. Since each class has 20 students and there are 3 classes, the total number of students is:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

Given that the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the number of boys and girls in the school is:

\[ \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

For the first class, there are 15 girls, so the number of boys in the first class is:

\[ 20 - 15 = 5 \]

For the second class, there are 12 girls, so the number of boys in the second class is:

\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \]

Now, let's find the total number of boys in the first and second classes:

\[ 5 + 8 = 13 \]

Since the total number of boys in the school is 30, the number of boys in the third class is:

\[ 30 - 13 = 17 \]

So, the number of boys in the third class is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Previous Night's Kill:**
   - Wolves: 10
   - Cougars: 15

2. **Today's Kill:**
   - Let the number of cougars killed today be \( c \).
   - According to the problem, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, so the number of wolves killed today is \( 3c \).
   - Also, Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, so the number of cougars killed today is \( 15 - 3 = 12 \).

3. **Calculating Today's Wolves:**
   - Since today's number of cougars is 12, the number of wolves killed today is \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \).

4. **Total Animals Killed:**
   - Wolves killed in total: \( 10 \text{ (previous night)} + 36 \text{ (today)} = 46 \)
   - Cougars killed in total: \( 15 \text{ (previous night)} + 12 \text{ (today)} = 27 \)

"First, let's find out how many times Anne went down the water slide. If Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Anne's rides} = \text{Mitchel's rides} - (\text{Mitchel's rides} \times 0.30) \]
\[ \text{Anne's rides} = 30 - (30 \times 0.30) \]
\[ \text{Anne's rides} = 30 - 9 \]
\[ \text{Anne's rides} = 21 \]

Now, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne:

\[ \text{Robert's rides} = 4 \times \text{Anne's rides} \]
\[ \text{Robert's rides} = 4 \times 21 \]
\[ \text{Robert's rides} = 84 \]

So, Robert went down the water slide 84 times."
"First, let's determine the total number of cows initially present in the ten stalls. Each stall has 20 cows, so the total number of cows is:

\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows/stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Mr. Sylas then buys 40 more cows, so the new total number of cows is:

\[ 200 \text{ cows} + 40 \text{ cows} = 240 \text{ cows} \]

These 40 new cows are then divided equally into the 20 stalls. Therefore, each stall gets:

\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows/stall} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. Since each stall has 2 cows, the number of cows in 8 stalls is:

"First, we need to determine the total length of the redwood tree in feet, which is given as 200 feet.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the entire redwood tree before any damage. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can find the total weight by dividing the total length by the length of each section and then multiplying by the weight per section.

\[
\text{Total weight} = \left(\frac{\text{Total length}}{\text{Length per section}}\right) \times \text{Weight per section}
\]

\[
\text{Total weight} = \left(\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}}\right) \times 400 \text{ pounds/section}
\]

\[
\text{Total weight} = 20 \times 400 = 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to account for the damage caused by the termites. The termites ate 30% of the redwood's wood, which means 70% of the wood remains.

\[
\text{Weight after termites} = \text{Total weight} \times (1 - \text{Percentage eaten})
\]

\[
\text{Weight after termites} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \times (1 - 0.30)

"Let's denote the number of apples Jamal has as \( J_a \), the number of bananas Jamal has as \( J_b \), and the number of apples Andrea has as \( A_a \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal: \( A_a = J_a + 8 \).
2. Andrea has 52 apples, so \( A_a = 52 \).
3. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal: \( A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b \).
4. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples: \( J_b = J_a + 4 \).

First, we can find the number of apples Jamal has using the information about Andrea's apples:
\[ A_a = J_a + 8 \]
\[ 52 = J_a + 8 \]
\[ J_a = 52 - 8 \]
\[ J_a = 44 \]

Next, we can find the number of bananas Jamal has using the information about the difference between bananas and apples:
\[ J_b = J_a + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 44 + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 48 \]

Now, we can find the number of bananas Andrea has:
\[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b \]
\[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 \]
\[ A_b = 24 \]

Finally, we can find the total number of fruits Andrea and Jamal have together:
\[ \text{Total fruits} = A_a + A_b + J_a + J_b \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 168 \]

So, the total number of fruits is 168."
"To determine the total amount of flour Carla needs, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she is making and then determine the total amount of flour required based on the given ratio.

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, which totals to:
\[ 36 + 30 = 66 \text{ cookies} \]

We know that 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies. To find out how many cups of flour are needed for 66 cookies, we can set up a proportion:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{66 \text{ cookies}} \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 66 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} \]
\[ x = \frac{132}{12} \]
\[ x = 11 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow."
"First, we need to find out how many pennies are in two thirds of the pennies in the cup. The total number of pennies in the cup is 9,300. To find two thirds of 9,300, we perform the following calculation:

\[
\text{Number of pennies in the stack} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9300
\]

To calculate this, we multiply 9,300 by 2 and then divide by 3:

\[
\frac{2 \times 9300}{3} = \frac{18600}{3} = 6200
\]

So, there are 6,200 pennies in the stack. Since each penny is worth $0.01, the total dollar amount in the stack is:

\[
6200 \times 0.01 = 62
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 62."
"Maddison initially has 5 boxes with 50 marbles each, so she has a total of 5 * 50 = 250 marbles. After getting 20 more marbles from her friend, she now has 250 + 20 = 270 marbles.

"First, let's determine the number of trees Ferdinand has. Since Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, and Chris has 6 trees:

\[ \text{Number of trees Ferdinand has} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we need to find out how many trees Harry has. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. Since Ferdinand has 3 trees:

\[ \text{Twice the number of trees Ferdinand has} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \]
\[ \text{Number of trees Harry has} = 6 + 5 = 11 \]

Now, to find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand:

\[ \text{Difference in number of trees} = 11 - 3 = 8 \]

So, Harry has 8 more trees than Ferdinand. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 8 \]"
"First, let's determine how much money each girl has:

- Carmen has $100.
- Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125.
- Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has $125 + $50 = $175.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money all three girls have combined:

- Carmen: $100
- Samantha: $125
- Daisy: $175

Total = $100 + $125 + $175 = $400

"First, let's calculate the total price of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price:
\[ \text{Brokerage fee} = 350,000 \times \frac{5}{100} = 350,000 \times 0.05 = 17,500 \]

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price:
\[ \text{Transfer fee} = 350,000 \times \frac{12}{100} = 350,000 \times 0.12 = 42,000 \]

Now, let's add the brokerage fee and the transfer fee to the selling price to get the total price:
\[ \text{Total price} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500 \]

Finally, let's find out how much more the total price is than Mrs. Cruz's budget:
\[ \text{Difference} = 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500 \]

The total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget."
"First, let's calculate the transfer fees. The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Transfer Fees} = 400,000 \times \frac{3}{100} = 400,000 \times 0.03 = 12,000 \]

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee. The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Brokerage Fee} = 400,000 \times \frac{5}{100} = 400,000 \times 0.05 = 20,000 \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount paid for the transfer fees and the brokerage fee.

\[ \text{Total Fees} = 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000 \]

Mr. Tan also paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount of the house.

\[ \text{Total Paid} = 32,000 + 250,000 = 282,000 \]

Finally, to find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we subtract the total amount paid from the selling price.

\[ \text{Net Proceeds} = 400,000 - 282,000 = 118,000 \]

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is $118,000."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes for the oil to heat up to 400 degrees. We know it takes 20 minutes to heat the oil to 300 degrees, and it then takes 40% longer to heat it to 400 degrees.

To find 40% of 20 minutes:
\[ 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the additional time needed to heat the oil to 400 degrees is 8 minutes. Therefore, the total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that the time to cook the chicken is 5 minutes less than the time it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees:
\[ 28 - 5 = 23 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add up all the time periods:
- Time to heat the oil to 300 degrees: 20 minutes
- Time to heat the oil to 400 degrees: 28 minutes
- Time to cook the chicken: 23 minutes

The total time from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken is:
\[ 20 + 28 + 23 = 71 \text{ minutes} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 71 \]"
"To calculate the total amount spent by the real estate agent, we need to calculate the cost for the newspaper ads and the television ads separately, and then add them together.

Cost per newspaper ad = $5
Number of newspaper ads = 50
Total cost for newspaper ads = $5 * 50 = $250

For the television ads:
Cost per television ad = $75
Number of television ads = 15
Total cost for television ads = $75 * 15 = $1125

Now, we add the total costs for both types of ads:

"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and then sum them up.

1. The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
2. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has \(300 + 12 = 312\) M&Ms.
3. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, so it has \(300 / 2 = 150\) M&Ms.

Now, we sum the M&Ms from all three bags:
\[ 300 + 312 + 150 = 762 \]

So, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms:**
   - Each house has 3 bedrooms.
   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.
   - Therefore, the number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is \(3 \text{ bedrooms} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows}\).
   - Since John has 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms of both houses is \(6 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 12 \text{ windows}\).

2. **Calculate the number of additional windows:**
   - Each house has an additional 4 windows not connected to bedrooms.
   - Therefore, the total number of additional windows in both houses is \(4 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 8 \text{ windows}\).

3. **Calculate the total number of windows:**
   - The total number of windows is the sum of the windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows.
   - Therefore, the total number of windows is \(12 \text{ windows} + 8 \text{ windows} = 20 \text{ windows}\).

The final numerical answer is 20."
"To find out the change the cashier gives back, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items the mother bought. The cost of the cocoa is $4.20, the laundry is $9.45, and the package of pasta is $1.35. Adding these together gives:

\[ 4.20 + 9.45 + 1.35 = 15.00 \]

The mother pays with $20. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from $20:

\[ 20.00 - 15.00 = 5.00 \]

So, the change the cashier gives back is $5.00."
"First, let's calculate the number of stitches for the collar and the rosette.

The collar takes a tenth of the stitches for the body of the sweater:
\[ \text{Collar stitches} = \frac{900}{10} = 90 \]

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar:
\[ \text{Rosette stitches} = 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Now, let's add up the stitches for the collar and the rosette:
\[ \text{Collar and rosette stitches} = 90 + 180 = 270 \]

The total number of stitches for the whole sweater is 1800. Therefore, the stitches used for the body and the sleeves are:
\[ \text{Body and sleeves stitches} = 1800 - 270 = 1530 \]

Since there are two sleeves, we need to divide the remaining stitches equally between the two sleeves:
\[ \text{Stitches per sleeve} = \frac{1530}{2} = 765 \]

So, each sleeve takes 765 stitches."
"To find out how much money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the total cost for the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately, and then add these amounts together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the tomato seeds:
- She bought 20 packets of tomato seeds.
- Each packet costs $40.

\[
\text{Total cost for tomato seeds} = 20 \times 40 = 800

"First, let's find out how many cards had the letter A on them. Since 2/5 of the cards had the letter A, we calculate:

\[
\text{Cards with letter A} = \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = \frac{160}{5} = 32
\]

Next, we find out how many cards were left after removing the cards with the letter A:

\[
\text{Remaining cards} = 80 - 32 = 48
\]

Now, 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B on them:

\[
\text{Cards with letter B} = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24
\]

After removing the cards with the letter B, we find out how many cards were left:

\[
\text{Remaining cards} = 48 - 24 = 24
\]

Then, 5/8 of the remaining cards had the letter C on them:

\[
\text{Cards with letter C} = \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = \frac{120}{8} = 15
\]

After removing the cards with the letter C, we find out how many cards were left:

"To calculate the total time Matthew will take to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time to dig 30 small holes.
2. Calculate the total time to dig 15 large holes.
3. Sum the times from steps 1 and 2.
4. Convert the total time from minutes to hours.

Let's start with step 1:
- Time to dig one small hole = 3 minutes
- Number of small holes = 30
- Total time for small holes = 3 minutes/hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes

Next, step 2:
- Time to dig one large hole = 10 minutes
- Number of large holes = 15
- Total time for large holes = 10 minutes/hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes

Now, step 3:
- Total time in minutes = 90 minutes (small holes) + 150 minutes (large holes) = 240 minutes

Finally, step 4:
- Convert total time from minutes to hours.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Total time in hours = 240 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours

Therefore, the total time it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes is 4 hours."
"To find the sum of their ages in 10 years, we can start by understanding the current sum of their ages, which is given as 20. 

In 10 years, each of them will be 10 years older. Therefore, we can calculate the increase in their combined age by adding 10 years to each of their ages. Since there are two individuals, the total increase in their combined age will be:

\[ 10 \text{ years} + 10 \text{ years} = 20 \text{ years} \]

Given that their current combined age is 20 years, we can find their combined age in 10 years by adding this increase to their current combined age:

\[ 20 \text{ years} + 20 \text{ years} = 40 \text{ years} \]

"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, which translates to \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. This translates to \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"First, let's determine the number of spots a mamba has. Since a cobra has 70 spots and a mamba has half as many spots as a cobra, we calculate the number of spots a mamba has as follows:

\[ \text{Spots per mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and all the mambas. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots:

\[ \text{Total spots for cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots:

\[ \text{Total spots for mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Now, we find the combined total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas:

\[ \text{Total spots} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of the total number of spots:

\[ \text{Half the total spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

Adding these together, the total number of people is:
\[ 12 \text{ (team members)} + 3 \text{ (coaches)} + 24 \text{ (guests)} = 39 \text{ people} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Since each pizza serves 3 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each pizza can serve:
\[ \frac{39}{3} = 13 \text{ pizzas} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Each pizza costs $15, so:
\[ 13 \text{ pizzas} \times 15 \text{ dollars per pizza} = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Maddy will spend \(\boxed{195}\) dollars."
"To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we first need to calculate the total length used by the topaz gemstones and then subtract that from the total length of the necklace.

Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and she uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace. Therefore, the total length used by the topaz gemstones is:
\[ 8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. So, the length used by the sterling silver beads is:
\[ 25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches} \]

Each sterling silver bead is 0.25 inches long. To find the number of sterling silver beads used, we divide the total length used by the beads by the length of one bead:

She also has 2 dimes, and since each dime is worth 10 cents, she has a total of 2 * 10 = 20 cents from the dimes. Therefore, Kelly has a total of 125 + 20 = 145 cents. If she buys a can of pop for 55 cents, the number of cents she will have left is 145 - 55 = 90 cents."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of rows on the flag and then find out how many of those rows are 5-star rows.

First, let's calculate the total number of stars in the 3 rows of 8 stars:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of stars in the 2 rows of 6 stars:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Now, we add the stars from the 3 rows of 8 stars and the 2 rows of 6 stars to find the total number of stars accounted for:
\[ 24 + 12 = 36 \]

The flag has a total of 76 stars. To find out how many stars are in the rows of 5 stars, we subtract the stars accounted for from the total number of stars:
\[ 76 - 36 = 40 \]

Finally, to find the number of rows of 5 stars, we divide the number of 5-star rows by the number of stars per row:
\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the number of rows of 5 stars is:

Therefore, the number of trucks needed is 3."
"First, let's determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since it is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, we can calculate its speed as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of car in the slow lane} = \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it took the car in the fast lane to travel 480 miles. We can use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the fast lane:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{fast lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Since the car in the slow lane traveled the same distance (480 miles) but at a different speed (30 miles/hour), we can calculate the time it took for the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance using the same formula:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{slow lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

\[ \text{Medals Izzy has} = \text{Medals Ali has} - 5 = 22 - 5 = 17 \]

Next, we need to find out the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:

\[ \text{Total medals Ali and Izzy have} = \text{Medals Ali has} + \text{Medals Izzy has} = 22 + 17 = 39 \]

According to the problem, the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have:

\[ \text{Total medals given out} = 10 \times \text{Total medals Ali and Izzy have} = 10 \times 39 = 390 \]

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is:

\[ 390 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available:

- Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars.
- There are 8 packets.

So, the total number of chocolate bars is:
\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars/packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of chocolate bars that the adults will receive:

- There are 4 adults.
- Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars.

So, the total number of chocolate bars for the adults is:
\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars/adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, we find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children:

\[ 40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

There are 8 children, and we need to distribute the remaining 16 chocolate bars equally among them:

\[ \frac{16 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars/child} \]

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars."
"To determine how much money Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she works and then use her hourly rate to find her earnings.

First, let's calculate the total time Susan works:
- Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours.
- She takes a 30-minute break in the middle.

Total working time = 3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours.

Next, we need to find out how much she earns per hour. Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we can calculate her hourly rate:
- There are 6 intervals of 10 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, her hourly rate is $5 * 6 = $30 per hour.

Now, we can calculate her total earnings for 2.5 hours:
- Total earnings = 2.5 hours * $30/hour = $75.

Thus, Susan earns $75 for the online task."
"First, let's determine the initial points for each player:

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Next, we check if any of the players get an extra point in the fourth round. The extra point is given to players who have over 20 points.

- Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so Mike gets an extra point.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so Jim does not get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so Tony gets an extra point.

Now, we add the extra points to their initial points:

- Mike's new total is \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
- Jim's total remains \(18\) points.
- Tony's new total is \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

Finally, we calculate the total points for all three players:

\[22 + 18 + 43 = 83\]

The total points for all three players after the extra points had been distributed is \(\boxed{83}\)."
"First, let's determine the ages of Will's sons. The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest son is half as old as the oldest, which means the youngest son is 4 years old.

Next, we calculate how many oranges each son washes. The oldest son washes 8 oranges, and the youngest son washes 4 oranges. Together, they wash a total of:

8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Will initially bought 15 oranges. After his sons wash 12 oranges, the number of oranges left unwashed is:

15 - 12 = 3 oranges.

So, the final numerical answer is 3."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Day:**
   - Pushups: 100
   - Squats: 50
   - Dumbbell presses: 20

2. **Second Day:**
   - Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
   - Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
   - Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

3. **Total Activities for Two Days:**
   - Pushups: 100 (first day) + 120 (second day) = 220
   - Squats: 50 (first day) + 40 (second day) = 90
   - Dumbbell presses: 20 (first day) + 40 (second day) = 60

4. **Total Count of Activities:**
   - Total = Pushups + Squats + Dumbbell presses
   - Total = 220 + 90 + 60 = 370

The total count of the activities he's done in the two days is 370."
"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day by the household.
2. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week by the household.
3. Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

First, let's calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day by the household. There are 5 members, and each consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since they eat rice at lunch and dinner, each person consumes 0.4 kg of rice per day.

Total daily consumption = 5 members * 0.4 kg/member/day = 2 kg/day

Next, we calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week. There are 7 days in a week.

Total weekly consumption = 2 kg/day * 7 days/week = 14 kg/week

Finally, we determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

Number of weeks the bag will last = 42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks

The final numerical answer is 3 weeks."
"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we first need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week.

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he did not sell any bread on those days. He sold 20 crates over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday). On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates, on Wednesday, he sold 12 crates, and on Thursday, he sold 18 crates.

Let's add up the crates sold from Tuesday to Thursday:
15 crates (Tuesday) + 12 crates (Wednesday) + 18 crates (Thursday) = 45 crates

Now, we add the crates sold over the weekend:
45 crates + 20 crates = 65 crates

Sam's target for the week was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off by, we subtract the crates he sold from his target:
120 crates (target) - 65 crates (sold) = 55 crates

Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week."
"To determine the cost of the antique desk to Carmen, we need to calculate the total amount she bid, considering the initial bid and the subsequent bids from herself and the other three bidders.

1. **Initial Bid**: Carmen's initial bid is $200.
2. **Subsequent Bids**: Each of the other three bidders makes a bid, and Carmen bids after each of them. The bids increase by $50 each time.

Let's denote the number of times Carmen bids as \( n \). Since she bids after each of the 3 other bidders, \( n = 3 \).

The bids from the other bidders are:
- First bidder: $200 + $50 = $250
- Second bidder: $250 + $50 = $300
- Third bidder: $300 + $50 = $350

Carmen's bids are:
- First time: $200 + $50 = $250
- Second time: $250 + $50 = $300
- Third time: $300 + $50 = $350

Now, we sum up all the bids:
- Initial bid by Carmen: $200
- Bids by the other three bidders: $250 + $300 + $350

Calculating the total:
\[ 200 + 250 + 300 + 350 = 1100 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Carmen spends on the desk is:

"To calculate the total annual cost for John's driving service, we need to consider the cost of miles driven and the monthly bonus, then scale it up to a yearly figure.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven in a year:
- Distance to work one way: 30 miles
- Round trip to work each day: 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles
- Days per week: 5 days
- Weeks per year: 50 weeks
- Total miles driven in a year: 60 miles/day * 5 days/week * 50 weeks/year = 15000 miles/year

Next, let's calculate the cost of the miles driven:
- Cost per mile: $2
- Total cost for miles driven in a year: 15000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30000/year

Now, let's calculate the total bonus paid in a year:
- Bonus per month: $150
- Months per year: 12 months/year
- Total bonus paid in a year: $150/month * 12 months/year = $1800/year

Finally, let's calculate the total annual cost:
- Total annual cost: Cost for miles driven + Total bonus paid in a year
- Total annual cost: $30000 + $1800 = $31800

The final numerical answer is $31800."
"To solve this, we first need to find out how much time Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined. On Sunday, he exercised for 23 minutes, and on Monday, he exercised for 16 minutes. So, the total time he exercised on these two days is:

\[ 23 + 16 = 39 \text{ minutes} \]

Peter wants to exercise for twice this amount on Tuesday. Therefore, the time he needs to exercise on Tuesday is:

\[ 2 \times 39 = 78 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the folding process and how the pages are printed.

1. **Folding Process**: When a piece of paper is folded vertically, it creates two layers. Each layer can be used to print one side of a page. Therefore, for a 32-page tabloid, we need 16 layers (since 32 pages divided by 2 pages per layer equals 16 layers).

2. **Number of Pieces of Paper**: Since each layer is created from one piece of paper, the number of pieces of paper required is equal to the number of layers.

Thus, the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid is 16."

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Total books: 250
2. Unsold books: 50
3. Books sold this year: \(250 - 50 = 200\)
4. Books sold in the first year: \(2 \times 200 = 400\)
5. Books sold in the second year: 200 (as given)
6. Price per book: $20

Now, let's calculate the earnings for the second year:

\[ \text{Earnings in the second year} = \text{Books sold in the second year} \times \text{Price per book} \]
\[ \text{Earnings in the second year} = 200 \times 20 = 4000 \]

So, the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is $4000."
"To determine how much money Watson made in April, we need to calculate his earnings from his hourly wage and his weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate Watson's daily earnings:
- Watson works 10 hours a day.
- He earns $10 per hour.

\[ \text{Daily earnings} = 10 \, \text{hours/day} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$100/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate his weekly earnings:
- Watson works 5 days a week.
- He earns $100 per day.

\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 5 \, \text{days/week} \times \$100/\text{day} = \$500/\text{week} \]

Since Watson received a $300 bonus each week if the company performed well, his total weekly earnings when the company performed well are:

\[ \text{Total weekly earnings} = \$500 + \$300 = \$800/\text{week} \]

Now, let's calculate his total earnings for the month of April. April typically has 30 days, and we need to determine how many weeks are in April.

\[ \text{Number of weeks in April} = \left\lfloor \frac{30 \, \text{days}}{7 \, \text{days/week}} \right\rfloor = 4 \, \text{weeks} \]

Since Watson worked 5 days a week and the company performed well each week, we can calculate his total earnings for the month of April:

\[ \text{Total earnings for April} = 4 \, \text{weeks} \times \$800/\text{week} = \$3200 \]

Thus, Watson made \$3200 in April if the company performed very well for the whole month."
"To determine how many people John lost to, we first need to calculate how many people he beat. If he beats 80% of the 20 people he arm wrestles, we can find this number by calculating 80% of 20.

\[ \text{Number of people John beats} = 0.80 \times 20 = 16 \]

Since he arm wrestled 20 people in total, the number of people he lost to is the total number of people minus the number of people he beat.

\[ \text{Number of people John lost to} = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 4."
"First, let's determine how many loaves of bread are sold in the morning. Since two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning, we calculate:

\[
\text{Morning sales} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
\]

Next, we find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales:

\[
\text{Loaves left after morning} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
\]

In the afternoon and evening, half of the remaining loaves are sold equally. Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening combined is:

\[
\text{Afternoon and evening sales combined} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
\]

Since the loaves sold in the afternoon and evening are sold equally, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[
\text{Afternoon sales} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \text{ loaves}
\]

Thus, the number of loaves of bread sold in the afternoon is:

\[
\boxed{5}

So, the total amount saved if you buy 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many times the person grows an extra arm and how many times they grow an extra leg within the 15-day period.

First, let's calculate the number of extra arms grown:
- The person grows an extra arm every 3 days.
- In 15 days, the number of times an extra arm is grown is \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \).

Next, let's calculate the number of extra legs grown:
- The person grows an extra leg every 5 days.
- In 15 days, the number of times an extra leg is grown is \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \).

To find the total number of new limbs grown, we add the number of extra arms and extra legs:
- Total new limbs = Number of extra arms + Number of extra legs
- Total new limbs = 5 + 3 = 8

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 8."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
6 business suits * $100 each = $600

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
3 suitcases * $50 each = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit:
5 * $100 (cost of one business suit) = $500
$700 more than $500 = $5700
So, the flight ticket costs $5700.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
Cost of business suits: $600
Cost of suitcases: $150
Cost of flight ticket: $5700
Total cost: $600 + $150 + $5700 = $6450

Theo wishes to save $2000 for the trip, so the amount he has spent so far is:
Total cost - Savings = $6450 - $2000 = $4450

Finally, to find out how much he has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners, we subtract the amount spent so far from his total budget:
Total budget - Amount spent so far = $6000 - $4450 = $1550

Therefore, Theo has to spend $1550 on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total people in the family:** 5
2. **People eating 3 eggs each day:** 3
3. **People eating 2 eggs each day:** 5 - 3 = 2

Now, let's calculate the daily egg consumption:

- **Eggs consumed by the 3 people eating 3 eggs each:** 3 * 3 = 9 eggs
- **Eggs consumed by the 2 people eating 2 eggs each:** 2 * 2 = 4 eggs

**Total daily egg consumption:** 9 + 4 = 13 eggs

Since they eat eggs every day, to find out how many eggs they consume in a week (7 days), we multiply the daily consumption by 7:

**Total weekly egg consumption:** 13 * 7 = 91 eggs

Therefore, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week."

So, the final numerical answer is 32."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera's current age is 46 years.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old six years ago.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since six years have passed, Noah's current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Calculate the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was \(3000 \times \text{Noah's age six years ago} = 3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

4. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now, so the current population is \(60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

The population of Chile now is \(\boxed{120000}\)."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so it is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players in the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve for \( D \), we first combine the terms on the left side of the equation:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 3D + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{6D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{7D}{2} \]

So the equation becomes:
\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

To isolate \( D \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Then we divide both sides by 7:
\[ D = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 30 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha initially invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\)
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\)

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we need to account for the people who couldn't come due to illness and those with previous commitments:

- 8 people couldn't come due to illness.
- 1/4 of the 8 people with illness had previous commitments, which is \(8 \div 4 = 2\).

Therefore, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Finally, the number of people who show up for the party is the total number of people invited minus the number who couldn't come:

\(24 - 10 = 14\).

So, the final numerical answer is 14."
"First, let's calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has after adding the ones he bought from Johanna to the store.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and the store already had 50 marbles. So, the total number of marbles in the store after adding the ones Solomon bought is:
\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \]

Next, we need to determine how many marbles Solomon's father gave him. Solomon's father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as Solomon bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles, the number of marbles given by his father is:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \]

Now, we add the marbles given by his father to the total number of marbles in the store:
\[ 70 + 8 = 78 \]

Each marble weighs 2 kg, so the total weight of the marbles is:
\[ 78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:

"First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Height (or depth) = 5 feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 5 \]

\[ V = 24 \times 5 \]

\[ V = 120 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is given as $0.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = \text{Volume} \times \text{Cost per cubic foot} \]

\[ C = 120 \times 0.1 \]

\[ C = 12 \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is $12."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Number of Boys**: The problem states that there are 30 boys in the classroom.

2. **Number of Girls**: Since the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of Girls} = 3 \times \text{Number of Boys} = 3 \times 30 = 90
   \]

3. **Number of Nongendered Children**: The problem states that there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as there are boys. Therefore, we can calculate the number of nongendered children as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of Nongendered Children} = \frac{1}{10} \times \text{Number of Boys} = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3
   \]

4. **Total Number of Children**: To find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
   \[
   \text{Total Number of Children} = \text{Number of Boys} + \text{Number of Girls} + \text{Number of Nongendered Children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123

"First, let's find out how many pencils Jam has in total. We know that Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which add up to 26 pencils. Let's denote the number of pencils in each box as \( x \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]

To find the value of \( x \), we need to solve this equation. Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ 3x = 24 \]

Now, divide both sides by 3:

\[ x = 8 \]

So, each box contains 8 pencils. Now, we can calculate the total number of pencils Jam has:

\[ 3 \times 8 + 2 = 24 + 2 = 26 \]

Jam has 26 pencils. Meg has 46 pencils. To find out how many boxes they need to store all their pencils, we need to add the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Now, we need to determine how many boxes are required to store 72 pencils. Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 9 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weakening of the coffee due to the cooling and the addition of cream.

First, let's calculate the weakening due to cooling. Each degree of cooling weakens the coffee by 13 milliliters. Shannon cools the coffee by 65 degrees, so the weakening due to cooling is:
\[ 65 \text{ degrees} \times 13 \text{ milliliters/degree} = 845 \text{ milliliters} \]

Next, we need to account for the weakening due to the addition of cream. Adding 15 milliliters of cream weakens the coffee by 12 milliliters. Therefore, the weakening due to the addition of cream is:
\[ 15 \text{ milliliters} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/15 milliliters} = 12 \text{ milliliters} \]

Now, we add the weakening due to cooling and the weakening due to the addition of cream to find the total weakening:
\[ 845 \text{ milliliters} + 12 \text{ milliliters} = 857 \text{ milliliters} \]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is 857 milliliters weaker when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of old records brought in by the 5 people. Given that each person can trade 2 old records for 1 new record, and 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can set up the following equation:

Let \( x \) be the total number of old records brought in by the 5 people.

Since each person trades 2 old records for 1 new record, the total number of old records traded is \( 2x \). The number of new records received is \( \frac{2x}{2} = x \).

We know that the total number of new records received is 7. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ x = 7 \]

So, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records (since \( x = 7 \) and each person brought in 2 old records).

The final numerical answer is:
14"
"First, let's determine the number of junior and senior programmers.

Given that the total number of employees is 100 and the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:
\[ \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers is:
\[ \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Next, we know that each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total amount paid to junior programmers per month is:
\[ \text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

The senior programmers are paid $400 more than the junior programmers, so each senior programmer is paid:
\[ \text{Payment to each senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400 \]

Therefore, the total amount paid to senior programmers per month is:
\[ \text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

Finally, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers:
\[ \text{Total payment to all programmers} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 224000 \]"
"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the number of people on the bus became \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on, so the number of people on the bus became \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).

We are given that at the third stop, there were 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( 14 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 14 \]"
"Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has:
\[ 24 - 2 = 22 \]
lollipops left.

He passes 14 lollipops to his friends, so he has:
\[ 22 - 14 = 8 \]
lollipops left.

He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is:
\[ 2 \times 14 = 28 \]
So, he adds these to his current count:
\[ 8 + 28 = 36 \]
lollipops.

He eats 3 more that night and 2 more in the morning, so he eats:
\[ 3 + 2 = 5 \]
lollipops in total.

Therefore, the number of lollipops Oscar has left is:
\[ 36 - 5 = 31 \]

The final numerical answer is 31."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total percentage of charging required and then convert that into minutes, and finally into hours.

1. The phone is currently at 60% charged.
2. The phone needs to reach 100% charged.
3. Therefore, the remaining percentage to be charged is \(100\% - 60\% = 40\%\).

Given that the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the total time required to charge 40 percentage points:

\[ 40 \text{ percentage points} \times 3 \text{ minutes/percentage point} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to convert 120 minutes into hours:

\[ 120 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

The final numerical answer is:
2"
"Erin initially has 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her another 10 lollipops, so she now has:

"First, let's calculate the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip where they spent $80. For every $20 spent, they get $1 off their next purchase. 

Rewards earned = $80 / $20 = 4 rewards

Since each reward is worth $1, the customer earned 4 rewards.

Next, let's calculate the rewards for the current shopping trip where they spent $43. 

Rewards earned = $43 / $20 = 2.15

Since rewards can only be in whole numbers, the customer earns 2 rewards.

Now, let's apply the rewards to the current shopping trip.

Rewards applied = 2 * $1 = $2

The original price of the current shopping trip is $43. After applying the rewards, the price becomes:

Price after rewards = $43 - $2 = $41

The customer then uses a coupon that takes twice the amount of rewards off the price. Since the rewards are $2, the coupon takes off:

Coupon discount = 2 * $2 = $4

The final price after applying the coupon is:

Final price = $41 - $4 = $37

So, the customer paid $37 on this shopping trip.

The final numerical answer is $37."
"First, let's calculate the net income for Job A.

Job A:
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours per year: 2000
- Annual income before tax: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- State tax rate: 20%
- State tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Annual income after state tax: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Next, let's calculate the net income for Job B.

Job B:
- Annual income before tax: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax rate on net income after property tax: 10%
- Tax on net income after property tax: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Annual income after tax: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, let's find the difference in net income between the two jobs.

Difference in net income: $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate compared to the other job."

   \]

2. **First Year Increase:**
   The stock price increases by 50%.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 50\% \times \$8 = 0.50 \times \$8 = \$4
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price after 1st Year} = \$8 + \$4 = \$12
   \]

3. **Value of Shares at the End of the First Year:**
   \[
   \text{Value at the end of the 1st year} = 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12/\text{share} = \$96

"First, let's determine how many hot dogs Thomas ate. Since Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, we calculate:

\[ \text{Thomas's hot dogs} = 3 \times \text{Luke's hot dogs} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Next, we find out how many hot dogs John ate. John ate half the amount that Thomas ate, so:

\[ \text{John's hot dogs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Thomas's hot dogs} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \]

Now, to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number John ate:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's hot dogs} - \text{Luke's hot dogs} = 3 - 2 = 1 \]

So, John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is \( x - 10 \).

The total number of students in the class is 200, so we can write the equation:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:
\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two equal groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:
\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

The number of students in the smallest group is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \) and the number of chickens as \( H \). According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. The total number of animals is 60.
2. There are twice as many chickens as cows.

We can express these as the following equations:
\[ H + C = 60 \]
\[ H = 2C \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( C \):
\[ 2C + C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:
\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of legs. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each:
\[ \text{Total number of legs} = (2 \times H) + (4 \times C) \]
\[ \text{Total number of legs} = (2 \times 40) + (4 \times 20) \]
\[ \text{Total number of legs} = 80 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total number of legs} = 160 \]

So, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is 160."
"Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week for 4 weeks. So, the number of balls he adds is:

\[ 3 \text{ initial balls} + 4 \text{ added balls} = 7 \text{ balls} \]

When he starts juggling on stage, he drops 3 balls, so the number of balls he has left is:

\[ 7 \text{ balls} - 3 \text{ dropped balls} = 4 \text{ balls} \]

However, 2 of the dropped balls are caught by people in the crowd, so the number of balls Josh has to juggle is:

\[ 4 \text{ balls} - 2 \text{ caught balls} = 2 \text{ balls} \]

So, Josh starts juggling on stage with 2 balls."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the weights of the other animals based on the given information and then calculate the total weight of the container with one of each animal inside.

1. **Pink Frog Weight:**
   - Given: Pink frog weighs 50 pounds.

2. **Blue Beetle Weight:**
   - Since the pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.

3. **Green Toad Weight:**
   - Since the pink frog weighs the same as a green toad, the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.

4. **Yellow Snake Weight:**
   - The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake.
   - Therefore, the yellow snake weighs \( 50 + 10 = 60 \) pounds.

5. **Red Bird Weight:**
   - The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than a red bird.
   - Therefore, the red bird weighs \( 50 - 20 = 30 \) pounds.

Now, we have the weights of all the animals:
- Pink Frog: 50 pounds
- Blue Beetle: 50 pounds
- Green Toad: 50 pounds

3. Calculate the total distance Tyson runs in a month (30 days) in June.

First, let's calculate the additional distance Tyson should run each day. The coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters than he currently runs. Since Tyson currently runs 5000 meters, the additional distance is:
\[ \text{Additional distance} = 5000 \times \frac{1}{5} = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

So, the total distance Tyson should run each day is:
\[ \text{Total daily distance} = 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters} \]

Next, we calculate the total distance Tyson runs in a month (30 days):
\[ \text{Total distance in June} = 6000 \times 30 = 180000 \text{ meters} \]

"To calculate the total annual cost for Madeline's dog, we need to first find the monthly cost and then multiply it by 12 (the number of months in a year).

The cost of food per month is calculated as follows:
- Food costs $25 per week.
- There are 4 weeks in a month.
- Therefore, the monthly cost of food is $25 * 4 = $100.

The cost of treats per month is given as $20.

The cost of medicine per month is given as $100.

Adding these together gives the total monthly cost:

"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming.

Boating time: 6 hours
Swimming time: 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours

Total time for boating and swimming: 6 hours + 3 hours = 9 hours

Next, let's calculate the total time he spent watching shows.

Number of shows: 3
Duration of each show: 2 hours
Total show time: 3 * 2 = 6 hours

Now, let's add the time spent on shows to the time spent on boating and swimming to get the total time spent on these activities.

Total time for shows and boating/swimming: 6 hours + 9 hours = 15 hours

This 15 hours represents 30% of the total time spent on the vacation. We can use this information to find the total time spent on the vacation.

Let \( T \) be the total time spent on the vacation. Then,

\[ 0.30T = 15 \]

Solving for \( T \):

\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John spent 40% of his total time sightseeing. We can calculate the time spent sightseeing as follows:

\[ \text{Time spent sightseeing} = 0.40 \times 50 = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's find the total cost of the toys Dean bought:
\[ 12 + 5 = 17 \text{ dollars} \]

Dean initially had $28. After buying the toys, the amount of money he has left is:
\[ 28 - 17 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

Dean's mother then gives him an extra $10. So, the total amount of money Dean has now is:
\[ 11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 21 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost for the mini-golf and go-karts:

- Cost for one round of mini-golf: $5
- Cost for two rides on go-karts: $10 * 2 = $20

Total cost for mini-golf and go-karts: $5 + $20 = $25

Now, let's subtract this total cost from the budget to find out how much money is left for arcade tokens:

- Remaining budget: $90 - $25 = $65

Each friend gets $5 worth of arcade tokens, so we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend:

- Number of friends: $65 / $5 = 13

So, Morgan can invite 13 friends to her birthday party."
"First, let's calculate how much Marisa spends on lollipops each day. She buys 4 lollipops each day, and each lollipop costs 25 cents. Therefore, the cost of lollipops each day is:

\[ 4 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 100 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, 100 cents is equivalent to 1 dollar. So, Marisa spends $1 on lollipops each day.

Next, let's calculate how much money Marisa earns each day. She gets $5 as pocket money every day.

Now, we need to find out how much money Marisa saves each day. This is the difference between what she earns and what she spends:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars} - 1 \text{ dollar} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Marisa saves $4 each day. Over 5 days, the total amount she saves is:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Billy spent on gumballs. He bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, so the total cost for the gumballs is:

\[ 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Since he spent half of his change on gumballs, the total change he received after buying the candy is:

\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Billy started with $10, so the amount he spent on candy is:

\[ 10 - 4 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of the candy is $1.5 per pound. To find out how many pounds of candy he bought, we divide the total amount spent on candy by the cost per pound:

\[ \frac{6}{1.5} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( x \) years. According to the problem, Carver's age is 5 years less than twice his son's age. This can be expressed with the following equation:

\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old."
"First, let's calculate the distance of the entire trip from the first city to the third city and back to the first city.

The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance from the first city to the second city and from the second city to the third city. The combined distance from the first to the second city and from the second to the third city is 75 miles + 100 miles = 175 miles. Therefore, the distance from the third city to the first city is 175 miles - 50 miles = 125 miles.

So, the total distance for one complete round trip (first to third city and back to the first city) is:
\[ 100 \text{ miles} + 125 \text{ miles} = 225 \text{ miles} \]

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[ 225 \text{ miles/trip} \times 3 \text{ trips/day} = 675 \text{ miles/day} \]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance traveled in one day by the service interval:
\[ \frac{675 \text{ miles/day}}{18,000 \text{ miles/service}} = \frac{675}{18,000} = \frac{1}{26.6667} \approx 0.0375 \text{ days} \]

Since the train travels 675 miles in one day, it will go between services after approximately 0.0375 days. To convert this into hours, we multiply by 24 (since there are 24 hours in a day):
\[ 0.0375 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 0.9 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the train goes between services every 0.0375 days, or approximately 0.9 hours. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 0.0375 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of stuffing required for each type of dog bed and then calculate the total amount needed for the specified number of beds.

First, let's find out how much stuffing a collie bed requires. The collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. A Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds of stuffing and a chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing. The average is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Average stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we know:
- A chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing.
- A collie bed requires 5 pounds of stuffing.

Next, we calculate the total stuffing needed for the specified number of beds:
- Mark needs to make 4 chihuahua beds. The total stuffing for the chihuahua beds is:
\[
4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]
- Mark needs to make 3 collie beds. The total stuffing for the collie beds is:
\[
3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds to find the total amount of stuffing Mark needs:
\[
8 + 15 = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the total amount of stuffing Mark needs is:
\[
\boxed{23}
\]"
"First, we need to calculate the time John spent driving to his friend's house. The distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, and he drives at a speed of 70 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time taken to drive to his friend's house is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} = \frac{200 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{200}{70} \text{ hours} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 2.857 \text{ hours} \]

Next, John took a detour that added 10 miles to his trip, making the total distance to his friend's house 210 miles. The time taken for this detour is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{210}{70} \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we need to calculate the time John spent driving back home. The distance home is 240 miles, and he drives at a speed of 80 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{back home}} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = \frac{240}{80} \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, the total time for the trip is the sum of the time taken to drive to his friend's house, the time taken for the detour, and the time taken to drive back home:

\[ \text{Total Time} = \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} + \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} + \text{Time}_{\text{back home}} \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{20}{7} + 3 + 3 \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{20}{7} + 6 \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{20}{7} + \frac{42}{7} \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{62}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 8.857 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total trip time is:

\[ \frac{62}{7} \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 8.857 \text{ hours} \]"
"First, let's find out the total number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School. Since there are 96 fourth-graders in total and 43 of them are girls, the number of boys is:

\[ 96 - 43 = 53 \]

Next, we need to determine how many boys were present on Friday. We know that 4 boys were absent on Friday. Therefore, the number of boys present on Friday is:

\[ 53 - 4 = 49 \]

So, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School who were present on Friday is 49."
"If there are 6 girls in the park and twice the number of boys, then there are 6 * 2 = 12 boys in the park. Therefore, the total number of kids in the park is 6 girls + 12 boys = 18 kids.

"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test, we start by calculating the total points she has already scored on her first two tests.

Points from the first test: 15 points
Points from the second test: 18 points

Total points from the first two tests: \( 15 + 18 = 33 \) points

Jane needs a total of at least 42 points across all three tests. To find out how many points she needs on her third test, we subtract the points she has already scored from the total required points.

Points needed on the third test: \( 42 - 33 = 9 \) points

Therefore, the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass is 9 points."
"Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as \( C \). According to the problem, \( C = 3 \).

The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is \( 4C - 5 \). Substituting \( C = 3 \) into this equation, we get:
\[ 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]

The number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is \( 3 \) times the number of shoplifters, which is \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \).

Now, we know the total number of customers kicked out is 50. The total number of customers and shoplifters and those for physical violence can be expressed as:
\[ C + (4C - 5) + 3(4C - 5) = 50 \]
Substituting \( C = 3 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 3 + (4(3) - 5) + 3(4(3) - 5) = 50 \]
\[ 3 + 7 + 3(7) = 50 \]
\[ 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 \]

The number of customers kicked out for other reasons is the total number of customers kicked out minus the number of customers for refusing to wear masks, shoplifters, and those for physical violence:
\[ 50 - 31 = 19 \]

Therefore, the number of customers kicked out for other reasons is \( 19 \)."
"First, let's determine how many points Erin has after scoring 14 points. According to the problem, after scoring 14 points, Erin has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8 points.

Let's calculate the points Sara has after scoring 8 points:
\[ \text{Sara's points after scoring} = 8 \]

Since Erin has three times more points than Sara after scoring 14 points:
\[ \text{Erin's points after scoring} = 3 \times \text{Sara's points after scoring} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

We know that Erin scored 14 points after these points were added to her initial points. Therefore, to find out how many points Erin had before scoring the 14 points, we subtract the 14 points from her total points after scoring:
\[ \text{Erin's initial points} = \text{Erin's points after scoring} - 14 = 24 - 14 = 10 \]

So, Erin had 10 points before scoring the additional 14 points. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break down the expenses into different categories and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of picture frames:**
   - Each picture frame costs $20.
   - Each frame needs to be etched at an additional 20% cost.
   - The total cost per frame is $20 + (20% of $20) = $20 + $4 = $24.
   - There are 44 seniors, so the total cost for the picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. **Cost of pins:**
   - 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each.
   - The total cost for the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

3. **Cost of cords for officers:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so there are 44 / 4 = 11 officers.
   - Each officer will receive a cord that costs $12.
   - The total cost for the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, we sum up all the costs:
- Cost of picture frames: $1056
- Cost of pins: $10
- Cost of cords: $132

Total cost = $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total cost of making Ethan's own hand-painted wallpaper, we first need to determine the cost of the materials after a 20% savings.

The savings amount is 20% of $400, which can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Savings} = 400 \times \frac{20}{100} = 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

Subtracting the savings from the original cost gives us the cost of the materials:
\[ \text{Cost of materials} = 400 - 80 = 320 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Friday Sales**: The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.
2. **Saturday Sales**: The store sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday. Therefore, the number of pairs sold on Saturday is:
   \[
   14 \times 2 = 28 \text{ pairs}
   \]
3. **Sunday Sales**: The store sold one-half the number of pairs sold on Saturday. Therefore, the number of pairs sold on Sunday is:
   \[
   \frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ pairs}
   \]
4. **Returns**: Six pairs of shoes were returned, so we need to subtract these from the total sales:
   \[
   14 \text{ (Friday)} + 28 \text{ (Saturday)} + 14 \text{ (Sunday)} - 6 \text{ (returns)} = 50 \text{ pairs}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale is:

- On Tuesdays, she practiced for 1 hour.
- On Thursdays, she practiced for 2 hours.
- On Saturdays, she practiced for twice as long as on Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 1 = 2\) hours.

Now, we sum these hours:
\[ 1 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 2 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Saturday)} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total number of hours Hallie had dance practice in a week is 5 hours."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of faulty pieces of equipment.
2. Determine the number of functioning pieces of equipment.
3. Calculate the total cost of the functioning pieces of equipment.

First, let's calculate the number of faulty pieces of equipment. Since 40% of the total number of pieces were faulty, we can find the number of faulty pieces by calculating 40% of the total number of pieces. However, we don't know the total number of pieces initially, but we can still proceed with the percentage calculation.

The total number of pieces of equipment is $400,000 worth, and 40% of these pieces are faulty. So, the number of faulty pieces is:
\[ 0.40 \times 400,000 = 160,000 \]

Since the total value of the equipment is $400,000, and 40% of it is faulty, the remaining 60% must be functioning. Therefore, the number of functioning pieces is:
\[ 0.60 \times 400,000 = 240,000 \]

The total amount of money spent on the functioning pieces of equipment is the value of the functioning pieces, which is:
\[ 240,000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 240000 \]"
"To determine the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. **Calculate the number of sheep that provide 1 kg of milk:**
   - Mary has 30 sheep.
   - Half of them provide 1 kg of milk each.
   - Therefore, the number of sheep providing 1 kg of milk is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \).

2. **Calculate the number of sheep that provide 2 kg of milk:**
   - The other half of the sheep provide 2 kg of milk each.
   - Therefore, the number of sheep providing 2 kg of milk is also \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \).

3. **Calculate the total milk from the sheep providing 1 kg of milk:**
   - Each of these 15 sheep provides 1 kg of milk.
   - Therefore, the total milk from these sheep is \( 15 \times 1 = 15 \) kg.

4. **Calculate the total milk from the sheep providing 2 kg of milk:**
   - Each of these 15 sheep provides 2 kg of milk.
   - Therefore, the total milk from these sheep is \( 15 \times 2 = 30 \) kg.

5. **Calculate the total milk collected every day:**
   - Add the milk from both groups of sheep.
   - Therefore, the total milk collected every day is \( 15 + 30 = 45 \) kg.

The final numerical answer is 45 kg."
"Mrs. Sherman made a dozen bread rolls, which is 12 rolls. She gave one roll to each of her 6 children, so she gave away 6 rolls. This leaves her with 12 - 6 = 6 rolls. She then broke each of the remaining 6 rolls into 8 pieces and fed them to the chickens. Therefore, the total number of pieces of rolls she fed to the chickens is 6 rolls * 8 pieces per roll = 48 pieces.

"First, let's determine how many apples Lucy sold on Monday. Given that she sold all the apples picked on Monday and received $56 from selling them at $4 per piece, we can calculate the number of apples sold on Monday as follows:

\[ \text{Number of apples sold on Monday} = \frac{\$56}{\$4/\text{apple}} = 14 \text{ apples} \]

Next, we know that on Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples. On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of apples picked on Wednesday is:

\[ \text{Number of apples picked on Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ apples} \]

To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we add the apples picked on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday:

\[ \text{Total number of apples} = 14 \text{ (Monday)} + 12 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 24 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 50 \text{ apples} \]

"To calculate the monthly payment for Karan, we first need to determine the total interest she will pay over the five months and then add that to the principal amount to find the total amount she will pay back. Finally, we divide this total by the number of months to find the monthly payment.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Given:
- Principal (\(P\)) = $3,650
- Rate (\(R\)) = 10% or 0.10
- Time (\(T\)) = 5 months

First, calculate the interest:
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 5 = 1825 \]

Now, calculate the total amount to be paid back:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} = 3650 + 1825 = 5475 \]

Finally, calculate the monthly payment:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{\text{Number of Months}} = \frac{5475}{5} = 1095 \]

So, Karan has to pay $1095 per month."
"First, we calculate the distance Cho hiked. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Cho, the speed is 14 kilometers per hour and the time is 8 hours. So,

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{h} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, we calculate the distance Chloe hiked. The speed for Chloe is 9 kilometers per hour and the time is 5 hours. So,

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{h} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked, we subtract the distance Chloe hiked from the distance Cho hiked:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

So, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe."
"First, let's determine the number of silver and gold pesos Anna has:

- Axel has 50 silver pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so Anna has \(2 \times 50 = 100\) silver pesos.
- Axel has 80 gold pesos. Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so Anna has \(80 + 40 = 120\) gold pesos.

Now, let's calculate the total number of silver pesos they have together:
- Axel has 50 silver pesos and Anna has 100 silver pesos, so together they have \(50 + 100 = 150\) silver pesos.

Next, let's calculate the total number of gold pesos they have together:
- Axel has 80 gold pesos and Anna has 120 gold pesos, so together they have \(80 + 120 = 200\) gold pesos.

Finally, let's calculate the total number of pesos they have together:

The final numerical answer is 350."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make:

- Each pitcher holds 12 cups.
- She can make 3 pitchers of lemonade.

Total cups of lemonade = 3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups.

Next, let's determine the total revenue from selling all the lemonade:

- She sells each cup for $1.
- She has 36 cups of lemonade.

Total revenue = 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

Now, let's calculate the cost of making the lemonade:

- She spent $18 to buy the supplies.

Total cost = $18.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $36 - $18 = $18.

Millie sells all the lemonade, so to find the profit per hour, we need to know how long the lemonade stand is open. However, the question does not specify the number of hours the lemonade stand is open. Assuming the stand is open for 1 hour (as the question implies she sells all the lemonade in that hour), the profit per hour is:

Profit per hour = $18.

Final numerical answer:
18"
"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we need to determine the total amount of land based on the information that 12.8 hectares represent the remaining 2/5 of his land.

"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 50\% \times 52 = 0.50 \times 52 = 26 \]

Since the choir is evenly split between boys and girls, the number of boys is also 26.

Next, we need to find out how many female members are performing. Since all female members are performing, the number of female members is equal to the number of girls, which is 26.

On the day of the performance, half of the female members can't make it to the show because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of female members who can't make it is:

\[ \frac{26}{2} = 13 \]

This means that the number of female members who can make it to the show is:

\[ 26 - 13 = 13 \]

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is the sum of the female members who can make it and the 3 teachers:

\[ 13 + 3 = 16 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 16 \]"
"To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his 5 test scores. The scores are 65, 94, 81, 86, and 74.

First, we sum up all the test scores:

Let's add these step by step:
\[ 65 + 94 = 159 \]
\[ 159 + 81 = 240 \]
\[ 240 + 86 = 326 \]
\[ 326 + 74 = 400 \]

So, the total sum of the scores is 400.

Next, we divide the total sum by the number of tests (which is 5) to find the average:

The cost of 6 erasers is:
\[ 6 \text{ erasers} \times \$2 \text{ per eraser} = \$12 \]

The cost of 8 pencils is:
\[ 8 \text{ pencils} \times \$3 \text{ per pencil} = \$24 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost:
\[ \$12 + \$24 = \$36 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$36 \]"
"First, we need to determine how many messages Mr. Yu receives. Since Mr. Yu receives 1/3 as many messages as Ms. Thompson, we calculate:

\[ \text{Messages to Mr. Yu} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \]

Next, we add the messages delivered to both teachers to find the total number of messages delivered:

\[ \text{Total messages} = 66 + 22 = 88 \]

So, the total number of messages delivered is:

\[ 88 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost for David who buys a ride bracelet. The ride bracelet costs $30 and gives 9 rides. So, David's total cost is $30.

Next, let's calculate the cost for Dasha who buys tickets. Each ride costs 2 tickets, and there are 9 rides. Therefore, Dasha needs 9 rides * 2 tickets/ride = 18 tickets. Since each ticket costs $2, Dasha's total cost is 18 tickets * $2/ticket = $36.

Now, we compare the total costs for David and Dasha:
- David's total cost: $30
- Dasha's total cost: $36

To find out how much money David saves, we subtract David's total cost from Dasha's total cost:
$36 - $30 = $6

Therefore, David saves $6."
"To determine how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of gifts Monica needs to wrap.
2. Divide the total length of ribbon by the total number of gifts.

First, let's calculate the total number of gifts:
- Monica has 6 gifts to wrap for her family.
- She has 4 gifts to wrap for her friends.
- She has 2 gifts to wrap for her teachers.

Total number of gifts = 6 (family) + 4 (friends) + 2 (teachers) = 12 gifts.

Next, we divide the total length of ribbon by the total number of gifts:
- Monica has 144 inches of ribbon.
- She needs to wrap 12 gifts.

Number of inches of ribbon per gift = 144 inches / 12 gifts = 12 inches per gift.

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many popsicles Betty and Sam each have based on the given ratio and total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. The total parts of the ratio are 5 + 6 = 11 parts.

Given that the total number of popsicles is 165, we can find out how many popsicles each part of the ratio represents by dividing the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts in the ratio:
\[ \text{Value of each part} = \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can find out how many popsicles Betty and Sam have:
- Betty's popsicles: \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \)
- Sam's popsicles: \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \)

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ \text{Difference} = 90 - 75 = 15 \]

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 15 \]"
"First, let's calculate the monthly cost of the streaming services after the discount:

- Hulu normally costs $10 a month.
- Disney Plus normally costs $10 a month.

The discount for bundling is 20%, so the savings per service is:
\[ \text{Savings per service} = 10 \times \frac{20}{100} = 2 \]

Therefore, the cost of each service after the discount is:
\[ \text{Cost of Hulu after discount} = 10 - 2 = 8 \]
\[ \text{Cost of Disney Plus after discount} = 10 - 2 = 8 \]

The total monthly cost for the streaming services is:
\[ \text{Total monthly cost} = 8 + 8 = 16 \]

Now, let's calculate the total monthly cost of the cable package:
\[ \text{Total monthly cost of cable} = 60 \]

Finally, the amount of money Tim saves by cancelling his cable package and getting the streaming services is:
\[ \text{Savings} = 60 - 16 = 44 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 44 \]"
"First, let's convert all the time spent into the same unit. We'll use minutes for this calculation.

Carol spends 4 hours writing a song. Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, 4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

She spends half that much time recording it, so recording takes 240 / 2 = 120 minutes.

Editing takes 90 minutes.

Now, let's add up the total time spent on all tasks:
Total time = Writing + Recording + Editing
Total time = 240 + 120 + 90 = 450 minutes.

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{90}{450} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of her total work time that Carol spent editing is 20%."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of spaces available in the shelving system and then calculate how many more books Wendy needs to place.

The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns, so the total number of spaces is:
\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in the shelving system. Let's denote the number of books she currently has as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of books she wants to place is:
\[ 2x + 20 \]

Since the total number of spaces in the shelving system is 36, the number of books she needs to carry to complete her task is:
\[ 2x + 20 = 36 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 2x + 20 = 36 \]
\[ 2x = 36 - 20 \]
\[ 2x = 16 \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, Wendy currently has 8 books. The number of books she needs to carry to fill the shelving system is:
\[ 2(8) + 20 = 16 + 20 = 36 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 36 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of cards Erica has initially:

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"Mark currently has $50 and needs $300 to buy the bike. Therefore, he needs an additional $300 - $50 = $250. Since he earns $10 per day, the number of days he needs to work to earn the additional $250 is $250 / $10 = 25 days.

The final numerical answer is 25."
"First, let's calculate the number of millipedes. Since there are 1/3 as many millipedes as spiders, and there are 90 spiders:

\[ \text{Number of millipedes} = \frac{90}{3} = 30 \]

Next, we calculate the number of stink bugs. The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12:

\[ \text{Number of stink bugs} = 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48 \]

Now, we can find the total number of bugs by adding the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs:

\[ \text{Total number of bugs} = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168 \]

So, the total number of bugs Nancy counted is 168."
"If Erica is 30 years old, and Beth is 5 years older than Erica, then Beth is 30 + 5 = 35 years old.

Since Alice is 7 years older than Beth, Alice is 35 + 7 = 42 years old.

The difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 42 - 30 = 12 years.

"To determine the builder's annual earnings, we need to calculate the number of days he works in a year and then multiply that by his daily wage.

First, let's calculate the number of days the builder works in a month:
- He works 6 days a week.
- He works 4 weeks a month.

So, the number of days he works in a month is:
\[ 6 \text{ days/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 24 \text{ days/month} \]

Next, we calculate the number of days he works in a year:
- There are 12 months in a year.

So, the number of days he works in a year is:
\[ 24 \text{ days/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 288 \text{ days/year} \]

Now, we calculate his annual earnings by multiplying the number of days he works in a year by his daily wage:
- His daily wage is $50.

So, his annual earnings are:

"To determine how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for a quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for:
- 3 cups of flour
- 1 cup of milk

For a quadruple batch, the amounts are:
- Flour: \( 3 \text{ cups} \times 4 = 12 \text{ cups} \)
- Milk: \( 1 \text{ cup} \times 4 = 4 \text{ cups} \)

Next, we need to determine how many bags of flour and bottles of milk are required.

Flour is sold in 2-cup bags:
- \( \frac{12 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups per bag}} = 6 \text{ bags} \)

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles:
- \( \frac{4 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups per bottle}} = 2 \text{ bottles} \)

Finally, to find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:
- \( 6 \text{ bags} - 2 \text{ bottles} = 4 \)

So, Mark has to buy 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the energy consumption of the air conditioner per hour.
2. Determine the daily energy consumption before and after the reduction.
3. Calculate the daily energy savings.
4. Compute the total energy savings over 30 days.

First, we know the air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, the air conditioner uses 0.9 kilowatts per hour.

Before the reduction, the air conditioner is used for 8 hours a day, so the daily energy consumption is:
\[ 0.9 \, \text{kW} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7.2 \, \text{kW} \cdot \text{hours} \]

After the reduction, the air conditioner is used for 3 hours a day, so the daily energy consumption is:
\[ 0.9 \, \text{kW} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2.7 \, \text{kW} \cdot \text{hours} \]

The daily energy savings is:
\[ 7.2 \, \text{kW} \cdot \text{hours} - 2.7 \, \text{kW} \cdot \text{hours} = 4.5 \, \text{kW} \cdot \text{hours} \]

To find the total energy savings over 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:
\[ 4.5 \, \text{kW} \cdot \text{hours/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kW} \cdot \text{hours} \]

Therefore, the total energy savings in 30 days is:
\[ 135 \, \text{kW} \cdot \text{hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 135 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of stripes on all the zebras:

- Two zebras with 17 stripes each: \(2 \times 17 = 34\)
- One zebra with 36 stripes: \(36\)
- One zebra with half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes: \(36 / 2 = 18\)

Now, let's add these numbers to get the total number of stripes:

\(34 + 36 + 18 = 88\)

To find the average number of stripes, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras:

There are 4 zebras in total, so:

\(88 / 4 = 22\)

The average number of stripes on the zebras is 22."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. **Determine the number of sandwiches needed:**
   - There are 20 people and each sandwich serves 4 people.
   - Number of sandwiches = 20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches.

2. **Calculate the total amount of meat required:**
   - Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat.
   - Total meat required = 5 sandwiches * 1 pound per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat.

3. **Calculate the total amount of cheese required:**
   - Each sandwich requires 1 pound of cheese.
   - Total cheese required = 5 sandwiches * 1 pound per sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese.

4. **Calculate the cost of the meat:**
   - Meat costs $7.00 per pound.
   - Total cost of meat = 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00.

5. **Calculate the cost of the cheese:**
   - Cheese costs $3.00 per pound.
   - Total cost of cheese = 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00.

6. **Calculate the total cost of meat and cheese:**
   - Total cost = Cost of meat + Cost of cheese = $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

Therefore, the total amount of money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese is $50.00."
"First, let's determine the initial number of corns Allan has. According to the problem, there is twice as much corn as cannolis. Given that Allan initially has 40 cannolis, we can calculate the initial number of corns as follows:

\[ \text{Initial number of corns} = 2 \times \text{Initial number of cannolis} = 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

Next, Allan bought 60 more cannolis. So, the new number of cannolis is:

\[ \text{New number of cannolis} = \text{Initial number of cannolis} + 60 = 40 + 60 = 100 \]

Allan also bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought. Since he bought 60 more cannolis, the number of corns he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of corns bought} = 60 - 40 = 20 \]

So, the new number of corns is:

\[ \text{New number of corns} = \text{Initial number of corns} + \text{Number of corns bought} = 80 + 20 = 100 \]

Now, we can find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house:

\[ \text{Combined total} = \text{New number of corns} + \text{New number of cannolis} = 100 + 100 = 200 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day. He has already completed half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which means he has taken 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps so far. He also took an additional 1,000 steps with his friend. Let's denote the steps he took during his jog as \( J \).

After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps. This means that the total steps he took before his jog was 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps.

We know he had already taken 5,000 steps before his jog and 1,000 steps with his friend, so the steps he took during his jog can be calculated as follows:

\[ J = 8,000 - (5,000 + 1,000) \]
\[ J = 8,000 - 6,000 \]
\[ J = 2,000 \]

So, Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog."
"First, we need to calculate the total number of words in the book. The book is 45 pages long and each page has 200 words. Therefore, the total number of words in the book is:
\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we calculate how long it takes Toby to read the entire book. Given that Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute, the time it takes to read the book is:
\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby plans to leave the place where he is reading the book as soon as he finishes the book. It takes him 30 minutes to read the book. He also needs 10 minutes to get to the airport. Therefore, the total time he will spend is:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby has 60 minutes until he needs to be at the airport. The number of minutes early Toby will be is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money paid to the employees in May and June, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the total amount paid in May:
- Number of employees hired in May: 40
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours worked per week: 40
- Weeks in a month (considering a month as 4 weeks for simplicity): 4

The weekly wage for one employee is:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} = 600 \text{ dollars/week} \]

The total wage for one employee in May is:
\[ 600 \text{ dollars/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

The total wage for all 40 employees in May is:
\[ 2400 \text{ dollars/employee} \times 40 \text{ employees} = 96000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount paid in June:
- Number of employees whose contracts expired: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \)
- Number of employees whose contracts did not expire: \( 40 - 10 = 30 \)

The total wage for the 30 employees whose contracts did not expire in June is:
\[ 2400 \text{ dollars/employee} \times 30 \text{ employees} = 72000 \text{ dollars} \]

The total wage for the 10 employees whose contracts expired in June is:
\[ 600 \text{ dollars/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} \times 10 \text{ employees} = 24000 \text{ dollars} \]

The total wage for all employees in June is:
\[ 72000 \text{ dollars} + 24000 \text{ dollars} = 96000 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means for every 2 pounds of taffy, Sally pays $3 for the first pound and only $1.50 for the second pound (since it's half off).

For 2 pounds of taffy:
- The first pound costs $3.
- The second pound costs $1.50.
- Total cost for taffy = $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets:
- The seashells cost $1.50.
- Each magnet costs $0.25, and she bought 4 magnets, so the total cost for the magnets is $0.25 * 4 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
- Total cost = Cost of taffy + Cost of seashells + Cost of magnets
- Total cost = $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00.

Sally's parents gave her $10 initially. To find out how much money Sally has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from the initial amount:
- Money left = Initial amount - Total cost
- Money left = $10 - $7.00 = $3.00.

The final numerical answer is $3.00."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the two packs of fireworks. The first pack costs $400, and the second pack costs twice as much, which is $800. So, the total cost for the two packs is:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the $1200. A 20% discount means Tim pays 80% of the total cost of the fireworks. So, we calculate 80% of $1200:

\[ 1200 \times 0.80 = 960 \]

Now, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted cost of the fireworks:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is:

\[ 1110 \]"

"Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees as \( A_{\text{tall}} \), from the shortest trees as \( A_{\text{short}} \), and from the average trees as \( A_{\text{avg}} \).

From the problem, we know:
- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, so \( A_{\text{tall}} = 30 \).
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, so \( A_{\text{short}} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \).
- Joanne gathers \( A_{\text{avg}} \) apples from the average trees.

Her sister gathers:
- Twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
- Three times as many apples from the shortest trees, so \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
- No apples from the average trees, so \( 0 \) apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne and her sister is 500. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total apples gathered as:
\[ A_{\text{tall}} + A_{\text{short}} + A_{\text{avg}} + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 30 + 15 + A_{\text{avg}} + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Simplifying the left side:
\[ 150 + A_{\text{avg}} = 500 \]

Solving for \( A_{\text{avg}} \):
\[ A_{\text{avg}} = 500 - 150 \]
\[ A_{\text{avg}} = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 350 \]"
"Let's denote the number of camels as \( c \) and the number of dromedaries as \( d \).

From the problem, we have two equations:
1. The total number of heads: \( c + d = 180 \)
2. The total number of humps: \( 2c + d = 304 \)

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, we can express \( c \) in terms of \( d \) from the first equation:
\[ c = 180 - d \]

Next, we substitute \( c = 180 - d \) into the second equation:
\[ 2(180 - d) + d = 304 \]
\[ 360 - 2d + d = 304 \]
\[ 360 - d = 304 \]
\[ -d = 304 - 360 \]
\[ -d = -56 \]
\[ d = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

   - Total distance for 7 days: \( 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \)

Now, we sum up all the distances:
- First 4 days: 800 km
- Next 2 days: 240 km
- Next day: 0 km
- Second week: 2100 km

Total distance traveled: \( 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km} \)

The total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is 3140 kilometers."
"To solve this problem, we need to work through the relationships between the sizes of the lockers step by step.

1. **Peter's locker size**: Given as 5 cubic inches.
2. **Zack's locker size**: Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. Therefore, if Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, Zack's locker must be 4 times larger than Peter's locker. So, Zack's locker size is \(5 \times 4 = 20\) cubic inches.
3. **Timothy's locker size**: Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. Therefore, if Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches, Timothy's locker must be twice as large as Zack's locker. So, Timothy's locker size is \(20 \times 2 = 40\) cubic inches.

The final numerical answer for Timothy's locker size is 40 cubic inches."
"Stanley's comb fell from an elevation of 10,000 feet to 6,000 feet (10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet). Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet - 6,000 feet = -3,000 feet. However, since we are calculating the distance to reach Stanley's comb, we take the absolute value of the difference, which is 3,000 feet.

The final numerical answer is 3000 feet."
"To determine Mr. Josue's total capital after receiving funds from the banks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of money given by the second bank.
2. Sum the amounts given by both banks.
3. Add the total amount received from the banks to his initial capital.

First, the second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank. Since the first bank gave him $4000, the second bank gave him:
\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Next, we sum the amounts given by both banks:
\[ 4000 + 8000 = 12000 \]

Now, we add this total to his initial capital of $5000:
\[ 5000 + 12000 = 17000 \]

Therefore, Mr. Josue now has:
\[ 17000 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 17000 \]"
"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, which means a total of \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cats were taken away. Therefore, the number of cats remaining on the rock after the boats left is \(50 - 20 = 30\).

Later, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse they'd seen. The number of cats that ran away is \(\frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18\). Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is \(30 - 18 = 12\).

The final numerical answer is 12."
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service for Bill, we need to break down the cost into different periods based on the pricing changes.

1. **First 6 months**: The cost is $8 per month.
   \[
   6 \text{ months} \times \$8/\text{month} = \$48
   \]

2. **Next 2 months (months 7 and 8)**: The cost is the normal price of $12 per month.
   \[
   2 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$24
   \]

3. **Next 18 months (months 9 to 26)**: The cost is the increased price of $14 per month.
   \[
   18 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$252
   \]

Now, we sum up the costs for all periods:
\[
\$48 + \$24 + \$252 = \$324
\]

Therefore, the total cost for 2 years of the service is:
\[
\boxed{324}
\]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:

\[ \text{Cost of jogger jeans} = 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of both jeans:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 28 + 22 = 50 \]

Cole saved a total of $6, and he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. Let's denote the total savings as \( S \). Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can write:

\[ \frac{1}{3}S = \text{Savings from jogger jeans} \]
\[ \frac{2}{3}S = \text{Savings from tattered jeans} \]

Given that the total savings \( S \) is $6, we can find the savings from each type of jeans:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \]

So, he saved $2 from the jogger jeans and $4 from the tattered jeans. Now, we need to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. We already know the original cost of the tattered jeans is $28 and the original cost of the jogger jeans is $22. The difference in cost is:

\[ \text{Difference} = 28 - 22 = 6 \]

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 more than the tattered jeans. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To calculate the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to add up the capacities of all the vehicles rented.

First, we calculate the capacity of the buses:
\[ 4 \text{ buses} \times 60 \text{ employees per bus} = 240 \text{ employees} \]

Next, we calculate the capacity of the minibusses:
\[ 6 \text{ minibusses} \times 30 \text{ employees per minibus} = 180 \text{ employees} \]

Then, we calculate the capacity of the minivans:
\[ 10 \text{ minivans} \times 15 \text{ employees per minivan} = 150 \text{ employees} \]

Finally, we add up the capacities of all the vehicles:
\[ 240 \text{ employees} + 180 \text{ employees} + 150 \text{ employees} = 570 \text{ employees} \]

So, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"First, let's determine the total number of bird feeders Lillian has. She builds 3 and buys 3 more, so the total number of bird feeders is:
\[ 3 + 3 = 6 \]

Next, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders. Each store-bought feeder attracts 20 birds per day. Since there are 3 store-bought feeders, the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders is:
\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

Now, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted by the bird feeders Lillian made herself. Each of these feeders attracts 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so each of her feeders attracts:
\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ birds per day} \]
Since she made 3 feeders, the total number of birds attracted by her feeders is:
\[ 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we add the number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders and the number of birds attracted by her own feeders:
\[ 60 + 90 = 150 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 150 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the soup. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. The bagel costs $4.

To find 25% of $4:
\[ 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]

So, the soup costs:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Next, we know the cake costs half of the price of the bagel. The bagel costs $4, so:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Now, we add up the costs of the soup, the bagel, and the cake to find the total cost of the dinner:
\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \]

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for the dinner she ordered."
"Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( x \).

Kenny keeps \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his cards, so he sells \( \frac{2}{3} \) of them. The number of cards he sells is \( \frac{2}{3}x \).

He sells each card for $1.5, so the total amount of money he earns from selling the cards is \( 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}x = x \).

According to the problem, after spending $50 on the ticket, he has $50 left. This means the total amount of money he earned from selling the cards is $100 (the cost of the ticket plus the $50 he has left).

So, we have the equation:
\[ x = 100 \]

Therefore, Kenny started with 100 cards."
"First, let's determine how many hotdogs were prepared initially. Since half of the 40 guests would have two hotdogs each, we calculate:

\[
\frac{40}{2} \times 2 = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ hotdogs}
\]

This means the caterer prepared 40 hotdogs. However, since 40 guests showed up and each guest wanted a second hotdog, we need to see if there are enough hotdogs for everyone to have a second one. Since there are only 40 hotdogs and 40 guests, only 40 guests can have a second hotdog. This means that 0 guests did not get a second hotdog.

The final numerical answer is:

\[
0
\]"
"First, let's determine the number of letters in Indras' sister's name. We know that Indras' name has 6 letters. Half of the letters in Indras' name is:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than this amount, so:

\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Now, to find the total number of letters in both names, we add the number of letters in Indras' name to the number of letters in her sister's name:

\[ 6 + 7 = 13 \]

So, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Mixing bowls: $20.00
- Utensils: 5 utensils at $5.00 each, so 5 * $5.00 = $25.00

Total cost before discount = $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Now, let's calculate the discount amount:

- The discount is 20%, so the discount amount is 20% of $165.00.

Discount amount = 20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00

Finally, let's calculate the total cost after the discount:

Total cost after discount = Total cost before discount - Discount amount
Total cost after discount = $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

So, the final numerical answer is $132.00."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Dora wants to buy:
- Skipping rope: $6
- Board game: $11
- Playground ball: $2

Total cost = $6 + $11 + $2 = $19

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Dora has:
- Money from allowance: $2
- Money from mother: $16

Total money Dora has = $2 + $16 = $18

Now, let's find out how much more money Dora needs:
Money needed = Total cost - Total money Dora has
Money needed = $19 - $18 = $1

So, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball."
"First, let's determine how many dragons Prince Arthur slew. Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons, and Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many. 

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Arthur} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \]

Next, we calculate how many dragons Prince Walter slew. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur.

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Walter} = 2 \times 75 = 150 \]

Finally, we determine how many dragons Prince Bruce slew. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter.

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Bruce} = \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30 \]

So, the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew is 30."
"First, we need to determine how much gas is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we can calculate the amount of gas per container as follows:

\[ \text{Gas per container} = \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5 \text{ containers}} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Next, we need to find out how much gas Josey needed. Josey needed \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a container, which is:

\[ \text{Gas needed by Josey} = \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert the amount of gas needed from gallons to pints. Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we can convert \( \frac{3}{4} \) gallons to pints as follows:

\[ \text{Gas needed by Josey in pints} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints per gallon} = \frac{3 \times 8}{4} \text{ pints} = \frac{24}{4} \text{ pints} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \text{ pints} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine how much money George spent on chips. We know that George got 3 bags of chips and each bag costs 40 cents. Therefore, the total cost for the chips is:
\[ 3 \times 40 \text{ cents} = 120 \text{ cents} \]

Since George spent $5, which is 500 cents, and he had 1% of his money left after buying the chips, we can calculate the amount of money he had left:
\[ 500 \text{ cents} \times 0.01 = 5 \text{ cents} \]

This means the amount of money George spent on chips and candy bars is:
\[ 500 \text{ cents} - 5 \text{ cents} = 495 \text{ cents} \]

Since he spent 120 cents on chips, the amount of money he spent on candy bars is:
\[ 495 \text{ cents} - 120 \text{ cents} = 375 \text{ cents} \]

Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so the number of candy bars George bought is:
\[ \frac{375 \text{ cents}}{75 \text{ cents per candy bar}} = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of candy bars George bought is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"

"Rory and her mom each have a piece, which means they have 2 pieces in total. The cake weighs 20 ounces, and Rory cuts it into 8 pieces. Therefore, the weight of each piece is 20 ounces / 8 pieces = 2.5 ounces per piece. Since Rory and her mom have 2 pieces, the weight of the pieces they have is 2 pieces * 2.5 ounces/piece = 5 ounces. The remaining cake weighs 20 ounces - 5 ounces = 15 ounces."
"First, we need to find the total number of oranges. Sitti bought 34 oranges and Juris bought 22 oranges. So, the total number of oranges is:

\[ 34 + 22 = 56 \]

Next, we need to determine how many people will be sharing the oranges. Sitti and Juris are sharing with their 6 other friends, so the total number of people is:

\[ 2 + 6 = 8 \]

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people:

\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

So, everyone will get 7 oranges. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 7 \]"
"First, let's determine the amount of onions Antoine uses. The recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, and he doubles that amount:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00 \text{ per pound} = \$8.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box is $2.00:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00 \text{ per box} = \$4.00 \]

Adding the cost of the onions and the beef stock gives us the total cost:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

Antoine's soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

\[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00 \text{ per serving} \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is:

\[ \$2.00 \]"
"First, let's determine the time it takes for Wayne to drive to the theater. According to the problem, it takes Wayne 4 minutes to drive to the theater.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes for Bernadette to drive to the theater. The problem states that the drive from Bernadette’s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne’s hotel. Therefore, we calculate the time for Bernadette's drive as follows:

\[
\text{Time for Bernadette's drive} = 4 \times \text{Time for Wayne's drive} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes}
\]

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to drive to the theater, we need to determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.

\[
\text{Time Bernadette should leave} = \text{Time Wayne takes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 4 + 5 = 9 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, Bernadette should leave 9 minutes before Wayne to arrive at the theater 5 minutes before him.

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{9}

"To solve this problem, we need to first convert the length from yards to feet, since the area is given in square feet. There are 3 feet in a yard, so the length of the room in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area formula for a rectangle, which is:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

Given that the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, we can solve for the width:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{width} \]

\[ \text{width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can calculate the perimeter of the rectangle using the perimeter formula:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) \]

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} \]

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

So, the perimeter of Billie's bedroom is 98 feet."

So, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth."
"First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven. Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour.

\[ \text{Temperature increase from oven} = 3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, let's calculate the temperature decrease due to the window. Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.

\[ \text{Temperature decrease from window} = \left(\frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes}}\right) \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 3 \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 6 \text{ degrees} \]

Now, let's add the initial temperature of the house, the temperature increase from the oven, and the temperature decrease from the window.

\[ \text{Final temperature} = 40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees} \]

The house's final temperature is 49 degrees."
"First, let's convert all times to minutes for easier calculation:
- Jon's total time: \(40 + 80 + 50 = 170\) minutes.
- James' swim time: \(40 \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36\) minutes.
- James' bike time: \(80 + 5 = 85\) minutes.
- James' run time: unknown, let's call it \(R\) minutes.

James' total time is the sum of his swim, bike, and run times:
\[36 + 85 + R = 121 + R\]

Jon won the race by 10 minutes, so James' total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's:
\[170 + 10 = 180\]

Setting up the equation for James' total time:
\[121 + R = 180\]

Solving for \(R\):
\[R = 180 - 121 = 59\]

James took 59 minutes to do the run. The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to calculate the distance the horse runs. The horse runs at a speed of 32 miles per hour for 30 minutes, which is half an hour. The distance can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Given the speed is 32 miles per hour and the time is 0.5 hours, the distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = 32 \times 0.5 = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how much hay the horse eats. The horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile. Therefore, for 16 miles, the horse will eat:

\[ \text{Hay needed} = 16 \times \frac{1}{2} = 8 \text{ bails} \]

The cost of one bail of hay is $3, so the total cost for 8 bails is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 \times 3 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which means he has:

\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the hay, the change Michael has is:

\[ \text{Change} = 30 - 24 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as \( P \).

The cost of the super ticket is $20, and the cost of one popcorn with a soda with the super ticket is $21 (since the popcorn and soda cost $1 extra).

The cost of buying a movie ticket for $12 and a popcorn and a soda at regular price is:
\[ 12 + P + 3 = 15 + P \]

According to the problem, you saved $2 by choosing the super ticket, so the cost of the super ticket is $2 more than the cost of buying a movie ticket and a popcorn and a soda at regular price. This gives us the equation:
\[ 20 = 15 + P + 2 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 20 = 17 + P \]
\[ P = 20 - 17 \]
\[ P = 3 \]

The regular price of popcorn is $3."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the original cost per balloon:**
   - The total cost for 20 balloons was $900.
   - Therefore, the cost per balloon was:
     \[
     \text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine the new cost per balloon after the price increase:**
   - The cost per balloon increased by $20.
   - Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:

     \text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for 170 balloons at the new price:**
   - With the new cost per balloon being $65, the total cost for 170 balloons is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 170 \times 65
     \]

4. **Perform the multiplication to find the total cost:**
   - First, break down the multiplication:
     \[
     170 \times 65 = 170 \times (60 + 5) = (170 \times 60) + (170 \times 5)
     \]
   - Calculate each part separately:
     \[
     170 \times 60 = 10200
     \]
     \[
     170 \times 5 = 850
     \]
   - Add the results together:
     \[
     10200 + 850 = 11050
     \]

Therefore, the total cost for Bentley to fill 170 balloons after the price increase is:
\[
\boxed{11050}

"To find the average speed of the car during the entire trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

First, calculate the distance for each segment of the trip:
- For the first segment: \(60 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles}\)
- For the second segment: \(30 \text{ mph} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 30 \text{ miles}\)

Next, add the distances to find the total distance:
- Total distance = \(120 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 150 \text{ miles}\)

Now, calculate the total time taken:
- Total time = \(2 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} = 3 \text{ hours}\)

Finally, calculate the average speed:
- Average speed = \(\frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ mph}\)

The car's average speed during the trip is 50 mph."
"First, let's determine how many sapphires Jenna has left after the trade. Jenna starts with 8 sapphires and trades 3 of them, so she has:

\[ 8 - 3 = 5 \text{ sapphires} \]

Next, we calculate the value of the sapphires Jenna has left. Since each sapphire is worth $800, the value of the 5 sapphires is:

\[ 5 \times 800 = 4000 \text{ dollars} \]

Jenna trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. Now, we need to determine the value of the 2 rubies. Since each ruby is worth $1200, the value of the 2 rubies is:

\[ 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the total value of all her jewels, we add the value of the sapphires and the value of the rubies:

\[ 4000 + 2400 = 6400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total value of all her jewels is:

\[ 6400 \text{ dollars} \]"
"To find out how many apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many apples one person eats in 30 days.
2. Multiply that number by 2, since there are two people (Marin and Nancy).

First, let's calculate how many apples one person eats in 30 days:
\[ 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples} \]

Now, since there are two people:
\[ 120 \text{ apples/person} \times 2 \text{ people} = 240 \text{ apples} \]

So, the total number of apples they eat in 30 days is:
\[ 240 \]

Final numerical answer:

"First, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the raised bed) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

For one raised bed, the volume is:

\[ V = 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:

\[ \text{Total Volume} = 10 \times 32 \, \text{cubic feet} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of Bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet per bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{dollars per bag} = 1920 \, \text{dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 1920 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of green cards. We know that there are 15 red cards and that the number of green cards is 60% more than the number of red cards.

The number of green cards can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Number of green cards} = \text{Number of red cards} + 0.60 \times \text{Number of red cards} \]
\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + 0.60 \times 15 \]
\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + 9 \]
\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 24 \]

Next, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards:
\[ \text{Number of yellow cards} = \text{Number of red cards} + \text{Number of green cards} \]
\[ \text{Number of yellow cards} = 15 + 24 \]
\[ \text{Number of yellow cards} = 39 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of cards:
\[ \text{Total number of cards} = \text{Number of red cards} + \text{Number of green cards} + \text{Number of yellow cards} \]
\[ \text{Total number of cards} = 15 + 24 + 39 \]
\[ \text{Total number of cards} = 78 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"Katelyn initially saw 50 fairies. Her friend saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw, which is 50 / 2 = 25 fairies. So, after the friend saw the fairies, the total number of fairies became 50 + 25 = 75 fairies. Then, 30 fairies flew away, leaving 75 - 30 = 45 fairies remaining.

The final numerical answer is 45."
"To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we first need to calculate the total number of puppies and the total number of spotted puppies.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies with 3 having spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies with 4 having spots.

The total number of puppies is:
\[ 8 + 12 = 20 \]

The total number of spotted puppies is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

The percentage of all the puppies that have spots is calculated by the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of Spotted Puppies}}{\text{Total Number of Puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 35\% \]

So, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is:

"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of the feed.

1. **Sugar Cubes:**
   - 2 boxes, each 1 pound.
   - Total weight = 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

2. **Carrots:**
   - 4 bags, each 12 pounds.
   - Total weight = 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

3. **Hay:**
   - 42 bales, each 75 pounds.
   - Total weight = 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

4. **Oats:**
   - 20 sacks, each 65 pounds.
   - Total weight = 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

Now, we sum the weights of all the feed items to find the total weight:
- Total weight = 2 (sugar cubes) + 48 (carrots) + 3150 (hay) + 1300 (oats) = 4500 pounds.

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find the number of trips needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number since partial trips are not possible:
- Number of trips = 4500 / 2250 = 2.

Since 2 trips are not enough (as 2 trips would only carry 4500 / 2 = 2250 pounds), the farmer needs 3 trips to transport all the feed.

The final numerical answer is:
3 trips"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the weekly earnings from recycling cans and bottles and then extend that to a four-week period.

First, let's calculate the weekly earnings:
- An aluminum can is worth 2 cents.
- A plastic bottle is worth 3 cents.
- Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans a week, so she earns \(3 \times 2 = 6\) cents from aluminum cans.
- Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles a week, so she earns \(5 \times 3 = 15\) cents from plastic bottles.
- Therefore, her total weekly earnings are \(6 + 15 = 21\) cents.

Next, we calculate her earnings for a four-week period:
- Since she earns 21 cents per week, in four weeks she earns \(21 \times 4 = 84\) cents.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how many plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we can calculate the number of plants Toni has as follows:

\[ \text{Toni's plants} = \text{Frederick's plants} + 0.60 \times \text{Frederick's plants} \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 0.60 \times 10 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 6 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 16 \]

Now, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So, we can calculate the number of plants Shondra has as follows:

\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = \text{Toni's plants} - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 16 - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 9 \]

Therefore, Shondra has 9 plants."

"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll use inches.

1 foot = 12 inches

The shark's length is 10 feet, which is:
10 feet * 12 inches/foot = 120 inches

Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is:
2 * 6 inches = 12 inches

Now, to find what percentage of the shark's body length the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Length of remoras}}{\text{Shark's length}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{120 \text{ inches}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{12}{120} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

   - Therefore, one horse consumes \(5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day}\).

2. **Calculate the total amount of oats consumed by all four horses per day:**
   - There are four horses.
   - Each horse consumes 10 pounds of oats per day.
   - Therefore, all four horses consume \(10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}\).

3. **Calculate the total amount of oats consumed by all four horses for five days:**
   - The horses consume 40 pounds of oats per day.
   - They are fed for 5 days.
   - Therefore, the total consumption is \(40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds}\).

4. **Calculate the number of bags of oats needed:**
   - Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats.
   - The total consumption is 200 pounds.
   - Therefore, the number of bags needed is \(200 \text{ pounds} \div 50 \text{ pounds/bag} = 4 \text{ bags}\).

The final numerical answer is 4 bags of oats."

So, Sally spends $32 in all."
"To solve this, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Cost of 2 packs of razors without any discounts:**
   - Each pack costs $4.00.
   - Heather buys 2 packs.
   - Total cost without any discounts = $4.00 * 2 = $8.00.

2. **Applying the ""buy one get one free"" promotion:**
   - For every pack bought, one pack is free.
   - Heather buys 2 packs, but only pays for 1 pack.
   - Total cost after the promotion = $4.00.

3. **Applying the $2.00 coupon:**
   - The total cost after the promotion is $4.00.
   - Heather has a $2.00 coupon.
   - Total cost after applying the coupon = $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

4. **Calculating the cost per razor:**
   - Heather buys 2 packs.
   - Each pack contains 4 razors.
   - Total number of razors = 2 packs * 4 razors/pack = 8 razors.
   - Total cost = $2.00.
   - Cost per razor = $2.00 / 8 razors = $0.25 per razor.

5. **Converting the cost to cents:**

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total height of the human pyramid by summing the heights of all the cheerleaders and then converting the total height from inches to feet.

First, let's determine the total number of cheerleaders:
- 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall.
- 1 cheerleader is 60 inches tall.

Total number of cheerleaders = 9 * 64 + 1 * 60 = 576 + 60 = 636 inches.

Next, we need to distribute these 636 inches into the structure of the human pyramid:
- 4 girls on the bottom level.
- 3 girls on the second level.
- 2 girls on the third level.
- 1 girl on the top level.

The total height of the pyramid in inches is the sum of the heights of all these levels.

Let's denote the height of the top girl as \( h \). Since the top girl is the shortest, she is 60 inches tall. The other girls are 64 inches tall.

The total height of the pyramid in inches is:
\[ 4 \times 64 + 3 \times 64 + 2 \times 64 + 1 \times 60 \]

Calculating the total height:
\[ 4 \times 64 = 256 \]
\[ 3 \times 64 = 192 \]
\[ 2 \times 64 = 128 \]
\[ 1 \times 60 = 60 \]

Adding these together:
\[ 256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636 \]

Now, we convert the total height from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot:
\[ \frac{636}{12} = 53 \]

So, the height of the human pyramid in feet is:
\[ 53 \]"

- Total cost for 14 days = $8 × 14 = $112

So, the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is $112."
"First, let's calculate the total number of oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box, so:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, let's add the total number of oranges brought by both Ashley and Brianne:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Since one greek orange pie needs three oranges, the number of pies they can make is:

"To determine the number of guests for which the costs of the two venues are equal, we need to set up an equation for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let's denote the number of guests by \( n \).

**Cost at the first venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Cost of food per guest: $5
- Total cost at the first venue: \( 200 + 5n \)

**Cost at the second venue:**
- Cost per guest: $25
- Cost of food per guest: $0 (included in the price)
- Total cost at the second venue: \( 25n \)

We need to find the value of \( n \) for which the costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5n = 25n \]

Now, solve for \( n \):
\[ 200 + 5n = 25n \]
\[ 200 = 25n - 5n \]
\[ 200 = 20n \]
\[ n = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ n = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \( D \). According to the problem, Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects. Additionally, David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.

The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ D = 9 \]

Now, we know David found 9 insects. Since Lily found 7 more than David, we calculate the number of insects Lily found as follows:

\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

So, Lily found 16 insects. The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to add the fractions of a skein they each used and then convert that to yards.

Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein, and her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein. First, we need to add these fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4}
\]

So, they used \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein of yarn altogether.

Since there are 364 yards in a skein, we can find out how many yards are in \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein by multiplying:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 364 = \frac{3 \times 364}{4} = \frac{1092}{4} = 273
\]

Therefore, the total number of yards of yarn they used altogether is 273 yards."

"First, let's determine the width of the rug. Since the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair and the chair is 3 feet wide, the rug's width is:

\[ \text{Rug's width} = \text{Chair's width} + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the length of the couch. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Since the rug's width is 8 feet, twice the width of the rug is:

\[ 2 \times \text{Rug's width} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the length of the couch is:

\[ \text{Couch's length} = 2 \times \text{Rug's width} + 2 = 16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet} \]

So, the length of the couch is 18 feet."
"Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( S \), the cost of each pack of grape gum as \( G \), and the cost of the small pack of green apple gum as \( A \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Suzie bought four packs of gum in total.
2. She bought two packs of strawberry gum, so the cost for strawberry gum is \( 2S \).
3. She bought one pack of grape gum, so the cost for grape gum is \( G \).
4. She bought one small pack of green apple gum, so the cost for green apple gum is \( A \).
5. The total cost for all the gum is $7.
6. The cost of grape gum is $2, so \( G = 2 \).
7. The cost of the green apple gum is half the cost of the grape gum, so \( A = \frac{1}{2}G = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 = 1 \).

Now, we can set up the equation for the total cost:
\[ 2S + G + A = 7 \]
Substituting the known values of \( G \) and \( A \):
\[ 2S + 2 + 1 = 7 \]
\[ 2S + 3 = 7 \]
Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 4 \]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's determine how many 2 x 4 pieces Frederick can buy with $24. Each 2 x 4 costs $4.

\[ \text{Number of 2 x 4 pieces} = \frac{\$24}{\$4} = 6 \]

Next, let's determine how many 2 x 8 pieces Frederick can buy with $24. Each 2 x 8 costs $6.

"To determine the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his sled dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
2. Determine the number of pairs of legs (since each pair of snowshoes is for one pair of legs).
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of pairs of legs.

First, we know that each dog has 4 legs and there are 6 dogs:
\[ 4 \text{ legs/dog} \times 6 \text{ dogs} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Next, since each pair of snowshoes covers one pair of legs, we need to find out how many pairs of legs there are:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs/pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs of legs} \]

Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, so the total cost for 12 pairs of snowshoes is:
\[ 12 \text{ pairs} \times 12 \text{ dollars/pair} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is:

"To calculate how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we first need to determine how much she spends on bus trips without the pass.

Janet takes two bus trips each day and does this five days a week. Therefore, the number of bus trips she takes in a week is:
\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 10 \text{ trips/week} \]

Each bus trip costs her $2.20, so the total cost for the bus trips in a week is:
\[ 10 \text{ trips/week} \times \$2.20/\text{trip} = \$22.00 \text{ per week} \]

If Janet buys a weekly bus pass for $20, the savings per week would be:
\[ \$22.00 - \$20.00 = \$2.00 \]

So, Janet would save $2.00 by buying the weekly bus pass."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has 20 sheep.
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does. This means the zoo has \(2 \times 30 = 60\) cows.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. This means the farm has \(\frac{20}{2} = 10\) sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo combined:

- The farm has \(30\) cows + \(10\) sheep = \(40\) animals.
- The zoo has \(60\) cows + \(20\) sheep = \(80\) animals.

Therefore, the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo combined is \(40 + 80 = 120\).

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought based on the information given.

First, we know that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought. Let's denote the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought as \( S \).

Given:
- Rose bought 12 onions.
- Rose bought 4 potatoes.
- Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.

From the information, we can set up the following equations:
\[ 4S = 12 \text{ (onions)} \]
\[ 4S = 4 \text{ (potatoes)} \]

We can solve for \( S \) using either equation since they are equal:
\[ S = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \]
\[ S = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

Both equations give us the same value for \( S \), which is 3. Therefore, Sophia bought 3 onions and 3 potatoes.

To find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought:
\[ \text{Total} = 3 \text{ onions} + 3 \text{ potatoes} = 6 \]

So, Sophia bought a total of 6 onions and potatoes.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we first need to calculate the total number of calories he needs to burn to lose 30 pounds.

Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose one pound. Therefore, to lose 30 pounds, he needs to burn:
\[ 3500 \, \text{calories/pound} \times 30 \, \text{pounds} = 105000 \, \text{calories} \]

Next, we need to determine the number of days Andy has until his birthday. Today is December 31st, and his birthday is July 19th. We count the days from December 31st to July 19th.

- December has 31 days, so from December 31st to December 19th is 19 days.
- January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 19th is 19 days.
- February has 28 days in a non-leap year, so from February 1st to February 19th is 19 days.
- March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 19th is 19 days.
- April has 30 days, so from April 1st to April 19th is 18 days.
- May has 31 days, so from May 1st to May 19th is 19 days.
- June has 30 days, so from June 1st to June 19th is 19 days.
- July 1st to July 19th is 19 days.

Adding these up, we get:
\[ 19 + 19 + 19 + 19 + 18 + 19 + 19 + 19 = 149 \, \text{days} \]

Now, to find the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to maintain, we divide the total calories he needs to burn by the number of days:
\[ \frac{105000 \, \text{calories}}{149 \, \text{days}} \approx 710.34 \, \text{calories/day} \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, Andy needs to maintain a daily calorie deficit of approximately 710 calories."

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000.
2. The house costs three times as much as the lot.

We can express these as the following equations:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]
\[ H = 3L \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now that we know the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house using the second equation:
\[ H = 3L \]
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So, the house cost $90,000."

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has:

- Ali has four $10 bills, which is \(4 \times 10 = 40\) dollars.
- Ali has six $20 bills, which is \(6 \times 20 = 120\) dollars.

So, the total amount of money Ali has is \(40 + 120 = 160\) dollars.

Next, Ali gives half of the total money to his sister:

- Half of 160 dollars is \(160 \div 2 = 80\) dollars.

"To determine the total number of skeins of wool Martha will need, we first calculate the number of each item she needs to knit for her 3 grandchildren, and then multiply by the number of skeins required for each item.

For each grandchild:
- Hats: 3 hats
- Scarves: 3 scarves
- Sweaters: 3 sweaters
- Mittens: 3 pairs of mittens
- Socks: 3 pairs of socks

Now, we calculate the total number of each item for 3 grandchildren:
- Hats: \(3 \text{ hats} \times 2 \text{ skeins per hat} = 6 \text{ skeins}\)
- Scarves: \(3 \text{ scarves} \times 4 \text{ skeins per scarf} = 12 \text{ skeins}\)
- Sweaters: \(3 \text{ sweaters} \times 12 \text{ skeins per sweater} = 36 \text{ skeins}\)
- Mittens: \(3 \text{ pairs} \times 1 \text{ skein per pair} = 3 \text{ skeins}\)
- Socks: \(3 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ skeins per pair} = 6 \text{ skeins}\)

Finally, we sum up all the skeins needed:
\[6 \text{ (hats)} + 12 \text{ (scarves)} + 36 \text{ (sweaters)} + 3 \text{ (mittens)} + 6 \text{ (socks)} = 63 \text{ skeins}\]

Therefore, Martha will need to buy 63 skeins of wool."
"First, let's calculate the number of problems Chris completes on Tuesday. Since he completes 3 times as many problems on Tuesday as he did on Monday, and he completed 12 problems on Monday, the number of problems he completes on Tuesday is:

\[ 12 \times 3 = 36 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of problems completed by the end of Tuesday:

\[ 12 \text{ (Monday)} + 36 \text{ (Tuesday)} = 48 \]

Now, we determine the number of problems remaining after Tuesday:

\[ 100 - 48 = 52 \]

On Wednesday, Chris completes one-quarter of the remaining problems. Therefore, the number of problems he completes on Wednesday is:

\[ \frac{52}{4} = 13 \]

Finally, we calculate the number of problems remaining after Wednesday:

\[ 52 - 13 = 39 \]

So, the number of math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday is:

\[ 39 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of quarts each person can pick per hour:

- Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.
- Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
- Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick \(5 \times 2 = 10\) quarts per hour.
- Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than does Kathy, so Ricky can pick \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, let's add up the quarts picked per hour by all four individuals:

- Tony: 6 quarts
- Bobby: 5 quarts
- Kathy: 10 quarts
- Ricky: 8 quarts

Total quarts picked per hour = \(6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29\) quarts.

The final numerical answer is 29."

"First, let's calculate Ada's daily electric consumption before adding the new device:
- Ada's daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour
- New device's daily consumption: 2 kilowatts per hour
- Total daily consumption after adding the new device: 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour

Next, let's calculate the daily cost of electricity:
- Cost per kilowatt per hour: $1.50
- Daily cost after adding the new device: 14 * $1.50 = $21.00

Now, let's calculate the weekly cost of electricity:
- Weekly cost after adding the new device: $21.00 * 7 = $147.00

Before adding the new device, Ada's daily consumption was 12 kilowatts per hour, so the daily cost was:
- Daily cost before adding the new device: 12 * $1.50 = $18.00

And the weekly cost before adding the new device:
- Weekly cost before adding the new device: $18.00 * 7 = $126.00

Finally, let's find the difference between the weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device:
- Difference: $147.00 - $126.00 = $21.00

The difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is $21.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the work rate of one person and then scale it up for 5 people.

1. One person can paint half a house in 5 days. Therefore, one person can paint a whole house in 10 days.
2. The work rate of one person is \(\frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}}\).
3. For 5 people working together, their combined work rate is \(5 \times \frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{2 \text{ days}}\).
4. This means that 5 people can paint a whole house in 2 days.
5. Since there are 24 hours in a day, 2 days is equal to \(2 \times 24 = 48\) hours.

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

The final numerical answer is 48."
"Let's denote the number of sofas Ophelia has as \( S_O \) and the number of chairs Ophelia has as \( C_O \). Similarly, let's denote the number of sofas Jenna has as \( S_J \) and the number of chairs Jenna has as \( C_J \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Ophelia has 20 sofas, so \( S_O = 20 \).
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so \( S_O = C_O - 2 \). Substituting \( S_O = 20 \) into this equation, we get \( 20 = C_O - 2 \), which means \( C_O = 22 \).
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so \( C_J = 3 \times C_O = 3 \times 22 = 66 \).
4. Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so \( S_J = C_J - 2 = 66 - 2 = 64 \).

Now, we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together:
- Total sofas = \( S_O + S_J = 20 + 64 = 84 \)
- Total chairs = \( C_O + C_J = 22 + 66 = 88 \)

The total number of sofas and chairs is \( 84 + 88 = 172 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had not bought the headphone set, we first need to determine the cost of the headphone set. We know that the total amount Tom paid was $48, and he bought a CD for $4. Therefore, the cost of the headphone set is:

\[ \text{Cost of headphone set} = \text{Total amount paid} - \text{Cost of CD} = 48 - 4 = 44 \]

Next, we need to find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with the $44 that he spent on the headphone set. Since each CD costs $4, the number of CDs he could have bought is:

\[ \text{Number of CDs} = \frac{\text{Cost of headphone set}}{\text{Cost of CD}} = \frac{44}{4} = 11 \]

So, Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs if he had not bought the headphone set."
"To calculate the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we need to account for the hours he worked out each week.

- For 6 weeks, he worked out for 4 hours each week.
- For 2 weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each week.
- For 1 week, he worked out for 6 hours.

Let's calculate the total hours:

For the 6 weeks of 4 hours each:
\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ hours} \]

For the 2 weeks of 5 hours each:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ hours} \]

For the 1 week of 6 hours:
\[ 1 \times 6 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

"Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 people get off. Then, 5 times as many people as those who got off get on. So, \(5 \times 8 = 40\) people get on the bus. The number of people on the bus after the first stop is:
\[48 - 8 + 40 = 80\]

At the second stop, 21 people get off. Then, 3 times fewer people get on compared to those who got off. So, \(21 \div 3 = 7\) people get on the bus. The number of people on the bus after the second stop is:
\[80 - 21 + 7 = 66\]

The final numerical answer is 66."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, Jame's current age is \( 27 - 5 = 22 \) years.

2. **Determine the cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 22 + 8 = 30 \) years old.
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \).
   - Therefore, Jame's cousin will be \( 60 - 5 = 55 \) years old in 8 years.

3. **Determine the cousin's current age:**
   - If Jame's cousin will be 55 in 8 years, then the cousin's current age is \( 55 - 8 = 47 \) years.

4. **Determine the age difference between Jame and his cousin:**
   - Jame is currently 22 years old.
   - His cousin is currently 47 years old.

"Let's denote the cost of the computer as \( C \), the cost of the printer as \( P \), and the cost of one monitor as \( M \).

Given:
- \( C = 1100 \)
- \( P = C - 400 \)
- The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400.

First, we calculate the cost of the printer:
\[ P = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

Next, we set up the equation for the total cost:
\[ C + 2M + P = 2400 \]

Substitute the known values of \( C \) and \( P \) into the equation:
\[ 1100 + 2M + 700 = 2400 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 1800 + 2M = 2400 \]

Subtract 1800 from both sides to isolate the term with \( M \):
\[ 2M = 600 \]

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( M \):
\[ M = 300 \]

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is \( 300 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 300 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of boys and girls.
2. Calculate the total number of seashells brought by the boys.
3. Calculate the total number of seashells brought by the girls.

First, we know that there are 20 kids in total and they are divided into two equal groups of girls and boys. Therefore, there are:
\[ \text{Number of boys} = \text{Number of girls} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Next, we know that each boy brought back 60 seashells. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is:
\[ \text{Total seashells by boys} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought by the girls is:
\[ \text{Total seashells by girls} = 600 + 4 \times 60 = 600 + 240 = 840 \]

Since there are 10 girls, the number of seashells each girl brought is:
\[ \text{Seashells per girl} = \frac{840}{10} = 84 \]

Thus, the number of seashells brought by each girl is:
\[ \boxed{84} \]"
"If George has 3 candies left after eating 5, it means George originally had 3 + 5 = 8 candies.

"First, let's determine Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, we can calculate Alyana's age as follows:

Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4
Alyana's age = 10 - 4
Alyana's age = 6

Next, we need to find Anne's age. Since Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, we can calculate Anne's age as follows:

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2
Anne's age = 6 + 2
Anne's age = 8

Therefore, Anne is 8 years old."
"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and then sum them up.

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so its thickness is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so its thickness is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm.

Now, we sum the thicknesses of all four books:
\[ 31 + 50 + 45 + 62 \]

Let's add these step by step:
\[ 31 + 50 = 81 \]
\[ 81 + 45 = 126 \]
\[ 126 + 62 = 188 \]

Therefore, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma still needs to make, we should first calculate the total number of vlogs she has already made in the first three weeks.

For the first week, she made 18 vlogs.
For the second week, she made 21 vlogs.
For the third week, she made 15 vlogs.

Adding these up: \(18 + 21 + 15 = 54\) vlogs.

Emma's goal is to make 72 vlogs per month. To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:

\(72 - 54 = 18\).

So, Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month."
"First, we need to calculate the tip amount. The tip is 20% of the dinner bill. The dinner bill is $50.

Tip = 20% of $50 = 0.20 * $50 = $10

Total amount paid = Dinner bill + Tip
Total amount paid = $50 + $10 = $60

So, the final amount you ended up paying is $60."
"First, let's determine how much each boy gets when $18 is shared among 3 boys.

\[
\text{Each boy's initial share} = \frac{18}{3} = 6
\]

The eldest boy gets an additional $5 the next day, so his share becomes:

\[
6 + 5 = 11
\]

The following day, he adds another $10 to his share:

\[
11 + 10 = 21
\]

He then spends $8, so his share after spending is:

\[
21 - 8 = 13
\]

After saving some more, he triples the amount he had left after spending the $8. Let's denote the amount he had left after spending as \( x \). So, \( x = 13 \). Tripling this amount gives:

\[
3 \times 13 = 39
\]

Therefore, the final amount he has is:

\[
\boxed{39}

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable parts. Let's denote the daily savings in the first half of April as \( x \). Therefore, the daily savings in the second half of April would be \( 2x \).

April has 30 days, so the first half consists of 15 days and the second half also consists of 15 days.

The total savings in April can be calculated as the sum of the savings in the first half and the second half:
\[ 15x + 15(2x) = 15x + 30x = 45x \]

Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125. Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 45:
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} \]

Now, let's perform the division:
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Elvis has to save $25 for each day in the first half of the month. For the second half, he needs to save twice this amount:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save $50 for each day in the second half of the month.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 50 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the apples:
3 apples * $1.50/apple = $4.50

5 oranges * $0.80/orange = $4.00

Then, let's calculate the total cost of the peaches:
6 peaches * $0.75/peach = $4.50

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the fruits:
Total cost = Cost of apples + Cost of oranges + Cost of peaches
Total cost = $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

Verna gave $20, so the change she received is:
Change = Amount given - Total cost
Change = $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

The final numerical answer is $7.00."
"First, let's calculate how much Jairus earns for completing 20 tasks. Jairus earns $0.8 for each task, so for 20 tasks, he earns:
\[ 0.8 \times 20 = 16 \]

Next, let's calculate how much Jenny earns for completing 20 tasks. Jenny earns $0.5 for each task, so for 20 tasks, she earns:
\[ 0.5 \times 20 = 10 \]

Now, to find out how much more Jairus earns than Jenny, we subtract Jenny's earnings from Jairus's earnings:
\[ 16 - 10 = 6 \]

So, Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny."
"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars. The total amount of money is $100, so we can write the equation:

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets $20. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's amount as:

\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets $80.

The final numerical answer is 80."
"Jeff walks 3 miles to work and 3 miles back home each day, so he walks a total of 3 + 3 = 6 miles each day. If he has to work 5 times a week, then the total miles he walks in a week is 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Alphabet Length**: The English alphabet consists of 26 letters.

2. **First Two Passes**: Elise writes the alphabet in full twice.
   - Each full pass of the alphabet is 26 letters.
   - Therefore, two full passes are \(26 \times 2 = 52\) letters.

3. **Third Pass**: Elise writes half of the alphabet once.
   - Half of the alphabet is \(26 / 2 = 13\) letters.

4. **Fourth Pass**: Elise re-writes everything she has already written.
   - This includes the two full passes (52 letters) and the half alphabet (13 letters).
   - Therefore, the total number of letters re-written in the fourth pass is \(52 + 13 = 65\) letters.

5. **Total Letters Written**: Summing up all the letters written in each pass:
   - First two passes: 52 letters
   - Third pass: 13 letters
   - Fourth pass: 65 letters
   - Total: \(52 + 13 + 65 = 130\) letters.

Thus, the total number of letters Elise has written is 130."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of the phone tree. Each round, the number of families called is triple the number of families called in the previous round. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Round**: Ali calls 3 families.
2. **Second Round**: Each of the 3 families calls 3 other families, so \(3 \times 3 = 9\) families are called.
3. **Third Round**: Each of the 9 families calls 3 other families, so \(9 \times 3 = 27\) families are called.
4. **Fourth Round**: Each of the 27 families calls 3 other families, so \(27 \times 3 = 81\) families are called.

Therefore, the number of families notified during the fourth round of calls is 81."
"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to calculate the total weight loss over the 3 months and then add this to his final weight.

Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, so the total weight loss is:
\[ 10 \text{ pounds/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

His final weight was 70 pounds, so his initial weight was:

"First, let's determine how many toys are needed for a play set that is five times larger than James's play set. James's play set has 80 toys, so a play set five times larger would have:

\[ 80 \times 5 = 400 \text{ toys} \]

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have enough toys to make a play set that is five times larger than James's play set. Therefore, if \( x \) represents the number of toys Jonathan currently has, then:

\[ x + 2 = 400 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

\[ x = 400 - 2 \]
\[ x = 398 \]

Jonathan currently has 398 toys."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of each item before the discount:

- The cost of five notebooks is \(5 \times \$1.50 = \$7.50\).
- The cost of two pens is \(2 \times \$0.25 = \$0.50\).
- The cost of one calculator is \(1 \times \$12 = \$12\).
- The cost of one geometry set is \(1 \times \$10 = \$10\).

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost before the discount:

"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break down the commission structure based on the sales amount.

1. For the first $1000 of sales, Antonella earns a 30% commission.
2. For sales over $1000, she earns an additional 10% commission on the amount exceeding $1000.

Let's calculate the commission step by step:

1. Commission on the first $1000:
\[ \text{Commission on first } \$1000 = \$1000 \times 0.30 = \$300 \]

2. Sales over $1000: 
\[ \text{Sales over } \$1000 = \$2500 - \$1000 = \$1500 \]

3. Additional commission on the sales over $1000:
\[ \text{Additional commission} = \$1500 \times 0.10 = \$150 \]

4. Total commission:
\[ \text{Total commission} = \$300 + \$150 = \$450 \]

Therefore, Antonella earned a total of $450 from the sales worth $2500."
"First, let's calculate the total number of bottles Bill currently has. He has 2 cases of water, and each case has 24 bottles. So, the total number of bottles he currently has is:

"First, let's determine how long it takes Ray to swim a mile when the water is warm.

Given:
- When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.
- When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold.

Let's calculate the time it takes to swim a mile in warm water:
- Twice the time it takes to swim a mile in cold water is \(2 \times 16 = 32\) minutes.
- Adding 2 minutes to this gives \(32 + 2 = 34\) minutes.

So, it takes Ray 34 minutes to swim a mile in warm water.

Next, we calculate the time it takes to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water:
- In cold water, it takes \(16 \times 3 = 48\) minutes to swim 3 miles.
- In warm water, it takes \(34 \times 3 = 102\) minutes to swim 3 miles.

Finally, we find the difference in time between swimming 3 miles in warm water and cold water:
- The difference is \(102 - 48 = 54\) minutes.

Therefore, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day."
"First, let's calculate how much John earns in a day. He earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day, so his daily earnings are:
\[ 2 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours/day} = 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \]

Next, let's calculate his weekly earnings. He works 4 days a week, so his weekly earnings are:
\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 4 \, \text{days/week} = 40 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take for John to save $80. We do this by dividing the total amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:
\[ \frac{80 \, \text{dollars}}{40 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 2 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80."
"First, we need to determine the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub. Since it costs thrice as much as the foot-long fish sub, we calculate:

\[ \text{Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo sub} = 3 \times \text{Cost of foot-long fish sub} \]
\[ \text{Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo sub} = 3 \times 40 = 120 \]

Next, we add the cost of the foot-long fish sub and the six-inch cold-cut combo sub to find the total cost:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of foot-long fish sub} + \text{Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo sub} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 40 + 120 = 160 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 160."

\[ \text{Buttons with four holes} = 21 - 7 = 14 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of holes. The 7 buttons with two holes contribute:

\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ holes} \]

The 14 buttons with four holes contribute:

\[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \text{ holes} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of holes:

\[ 14 + 56 = 70 \]

So, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is:

\[ 70 \]"
"First, let's determine the volume of Zack's locker. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can calculate the volume of Zack's locker as follows:

\[ \text{Volume of Zack's locker} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Volume of Timothy's locker} \]

Given that Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches, we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[ \text{Volume of Zack's locker} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 = 12 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we need to find the volume of Peter's locker, which is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. We can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Volume of Peter's locker} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Volume of Zack's locker} \]

Substituting the volume of Zack's locker into the equation:

\[ \text{Volume of Peter's locker} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ cubic inches} \]

So, the volume of Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches."
"First, let's determine the daily recommended cups of coffee for Octavia. Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, if we denote the daily recommended cups of coffee as \( R \), then Octavia drinks \( \frac{R}{2} \) cups of coffee.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks, so Juan drinks \( 10 \times \frac{R}{2} = 5R \) cups of coffee.

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. Therefore, Juan needs to reduce his coffee intake from \( 5R \) cups to 4 cups.

To find out by how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we calculate the difference between his current intake and the recommended intake:
\[ 5R - 4 \]

Since the daily recommended cups of coffee for Octavia (and hence Juan) is \( R \), we can express the reduction in terms of \( R \):
\[ 5R - 4 \]

Thus, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by \( 5R - 4 \) cups. Given that \( R \) is the daily recommended cups of coffee, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 5R - 4 \]"
"To find the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then add them together.

For the hamsters:
3 cages * 10 hamsters per cage = 30 hamsters

For the guinea pigs:

Now, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs together:
30 hamsters + 15 guinea pigs = 45 rodents

The final numerical answer is 45."
"First, let's determine the weights of Susan and Bob.

Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so:
\[ \text{Susan's weight} = \text{Mark's weight} - 20 = 150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds} \]

Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so:
\[ \text{Bob's weight} = 2 \times \text{Susan's weight} = 2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's find the total weight of the three friends:
\[ \text{Total weight} = \text{Mark's weight} + \text{Susan's weight} + \text{Bob's weight} = 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends:
\[ \text{Average weight} = \frac{\text{Total weight}}{\text{Number of friends}} = \frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 180 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total angle the sun will have moved from the ground after 10 hours.

1. The sun moves at a rate of 5 degrees per hour.
2. Over 10 hours, the sun will move \( 5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees} \).

The angle from the ground to the sun will be the sum of the angle of the pyramid from the ground (32 degrees) and the angle the sun has moved from the tip of the pyramid (50 degrees).

So, the total angle from the ground to the sun will be \( 32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees} \).

The final numerical answer is 82 degrees."
"First, we need to determine the ages of James' sons. One son is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger, which means the other son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Next, we need to find the total number of candles James needs. Since he needs one candle for each son, he needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Now, we need to calculate how many packs of candles James needs to buy. Since a pack contains 5 candles, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack: 20 ÷ 5 = 4 packs.

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Since each pack costs $3, the total cost for 4 packs is 4 × $3 = $12.

James spends $12 on candles."
"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the pages read in the first week and add it to the pages read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week. She read for 15 minutes each night for 7 nights, so the total reading time in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pages she can read in 105 minutes. Given that she reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, we can calculate the number of pages she reads per minute:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4 \text{ pages}}{3 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, we can find out how many pages she reads in 105 minutes:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4 \text{ pages}}{3 \text{ minutes}} = 105 \times \frac{4}{3} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 240 \]"
"First, we need to determine how many sandwiches Cody ate. Cody ate a third of the 12 sandwiches:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ sandwiches}
\]

Next, we calculate how many sandwiches Trevor ate. Trevor ate a quarter of the 12 sandwiches:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ sandwiches}
\]

Now, we add the number of sandwiches eaten by Cody and Trevor:

\[
4 + 3 = 7 \text{ sandwiches}
\]

To find out how many sandwiches are left, we subtract the total number of sandwiches eaten from the original number of sandwiches:

\[
12 - 7 = 5 \text{ sandwiches}
\]

So, the number of sandwiches left is:

\[
5

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equation based on the information given.

Let \( S \) be Shiloh's current age, and let \( N \) be his nephew's current age.

From the problem, we know:
- Shiloh's current age \( S = 44 \) years.
- In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( S + 7 \).
- In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be three times his nephew's age at that time, which is \( N + 7 \).

So, we can write the equation:
\[ S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Substitute \( S = 44 \) into the equation:
\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Simplify the left side:
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ 17 = N + 7 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides to solve for \( N \):
\[ N = 10 \]

Therefore, his nephew is 10 years old today.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the total amount of money Sharon received from the tooth fairy.

1. For the first tooth, the tooth fairy left $5.00.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy left $1.00 each.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy left half the amount of $1.00, which is $0.50 each.

Let's calculate the total amount step by step:

- For the first tooth: $5.00
- For the next three teeth: $1.00 * 3 = $3.00
- For the last two teeth: $0.50 * 2 = $1.00

Now, we sum these amounts to find the total:

\[
5.00 + 3.00 + 1.00 = 9.00

Therefore, the tooth fairy left Sharon a total of $9.00."
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information provided.

Let's denote:
- \( R \) as the number of goals Richie scored,
- \( M \) as the number of goals Mark scored,
- \( A \) as the number of goals Anna scored.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( R = 80 \) (Richie scored 80 goals).
2. \( R = M + 20 \) (Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark).
3. \( R = A + 45 \) (Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna).

First, we can use the second equation to find the number of goals Mark scored:
\[ R = M + 20 \]
\[ 80 = M + 20 \]
\[ M = 80 - 20 \]
\[ M = 60 \]

Next, we use the third equation to find the number of goals Anna scored:
\[ R = A + 45 \]
\[ 80 = A + 45 \]
\[ A = 80 - 45 \]
\[ A = 35 \]

Now, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers:
\[ \text{Total goals} = R + M + A \]
\[ \text{Total goals} = 80 + 60 + 35 \]
\[ \text{Total goals} = 175 \]

So, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is 175."

"First, let's determine how much money Peter spends each day. Since he has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week (7 days), we calculate:

\[ \text{Daily spending} = \frac{70}{7} = 10 \text{ dollars per day} \]

Next, we calculate how much money Peter spends on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. There are 4 days (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday) during which he buys wooden action figures. Each wooden action figure costs $5, so the total cost for wooden action figures is:

\[ \text{Cost of wooden action figures} = 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the wooden action figures, the remaining money Peter has is:

\[ \text{Remaining money} = 70 - 20 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Sunday), Peter will buy plastic action figures. Each plastic action figure costs $2, so the number of plastic action figures he can buy is:

\[ \text{Number of plastic action figures} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

Now, we add the number of wooden action figures and plastic action figures to find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week:

\[ \text{Total number of action figures} = 4 + 25 = 29 \]

So, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is:

\[ 29 \]"

"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a week.
2. Calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops in a week.
3. Determine the difference between the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops and the total number of roses grown by Ford in a week.
4. Multiply the weekly difference by the number of weeks in a month to find the monthly difference.

Let's start with step 1:
Ford grows 40 roses every week.

For step 2, we calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops in a week:
- The first flower shop orders 20 roses.
- The second flower shop orders 15 roses.
- The third flower shop orders 30 roses.

Total roses ordered by the flower shops in a week:
\[ 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \]

For step 3, we find the difference between the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops and the total number of roses grown by Ford in a week:
\[ 65 - 40 = 25 \]

For step 4, we calculate the monthly difference by multiplying the weekly difference by the number of weeks in a month (assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks):

- Days 4 and 5: 120 birds
- Day 6: 20 birds
- Day 7: 90 birds

First, we calculate the total number of birds seen:
\[ 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 \]

Next, we count the number of days:
\[ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28 \]

Now, we find the average by dividing the total number of birds by the number of days:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{280}{28} = 10 \]

So, on average, Mack saw 10 birds per day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Starting Value**: Diane gave the number train a starting value of 20. Let's denote this starting value as \( S \). So, \( S = 20 \).

2. **First Operation**: This starting value plus half the number was divided by 5. Let's denote the number as \( N \). So, the first operation can be written as:
   \[
   \frac{S + \frac{N}{2}}{5}
   \]
   Substituting \( S = 20 \):
   \[
   \frac{20 + \frac{N}{2}}{5}
   \]

3. **Second Operation**: The resulting value from the first operation was multiplied by the starting value minus 12. So, the second operation can be written as:
   \[
   \left( \frac{20 + \frac{N}{2}}{5} \right) \times (20 - 12)
   \]
   Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses:
   \[
   20 - 12 = 8
   \]
   Therefore, the expression becomes:
   \[
   \left( \frac{20 + \frac{N}{2}}{5} \right) \times 8
   \]

4. **Final Expression**: To find the final value, we need to simplify the expression:
   \[
   \left( \frac{20 + \frac{N}{2}}{5} \right) \times 8
   \]
   Simplify the fraction inside the parentheses:
   \[
   \frac{20 + \frac{N}{2}}{5} = \frac{40 + N}{10}
   \]
   Therefore, the expression becomes:
   \[
   \left( \frac{40 + N}{10} \right) \times 8
   \]
   Simplify further:
   \[
   \frac{40 + N}{10} \times 8 = \frac{8(40 + N)}{10} = \frac{320 + 8N}{10} = 32 + 0.8N
   \]

Since the problem does not specify the value of \( N \), the final expression in terms of \( N \) is:
\[
32 + 0.8N
\]

If we assume \( N \) is the starting value (20), then:
\[
32 + 0.8 \times 20 = 32 + 16 = 48
\]

Thus, the final value of the number train is:
\[
\boxed{48}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by which the oven is off and then apply that same percentage to the 520 degrees required by the recipe.

First, let's calculate the percentage by which the oven is off when set to 450 degrees:

\[
\text{Percentage Off} = \left( \frac{\text{Actual Temperature} - \text{Set Temperature}}{\text{Set Temperature}} \right) \times 100
\]

\[
\text{Percentage Off} = \left( \frac{468 - 450}{450} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 = 4\%
\]

Now that we know the oven is off by 4%, we can apply this same percentage to the 520 degrees required by the recipe to find the correct temperature setting:

\[
\text{Correct Temperature} = \text{Required Temperature} \times \left(1 + \frac{\text{Percentage Off}}{100}\right)
\]

\[
\text{Correct Temperature} = 520 \times \left(1 + \frac{4}{100}\right) = 520 \times 1.04 = 540.8
\]

Therefore, Maggie should set the oven to 540.8 degrees.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to add the duration of each movie together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Converting this to minutes:
1 hour = 60 minutes
So, 1 hour and 30 minutes = 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting this to minutes:
2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes
So, 2 hours and 5 minutes = 120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes.

Now, we add the durations of the two movies:
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is 215 minutes."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we first need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and then subtract that from Herb's price.

30% of $76,000 is calculated as:
\[ 0.30 \times 76,000 = 22,800 \]

Subtracting this from Herb's price gives us the value of Juan's house:
\[ 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200 \]

Now, to find the combined value of the two houses, we add the value of Juan's house to Herb's house:
\[ 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200 \]

So, the value of the two houses combined is $129,200."
"First, let's determine the number of cups and dishes Judy initially bought.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups.

She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.

At the event, her friend brought 40 cups. Since Judy initially bought 12 cups, her friend brought \(40 - 12 = 28\) more cups than Judy bought.

Her friend also brought 20 more dishes than Judy's initial purchase. Judy initially bought 24 dishes, so her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend.

Judy's total cups: \(12 + 28 = 40\)
Judy's total dishes: \(24 + 44 = 68\)

The total number of utensils (cups and dishes) brought by the two is:
\[40 + 68 = 108\]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the discounted price of one box of contacts. The original price of one box is $100.00, and there is a 10% discount.

The discount amount is:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the discounted price of one box is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost for 2 boxes is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost per pair of contacts. Since each box contains 90 single use contacts, 2 boxes will contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \]

Therefore, the cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

At $10 an hour, John earned:
\[ 7 \times 10 = 70 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings:
\[ 70 - 30 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

So, John earned $40 more than Jill."
"First, let's calculate the total calories burned by Hannah during her workout.

For the aerobics:
- She spends 2 hours doing aerobics.
- Aerobics burn 500 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from aerobics = 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.

For the running:
- She spends 1 hour running.
- Running burns 600 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from running = 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.

Now, let's add the calories burned from both activities to get the total calories burned:
- Total calories burned = calories burned from aerobics + calories burned from running
- Total calories burned = 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories.

Now, we need to calculate how much water Hannah needs to drink. She needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns.

To find out how much water she needs to drink for 1600 calories:
- For 200 calories, she drinks 100 ml.
- For 1600 calories, she drinks (1600 calories / 200 calories) * 100 ml = 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml.

So, the final numerical answer is 800 ml."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \).

According to the note, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans. Therefore, the number of red jelly beans \( R \) can be expressed as:
\[ R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B \]

Similarly, the number of green jelly beans \( G \) is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans:
\[ G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B \]

The total number of jelly beans is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
\[ R = 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]
\[ G = 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

The difference between the number of green and red jelly beans is:
\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 30 \]"
"To find the average of the three measurements, we first need to determine the typing speeds for each test.

1. Initial speed: 47 WPM
2. Speed after lessons: 52 WPM
3. Speed after further increase: 52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM

Now, we calculate the average of these three speeds:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{47 + 52 + 57}{3}
\]

First, we sum the speeds:

\[
47 + 52 + 57 = 156
\]

Next, we divide the sum by 3 to find the average:

\[
\frac{156}{3} = 52
\]

So, the average of the three measurements is 52 WPM."
"To find the difference in weight between eating Cheerios and donuts over 5 weeks, we need to calculate the weight change for each option and then find the difference.

For Cheerios:
- Weight loss per week = 1.25 pounds
- Number of weeks = 5
- Total weight loss = 1.25 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 6.25 pounds

For donuts:
- Weight gain per week = 1.75 pounds
- Number of weeks = 5
- Total weight gain = 1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 8.75 pounds

Now, to find the difference in weight:
- Difference = Total weight gain from donuts - Total weight loss from Cheerios
- Difference = 8.75 pounds - 6.25 pounds = 2.5 pounds

The difference in his weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options is 2.5 pounds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of people Alex will have at the event. We start with the initial 100 people invited via email. Each of these 100 people invites 2 friends, so we calculate the number of additional people invited as follows:

\[ 100 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ friends per person} = 200 \text{ friends} \]

Next, Alex calls 10 of her friends and 8 of them bring their spouses. The number of additional people invited in this case is:

\[ 8 \text{ friends with spouses} \]

Now, we sum up all the people:

\[ 100 \text{ (initial invitees)} + 200 \text{ (friends invited by initial invitees)} + 8 \text{ (friends with spouses)} = 308 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, Alex will need 308 seats for the event."

"To determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, we need to calculate the height of the beanstalk each day until it exceeds 20 feet.

The initial height of the beanstalk is 4 feet. Since the beanstalk doubles its height every day, we can express the height of the beanstalk on day \( n \) as:
\[ \text{Height on day } n = 4 \times 2^{n-1} \]

We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that the height exceeds 20 feet:
\[ 4 \times 2^{n-1} > 20 \]

First, divide both sides by 4:
\[ 2^{n-1} > 5 \]

Next, we need to find the smallest integer \( n-1 \) such that \( 2^{n-1} > 5 \). We can check the powers of 2:
\[ 2^2 = 4 \]
\[ 2^3 = 8 \]

Since \( 2^2 = 4 \) is less than 5 and \( 2^3 = 8 \) is greater than 5, we have:
\[ n-1 = 3 \]
\[ n = 4 \]

Therefore, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \]"
"To determine how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms every day, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the protein content per gram of mushrooms:**
   - Given that 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein, we can calculate the protein content per gram:
     \[
     \text{Protein per gram} = \frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams of mushrooms}} = 0.03 \text{ grams of protein per gram of mushrooms}
     \]

2. **Calculate the daily protein intake:**
   - John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. Using the protein content per gram, we can find out how much protein he gets from 200 grams:
     \[
     \text{Daily protein intake} = 200 \text{ grams of mushrooms} \times 0.03 \text{ grams of protein per gram} = 6 \text{ grams of protein per day}
     \]

3. **Calculate the weekly protein intake:**
   - To find out how much protein John gets in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 (the number of days in a week):
     \[
     \text{Weekly protein intake} = 6 \text{ grams of protein per day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ grams of protein per week}
     \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 42 grams of protein per week."
"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Expanding and simplifying the equation:
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
\[ J - 2J = -10 \]
\[ -J = -10 \]
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

George needs 2 implants, and each implant has a base price of $2000. So, the cost for the implants is:
\[ 2 \times 2000 = 4000 \]

For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. So, the additional cost for the crown is:
\[ 500 \]

Adding the cost of the implants and the crown, the total cost of the dental work is:
\[ 4000 + 500 = 4500 \]

George has already put down a deposit of $600. Therefore, the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
\[ 4500 - 600 = 3900 \]

George makes $15 per hour at work. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
\[ \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \]

So, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 260 \]"
"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees, and the other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees. The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ degrees} \]
\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ degrees} \]

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees. Therefore, the measure of the largest angle is:

\[ 90 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 90 \]"

"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz makes in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we can calculate the hourly rate for Ruiz as follows:

\[ \text{Ruiz's hourly rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa makes in one hour. According to the problem, Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we can calculate the amount Marissa makes in one hour as follows:

\[ \text{Marissa's hourly rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 60 \text{ pounds per hour} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we can calculate the total amount of chocolates Ruiz makes in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Ruiz's total in 12 hours} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

And the total amount of chocolates Marissa makes in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Marissa's total in 12 hours} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the totals to find the combined amount of chocolates they made together in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Total chocolates} = 720 \text{ pounds} + 540 \text{ pounds} = 1260 \text{ pounds} \]

The final numerical answer is 1260 pounds."

"To calculate the total earnings, we need to break down the problem into two parts based on the given time periods and then sum the earnings.

For the first four hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.

So, the earnings for the first four hours are:
\[ 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} \]

For the next two hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.

So, the earnings for the next two hours are:
\[ 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} \times \$0.60/\text{cup} \]

Now, let's calculate these values:

For the first four hours:
\[ 15 \times 4 \times 0.50 = 60 \times 0.50 = \$30.00 \]

For the next two hours:
\[ 10 \times 2 \times 0.60 = 20 \times 0.60 = \$12.00 \]

"First, let's determine the total number of rotations the tires make in a month. Given that the car drives 400 miles a month and the tires rotate 725 times for every 2 miles, we can calculate the total rotations for 400 miles as follows:

\[ \text{Rotations per mile} = \frac{725}{2} \]
\[ \text{Total rotations per month} = 400 \times \frac{725}{2} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of rotations the tires make in a month:

\[ \text{Total rotations per month} = 400 \times 362.5 = 145000 \]

Now, we know that each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations before replacement. To find out how many months the tires can last, we divide the total number of rotations each tire can handle by the number of rotations per month:

\[ \text{Months per tire} = \frac{10,440,000}{145000} \]

Finally, to find out how many years the tires can last, we divide the number of months by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):

\[ \text{Years per tire} = \frac{\text{Months per tire}}{12} \]

Let's calculate the final numerical answer.
```python
# Calculations
rotations_per_mile = 725 / 2
total_rotations_per_month = 400 * rotations_per_mile
total_rotations_per_tire = 10440000
months_per_tire = total_rotations_per_tire / total_rotations_per_month
years_per_tire = months_per_tire / 12

years_per_tire

"To find out how much each pump costs, we first need to determine the total number of washes Jackie can get from one bottle of shampoo. Since the bottle gives 120 washes with 2 pumps, we can calculate the cost per wash and then find the cost per pump.

The total cost of the bottle is $24.00. If Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, then for 120 washes, she would use 120 pumps. Therefore, the cost per pump is:

\[ \text{Cost per pump} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of pumps}} = \frac{24.00}{120} \]

Let's calculate this value.
```python
# Calculation
total_cost = 24.00
number_of_pumps = 120

cost_per_pump = total_cost / number_of_pumps
cost_per_pump_cents = cost_per_pump * 100  # Convert to cents
cost_per_pump_cents

"First, let's calculate the discount on the shirt and the shorts.

The shirt's original price is $25, and it has a 30% discount.
The discount amount on the shirt is \( 25 \times \frac{30}{100} = 7.5 \).

So, the shirt's price after the discount is \( 25 - 7.5 = 17.5 \).

The shorts' original price is $35, and it also has a 30% discount.
The discount amount on the shorts is \( 35 \times \frac{30}{100} = 10.5 \).

So, the shorts' price after the discount is \( 35 - 10.5 = 24.5 \).

Now, let's add the discounted prices of the shirt and the shorts to find the total cost of the outfit.
The total cost is \( 17.5 + 24.5 = 42 \).

Joe has $50 initially, so the amount of money he will have left after the purchase is \( 50 - 42 = 8 \).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 8."
"To determine how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a week.
2. Determine the total amount of butter required based on the number of dozens.

Next, we calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street. Lewis' street is 490 meters long, so the cost for Lewis' street is:

\[ 194 \times 490 = 94860 \]

To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we subtract the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis' street:

\[ 94860 - 29100 = 65760 \]

So, the additional cost to repave Lewis' street is $65760."
"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the funding into two parts: the initial 5 months and the subsequent months.

1. **Initial Funding:**
   - John receives $100,000 for the first 5 months.
   - Cost for the first 5 months = $100,000.

2. **Subsequent Funding:**
   - The research takes 10 times the initial 5 months, which is 50 months in total.
   - The first 5 months are already accounted for, so the subsequent months are 50 - 5 = 45 months.
   - The funding for each month after the first 5 months is 50% more than the initial $100,000 / 5 = $20,000 per month.
   - Therefore, the funding per month for the subsequent months is $20,000 * 1.5 = $30,000 per month.
   - Total cost for the subsequent 45 months = 45 * $30,000 = $1,350,000.

3. **Total Cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost for the first 5 months + Cost for the subsequent 45 months
   - Total cost = $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000.

The total cost of John's research is $1,450,000."

"To determine how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of loads of laundry Gary does in a year.
2. Determine the total gallons of water used in a year.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the cost per gallon of water.

First, Gary does laundry twice a week. There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total number of loads of laundry Gary does in a year is:
\[ 2 \text{ loads/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 104 \text{ loads/year} \]

Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water, so the total gallons of water used in a year is:
\[ 104 \text{ loads/year} \times 20 \text{ gallons/load} = 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \]

A gallon of water costs $0.15, so the total cost for the water used in a year is:

"To find the height of Jane's beanstalk after 3 weeks, we need to follow the growth pattern described:

1. After the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.
2. After the second week, it doubled in height. So, the height after the second week is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.
3. After the third week, it grew another 4 inches. So, the height after the third week is \(6 + 4 = 10\) inches.

Therefore, the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks is 10 inches."
"To determine how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of meat Prince can sell in one day.
2. Determine the total amount of meat from the bull.
3. Calculate the number of days required to sell the total amount of meat.

First, Prince sells 15 kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day. Therefore, the amount of meat he sells in one day is:
\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Next, the bull weighs 750 kg. To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell all the meat from the bull, we divide the total weight of the bull by the amount of meat sold per day:
\[ \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

So, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull."
"First, let's calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium. There are 4 rows with 18 seats each:

\[ \text{Total seats} = 4 \times 18 = 72 \]

Next, we find out how many seats were occupied by the administrators. One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators:

\[ \text{Seats occupied by administrators} = \frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18 \]

Now, we calculate the number of seats remaining after the administrators have been seated:

\[ \text{Remaining seats} = 72 - 18 = 54 \]

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents:

\[ \text{Seats occupied by parents} = \frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18 \]

Finally, we find out how many seats were occupied by the students by subtracting the seats occupied by the administrators and the parents from the total remaining seats:

\[ \text{Seats occupied by students} = 54 - 18 = 36 \]

So, the number of students in the auditorium is:

\[ \text{Number of students} = 36 \]

The final numerical answer is 36."
"First, let's calculate the total number of poles across all intersections:
\[ \text{Total poles} = \text{Number of poles per intersection} \times \text{Number of intersections} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of street lights:
\[ \text{Total street lights} = \text{Total poles} \times \text{Street lights per pole} = 24 \times 4 = 96 \]

Now, we subtract the number of non-functioning street lights from the total number of street lights to find the number of functioning street lights:
\[ \text{Functioning street lights} = \text{Total street lights} - \text{Non-functioning street lights} = 96 - 20 = 76 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 76 \]"
"To find out how many total times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to add the number of times each DVD has already been played to their respective maximum play counts.

The first DVD can be played 1000 times and has been played 356 times, so it can be played:
\[ 1000 - 356 = 644 \text{ more times} \]

The second DVD can also be played 1000 times and has been played 135 times, so it can be played:
\[ 1000 - 135 = 865 \text{ more times} \]

Adding the remaining play counts of both DVDs together:
\[ 644 + 865 = 1509 \]

Therefore, the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is:
\[ 1509 \]"
"To calculate the total cost of John's physical therapy, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of therapy sessions John attended.
2. Calculate the total number of hours John spent in therapy.
3. Compute the total cost based on the hourly rate.

**Step 1: Total number of therapy sessions**
John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks, and each week he attended twice for 2 hours at a time.
\[ \text{Total sessions} = 6 \text{ weeks} \times 2 \text{ sessions/week} = 12 \text{ sessions} \]

**Step 2: Total number of hours spent in therapy**
Each session is 2 hours long.
\[ \text{Total hours} = 12 \text{ sessions} \times 2 \text{ hours/session} = 24 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 3: Total cost of therapy**
The cost per hour is $125.

"First, let's determine how many pieces of gum Jim chews during the school day. Since he chews 1 piece every 2 hours and his school day lasts 8 hours, we can calculate the number of pieces he chews during school as follows:

\[ \text{Pieces chewed during school} = \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours/piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we account for the pieces he chews on the way home and after dinner:

\[ \text{Pieces chewed on the way home} = 1 \]
\[ \text{Pieces chewed after dinner} = 1 \]

Adding these together with the pieces chewed during school:

\[ \text{Total pieces chewed} = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we subtract the total pieces chewed from the initial pack of gum:

\[ \text{Gum remaining before giving to sister} = 20 - 6 = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

Jim then gives half of the remaining gum to his sister:

\[ \text{Gum given to sister} = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ pieces} \]

Finally, we calculate the number of pieces Jim has left after giving some to his sister:

\[ \text{Gum left} = 14 - 7 = 7 \text{ pieces} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 7 \]"
"To find out how old Charmaine will be 4 years from now, we first need to determine her current age. If she will be 16 years old in 12 years, we subtract 12 from 16 to find her current age.

\[ \text{Current age} = 16 - 12 = 4 \text{ years old} \]

Now, to find out how old she will be 4 years from now, we add 4 to her current age.

\[ \text{Age in 4 years} = 4 + 4 = 8 \text{ years old} \]

So, Charmaine will be 8 years old 4 years from now."
"First, let's calculate how much the baseball coach spent. The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs at $3 each:

\[ 9 \times 3 = 27 \]

So, the baseball coach spent $27.

Next, let's calculate how much the basketball coach spent. The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs at $14 each:

\[ 8 \times 14 = 112 \]

So, the basketball coach spent $112.

To find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we subtract the amount spent by the baseball coach from the amount spent by the basketball coach:

\[ 112 - 27 = 85 \]

Therefore, the basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach."
"To find out how many flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of flowers planted.
2. Determine the fraction of flowers that have bloomed.

First, let's calculate the total number of flowers planted:
\[ \text{Total flowers} = \text{Number of rows} \times \text{Flowers per row} = 10 \times 20 = 200 \]

Next, we know that 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed:
\[ \text{Flowers that have bloomed} = \text{Total flowers} \times \frac{4}{5} = 200 \times \frac{4}{5} \]

Now, let's perform the multiplication:
\[ 200 \times \frac{4}{5} = 200 \times 0.8 = 160 \]

Therefore, the number of flowers that have bloomed is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to convert Ashley's internet connection speed from kilobits per second (kb/s) to megabits per hour (Mb/h).

First, let's determine how many kilobits Ashley gets in one hour:
- There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are \(60 \times 60 = 3600\) seconds in an hour.
- Ashley's speed is 20 kilobits per second, so in one hour, she gets \(20 \times 3600 = 72000\) kilobits.

Next, we need to convert kilobits to megabits. Since 1 megabit is equal to 1000 kilobits, we divide the total kilobits by 1000 to get the megabits:
- Ashley's speed in megabits per hour is \(\frac{72000}{1000} = 72\) megabits per hour.

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed in Mb per hour is 72 Mb/h."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the total number of cars towed over the week.

First, we calculate the number of cars towed during the first three days:
- The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days.
- Therefore, the total for the first three days is \(10 \times 3 = 30\) cars.

Next, we calculate the number of cars towed during the remaining four days:
- On the fourth day, the tow truck pulled \(10 - 4 = 6\) cars.
- On the fifth day, the tow truck pulled \(10 - 4 = 6\) cars.
- On the sixth day, the tow truck pulled \(10 - 4 = 6\) cars.
- On the seventh day, the tow truck pulled \(10 - 4 = 6\) cars.
- Therefore, the total for the last four days is \(6 \times 4 = 24\) cars.

Finally, we add the number of cars towed during the first three days and the last four days to get the total number of cars towed that week:
- The total number of cars towed is \(30 + 24 = 54\).

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to convert Adam's current height from inches to feet to compare it with the required height. There are 12 inches in a foot, so Adam's height in feet is:

\[ 40 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{40}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The minimum height required to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. Therefore, Adam needs to grow:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Adam grows 2 inches per year, which is equivalent to \(\frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6}\) feet per year. To find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet, we divide the required growth by his annual growth rate:

\[ \frac{\frac{2}{3} \text{ feet}}{\frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year}} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = 4 \text{ years} \]

So, Adam will be tall enough to ride the roller coaster in 4 years."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 cars James sold:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 10 \times \$25,000 = \$250,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount the company paid to acquire these cars:
\[ \text{Cost to Company} = 30\% \times \$250,000 = 0.30 \times \$250,000 = \$75,000 \]

Now, we find the total profit James made:
\[ \text{Total Profit} = \text{Total Cost} - \text{Cost to Company} = \$250,000 - \$75,000 = \$175,000 \]

James received a 10% commission on the profits:
\[ \text{James's Commission} = 10\% \times \$175,000 = 0.10 \times \$175,000 = \$17,500 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$17,500 \]"
"First, let's find out how many riders can stay upright on the wave. Since only 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright, we calculate:

\[ 100 \times 0.25 = 25 \]

So, 25 riders can stay upright on the wave.

Next, we need to find out how many of these 25 riders are women. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we calculate:

\[ 25 \times 0.60 = 15 \]

So, 15 riders are women who can stay upright on the wave.

To find out how many of these 25 riders are men, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is 10.

"To solve this problem, we will first find the price of the gold jewel and then the price of the silver jewel. Finally, we will sum the prices of all three jewels.

Given:
- The price of a diamond jewel is $2000.
- The price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel.
- The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel.

First, calculate the price of the gold jewel:
\[
\text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600
\]

Next, calculate the price of the silver jewel:
\[
\text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
\]

Now, sum the prices of all three jewels:

"First, let's determine the number of truck stamps Max bought. Since he bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, and he bought 16 snowflake stamps, we can calculate the number of truck stamps as follows:

Number of truck stamps = Number of snowflake stamps + 3
Number of truck stamps = 16 + 3
Number of truck stamps = 19

Next, we need to find out how many rose stamps Max bought. Since he bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, we can calculate the number of rose stamps as follows:

Number of rose stamps = Number of truck stamps - 9
Number of rose stamps = 19 - 9
Number of rose stamps = 10

Now, to find the total number of stamps Max bought, we add the number of snowflake stamps, truck stamps, and rose stamps together:

Total number of stamps = Number of snowflake stamps + Number of truck stamps + Number of rose stamps
Total number of stamps = 16 + 19 + 10
Total number of stamps = 45

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between him and Bob.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( t \) be the time in hours it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob.
- Bob's speed is 55 miles per hour.
- Tom's speed is 70 miles per hour.
- The distance Bob travels in \( t \) hours is \( 55t \) miles.
- The distance Tom travels in \( t \) hours is \( 70t \) miles.

Since Tom needs to cover the 75-mile gap plus the distance Bob travels in \( t \) hours, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 70t = 55t + 75 \]

Now, solve for \( t \):
\[ 70t - 55t = 75 \]
\[ 15t = 75 \]
\[ t = \frac{75}{15} \]
\[ t = 5 \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"First, we need to determine how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate the number of fish Darren caught as follows:

\[ \text{Darren's fish} = \text{Naomi's fish} - 6 = 17 - 6 = 11 \]

Next, we need to find out how many fish Tommy caught. According to the problem, Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. Since Darren caught 11 fish, we can calculate the number of fish Tommy caught as follows:

\[ \text{Tommy's fish} = \text{Darren's fish} + 3 = 11 + 3 = 14 \]

So, the number of fish Tommy caught is 14."
"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the maximum cost per class and then find out how many classes he can attend without exceeding this cost.

First, we know the total cost for 10 classes is $60. We need to find the maximum cost per class:

\[
\text{Maximum cost per class} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of classes}} = \frac{60}{10} = 6 \text{ dollars per class}
\]

According to the parents, if the cost per class exceeds $10, they will not sign him up again. Since the maximum cost per class is $6, which is less than $10, Manny can attend all 10 classes without exceeding the parents' limit.

To find out how many classes Manny can miss, we need to determine how many classes he can attend without the total cost exceeding $10 per class. Let's denote the number of classes he can attend as \( n \). The cost per class in this scenario would be:

\[
\text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{n}
\]

We need this cost to be less than or equal to $10:

\[
\frac{60}{n} \leq 10
\]

Solving for \( n \):

\[
60 \leq 10n
\]

\[
n \geq 6
\]

This means Manny can attend at least 6 classes without exceeding the parents' limit. Since he is taking 10 classes in total, the number of classes he can miss is:

\[
10 - 6 = 4
\]

Thus, Manny can miss 4 classes before his parents decide not to sign him up again.

The final numerical answer is:

\[
4

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total weekly production for both Julie and Jewel.

First, let's find out how many customers Jewel processes in a week. Since Jewel processes 50 customers per day and works all days of the week (7 days), we calculate:
\[ 50 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 350 \text{ customers/week} \]

Next, we need to determine how many customers Julie processes in a week. We know that Julie processes customers twice as fast as Jewel. Therefore, in a week, Julie processes:
\[ 2 \times 50 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 2 \times 350 \text{ customers/week} = 700 \text{ customers/week} \]

Now, we add the weekly customer counts for both Julie and Jewel to find the total weekly production:
\[ 350 \text{ customers/week} + 700 \text{ customers/week} = 1050 \text{ customers/week} \]

The total weekly production for the two is:
\[ \boxed{1050} \]"
"First, let's determine how many miles Reggie ran. Since Paisley ran 4 miles and Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, we can calculate Reggie's distance as follows:

\[ \text{Reggie's distance} = 5 \times \text{Paisley's distance} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. Therefore, we can find out how many miles Lynn ran by subtracting 3 miles from Reggie's distance:

\[ \text{Lynn's distance} = \text{Reggie's distance} - 3 = 20 - 3 = 17 \text{ miles} \]

So, Lynn ran 17 miles."
"To solve this problem, we first need to find the cost of one apple and one orange.

Given:
- Four apples cost $5.20.
- Three oranges cost $3.30.

First, we calculate the cost of one apple:
\[ \text{Cost of one apple} = \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of one orange:
\[ \text{Cost of one orange} = \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \]

Now, we need to find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges:
\[ \text{Cost of 5 apples} = 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \]
\[ \text{Cost of 5 oranges} = 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \]

Finally, we add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges to get the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \]

So, Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the hole:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel one cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) it will take him to dig the hole is:

\[ T = \text{volume} \times \text{time per cubic foot} \]

\[ T = 72 \times 3 = 216 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 216 seconds."
"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to add the base price of the truck to the costs of the additional features.

1. **Base Price of the Truck**: $30,000
2. **King Cab Upgrade**: $7,500
3. **Leather Seats**: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade.
   - Cost of leather seats = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 7,500 = 2,500 \)
4. **Running Boards**: $500 less than the leather seats.
   - Cost of running boards = \( 2,500 - 500 = 2,000 \)
5. **Upgraded Exterior Light Package**: $1,500

Now, we sum all these costs:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Base Price} + \text{King Cab Upgrade} + \text{Leather Seats} + \text{Running Boards} + \text{Upgraded Exterior Light Package}
\]

\[
\text{Total Cost} = 30,000 + 7,500 + 2,500 + 2,000 + 1,500

- Bill digs at a rate of 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He needs to dig 24 feet of soil.
- Time to dig through soil = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours.

Next, the time to dig through the clay:
- Bill digs at half the rate through clay, which is 2 feet per hour.
- He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.
- Time to dig through clay = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours.

Finally, the total time to dig the well is the sum of the time to dig through the soil and the time to dig through the clay:
- Total time = 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

The final numerical answer is 10 hours."

"First, let's determine the number of likes Fishio received three weeks after posting her selfie. We know that after 1 week, she received 2000 likes. Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times the initial number of likes.

Initial number of likes = 2000

Number of likes after 3 weeks = 70 * initial number of likes
Number of likes after 3 weeks = 70 * 2000
Number of likes after 3 weeks = 140000

Next, we add the 20000 new likes she received recently to the number of likes she had after 3 weeks.

Total number of likes = Number of likes after 3 weeks + 20000
Total number of likes = 140000 + 20000
Total number of likes = 160000

So, the final numerical answer is 160000."
"First, let's calculate the total cost Clara paid for the pomegranates on Tuesday.

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the total cost before the voucher discount is:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \]

She got $2 off because of the voucher, so the final price Clara paid is:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost Sheila paid for the pomegranates on Wednesday.

The price per pomegranate on Wednesday was $30, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \]

The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount is:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the final price Sheila paid is:
\[ 600 - 60 = 540 \]

Now, we need to find the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila:
\[ 540 - 398 = 142 \]

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the sales from green hats in the first month:**
   - Sales from red hats in the first month = $400
   - Sales from green hats in the first month = $400 * 2 = $800

2. **Calculate the total sales in the first month:**
   - Total sales in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
   - Total sales in the first month = $400 + $800 = $1200

3. **Calculate the sales in the second month:**
   - Sales in the second month = \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales of the first month
   - Sales in the second month = \(\frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900\)

4. **Calculate the total sales in two months:**
   - Total sales in two months = Total sales in the first month + Sales in the second month
   - Total sales in two months = $1200 + $900 = $2100

The final numerical answer is $2100."

- Second hour: $30
- Third hour: $60

Total cost = $15 + $30 + $60 = $105

The final numerical answer is $105."
"To find out how many dollars were withheld from Sally’s wage, we need to calculate the difference between the amount in her bank account at the end of the week and the amount she should have in her bank account if she had received her full weekly wage.

The amount in her bank account at the end of the week is $420.
The amount she should have in her bank account if she had received her full weekly wage is $300.

The difference, which represents the amount withheld, is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Amount withheld} = \text{Amount in bank account at the end} - \text{Amount she should have} \]
\[ \text{Amount withheld} = 420 - 300 \]
\[ \text{Amount withheld} = 120 \]

So, the number of dollars withheld from Sally’s wage is 120 dollars."
"First, let's determine how many deviled egg halves Lori needs in total. Since each of her 16 guests will eat 3 deviled egg halves, the total number of deviled egg halves needed is:

\[ 16 \text{ guests} \times 3 \text{ halves/guest} = 48 \text{ halves} \]

Since each whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we need to find out how many whole eggs are required to make 48 halves. This can be calculated as:

\[ \frac{48 \text{ halves}}{2 \text{ halves/egg}} = 24 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we need to convert the number of eggs into dozens. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, the number of dozens of eggs Lori needs is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading, we need to calculate the total number of days it will take him to read the entire 200-page book at a rate of 10 pages per day.

The total number of days required can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by the number of pages he reads per day:

\[ \text{Total days required} = \frac{\text{Total pages}}{\text{Pages per day}} = \frac{200}{10} = 20 \text{ days} \]

Since the assignment is to be completed within 30 days, we can find out how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading by subtracting the total days required from the deadline:

\[ \text{Days before deadline} = \text{Deadline} - \text{Total days required} = 30 - 20 = 10 \text{ days} \]

So, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline."
"To calculate the total cost for the first year, we need to consider both the initial cost of the plane and the monthly expenses for renting a hanger and fuel.

1. **Initial Cost of the Plane**: $150,000

2. **Monthly Rent for the Hanger**: $5,000

3. **Monthly Cost for Fuel**: Twice the rent, so $5,000 * 2 = $10,000

4. **Total Monthly Expenses**: Rent + Fuel = $5,000 + $10,000 = $15,000

5. **Total Cost for the First Year**: Monthly Expenses * 12 months = $15,000 * 12 = $180,000

Adding the initial cost of the plane to the total cost for the first year:

Total Cost = Initial Cost + Total Cost for the First Year = $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000

The final numerical answer is $330,000."
"First, let's define the variables and the given information:

- Let \( R \) be the time it took to cook rice.
- Let \( P \) be the time it took to cook pork.
- Let \( B \) be the time it took to cook beans.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( R = 30 \) minutes.
2. It took Finley 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so \( P = R + 20 \).
3. Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, so \( B = \frac{1}{2}(P + R) \).

Now, let's calculate the time it took to cook pork:
\[ P = R + 20 = 30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the time it took to cook beans:
\[ B = \frac{1}{2}(P + R) = \frac{1}{2}(50 + 30) = \frac{1}{2} \times 80 = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, to find the total time it took to cook all the food, we sum the times for rice, pork, and beans:
\[ \text{Total time} = R + P + B = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \]

The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \]

So, the total cost for the first mixture is:
\[ 5 + 5 = 10 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \]

The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \]

So, the total cost for the second mixture is:
\[ 2 + 5 = 7 \]

Now, to find out how much more the first mixture costs compared to the second mixture, we subtract the cost of the second mixture from the cost of the first mixture:
\[ 10 - 7 = 3 \]

Therefore, the first mixture costs $3 more than the second mixture. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of linear equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( s \) as the number of sheep.
- \( g \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we know:
1. Each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, and the total number of legs is 70.
2. Each sheep and each goose has one head, and the total number of heads is 20.

This gives us the following system of equations:
1. \( 4s + 2g = 70 \)
2. \( s + g = 20 \)

We can solve this system step by step. First, we'll solve the second equation for \( g \):
\[ g = 20 - s \]

Next, we substitute \( g = 20 - s \) into the first equation:
\[ 4s + 2(20 - s) = 70 \]

Now, we simplify and solve for \( s \):
\[ 4s + 40 - 2s = 70 \]
\[ 2s + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2s = 30 \]
\[ s = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \( s = 15 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many toys James needs initially. He currently has 4 toys for 4 dogs, so each dog has 1 toy. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so he needs 8 more toys to have one for each of these 8 dogs. Therefore, he needs 8 toys initially.

After buying the toys, he sees that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left. Initially, there were 4 dogs, so twice as many more dogs means there are \(4 \times 2 = 8\) more dogs. This means there are now \(4 + 8 = 12\) dogs in total. Since each dog needs one toy, he needs 12 more toys.

When James came back again, 3 dogs were gone, so he no longer needed the toys for those 3 dogs. This means he can return 3 toys. Therefore, the total number of toys he needs is the sum of the toys he initially needed and the additional toys he needed after seeing the increase in dogs, minus the toys he can return.

So, the total number of toys James needs is:
\[ 8 + 12 - 3 = 17 \]

"Let's denote the number of cookies Katarina has as \( K \), Max as \( M \), the Cookie Monster as \( C \), and Summer as \( S \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( K = 68 \)
2. \( K = M - 5 \)
3. \( M = C + 12 \)
4. \( S = M + 23 \)

First, we can find the number of cookies Max has by substituting \( K = 68 \) into the second equation:
\[ 68 = M - 5 \]
\[ M = 68 + 5 \]
\[ M = 73 \]

Next, we can find the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has by substituting \( M = 73 \) into the third equation:
\[ 73 = C + 12 \]
\[ C = 73 - 12 \]
\[ C = 61 \]

Finally, we can find the number of cookies Summer has by substituting \( M = 73 \) into the fourth equation:
\[ S = 73 + 23 \]
\[ S = 96 \]

Now, we can find the total number of cookies by adding the number of cookies each person has:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time Chris spent mowing in each mode and then sum these times.

First, let's convert the time for ""turtle"" mode to minutes:
- ""Turtle"" mode: 1 hour = 60 minutes

Next, let's convert the time for ""rabbit"" mode to minutes:
- ""Rabbit"" mode: 40 minutes

Chris mowed half of the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half in ""rabbit"" mode. Therefore, the time spent in each mode is half of the total time for each mode.

Time spent in ""turtle"" mode:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{turtle}} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Time spent in ""rabbit"" mode:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{rabbit}} = \frac{40 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we sum the times spent in both modes to find the total time:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time}_{\text{turtle}} + \text{Time}_{\text{rabbit}} = 30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is:
\[ 50 \text{ minutes} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time John and Jack have already spent walking.

- Time to get to the corner: 6 minutes
- Time to get to the fire station: 13 minutes

Total time spent walking so far = 6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( Tr \).

Given that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can write:
\[ T = Tr + 7 \]

Also, given that the combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44, we can write:
\[ T + T + Tr + Tr + Tr = 44 \]
\[ 2T + 3Tr = 44 \]

Substituting \( T = Tr + 7 \) into the second equation:
\[ 2(Tr + 7) + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 2Tr + 14 + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr = 30 \]
\[ Tr = 6 \]

Now, substituting \( Tr = 6 \) back into the equation \( T = Tr + 7 \):
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, one of the twins is 13 years old. The final numerical answer is:

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, 3 hours is equal to 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's find out how many minutes John has left for a nap:

Total minutes before dinner - Total homework time = Minutes for nap
180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes

So, John has 100 minutes to nap."
"First, let's determine the cost of one candy. We know that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20, and each lollipop costs $0.40.

The cost of five lollipops is:
\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

So, the cost of four candies is:
\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

The cost of one candy is:
\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Now, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:
\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost of 10 candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:
\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of coins each person has saved over ten years and then sum these amounts.

First, let's determine how many coins Rong has saved in ten years:
- Rong saves 20 coins per month.
- There are 12 months in a year, so in ten years, there are \(10 \times 12 = 120\) months.
- Therefore, the total number of coins Rong has saved in ten years is \(20 \times 120 = 2400\) coins.

Next, let's determine how many coins Neil has saved in ten years:
- Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong per month. This means Neil saves \(20 + \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 20 + 8 = 28\) coins per month.
- In ten years, Neil saves \(28 \times 120 = 3360\) coins.

Now, we sum the coins saved by Rong and Neil over ten years:
- Total coins saved by Rong and Neil together is \(2400 + 3360 = 5760\) coins.

"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Since each vaccine costs $20 and John needs 2 vaccines, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \]

Next, let's denote the cost of the heartworm check as \( H \). According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as \( T \). Therefore, we have:
\[ H = 0.6T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + H \]

Since \( H = 0.6T \), we can substitute \( H \) in the total bill equation:
\[ T = 40 + 0.6T \]

To find \( T \), we need to solve this equation. Subtract \( 0.6T \) from both sides:
\[ T - 0.6T = 40 \]
\[ 0.4T = 40 \]

Now, divide both sides by 0.4:
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.4} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To find the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the total cost of the bananas, apples, and oranges in the crate.

First, let's determine the price of each type of fruit:
- The price of one apple is $0.5.
- The price of one banana is twice the price of one apple, so it is \(2 \times 0.5 = $1.0\).
- The price of one orange is three times the price of one banana, so it is \(3 \times 1.0 = $3.0\).

Next, we calculate the total cost for each type of fruit in the crate:
- The total cost for the bananas is \(5 \times 1.0 = $5.0\).
- The total cost for the apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = $6.0\).
- The total cost for the oranges is \(7 \times 3.0 = $21.0\).

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much candy Ginger and Amy each have left after two weeks, and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate how much candy Ginger eats in two weeks:
- Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy per day.
- There are 14 days in two weeks.
- Therefore, Ginger eats \(4 \times 14 = 56\) pieces of candy in two weeks.

Next, let's calculate how much candy Amy eats in two weeks:
- Amy eats 3 pieces of candy per day.
- There are 14 days in two weeks.
- Therefore, Amy eats \(3 \times 14 = 42\) pieces of candy in two weeks.

Now, let's determine how much candy Ginger and Amy have left after two weeks:
- Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 56 pieces, so she has \(100 - 56 = 44\) pieces left.
- Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 42 pieces, so she has \(100 - 42 = 58\) pieces left.

Finally, to find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger after two weeks, we subtract the amount Ginger has from the amount Amy has:
- Amy has 58 pieces and Ginger has 44 pieces.
- Therefore, Amy has \(58 - 44 = 14\) more pieces of candy than Ginger.

"First, let's calculate the total cost James incurred for picking the blueberries. The cost includes a fixed fee and a variable fee based on the weight of the blueberries picked.

The fixed fee is $20.
The variable fee is $1.5 per pound, and he picked 30 pounds. Therefore, the variable cost is:
\[ 1.5 \times 30 = 45 \]

Adding the fixed and variable costs gives the total cost James paid:
\[ 20 + 45 = 65 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the same amount of blueberries at the store. The store price is $2.5 per pound, and he picked 30 pounds. Therefore, the cost at the store is:
\[ 2.5 \times 30 = 75 \]

To find out how much James saved compared to buying at the store, we subtract the cost he paid for picking the blueberries from the cost he would have paid at the store:

"First, let's calculate the new price of each computer. The original price was $700, and it increased by 10%. To find the new price, we calculate 10% of $700 and add it to the original price.

\[ \text{Increase in price} = 700 \times \frac{10}{100} = 700 \times 0.10 = 70 \]

So, the new price of each computer is:

\[ \text{New price} = 700 + 70 = 770 \]

Now, to find the total amount of money paid for 500 computers at the new price, we multiply the new price by the number of computers:

\[ \text{Total amount} = 770 \times 500 \]

Let's calculate this value.
```plaintext
770 * 500 = 385000
```
The total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices is $385,000."
"First, let's calculate the calories from the eggs. John uses 6 eggs, and each egg is 75 calories. So the total calories from the eggs are:
\[ 6 \text{ eggs} \times 75 \text{ calories/egg} = 450 \text{ calories} \]

Next, let's calculate the calories from the cheese. John uses 2 oz of cheese, and each ounce of cheese is 120 calories. So the total calories from the cheese are:
\[ 2 \text{ oz} \times 120 \text{ calories/oz} = 240 \text{ calories} \]

Then, let's calculate the calories from the ham. John uses 2 oz of ham, and each ounce of ham is 40 calories. So the total calories from the ham are:
\[ 2 \text{ oz} \times 40 \text{ calories/oz} = 80 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we add up all the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham to get the total calories in the omelet:
\[ 450 \text{ calories} + 240 \text{ calories} + 80 \text{ calories} = 770 \text{ calories} \]

So, the total number of calories in the omelet is:
\[ 770 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the pencils. Each pencil costs $0.50, and you bought 6 pencils:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of taps Helga makes with both feet over the 5-minute period, considering the different tap rates for different parts of her dance.

1. **Determine the tap rate when her arms are raised:**
   - When her arms are raised, she taps each foot 200 times per minute.

2. **Calculate the number of taps per minute with arms raised:**
   - Since she raises her arms for 2 minutes, the number of taps per minute during this time is 200 taps per minute.
   - Therefore, the total number of taps in 2 minutes is:
     \[
     200 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 400 \text{ taps}
     \]

3. **Determine the tap rate when her arms are not raised:**
   - When her arms are not raised, she taps each foot 300 taps per minute for the right foot and 250 taps per minute for the left foot.
   - The combined rate for both feet is:
     \[
     300 \text{ taps/minute} + 250 \text{ taps/minute} = 550 \text{ taps/minute}
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of taps per minute with arms not raised:**
   - Since she dances without raising her arms for 3 minutes, the number of taps per minute during this time is 550 taps per minute.
   - Therefore, the total number of taps in 3 minutes is:
     \[
     550 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 1650 \text{ taps}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total number of taps over the 5-minute period:**
   - The total number of taps is the sum of the taps with arms raised and the taps with arms not raised:
     \[
     400 \text{ taps} + 1650 \text{ taps} = 2050 \text{ taps}
     \]

The combined total number of times that Helga taps both of her feet is:
\[
\boxed{2050}

"First, let's determine the total number of slices of pizza ordered. Since there are 5 people (Bryce and his 4 friends) and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate how many slices Bryce and two of his friends ate. They ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizzas:
\[ 2 \times 12 \times \frac{2}{3} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Then, we calculate how many slices the remaining two friends ate. They ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizzas:
\[ 2 \times 12 \times \frac{3}{4} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Now, we add the slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends and the slices eaten by the other two friends:
\[ 16 + 18 = 34 \]

Finally, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices to find out how many slices are left:
\[ 60 - 34 = 26 \]

So, the number of slices of pizza left is:
\[ 26 \]"
"First, let's determine the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages. The cat takes 30 minutes to eat nine sausages. The dog takes \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the time the cat takes, so the dog's time is:

\[
\text{Dog's time} = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we need to calculate the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. The average time is the sum of the times divided by the number of animals:

\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{\text{Cat's time} + \text{Dog's time}}{2} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}

"First, let's convert Topher's shoe length to inches only for easier calculation. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, Topher's shoe length of 8-feet and 4-inches is:

\[ 8 \times 12 + 4 = 96 + 4 = 100 \text{ inches} \]

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby’s shoes. Let's denote the length of Bobby's shoe as \( x \) inches. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Now, divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby’s shoes is 10 inches."
"First, let's calculate the number of windows in the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars.
- Each student's car has 4 windows.
- Therefore, the total number of windows in the students' cars is \(64 \times 4 = 256\) windows.

Next, let's calculate the number of windows in the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each teacher's car has 2 windows.
- Therefore, the total number of windows in the teachers' cars is \(32 \times 2 = 64\) windows.

Now, let's calculate the number of windows Hannah smashes in the students' cars:
- She smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.
- Therefore, the number of windows she smashes in the students' cars is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64\) windows.

Next, let's calculate the number of windows Hannah smashes in the teachers' cars:
- She smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows.
- Therefore, the number of windows she smashes in the teachers' cars is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48\) windows.

Finally, let's add the number of windows smashed in the students' cars and the teachers' cars to get the total number of windows smashed:
- Total windows smashed = \(64 + 48 = 112\).

Candy has:
- 15 light blue spools
- 45 dark blue spools
- 40 light green spools
- 50 dark green spools

The total number of spools is:
\[ 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150 \]

The total number of blue spools (light blue and dark blue) is:
\[ 15 + 45 = 60 \]

To find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:

"First, let's calculate the number of votes candidate B received. Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A. Since candidate A got 20% of the votes, we can calculate the votes for candidate B as follows:

Votes for candidate B = Votes for candidate A + 50% of Votes for candidate A
Votes for candidate B = 20% of 100 + 0.5 * 20% of 100
Votes for candidate B = 20 + 0.5 * 20
Votes for candidate B = 20 + 10
Votes for candidate B = 30

Now, we know the total number of votes is 100. We can calculate the votes for candidate C by subtracting the votes for candidates A and B from the total votes:

Votes for candidate C = Total votes - Votes for candidate A - Votes for candidate B
Votes for candidate C = 100 - 20 - 30
Votes for candidate C = 50

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of students in each class.
2. Calculate the number of girls in each class.
3. Subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class to find the number of boys.

First, since the total number of students in the two classes is 80 and each class has the same number of students, we can find the number of students in each class by dividing the total number of students by 2:

\[ \text{Number of students in each class} = \frac{80}{2} = 40 \]

Next, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. Therefore, the number of girls in each class is:

\[ \text{Number of girls in each class} = 40 \times \frac{40}{100} = 40 \times 0.4 = 16 \]

Finally, to find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class:

\[ \text{Number of boys in each class} = 40 - 16 = 24 \]

So, the number of boys in each class is 24."

\[ \text{Carl's marbles} = 4 \times \text{Sean's marbles} = 4 \times 56 \]

Next, we need to find out how many marbles Cal has. Since Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, we can express Cal's marbles as:

\[ \text{Sean's marbles} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cal's marbles} \]

Given that Sean has 56 marbles, we can solve for Cal's marbles:

\[ 56 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cal's marbles} \]

\[ \text{Cal's marbles} = 56 \times 2 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined:

\[ \text{Total marbles} = \text{Carl's marbles} + \text{Cal's marbles} \]

Let's perform the calculations.
```markdown
\[ \text{Carl's marbles} = 4 \times 56 = 224 \]
\[ \text{Cal's marbles} = 56 \times 2 = 112 \]
\[ \text{Total marbles} = 224 + 112 = 336 \]
```
The total number of marbles that Carl and Cal have combined is 336."
"To solve this, we first need to determine how many students would be in each group if there are 12 groups.

Total number of students = 54
Number of groups = 12

Number of students per group = Total number of students / Number of groups
Number of students per group = 54 / 12
Number of students per group = 4.5

Since we can't have half a student in a group, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the problem statement. However, if we proceed with the given numbers, we can calculate how many more groups are needed to form 12 groups.

The number of groups already formed = 6
The number of groups needed = 12

Number of additional groups needed = Number of groups needed - Number of groups already formed
Number of additional groups needed = 12 - 6
Number of additional groups needed = 6

So, 6 more groups are needed to form 12 groups.

The final numerical answer is: 6"
"To calculate the total number of chairs Candy can rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during a single 4-week month:
- There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a week.
- During weekdays, 60 chairs are rented each day. So, in a week, the number of chairs rented on weekdays is \(5 \times 60 = 300\) chairs.
- During weekends, 100 chairs are rented each day. So, in a week, the number of chairs rented on weekends is \(2 \times 100 = 200\) chairs.
- Therefore, in a week, the total number of chairs rented is \(300 + 200 = 500\) chairs.
- For a 4-week month, the total number of chairs rented is \(4 \times 500 = 2000\) chairs.

Now, let's calculate the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months:
- For two 4-week months, the total number of chairs rented is \(2 \times 2000 = 4000\) chairs.

So, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is 4000."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of events and perform the necessary calculations step by step.

1. Gunther initially had 48 bananas.
2. Arnold stole half of the bananas:
   \[
   \text{Bananas stolen by Arnold} = \frac{48}{2} = 24
   \]
   \[
   \text{Bananas left} = 48 - 24 = 24
   \]
3. The next day, Gunther added 25 more bananas:
   \[
   \text{Bananas after adding 25} = 24 + 25 = 49
   \]
4. Arnold stole another 12 bananas:
   \[
   \text{Bananas left} = 49 - 12 = 37
   \]
5. On the third day, Gunther added another 6 bananas:
   \[
   \text{Bananas after adding 6} = 37 + 6 = 43
   \]

Therefore, the number of bananas Gunther found in the pile is 43."
"To find out how much each roommate will pay per year for electricity, we first need to calculate the total annual cost of the electricity bill and then divide that by the number of roommates.

The monthly cost of the electricity bill is $100. Therefore, the annual cost is:
\[ 100 \times 12 = 1200 \text{ dollars} \]

Since there are 4 roommates and they divide the cost equally, each roommate will pay:
\[ \frac{1200}{4} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 300 \]"
"First, let's convert the dozens into individual items. Since one dozen equals 12 items:

- Glasses sent: 8 dozen * 12 = 96 glasses
- Plates sent: 4 dozen * 12 = 48 plates

Next, we account for the items that were broken:

- Broken glasses: 10
- Broken plates: 6

Now, we subtract the broken items from the total items sent:

- Remaining glasses: 96 - 10 = 86 glasses
- Remaining plates: 48 - 6 = 42 plates

Finally, we add the remaining glasses and plates to find the total number of items Jeff has now:

- Total remaining: 86 glasses + 42 plates = 128 items

So, Jeff has 128 glasses and plates now."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps and calculate the number of buttons Lorraine ends up with.

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - Number of small stickers traded: \( 0.9 \times 30 = 27 \) small stickers.
   - Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she trades 27 small stickers for 27 large buttons.

3. **Remaining Small Stickers:**
   - Remaining small stickers: \( 30 - 27 = 3 \) small stickers.

4. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - Number of large stickers traded: \( 0.5 \times 40 = 20 \) large stickers.
   - Since each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons, she trades 20 large stickers for 20 large buttons.

5. **Remaining Large Stickers:**
   - Remaining large stickers: \( 40 - 20 = 20 \) large stickers.

6. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons.
   - Since each large button is worth three small buttons, she trades 20 large stickers for \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) small buttons.

7. **Total Number of Buttons:**
   - Large buttons from trading large stickers: 20
   - Small buttons from trading large stickers: 60
   - Total buttons: \( 20 + 60 = 80 \)

Thus, the final number of buttons Lorraine has by the end is 80."
"To find out how many matches Joey played in one week, we need to add up the matches he played on each day of the week mentioned.

- On Monday, Joey played 2 matches.
- On Friday, Joey played 1 match.
- On Saturday, Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday. Since he played 2 matches on Monday, on Saturday he played \(2 \times 2 = 4\) matches.

Now, we add the matches from each day:
\[ 2 \text{ (Monday)} + 1 \text{ (Friday)} + 4 \text{ (Saturday)} = 7 \]

Therefore, Joey played a total of 7 matches in one week."
"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x \).

The total number of votes cast is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is \( x + 2x = 3x \).

We know the total number of people on the council is 33, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x \):
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Thus, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Extra-small (XS) shirts**: 11 students need size extra-small.
2. **Small (S) shirts**: Twice as many students need size small as extra small. Therefore, the number of students needing size small is \(2 \times 11 = 22\).
3. **Medium (M) shirts**: Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size medium is \(22 - 4 = 18\).
4. **Large (L) shirts**: Half as many students need size large as size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size large is \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\).
5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts**: Six more students need size extra-large than large. Therefore, the number of students needing size extra-large is \(9 + 6 = 15\).

Now, let's sum up the total number of shirts ordered:

- Extra-small (XS): 11
- Small (S): 22
- Medium (M): 18
- Large (L): 9
- Extra-large (XL): 15

Total number of shirts = \(11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15\)

Let's calculate the total:

\[11 + 22 = 33\]
\[33 + 18 = 51\]
\[51 + 9 = 60\]
\[60 + 15 = 75\]

Therefore, the total number of shirts Krissa ordered is 75."
"To calculate the amount you will pay after a 5% discount on a $140 item, you first need to find out how much the discount is in dollars and then subtract that from the original price.

The discount amount is calculated as:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Original Price} \times \frac{\text{Discount Percentage}}{100} \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 140 \times \frac{5}{100} = 140 \times 0.05 = 7 \]

So, the discount amount is $7. Now, subtract the discount from the original price to find the final price:
\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount Amount} \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 140 - 7 = 133 \]

Therefore, after the discount, you will pay $133."
"To find the total number of hours the 20 playlists will last, we need to follow these steps:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ people} \]

Next, we calculate how many of the remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win. 

60% of 40 people is:
\[ 0.60 \times 40 = 24 \text{ people} \]

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win. This leaves:
\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is:

"Let's denote the total number of puppies Jana has as \( P \).

Given that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can write:
\[ \frac{2}{3}P \text{ are Pomeranians} \]

We are also told that one third of the Pomeranian puppies are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. Therefore:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3}P \right) = 6 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{9}P = 6 \]

To find \( P \), we solve for \( P \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \( \frac{9}{2} \):
\[ P = 6 \times \frac{9}{2} \]
\[ P = 3 \times 9 \]
\[ P = 27 \]

So, Jana has 27 puppies in total.

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The first house needs \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the second house, so the first house needs \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases.
- The third house needs double the first house, so the third house needs \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) cases.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{5}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{5} \):
\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{5} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. Since the third house needs double the first house, and the first house needs half the second house, the first house needs:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50 \] cases.

Therefore, the third house needs:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \] cases.

The number of cases of shingles the third house will need is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"

- She also earns an additional $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the hourly earnings for Monday:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} \times 5 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 20 \times 5 \times 15 = \$1500 \]

Next, calculate the additional daily bonus for Monday:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} > 3 \text{ classes} \]
\[ \text{Additional bonus} = \$5 \]

Now, sum the hourly earnings and the bonus for Monday:
\[ \$1500 + \$5 = \$1505 \]

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She does not earn the additional $5 per day bonus since she does not teach more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the hourly earnings for Wednesday:
\[ 2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 2 \times 2 \times 15 = \$60 \]

Since she does not earn the additional bonus, her earnings for Wednesday are:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance driven and hiked by the Llesis family.

First, let's determine the speed at which they hiked. The problem states that they hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Since they drove at an average of 50 miles per hour, half of this speed is 25 miles per hour. Therefore, their hiking speed is:
\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we calculate the distance they hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at a speed of 20 miles per hour:
\[ \text{Distance hiked} = 20 \text{ miles/hour} \times 1.5 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we calculate the distance they drove. They drove for a total of 6 hours, but we need to subtract the time they spent hiking (1.5 hours) to find the time they spent driving:
\[ \text{Time driven} = 6 \text{ hours} - 1.5 \text{ hours} = 4.5 \text{ hours} \]

Using their driving speed of 50 miles per hour, the distance they drove is:
\[ \text{Distance driven} = 50 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4.5 \text{ hours} = 225 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, the total distance to their vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked:
\[ \text{Total distance} = 225 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 255 \text{ miles} \]

"Let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumps on as \( E_e \) and the number of berries she collects as \( B_e \). Ava jumps on \( E_a = E_e + 8 \) enemies and collects \( B_a = B_e + 3 \) berries. Emma's score can be represented as \( S_e = 10E_e + 5B_e \), and Ava's score can be represented as \( S_a = 10E_a + 5B_a + 30 \times 4 \).

Substituting the values for \( E_a \) and \( B_a \) into Ava's score equation, we get:
\[ S_a = 10(E_e + 8) + 5(B_e + 3) + 120 \]
\[ S_a = 10E_e + 80 + 5B_e + 15 + 120 \]
\[ S_a = 10E_e + 5B_e + 215 \]

Since Emma's score is \( S_e = 10E_e + 5B_e \), the difference between their scores is:
\[ S_a - S_e = (10E_e + 5B_e + 215) - (10E_e + 5B_e) \]
\[ S_a - S_e = 215 \]

The difference between their two scores is 215 points."
"First, we need to determine the total cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each. This can be calculated as:
\[ 30 \text{ dollars/pizza} \times 2 \text{ pizzas} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

The total cost for all four pizzas is 64 dollars. Therefore, the cost of the remaining two pizzas can be found by subtracting the cost of the two 30-dollar pizzas from the total cost:
\[ 64 \text{ dollars} - 60 \text{ dollars} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the remaining two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the remaining cost by 2:
\[ \frac{4 \text{ dollars}}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars/pizza} \]

Thus, each of the other two pizzas cost 2 dollars. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"To solve this, let's break down the days and the number of rides:

- Chase and Rider ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days. So, for these 5 days, they ride \(3 \times 5 = 15\) times.
- On the remaining 2 days, they ride twice as many times as they do on the usual days. Since they ride 3 times a day on usual days, on these 2 days, they ride \(2 \times 3 = 6\) times each day. So, for these 2 days, they ride \(6 \times 2 = 12\) times.

Now, let's add the rides from both types of days:
- Total rides in a week = rides on usual days + rides on special days
- Total rides in a week = \(15 + 12 = 27\)

The final numerical answer is 27."
"Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as \( w \) and the number of orange fish he bought as \( o \). We know that the total number of fish he bought from the pet store is \( o + w = 17 \).

After adding these fish to his pond, the total number of orange fish became \( 3 + o \) and the total number of white fish became \( 4 + w \). According to the problem, after adding the fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish. This gives us the equation:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( o + w = 17 \)
2. \( 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \)

Let's solve the second equation first:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]
\[ 3 + o = 8 + 2w \]
\[ o - 2w = 5 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( o + w = 17 \)
2. \( o - 2w = 5 \)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use elimination. First, we'll eliminate \( o \) by subtracting the second equation from the first:
\[ (o + w) - (o - 2w) = 17 - 5 \]
\[ o + w - o + 2w = 12 \]
\[ 3w = 12 \]
\[ w = 4 \]

Now that we have \( w = 4 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( o \):
\[ o + 4 = 17 \]
\[ o = 13 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish and 13 orange fish. The number of white fish Bob bought at the store is \( 4 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total distance Andy travels in a week. Since he goes to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days. The one-way distance is 5 miles, so the round trip distance is 10 miles per day. Therefore, the total distance for the week is:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 50 \text{ miles/week} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of gas Andy consumes in a week. Given that his car's fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon, the number of gallons used per week is:

\[ \frac{50 \text{ miles/week}}{10 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons/week} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost of the gas consumed in a week. If the price of gas is $3 per gallon, the cost per week is:

\[ 5 \text{ gallons/week} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 15 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie received from her aunt.

Carrie received ten twenties, which means:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Carrie also received 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount from the quarters is:
\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Carrie received is:
\[ 200 + 35 = 235 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate how much money Carrie spent. She spent all the quarters, which is $35, and 3/5 of the twenties. The amount spent on the twenties is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Carrie spent for lunch is:
\[ 35 + 120 = 155 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to calculate the total yield from the tomato plants and the eggplant plants separately, and then add these amounts together.

First, we calculate the total yield from the tomato plants:
- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo planted 5 tomato plants.

So, the total yield from the tomato plants is:
\[ 22 \text{ tomatoes/plant} \times 5 \text{ plants} = 110 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Next, we calculate the total yield from the eggplant plants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo planted 8 eggplant plants.

So, the total yield from the eggplant plants is:
\[ 4 \text{ eggplants/plant} \times 8 \text{ plants} = 32 \text{ eggplants} \]

Now, we add the total yield from the tomato plants and the eggplant plants to find the total number of fruits:
\[ 110 \text{ tomatoes} + 32 \text{ eggplants} = 142 \text{ fruits} \]

Therefore, the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his plants is:
\[ 142 \]"
"To find out how many OLED TVs were sold, we first need to determine the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold, and then subtract these from the total sales.

Given:
- One-fourth of the sales are smart TVs.
- One-eighth of the sales are analog TVs.
- The rest are OLED TVs.
- Total sales = 40 TVs.

First, calculate the number of smart TVs sold:
\[ \text{Number of smart TVs} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

Next, calculate the number of analog TVs sold:
\[ \text{Number of analog TVs} = \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5 \]

Now, calculate the number of OLED TVs sold by subtracting the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total sales:
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (\text{Number of smart TVs} + \text{Number of analog TVs}) \]
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (10 + 5) \]
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - 15 \]
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 25 \]

So, the number of OLED TVs sold is 25."
"To determine how much money John is missing, we first need to calculate the total cost of the trip and then subtract the amount he already has.

The total cost of the trip is $300. The school has agreed to cover half of this cost, so the school will cover:
\[ \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

This means John needs to cover the remaining half of the trip cost:
\[ 300 - 150 = 150 \]

John currently has $50. To find out how much more money he needs, we subtract the amount he has from the total cost he needs to cover:
\[ 150 - 50 = 100 \]

So, John is missing $100."
"First, we need to determine the temperature difference that needs to be addressed to prevent the pipes from freezing. The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. The temperature during the night is 33 degrees colder than during the day, so the night temperature is:

\[ 45 \text{ degrees} - 33 \text{ degrees} = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

The temperature during the night is 12 degrees, which is below the freezing point of 32 degrees. To find out how much the temperature needs to be raised to 32 degrees, we calculate the difference:

\[ 32 \text{ degrees} - 12 \text{ degrees} = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs are needed to raise the temperature by 20 degrees, we divide the required temperature increase by the temperature increase per log:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ degrees}}{5 \text{ degrees/log}} = 4 \text{ logs} \]

So, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing. The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine the number of groups formed. Since 90 people were split into 9-person groups, we divide 90 by 9:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{90}{9} = 10 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups brought back seashells. According to the problem, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the groups each had members bring back 2 seashells. So, we calculate \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the 10 groups:

\[ \text{Number of groups bringing back seashells} = \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6 \]

Each of these groups brought back 2 seashells. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought back is:

\[ \text{Total seashells} = 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"Initially, the train has 172 people. At the first stop, 47 people get off and 13 people get on. So the number of people on the train after the first stop is:

\[ 172 - 47 + 13 = 138 + 13 = 151 \]

At the next stop, 38 people get off. So the number of people on the train after the second stop is:

"First, let's calculate Jamie's regular pay for the first 8 hours of work:

\[ \text{Regular pay} = 8 \text{ hours} \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$160 \]

Next, we need to calculate the additional hours worked, which is:

\[ \text{Additional hours} = 11 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

The special hourly rate for additional hours is 150% of her regular hourly rate. So, we calculate the special hourly rate:

\[ \text{Special hourly rate} = 1.5 \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$30/\text{hour} \]

Now, we calculate the pay for the additional 3 hours:

\[ \text{Pay for additional hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \times \$30/\text{hour} = \$90 \]

Finally, we add the regular pay and the pay for the additional hours to find the total pay for the day:

\[ \text{Total pay} = \$160 + \$90 = \$250 \]

So, Jamie was paid \$250 for her work on last Tuesday."

"First, we need to calculate the discount amount on the jeans. The jeans are advertised 25% off, and the original price is $40.00.

\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Original Price} \times \frac{\text{Discount Percentage}}{100} \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 40 \times \frac{25}{100} \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 40 \times 0.25 \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 10 \]

So, the jeans are now $10.00 cheaper. The sale price of the jeans is:

\[ \text{Sale Price} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount Amount} \]
\[ \text{Sale Price} = 40 - 10 \]
\[ \text{Sale Price} = 30 \]

Mike pays with a $50.00 bill. To find out how much money Mike will have left over after buying the jeans, we subtract the sale price from the $50.00:

\[ \text{Money Left Over} = \text{Payment Amount} - \text{Sale Price} \]
\[ \text{Money Left Over} = 50 - 30 \]
\[ \text{Money Left Over} = 20 \]

Mike will have $20.00 left over."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of employees after three months.
2. Calculate the total salary paid to all employees each month.
3. Multiply the total salary per month by the number of months (three months).

**Step 1: Determine the number of employees after three months.**

The company hires 20 new employees every month. After three months, the number of new hires is:
\[ 20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees} \]

Adding these to the initial 200 employees:
\[ 200 \text{ initial employees} + 60 \text{ new employees} = 260 \text{ employees} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total salary paid to all employees each month.**

Each employee is paid $4000 per month. Therefore, the total salary paid to 260 employees each month is:
\[ 260 \text{ employees} \times 4000 \text{ dollars/employee} = 1040000 \text{ dollars/month} \]

**Step 3: Multiply the total salary per month by the number of months (three months).**

The total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the hourly rates for both Billy and Sally, and then determine the total earnings for 20 hours for each. Finally, we will find the difference in their earnings.

1. **Billy's hourly rate:**
   - Initial rate: $10 per hour
   - After 2 months, raise: $0.50 per hour
   - On his first anniversary, raise: $1.00 per hour

   Let's calculate the hourly rate after each raise:
   - After 2 months: $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour
   - On his first anniversary: $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour

2. **Sally's hourly rate:**
   - Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary.
   - Billy's starting salary: $10 per hour
   - Sally's starting salary: $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour

3. **Total earnings for 20 hours:**
   - Billy's total earnings: $11.50 per hour * 20 hours = $230
   - Sally's total earnings: $10.50 per hour * 20 hours = $210

"First, let's calculate the number of students and teachers in the school.

The school has 40 classes with an average of 25 students per class:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 25 \text{ students/class} = 1000 \text{ students} \]

The school also has 40 classes with an average of 3 teachers per class:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 3 \text{ teachers/class} = 120 \text{ teachers} \]

Each child plants 1 tree, so the number of trees planted by the students is:
\[ 1000 \text{ students} \times 1 \text{ tree/student} = 1000 \text{ trees} \]

Each teacher plants 2 trees, so the number of trees planted by the teachers is:
\[ 120 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ trees/teacher} = 240 \text{ trees} \]

Adding the trees planted by the students and the teachers gives the total number of trees planted:

"First, let's calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:

- Puppies: 3
- Koalas: 5
- Zebras: 2
- Frogs: 4

Total stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Let's denote the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy as \( x \).

The total number of stuffed animals after buying \( x \) goats will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30%. Therefore, the equation representing this situation is:

\[ \frac{x}{14 + x} = 0.30 \]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides by \( 14 + x \) to get rid of the denominator:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Expanding the right side:

\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Subtract \( 0.30x \) from both sides to isolate \( x \):

\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]

\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Divide both sides by 0.70 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]

\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats."

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours and then find the difference between these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled by the first car:
- The speed of the first car is 60 miles per hour.
- The time is 2 hours.

\[ \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled by the second car:
- The speed of the second car is 70 miles per hour.
- The time is 2 hours.

\[ \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed}_2 \times \text{Time} = 70 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled by the two cars after 2 hours:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_2 - \text{Distance}_1 = 140 \, \text{miles} - 120 \, \text{miles} = 20 \, \text{miles} \]

"First, let's calculate the pass rates for each grade:

- For third graders: \( \frac{340}{500} = 0.68 \) or 68%
- For fourth graders: \( \frac{40}{100} = 0.40 \) or 40%
- For fifth graders: The pass rate is twice that of fourth graders, so \( 2 \times 0.40 = 0.80 \) or 80%

Next, we calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students:

- Third graders: 340
- Fourth graders: 40
- Fifth graders: 400

Total number of students: \( 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 \)

Total number of students who passed: \( 340 + 40 + 400 = 780 \)

Finally, the overall pass rate is calculated as follows:

"First, let's calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has:

- Each bag contains 72 chips.
- Milo has 2 bags.

So, the total number of chips is:
\[ 72 \text{ chips/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we need to determine how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make every square inch:

\[ \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips/square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall. To find out how many inches long he can make his mosaic, we use the area of the mosaic:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{height} \]

Given the area is 12 square inches and the height is 3 inches:

\[ 320 - 10 = 310 \]

Thus, the number of additional students who joined by the end of May is 310."
"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we first need to determine the total number of branches he climbed during the week. Since he made $105 and each branch costs $0.25, we can calculate the total number of branches as follows:

\[ \text{Total branches} = \frac{\text{Total money made}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} \]

\[ \text{Total branches} = 420 \]

Felix made this money over the course of a week, which has 7 days. To find out how many branches he climbed per day, we divide the total number of branches by the number of days:

\[ \text{Branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{420}{7} \]

\[ \text{Branches per day} = 60 \]

So, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day."
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose initially picks:

- For the first 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals
- For the next 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals
- For the next 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals
- For the last 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals

Adding these together gives the total number of petals before any are dropped:
\[15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\]

Next, Rose drops 1 of each type of flower:
- 1 of the 5-petal flowers: \(1 \times 5 = 5\) petals
- 1 of the 6-petal flowers: \(1 \times 6 = 6\) petals
- 1 of the 4-petal flowers: \(1 \times 4 = 4\) petals
- 1 of the 7-petal flowers: \(1 \times 7 = 7\) petals

The total number of petals dropped is:
\[5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\]

Subtracting the dropped petals from the initial total gives the number of petals remaining in the vase:
\[101 - 22 = 79\]

So, the total number of petals in the vase is:
\[79\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean to make S'mores:

John makes 9 S'mores, and DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so together they make:
\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \text{ S'mores} \]

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they use 18 marshmallows in total.

Next, we account for the marshmallows that were dropped on the ground:
\[ 18 \text{ marshmallows used} + 3 \text{ marshmallows dropped} = 21 \text{ marshmallows used and dropped} \]

Now, we subtract the total number of marshmallows used and dropped from the original number of marshmallows in the bag:
\[ 35 \text{ marshmallows} - 21 \text{ marshmallows used and dropped} = 14 \text{ marshmallows left} \]

Since John and DeSean are sharing the remaining marshmallows equally, we divide the remaining marshmallows by 2:
\[ \frac{14 \text{ marshmallows}}{2} = 7 \text{ marshmallows per person} \]

Therefore, each kid can have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag."
"First, let's determine the play times for each person:

- Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter.
- One friend can play for half as long as Jack, which is \(20 \div 2 = 10\) minutes.
- Another friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which is \(20 \times 1.5 = 30\) minutes.
- The third friend can play for 10 minutes, the same as the first friend.

Next, let's calculate the total play time in minutes:
- Jack plays for 20 minutes.
- The first friend plays for 10 minutes.
- The second friend plays for 30 minutes.
- The third friend plays for 10 minutes.

Total play time = \(20 + 10 + 30 + 10 = 70\) minutes.

Now, we need to determine how many quarters are used. Since each quarter allows for 20 minutes of play, we divide the total play time by 20:
- \(70 \div 20 = 3.5\).

Since Jack and his friends use whole quarters, they will use 4 quarters in total.

Therefore, the total amount of money used is 4 quarters."
"Let's denote the quantities of each ingredient as follows:
- Let \( S \) be the amount of salt used.
- Let \( O \) be the amount of oil used.
- Let \( F \) be the amount of fragrance used.
- Let \( C \) be the amount of citrus zest used.
- Let \( G \) be the amount of sugar used.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S = G \) (same amount of salt as sugar)
2. \( F = C \) (same amount of fragrance as citrus zest)
3. \( O = 2S \) (twice as much oil as salt)
4. \( S = C \) (same amount of salt as citrus zest)

Since \( S = C \) and \( F = C \), we can say \( S = F = C \).

The total amount of ingredients used is 10 ounces:
\[ S + O + F + C + G = 10 \]

Substituting the relationships into the equation:
\[ S + 2S + S + S + S = 10 \]
\[ 6S = 10 \]
\[ S = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \]

Since \( O = 2S \):
\[ O = 2 \times \frac{5}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \]

Therefore, the number of ounces of oil she uses is:
\[ \frac{10}{3} \]"
"To calculate the total amount of money John spent, we need to multiply the number of each type of animal by its respective cost and then add those amounts together.

For the goats:
3 goats * $500/goat = $1500

For the cows:
2 cows * $1500/cow = $3000

Now, we add the amounts spent on goats and cows:
$1500 + $3000 = $4500

So, the total amount of money John spent is $4500."
"Paul currently has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes, which totals to 8 + 40 = 48 cupcakes. He needs 63 cupcakes in total, so he should buy 63 - 48 = 15 more cupcakes."
"First, let's determine how many cars Joe initially has. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. The number of cars he sells is:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

After selling 8 cars, Joe has:

\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \text{ cars} \]

Then, Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

After giving away 16 cars, Joe has:

\[ 32 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, the final number of cars Joe remains with is:

\[ 16 \]"
"First, we need to determine how much money the students raised. The total amount raised by the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of this amount comes from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much each student raised. There are 20 students, and the total amount raised by the students is $125,000. So, the amount each student raised is:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

Thus, each student raised \(\boxed{6250}\) dollars."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Sandy spent walking over the two days in minutes.

First, let's determine the time Sandy spent walking on the second day. According to the problem, she walked half as many hours on the second day as she did on the first day. Since she walked for 8 hours on the first day, on the second day she walked for:
\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total time spent walking over the two days in hours:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Since we need the total time in minutes, we convert hours to minutes by multiplying by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes):
\[ 12 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is:
\[ 720 \text{ minutes} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of cars in the parking lot during the lunch break before any left.

Hunter initially counted 50 cars, and during the first break, he saw 20 more cars. Therefore, the total number of cars in the parking lot before the lunch break is:
\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \]

During the lunch break, half of the cars left the parking lot. So, the number of cars that left is:
\[ \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

The number of cars remaining in the parking lot after some left is:
\[ 70 - 35 = 35 \]

Therefore, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is:
\[ 35 \]"
"To calculate John's earnings for a full 7-day week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily earnings:
   - John does 30 cycles of work a day.
   - Each cycle has 5 tasks.
   - Each task pays $1.20.
   - Therefore, the earnings per cycle are \(5 \times 1.20 = 6.00\) dollars.
   - So, the daily earnings are \(30 \times 6.00 = 180.00\) dollars.

2. Calculate the weekly earnings:
   - John works 7 days a week.
   - Therefore, the weekly earnings are \(180.00 \times 7 = 1260.00\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is 1260.00."
"First, let's determine the points scored by Sasha and Julie in the first game.

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, so:
Julie's points in the first game = Sasha's points in the first game - 4
Julie's points in the first game = 14 - 4 = 10 points

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie did in the first game. So:
Sasha's points in the second game = Julie's points in the first game - 6
Sasha's points in the second game = 10 - 6 = 4 points

Now, let's calculate the total points Sasha scored during both games:
Total points Sasha scored = Sasha's points in the first game + Sasha's points in the second game
Total points Sasha scored = 14 + 4 = 18 points

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to calculate the total number of tins of cat food Kimberly bought. She bought 8 packages of cat food, and each package contains 11 tins. Therefore, the total number of tins of cat food is:

\[ 8 \times 11 = 88 \text{ tins} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of tins of dog food Kimberly bought. She bought 6 packages of dog food, and each package contains 6 tins. Therefore, the total number of tins of dog food is:

\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \text{ tins} \]

To find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we subtract the total number of tins of dog food from the total number of tins of cat food:

\[ 88 - 36 = 52 \]

So, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 52 \]"
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now we can find the number of cards Becca has:
\[ 3P + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

So, Becca has 153 cards.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of each color of eggs Cindy has:

- Cindy has 5 green eggs.
- She has twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so the number of blue eggs is \(2 \times 5 = 10\).
- She has one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so the number of pink eggs is \(10 - 1 = 9\).
- She has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so the number of yellow eggs is \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\).

Now, let's sum up all the eggs:

- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: 10
- Pink eggs: 9
- Yellow eggs: 3

Total number of eggs = 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27

The final numerical answer is 27."
"First, let's calculate the shipping cost. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound plus $0.08 per mile.

The cost for the weight of the book is:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.35/\text{pound} = \$1.40 \]

The cost for the distance is:
\[ 20 \text{ miles} \times \$0.08/\text{mile} = \$1.60 \]

So, the total shipping cost is:
\[ \$1.40 + \$1.60 = \$3.00 \]

Next, we calculate the refundable amount from the purchase price. Amazon will refund 75% of the book's purchase price:
\[ 32 \text{ dollars} \times 0.75 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we determine how much money Milly will lose. This is the difference between the cost of the shipping and the refundable amount:
\[ \$3.00 - \$24.00 = -\$21.00 \]

Since the negative value indicates a loss, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$21.00 \]"

Money left: $140 - $80 = $60

So, the final numerical answer is $60."
"To determine how many bars of chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to first calculate the total production for the first three weeks and then subtract this from the total monthly production.

First week production: 8,000 bars

Second week production: Half of the first week, so \( \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \) bars

Third week production: Three times the first week, so \( 8,000 \times 3 = 24,000 \) bars

Now, we add the production of the first three weeks:
\[ 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars} \]

Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. Therefore, the production in the fourth week is:

"To calculate the total cost for Angela, we need to break down the costs step by step.

First, let's calculate the base cost for the items Angela needs:
- She needs 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures.
- The base cost for 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures is $129.00.
- The cost for additional mirrors, chandeliers, and pictures will be calculated based on the extra items.

The cost for additional mirrors:
- Angela needs 6 - 4 = 2 additional mirrors.
- The cost for 2 additional mirrors is 2 * $15.00 = $30.00.

The cost for additional chandeliers:
- Angela needs 2 - 1 = 1 additional chandelier.
- The cost for 1 additional chandelier is 1 * $15.00 = $15.00.

The cost for additional pictures:
- Angela needs 20 - 10 = 10 additional pictures.
- The cost for 10 additional pictures is 10 * $15.00 = $150.00.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total distance across the highway:**
   - Let the distance across the highway be \( D \).
   - Let the speed of each kangaroo be \( v \).
   - Since it takes 3 kangaroos 18 hours to travel the distance \( D \), the total distance \( D \) can be calculated as:
     \[
     D = 3v \times 18 = 54v
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of each turtle:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of each turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).

3. **Calculate the time it takes for four turtles to travel the distance \( D \):**
   - Let \( t \) be the time it takes for four turtles to travel the distance \( D \).
   - The total distance \( D \) can also be expressed as:
     \[
     D = 4 \times \frac{v}{2} \times t = 2vt
     \]
   - Since we know \( D = 54v \), we can set up the equation:
     \[
     54v = 2vt
     \]
   - Solving for \( t \):
     \[
     t = \frac{54v}{2v} = 27
     \]

Therefore, it will take four turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway."

"First, let's calculate the total number of slices from the large apples. Adam decides to slice 3 large apples, and each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces. Therefore, the total number of slices from the large apples is:
\[ 3 \text{ apples} \times 5 \text{ slices/apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of slices from the small apples. Adam decides to slice 5 small apples, and each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces. Therefore, the total number of slices from the small apples is:
\[ 5 \text{ apples} \times 3 \text{ slices/apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's find the total number of slices Adam has after slicing all the apples:
\[ 15 \text{ slices (from large apples)} + 15 \text{ slices (from small apples)} = 30 \text{ slices} \]

Adam eats 15 slices. To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the number of slices Adam eats from the total number of slices:

"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to have to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to calculate the current daily milk production and then find out how much more milk is needed.

The current daily milk production from 3 cows is:
\[ 5 \text{ liters/cow/day} \times 3 \text{ cows} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The additional milk needed is:
\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow provides 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed to produce the additional 10 liters of milk is:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow/day}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

"First, let's determine the number of socks Jack has. According to the problem, Jack collected twice as many dishes as he had socks. Given that Jack collected 60 dishes, we can calculate the number of socks Jack has as follows:

\[ \text{Number of socks Jack has} = \frac{\text{Number of dishes Jack has}}{2} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

Next, we need to find out how many socks Peter has. The problem states that Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. Therefore:

\[ \text{Number of socks Peter has} = 2 \times \text{Number of socks Jack has} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of socks and dishes that Peter and Jack have together:

\[ \text{Total number of socks} = \text{Number of socks Peter has} + \text{Number of socks Jack has} = 60 + 30 = 90 \]
\[ \text{Total number of dishes} = \text{Number of dishes Jack has} = 60 \]

Adding the total number of socks and dishes together:

\[ \text{Total number of socks and dishes} = \text{Total number of socks} + \text{Total number of dishes} = 90 + 60 = 150 \]

So, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is:

\[ 150 \]"
"To determine the total number of students good at math, we need to consider those who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

Given:
- 5 students are good at math only.
- 8 students perform well in English only.
- The rest are good at both math and English.

First, we calculate the number of students who are good at both math and English. Since there are 20 students in total:
\[ \text{Total students} = 20 \]
\[ \text{Students good at math only} = 5 \]
\[ \text{Students performing well in English only} = 8 \]

The number of students good at both math and English is:
\[ \text{Students good at both} = \text{Total students} - (\text{Students good at math only} + \text{Students performing well in English only}) \]
\[ \text{Students good at both} = 20 - (5 + 8) \]
\[ \text{Students good at both} = 20 - 13 \]
\[ \text{Students good at both} = 7 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of students good at math. This includes those who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English:
\[ \text{Total students good at math} = \text{Students good at math only} + \text{Students good at both} \]
\[ \text{Total students good at math} = 5 + 7 \]
\[ \text{Total students good at math} = 12 \]

Time for one group:
- Getting on stage: 2 minutes
- Performing: 6 minutes
- Exiting stage: 2 minutes
- Intermission: 10 minutes

Total time for one group = 2 + 6 + 2 + 10 = 20 minutes

The concert duration is 2 hours, which is equivalent to 120 minutes.

To find out how many groups can perform, we divide the total concert time by the time required for one group:

"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
2. Divide the total amount spent on shoes by the total number of pairs bought in a year.

James buys 2 pairs of shoes each month. There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of pairs of shoes he buys in a year is:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair of shoes, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs bought:
\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down year by year:

1. In the first year, the town builds 12 homes.
2. In the second year, they build three times the number of homes built in the first year. So, they build \(3 \times 12 = 36\) homes.
3. In the third year, they double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total number of homes built in the first two years is \(12 + 36 = 48\). Therefore, in the third year, they build \(2 \times 48 = 96\) homes.

Now, to find the total number of homes built over the three years, we add the number of homes built each year:

- First year: 12 homes
- Second year: 36 homes
- Third year: 96 homes

Total homes built = \(12 + 36 + 96 = 144\)

The final numerical answer is 144."
"Let's denote the ages as follows:
- Let \( B \) be the age of your brother.
- Let \( S \) be the age of your sister.
- Let \( M \) be the age of your mom.
- Let \( Y \) be your age.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( Y = B - 3 \).
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( Y = S + 2 \).
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( M = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all your ages is 87: \( Y + B + S + M = 87 \).

First, we can express \( B \) and \( S \) in terms of \( Y \):
- From \( Y = B - 3 \), we get \( B = Y + 3 \).
- From \( Y = S + 2 \), we get \( S = Y - 2 \).

Next, we substitute \( B \) and \( S \) into the equation for \( M \):
- \( M = 3B - 1 = 3(Y + 3) - 1 = 3Y + 9 - 1 = 3Y + 8 \).

Now we substitute \( Y \), \( B \), \( S \), and \( M \) into the sum of the ages equation:
- \( Y + B + S + M = 87 \)
- \( Y + (Y + 3) + (Y - 2) + (3Y + 8) = 87 \)
- \( Y + Y + 3 + Y - 2 + 3Y + 8 = 87 \)
- \( 6Y + 9 = 87 \)
- \( 6Y = 78 \)
- \( Y = 13 \).

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of new infections each day and add them to the total number of infected people.

- **Day 0**: Initially, there are 10 infected people.
- **Day 1**: Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others, so the number of new infections is \(10 \times 6 = 60\). Therefore, the total number of infected people after Day 1 is \(10 + 60 = 70\).
- **Day 2**: Now there are 70 infected people. Each of these 70 people infects 6 others, so the number of new infections is \(70 \times 6 = 420\). Therefore, the total number of infected people after Day 2 is \(70 + 420 = 490\).
- **Day 3**: Now there are 490 infected people. Each of these 490 people infects 6 others, so the number of new infections is \(490 \times 6 = 2940\). Therefore, the total number of infected people after Day 3 is \(490 + 2940 = 3430\).

So, the total number of infected people after three days is 3430."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Rafaela received as tips. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate the total as follows:

\[ \text{Total tips for Rafaela} = 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money Julieta received. Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's total tips:

\[ 10\% \text{ of Rafaela's tips} = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]

So, Julieta received:

\[ \text{Total tips for Julieta} = 800 - 80 = 720 \]

Now, to find the total amount of money both Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether, we add their individual totals:

\[ \text{Total tips for both} = 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

"First, let's establish the number of badges each person earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge per month. Therefore, in a year (12 months), Claire earns:
\[ 1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ badges} \]

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire. Since Claire takes 1 month, Amber takes:
\[ 2 \times 1 \text{ month} = 2 \text{ months} \]
to earn a badge. Therefore, in a year, Amber earns:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/badge}} = 6 \text{ badges} \]

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. Since Claire earns 12 badges in a year, Wendy earns:
\[ 3 \times 12 \text{ badges} = 36 \text{ badges} \]

Now, to find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns:
\[ 36 \text{ badges} - 6 \text{ badges} = 30 \text{ badges} \]

The final numerical answer is:

1. Calculate the total number of hours Paige baked.
2. Determine the total number of banana bread loaves baked.
3. Calculate the total number of slices.
4. Find out the total revenue from selling all the slices.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours Paige baked.**
Paige baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a span of 5 hours.

**Step 2: Determine the total number of banana bread loaves baked.**
Since Paige can bake 2 loaves per hour, in 5 hours she can bake:
\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of slices.**
Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so for 10 loaves:
\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

**Step 4: Find out the total revenue from selling all the slices.**
Each slice is sold for 50 cents, so for 80 slices:

"Let's denote the number of books that Anne has as \( A \), the number of books that Sofie has as \( S \), and the number of books that Fawn has as \( F \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S = A + 25 \)
2. \( A = F - 12 \)
3. \( S + A + F = 85 \)

We can substitute the expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) from the first two equations into the third equation.

First, substitute \( S = A + 25 \) into the third equation:
\[ (A + 25) + A + F = 85 \]
\[ 2A + F + 25 = 85 \]
\[ 2A + F = 60 \]

Next, substitute \( A = F - 12 \) into the equation \( 2A + F = 60 \):
\[ 2(F - 12) + F = 60 \]
\[ 2F - 24 + F = 60 \]
\[ 3F - 24 = 60 \]
\[ 3F = 84 \]
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books. Let's verify this by finding the number of books Anne and Sofie have:
\[ A = F - 12 = 28 - 12 = 16 \]
\[ S = A + 25 = 16 + 25 = 41 \]

Now, let's check the total:
\[ S + A + F = 41 + 16 + 28 = 85 \]

The total is correct, so the number of books Fawn has is \(\boxed{28}\)."

\]

So, after the first day, the number of pieces remaining is:

\[
60 - 24 = 36 \text{ pieces}
\]

On the second day, Tobias ate 10 pieces, so the number of pieces remaining after the second day is:

\[ \text{Number of chickens to sell} = \frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling these 180 chickens at $50 per chicken:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 180 \times 50 = 9000 \]

Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. Therefore, the total cost price of the chickens sold can be calculated by subtracting the profit from the total revenue:
\[ \text{Total cost price} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Profit} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \]

Since Isaias plans to sell 180 chickens, the cost price per chicken is:
\[ \text{Cost price per chicken} = \frac{\text{Total cost price}}{\text{Number of chickens sold}} = \frac{7000}{180} \]

Now, let's calculate the exact cost price per chicken:
\[ \text{Cost price per chicken} = \frac{7000}{180} = \frac{7000 \div 20}{180 \div 20} = \frac{350}{9} \approx 38.89 \]

Therefore, the cost price of the chickens Isaias bought for sale is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{350}{9}} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many glasses of lemonade Micah sold. We know that Julie sold 14 glasses and the total number of glasses sold by Julie, Micah, and Mitchell is 32. Since the boys (Micah and Mitchell) sold an equal number of glasses, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Glasses sold by Julie} + \text{Glasses sold by Micah} + \text{Glasses sold by Mitchell} = 32 \]

Given that Julie sold 14 glasses and Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, let's denote the number of glasses sold by each of the boys as \( x \). Therefore, the equation becomes:

\[ 14 + x + x = 32 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 14 + 2x = 32 \]

Subtract 14 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 9 \]

So, Micah sold 9 glasses of lemonade. Now, we need to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah:

\[ \text{Glasses sold by Julie} - \text{Glasses sold by Micah} = 14 - 9 = 5 \]

Thus, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 5 \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the manicure. Since the manicure cost 1/4 as much as the hair treatment, we calculate:

\[ \text{Cost of manicure} = \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the pedicure, which is 3/4 as much as the manicure:

\[ \text{Cost of pedicure} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \]

Now, we add up the costs of the hair treatment, manicure, and pedicure to find the total amount Iris spent:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 400 + 100 + 75 = 575 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 575 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much money Sarah will make from selling her 20-meter rope at $2 per meter.

\[ \text{Total money from selling the rope} = 20 \text{ meters} \times \$2/\text{meter} = \$40 \]

Next, we need to determine how much the new rope will cost. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter.

\[ \text{Cost of the new rope} = 1 \text{ meter} \times \$1.5/\text{meter} = \$1.5 \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the money Sarah made from selling her rope to find out how much money she will have left over.

\[ \text{Money left over} = \$40 - \$1.5 = \$38.5 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$38.5 \]"
"Let's denote Melanie's current age as \( M \).

According to the problem, in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ M + 10 = 18 \]

Solving for \( M \):
\[ M = 18 - 10 \]
\[ M = 8 \]

So, Melanie's current age is 8 years.

We need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. Let's denote the number of years from now as \( x \). In \( x \) years, Melanie's age will be \( 8 + x \). We want this to be three times her current age, so we set up the equation:
\[ 8 + x = 3 \times 8 \]
\[ 8 + x = 24 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 16 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of each item Kelly has in her cart.

1. **Cost of Bacon:**
   Kelly has 5 packs of bacon, and they cost $10 in total.
   \[
   \text{Cost per pack of bacon} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of Chicken:**
   Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, and each packet costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   \[
   \text{Cost per packet of chicken} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of chicken} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of Strawberries:**
   Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, and each pack costs $4.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of strawberries} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Cost of Apples:**
   Kelly has 7 packs of apples, and each pack costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   \[
   \text{Price of one pack of apples} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of apples} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's sum up the total cost of all the items:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of bacon} + \text{Cost of chicken} + \text{Cost of strawberries} + \text{Cost of apples}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 10 + 24 + 12 + 14 = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget:
\[
\text{Money left} = 65 - 60 = 5 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, Kelly has \(\boxed{5}\) dollars left in her budget."
"Let's denote the usual runtime of Elaina's concerts as \( x \) minutes. According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, so the final concert duration is \( 2x \) minutes. Additionally, at the end of the final concert, she performs a 15-minute encore. Therefore, the total runtime of the final concert is the sum of the concert duration and the encore, which is given as 65 minutes. We can write this as:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual runtime of Elaina's concerts is 25 minutes. Let's confirm this by calculating the total runtime of the final concert:

\[ 2 \times 25 + 15 = 50 + 15 = 65 \]

The calculation confirms that the total runtime is indeed 65 minutes. Therefore, the usual runtime of Elaina's concerts is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Argo initially has 200 toys. After giving away 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky, the total number of toys given away is 40 + 80 + 30 = 150 toys. Therefore, the number of toys Argo has now is 200 - 150 = 50 toys."
"To find the total number of chimichangas made on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday, we need to add the number of chimichangas made each day.

- On Tuesday, they make 125 chimichangas.
- On Wednesday, they also make 125 chimichangas.
- On Friday, they make twice as many as on Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 125 = 250\) chimichangas.

Now, we add the number of chimichangas made on these three days:

\[ 125 + 125 + 250 = 500 \]

So, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many microphones can be paired and then find out how many pairs can be arranged.

First, calculate the number of microphones that won't fit in pairs:
20% of 50 microphones won't fit, so:
\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \text{ microphones} \]

This means that:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ microphones} \]
can be paired.

Now, to find out how many pairs of microphones can be arranged:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ pairs} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of birds flying overhead. Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes. According to the problem, 2/3 of that number of birds are flying overhead. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of birds flying overhead} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of birds feeding. Jerry counts 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of birds feeding} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, we add up all the birds Jerry counts:

\[ \text{Total number of birds} = \text{Number of birds nesting} + \text{Number of birds flying overhead} + \text{Number of birds feeding} \]
\[ \text{Total number of birds} = 6 + 4 + 24 = 34 \]

So, the total number of birds Jerry counts is:

\[ 34 \]"
"Lani started with 55 cookies and ate 5, so she had 55 - 5 = 50 cookies left. She placed these 50 cookies equally into 5 jars, so each jar had 50 / 5 = 10 cookies.

"First, let's calculate the total number of petals on the orchids. Joelle has 5 orchids, and each orchid has 5 petals. So, the total number of petals on the orchids is:

\[ 5 \text{ orchids} \times 5 \text{ petals/orchid} = 25 \text{ petals} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals on the African daisies. Joelle has 4 African daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals. So, the total number of petals on the daisies is:

\[ 4 \text{ daisies} \times 10 \text{ petals/daisy} = 40 \text{ petals} \]

Now, to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies:

\[ 40 \text{ petals} - 25 \text{ petals} = 15 \text{ petals} \]

So, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 15 \]"
"First, let's find out how many indoor plants there are. Since one-fourth of the plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, we find out how many plants are remaining after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants, so we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. We can find the number of flowering plants by subtracting the number of indoor and outdoor plants from the total number of plants:

\[ \text{Number of flowering plants} = 100 - 25 - 50 = 25 \]

To find what percent of the plants are flowering plants, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 25 \]"
"To find the speed of the whirligig, we first need to determine the speed of the thingamabob. We know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of the thingamabob can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{\text{Speed of whatchamacallit}}{11} = \frac{121 \text{ meters/second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters/second} \]

Now, we know that a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of the whirligig is:

\[ \text{Speed of whirligig} = 5 \times \text{Speed of thingamabob} = 5 \times 11 \text{ meters/second} = 55 \text{ meters/second} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 55 \]"
"Let's break down the costs Ellen incurs each day:

- The salad costs $6.
- The yogurt costs half the price of the salad, which is $6 / 2 = $3.
- Let the cost of one carrot be \( C \).

Ellen eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day. The total cost for these items is given as $11. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total cost as:

\[ 2C + 6 + 3 = 11 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2C + 9 = 11 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 2C = 2 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ C = 1 \]

So, the cost of one carrot every day is $1.

"Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( x \).

From the first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times.

From the second week, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5x \) times.

The payment for mowing Joe's lawn was $6, so the payment for mowing Kamala's lawn was \( 3x \times 6 = 18x \) and for mowing Alba's lawn was \( 5x \times 6 = 30x \).

The total earnings from mowing lawns is the sum of the payments for Joe's, Kamala's, and Alba's lawns:
\[ 6 + 18x + 30x = 6 + 48x \]

Tasha's total earnings from selling lemonade and mowing lawns was $80. Therefore, the earnings from mowing lawns alone is:
\[ 6 + 48x = 80 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 48x = 80 - 6 \]
\[ 48x = 74 \]
\[ x = \frac{74}{48} = \frac{37}{24} \]

Now, we calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns:
\[ 6 + 48 \times \frac{37}{24} = 6 + 2 \times 37 = 6 + 74 = 80 \]

Since the total earnings from mowing lawns is $80, the earnings from lemonade sales is:
\[ 80 - 80 = 0 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 0 \]"

"First, let's calculate the total number of hours John rents his car out in a month. He rents his car 10 times a month, and each time for 3 hours. So, the total hours rented in a month is:

\[ 10 \text{ times/month} \times 3 \text{ hours/time} = 30 \text{ hours/month} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money John earns from renting his car in a month. He gets $25 per hour, so:

\[ 30 \text{ hours/month} \times $25/\text{hour} = $750/\text{month} \]

Now, we need to find out his profit. His profit is the total earnings minus his car payment. His car payment is $500 per month, so:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of soup and how it can be distributed among the family members.

Calvin, his wife, and their two children make a total of 4 people. Each adult's bowl holds the same amount of soup as 8 child's bowls. Therefore, each adult's bowl is equivalent to 8 child's bowls.

First, let's calculate the total number of child's bowls' worth of soup:
- There are 4 adults, so the adults' bowls are equivalent to \(4 \times 8 = 32\) child's bowls.
- There are 2 children, so the children's bowls are equivalent to \(2 \times 1 = 2\) child's bowls.
- Therefore, the total number of child's bowls' worth of soup is \(32 + 2 = 34\) child's bowls.

Since the pot can fill 8 child's bowls, we need to determine how many times the pot can be refilled:
- The pot can fill 8 child's bowls, so it can be refilled \(\frac{34}{8} = 4.25\) times.

Since we can only have whole refills, the pot can be refilled 4 times. Each refill will provide 8 child's bowls of soup.

Thus, the number of times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup is:
\[
\boxed{4}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of material Jo needs for both small and large masks.

First, let's find out how much material is needed for one small mask:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for one small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4} = 0.5 \text{ yards} \).

Next, let's find out how much material is needed for one large mask:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for one large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3} = 0.75 \text{ yards} \).

Now, we calculate the material needed for 20 small masks:
- Material for 20 small masks = \( 20 \times 0.5 \text{ yards} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

Then, we calculate the material needed for 8 large masks:
- Material for 8 large masks = \( 8 \times 0.75 \text{ yards} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

Finally, we add the material needed for both small and large masks:
- Total material needed = \( 10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards} \).

The total amount of material Jo would need to make 20 small and 8 large masks is 16 yards."
"To find the average price per ticket, we first need to determine the total number of tickets Fast and the Furious movies Deepa has seen. Since there are 9 movies and she has seen each one three times, the total number of tickets is:

\[ 9 \text{ movies} \times 3 \text{ times per movie} = 27 \text{ tickets} \]

Deepa has spent $216 in total for these 27 tickets. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets:

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information provided.

Let \( D \) be Duncan's age and \( A \) be Adam's age.

From the problem, we know:
1. Duncan's current age \( D = 60 \).
2. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( D - 8 \).
3. Four years ago, Adam's age was \( A - 4 \).
4. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was two times Adam's age four years ago, which gives us the equation: \( D - 8 = 2(A - 4) \).

Now, let's substitute \( D = 60 \) into the equation:
\[ 60 - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 26 = A - 4 \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam's current age is 30. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

Now, we add 100 acres to this amount to find the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \text{ acres} \]

Next, we need to find the total number of acres for both farms combined. We add the size of Farmer Brown's farm to the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 200 + 500 = 700 \text{ acres} \]

Therefore, the total number of acres for both farms together is:
\[ 700 \]"
"First, let's determine how many packages Colby completes per hour. If he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

So, Colby completes 40 packages per hour. 

Next, we need to find out how many packages he completes in an eight-hour workday. We do this by multiplying the number of packages he completes per hour by the number of hours in an eight-hour workday:

\[ 40 \times 8 = 320 \]

Colby completes 320 packages in an eight-hour workday. 

Since he gets paid $0.20 for each package he completes, we can calculate his total earnings for the day by multiplying the number of packages by the pay rate:

\[ 320 \times 0.20 = 64 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday is $64."

From the problem, we know:
- Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon, so the total pieces of bologna thrown at red balloons is \( 2R \).
- Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, so the total pieces of bologna thrown at yellow balloons is \( 3Y \).
- The total number of pieces of bologna thrown is 58.
- The number of red balloons is 20.

So, we can write the following equations:
\[ 2R + 3Y = 58 \]
\[ R = 20 \]

Substituting \( R = 20 \) into the first equation:
\[ 2(20) + 3Y = 58 \]
\[ 40 + 3Y = 58 \]
\[ 3Y = 58 - 40 \]
\[ 3Y = 18 \]
\[ Y = \frac{18}{3} \]
\[ Y = 6 \]

Therefore, the number of yellow balloons is 6.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total distance Jon drives in a month. Since he drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, the total distance is:

\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how many tune-ups he needs. Since the car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total distance by 1000:

\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

So, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time."
"To find the total number of hours Bruce works over the three days, we will calculate the hours worked each day and then sum them up.

1. **Tuesday**: Bruce works for 5 hours.
2. **Wednesday**: Bruce works twice the time he works on Tuesday. Therefore, he works \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.
3. **Thursday**: Bruce works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday. Therefore, he works \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.

Now, we sum the hours worked over the three days:
\[ 5 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 10 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 8 \text{ (Thursday)} = 23 \text{ hours} \]

The total number of hours Bruce works in all these three days is 23."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount spent and then determine how much each girl received from their allowance.

1. **Calculate the cost of the cake:**
   The cake costs $11.

2. **Calculate the cost of the balloons:**
   They bought 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons.
   The price is $0.5 for 2 balloons.
   Therefore, the cost per balloon is $0.5 / 2 = $0.25.
   The total cost for 12 balloons is 12 * $0.25 = $3.

3. **Calculate the cost of the ice cream:**
   They bought 2 tubs of ice cream, each costing $7.
   The total cost for the ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

4. **Calculate the total amount spent:**
   The total amount spent is the sum of the cost of the cake, the balloons, and the ice cream.
   Total amount spent = $11 + $3 + $14 = $28.

5. **Determine the total allowance given to Julia and Nadine:**
   Since they combined their allowances, the total allowance is $28.

6. **Calculate the amount each girl received:**
   Each girl received half of the total allowance.
   Amount each girl received = $28 / 2 = $14.

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14."

"First, let's determine the number of students playing each sport:

- Tennis: There are 6 students playing tennis.
- Volleyball: There are twice the number of students playing tennis, so \( 6 \times 2 = 12 \) students playing volleyball.
- Soccer: There are 16 boys and 22 girls, making a total of \( 16 + 22 = 38 \) students playing soccer.

Now, let's add up all the students:

- Tennis students: 6
- Volleyball students: 12
- Soccer students: 38

Total number of students = \( 6 + 12 + 38 = 56 \)

The final numerical answer is 56."
"First, let's calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class. Since there are 30 students and each student sold an average of 10 lollipops, the total number of lollipops sold is:

\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops. Each lollypop was sold for $0.8, so the total revenue is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollypop} = \$240 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops. Each lollypop cost $0.5, so the total cost is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollypop} = \$150 \]

Finally, the profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ \$240 - \$150 = \$90 \]

So, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops."
"To solve this problem, we will break it down step by step and calculate the number of each type of pet Larry has.

1. **Number of Cats:**
   Larry has 3 cats.

2. **Number of Dogs:**
   Larry has 3 times as many dogs as cats. Therefore, the number of dogs is:
   \[
   3 \times 3 = 9
   \]

3. **Number of Rabbits:**
   Larry has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. Therefore, the number of rabbits is:
   \[
   9 - 2 = 7
   \]

4. **Number of Fish:**
   Larry has three times the number of fish as rabbits. Therefore, the number of fish is:
   \[
   3 \times 7 = 21
   \]

5. **Number of Gerbils:**
   Larry has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has. Therefore, the number of gerbils is:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]

Now, we sum up all the pets Larry has:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Adding these together:
\[
3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cups of chamomile and mint tea Lana brews in each row, and then find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row.

First, let's determine how many cups of chamomile and mint tea are in each row. Lana has 27 cups in total and divides them into 3 rows with an equal number of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row. This means that in each row, there are \( \frac{27}{3} = 9 \) cups of tea in total. Since the cups are divided equally between chamomile and mint tea, each row contains \( \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \) cups of chamomile tea and \( \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \) cups of mint tea.

Therefore, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is 4.5.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which the sloth picks berries and then use that rate to find out how many berries he can pick up in the given time.

First, let's break down the time it takes for the sloth to pick up berries:
- The sloth takes 4 hours to go down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up.

This means the time spent picking berries is:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]
(The 2 hours are spent going down and climbing back up, so the time spent picking berries is the remaining time.)

Next, we know the sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours. We need to find out how many berries he can pick up in the 2 hours he spends picking berries.

The rate at which the sloth picks berries is:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{\text{Total berries}}{\text{Total time}} = \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{8 \text{ hours}} = 3 \text{ berries per hour} \]

Now, we need to find out how many berries he can pick up in the 2 hours he spends picking berries:
\[ \text{Berries picked in 2 hours} = 3 \text{ berries per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ berries} \]

Therefore, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip down to the ground is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, we need to determine the amount of water in the tank. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons of water, the tank will have:

\[ \text{Tank capacity} = \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much water will be left in the tank after 6 days, given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. The total amount of water removed from the tank over 6 days is:

\[ \text{Total water removed} = 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, to find out how much water remains in the tank after 6 days, we subtract the total amount of water removed from the tank's initial capacity:

\[ \text{Water remaining} = 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of money Colby has left after buying the popcorn and candy:**
   - Cost of popcorn and candy: $8 + $2 = $10
   - Money left after buying popcorn and candy: $150 - $10 = $140

2. **Determine the cost of the tickets Colby can afford with the remaining money:**
   - Since it's a Friday, tickets cost $10 each.
   - Number of tickets Colby can buy with $140: $140 / $10 = 14 tickets

3. **Calculate the total number of tickets Colby has already used:**
   - Tickets used on Fridays and Saturdays: 5
   - Tickets used on other days: 8
   - Total tickets used: 5 + 8 = 13 tickets

4. **Calculate the number of tickets Colby can still afford:**
   - Tickets still available: 14 - 13 = 1 ticket

5. **Add the tickets Colby can still afford to the tickets he has already used:**
   - Total tickets Colby can see: 13 (already used) + 1 (still available) = 14 tickets

"First, we need to calculate the calories for the mini cinnamon rolls. Since a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll, we calculate the calories for one mini cinnamon roll as follows:

\[ \text{Calories per mini cinnamon roll} = \frac{600 \text{ calories}}{3} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Since Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls, the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls are:

\[ \text{Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls} = 200 \text{ mini cinnamon rolls} \times 200 \text{ calories per mini cinnamon roll} = 40000 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we calculate the calories for the mini blueberry muffins. Since a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin, we calculate the calories for one mini blueberry muffin as follows:

\[ \text{Calories per mini blueberry muffin} = \frac{450 \text{ calories}}{3} = 150 \text{ calories} \]

Since Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins, the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins are:

\[ \text{Total calories from mini blueberry muffins} = 300 \text{ mini blueberry muffins} \times 150 \text{ calories per mini blueberry muffin} = 45000 \text{ calories} \]

Finally, we add the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins to get the total calories from all the pastries:

\[ \text{Total calories} = 40000 \text{ calories} + 45000 \text{ calories} = 85000 \text{ calories} \]

The final numerical answer is 85000 calories."
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the five days and then divide that total by the number of days.

Let's break it down:

- On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
- On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday. So, for each of these days, she removed \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
- On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
- On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days:

\[ \text{Total Junebugs} = 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 \]

Next, we calculate the sum:

\[ 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 330 \]

Now, to find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days (which is 5):

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{330}{5} \]

Let's perform the division:

\[ \frac{330}{5} = 66 \]

So, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is 66."
"First, we calculate the distance traveled by the bus. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For the bus:
\[ \text{Speed} = 60 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, the distance traveled by the bus is:
\[ 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance traveled by the car:
\[ \text{Speed} = 30 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

So, the distance traveled by the car is:
\[ 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 240 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:
\[ 300 \text{ miles} - 240 \text{ miles} = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to add up all the toys Sophie already has and then subtract that total from the final count of toys.

"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old:
\[ P + Pa + J = 100 \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
\[ Pa = J + 10 \]

3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
\[ P = Pa + J \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[ P = (J + 10) + J \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 \]

Now, we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

Now that we have \( J \), we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[ Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

So, the age of Peter is \( 50 \) years old.

"To determine how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the total cost for his stay under both options and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost if Cameron chooses the 24-hour option:
- The base cost for 24 hours is 1600 pesos.
- Since Cameron stays for 24 hours, there are no additional hours to pay for.

So, the total cost for the 24-hour option is 1600 pesos.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Cameron chooses the option of adding 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark:
- The base cost for the first 12 hours is 1000 pesos.
- Cameron stays for 24 hours, so he has 12 additional hours.
- The cost for the additional 12 hours is 12 * 70 pesos = 840 pesos.

So, the total cost for the 12-hour option is 1000 pesos + 840 pesos = 1840 pesos.

Now, we find the difference between the two options to determine how much Cameron would save:
- The difference is 1840 pesos - 1600 pesos = 240 pesos.

Therefore, Cameron would save 240 pesos.

"First, let's calculate how much John earned in the week:
\[ \text{Earnings} = \text{Hourly Wage} \times \text{Hours Worked} = 50 \times 6 = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the cost of gas from his earnings:
\[ \text{Remaining after gas} = \text{Earnings} - \text{Cost of Gas} = 300 - 50 = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the pencils:
\[ \text{Cost of Pencils} = \text{Number of Pencils} \times \text{Cost per Pencil} = 5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the cost of the pencils from the remaining money:
\[ \text{Remaining after pencils} = \text{Remaining after gas} - \text{Cost of Pencils} = 250 - 50 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so we subtract that from the remaining money:
\[ \text{Remaining after deposit} = \text{Remaining after pencils} - \text{Deposit} = 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we calculate how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with the remaining money:

"To calculate the total earnings, we need to multiply the quantity of each type of root crop by its respective price and then sum up all the earnings.

For the yams:
6 yams * $1.5 per yam = $9.00

For the sweet potatoes:
10 sweet potatoes * $2 per sweet potato = $20.00

For the carrots:
4 carrots * $1.25 per carrot = $5.00

Now, we add up all the earnings:
$9.00 + $20.00 + $5.00 = $34.00

So, Jen will earn $34.00 if she sells everything."
"First, let's calculate the distance James swims. He swims 60% of the 20-mile lake, which is:

\[ 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes for James to swim 12 miles at a pace of 2 miles per hour:

\[ \text{Time to swim 12 miles} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

James rests for half as long as the swimming time, so his rest time is:

\[ \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the remaining distance to be swum, which is:

\[ 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

Since he swims at half the speed after resting, his new swimming speed is:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile/hour} \]

The time it takes to swim the remaining 8 miles at this speed is:

\[ \text{Time to swim remaining 8 miles} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, the total time taken to get across the lake is the sum of the swimming time, rest time, and the time to swim the remaining distance:

\[ \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time it took James to get across the lake is:

\[ 17 \text{ hours} \]"

   - Total commission from New York Times: \( 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \)

3. Calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal:
   - Commission rate for Wall Street Journal: 8%
   - Cost of each Wall Street Journal: $15
   - Commission per Wall Street Journal: \( 8\% \times 15 = 0.08 \times 15 = 1.20 \)

4. Calculate the total commission from the Wall Street Journal:
   - Number of Wall Street Journal sold: 10
   - Total commission from Wall Street Journal: \( 10 \times 1.20 = 12.00 \)

5. Calculate the total commission from both newspapers:
   - Total commission: \( 3.00 + 12.00 = 15.00 \)

Therefore, the total commission Cayley will earn is $15.00."
"To find Leo's age, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's denote:
- Marcus's age as \( M \)
- Leo's age as \( L \)
- Deanna's age as \( D \)

From the problem, we know:
1. Marcus is half of Leo’s age: \( M = \frac{1}{2}L \)
2. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna: \( M = D - 5 \)
3. Deanna is 26 years old: \( D = 26 \)

First, we substitute Deanna's age into the second equation to find Marcus's age:
\[ M = 26 - 5 = 21 \]

Now we know Marcus is 21 years old. Using the first equation, we can find Leo's age:
\[ 21 = \frac{1}{2}L \]

To solve for \( L \), we multiply both sides by 2:
\[ L = 21 \times 2 = 42 \]

So, Leo is 42 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
42"
"Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as \( A \), by Bahati as \( B \), and by Dinar as \( D \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( B = A + 20 \)
2. \( B = D + 10 \)
3. \( B + A + D = 45 \)

First, we can express \( D \) in terms of \( A \) using the first two equations:
From \( B = A + 20 \) and \( B = D + 10 \), we can equate the two expressions for \( B \):
\[ A + 20 = D + 10 \]
Solving for \( D \), we get:
\[ D = A + 10 \]

Now we substitute \( B \) and \( D \) in terms of \( A \) into the third equation:
\[ (A + 20) + A + (A + 10) = 45 \]
Simplifying the left side:
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]
Subtract 30 from both sides:
\[ 3A = 15 \]
Divide by 3:
\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of reports Vince stapled from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM.

First, calculate the total time Vince was stapling reports:
- From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Next, convert the total time into minutes:
- 15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes.

Now, determine how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:
- 900 minutes / 15 minutes/interval = 60 intervals.

Since Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes, we can calculate the total number of reports stapled:
- 60 intervals * 30 reports/interval = 1800 reports.

Therefore, the total number of reports Vince stapled is 1800."
"To calculate the total sleep time Kim had on that day, we need to consider her usual sleep duration and adjust for the changes.

1. Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours.
2. 8 hours is equivalent to 480 minutes.
3. On that particular day, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m. instead of 6 a.m.
4. She sleepwalked from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes.
5. Therefore, she was on her bed from 2:15 a.m. to 5:55 a.m., which is 11 hours and 40 minutes.

To find out how many minutes she slept on her bed:
- From 2:15 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 11 hours and 40 minutes.
- 11 hours is 660 minutes.
- Adding the 40 minutes, we get 700 minutes.

"First, let's determine the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has initially. Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has two dozen (24) measuring cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons as follows:

\[ \text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

Next, Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons he has remaining is:

\[ \text{Remaining measuring spoons} = 16 - 6 = 10 \]

Now, we add the remaining measuring spoons to the number of measuring cups to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining:

\[ \text{Total utensils} = \text{Remaining measuring spoons} + \text{Measuring cups} = 10 + 24 = 34 \]

So, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is 34."
"First, let's determine the initial number of occupied beds in the hospital. Given that the hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied, we can calculate the initial number of occupied beds as follows:

\[ \text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of patients admitted over 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, the total number of patients admitted over 2 weeks (14 days) is:

\[ \text{Total patients admitted} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

Now, we can find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks by adding the initial number of occupied beds to the total number of patients admitted:

\[ \text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Finally, to find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the total number of occupied beds from the total capacity of the hospital:

\[ \text{Unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 900 = 100 \]

The total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100."
"First, let's determine the number of emails Robyn sends to her family. We know that out of the sixteen emails, seven are work emails. Therefore, the number of non-work emails is:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these non-work emails are sent to her family. According to the problem, two-thirds of the non-work emails are sent to her family. So, the number of emails sent to her family is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

Now, we need to find out how many emails are left after sending emails to her family. This is:

\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

These remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. According to the problem, one-third of these remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. So, the number of emails sent to her boyfriend is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

Therefore, the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day is:

"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate the number that is 20% less than the number Courtney reported.

Courtney reported 48 people. If this number is 120% of the actual number of people, we can set up the following equation to find the actual number of people (let's call it \( x \)):

\[ 120\% \times x = 48 \]

First, convert the percentage to a decimal:

\[ 1.20 \times x = 48 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]

\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \). According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so we can set \( 2J = 2 \). Solving for \( J \), we get \( J = 1 \). This means Jeffrey carried 1 ball, Jason carried \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) balls, and Jordan carried \( 4 \times 1 = 4 \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey:
\[ 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 7."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Day**: The pirates dug 10 holes.
2. **Second Day**: They dug 13 holes.
3. **Third Day**: They dug 8 holes but also filled in 2 holes, so the net increase in holes is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
\[ 10 \text{ (first day)} + 13 \text{ (second day)} + 6 \text{ (third day net increase)} = 29 \text{ holes} \]

According to the problem, by the end of the third day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. The number of holes at the end of the first day was 10, so:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ holes} \]

This means that by the end of the third day, the island had 40 holes. Since we already calculated that there were 29 holes by the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[ 40 - 29 = 11 \text{ holes} \]

Therefore, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of corn chips based on the given conditions.

\[ \text{Collins' chips} = 70 + 15 = 85 \]

Next, calculate the total number of corn chips by summing the chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:
\[ \text{Total chips} = 70 + 70 + 85 \]

Now, perform the addition:
\[ 70 + 70 = 140 \]
\[ 140 + 85 = 225 \]

"First, we need to calculate the cost of the travel tickets. The problem states that the travel tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. The supplies cost $400.

To find 50% of $400, we calculate:
\[ 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the additional cost for the travel tickets is $200. Adding this to the original cost of the supplies gives us the total cost for the travel tickets:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Therefore, the total cost for the travel is $600.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 600 \]"
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( X = S + 5 \)
2. \( S = 4A - 13 \)
3. \( X + S + A = 339 \)

First, we substitute the expressions for \( X \) and \( S \) from the first two equations into the third equation.

Substituting \( X = S + 5 \) and \( S = 4A - 13 \) into \( X + S + A = 339 \):

\[ (4A - 13) + 5 + (4A - 13) + A = 339 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 4A - 13 + 5 + 4A - 13 + A = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Add 21 to both sides:

\[ 9A = 360 \]

Divide by 9:

\[ A = 40 \]

Now, we can find \( S \) using \( S = 4A - 13 \):

\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

"First, let's determine the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington initially had:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we calculate the number of boxes she gave to her mom and her sister:
\[ 2 \text{ boxes} + 2 \text{ boxes} = 4 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, we find out how many boxes she kept:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} - 4 \text{ boxes} = 8 \text{ boxes} \]

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges, so we need to find out how many boxes that represents:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 \text{ boxes} = 3 \text{ boxes} \]

This means she kept 3 boxes, and thus sold the remaining boxes:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} - 3 \text{ boxes} = 9 \text{ boxes} \]

\[ 4 \text{ hours/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ hours} \]

Since she uses 1 ounce of sunscreen per hour, the total amount of sunscreen she will use is:
\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \]

Each bottle of sunscreen contains 8 ounces. To find out how many bottles she needs, we divide the total amount of sunscreen by the amount each bottle contains:
\[ \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces/bottle}} = 4 \text{ bottles} \]

So, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen."
"To find the cost of the red car, we first calculate 40% of the blue car's price and subtract it from the blue car's price.

The price of the blue car is $100. 

40% of $100 is calculated as:
\[ 0.40 \times 100 = 40 \]

So, the red car is $40 cheaper than the blue car. Therefore, the price of the red car is:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Now, to find the total cost of both cars, we add the price of the red car to the price of the blue car:
\[ 100 + 60 = 160 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 160 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given:

- Let \( E \) be Emil's current age, which is 19.
- Let \( D \) be his dad's current age.
- Let \( B \) be his brother's current age.

From the problem, we know that when Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad and twice the age of his brother. This gives us the following equations:

1. When Emil is 24, his age will be half his dad's age:
\[ 24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + x) \]
where \( x \) is the number of years from now when Emil turns 24. So,
\[ 24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + x) \]
\[ 48 = D + x \]
\[ x = 48 - D \]

2. When Emil is 24, his age will be twice his brother's age:
\[ 24 = 2 (B + x) \]
\[ 12 = B + x \]
\[ x = 12 - B \]

Since both expressions are equal to \( x \), we can set them equal to each other:
\[ 48 - D = 12 - B \]
\[ B = D - 36 \]

Now, we need to find the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother. Since Emil is currently 19 years old, when he turns 24, \( x \) years will have passed. The current age of Emil's dad can be expressed as:
\[ D = 19 + (48 - D) \]
\[ D = 19 + 48 - D \]
\[ 2D = 67 \]
\[ D = 33.5 \]

The current age of Emil's brother can be expressed as:
\[ B = D - 36 \]
\[ B = 33.5 - 36 \]
\[ B = -2.5 \]

However, since age cannot be negative, we need to re-evaluate the setup. The correct interpretation should be that the brother's age is 24 - B, and the dad's age is 24 - D. So, the correct setup should be:
\[ B = 24 - D \]
\[ D = 24 - B \]

Using the correct setup:
\[ B = 24 - 33.5 \]
\[ B = -9.5 \]

This indicates an error in the setup. Let's re-evaluate with correct setup:
\[ B = 24 - 33.5 \]
\[ B = -9.5 \]

This indicates an error in the setup. Let's re-evaluate with correct setup:
\[ B = 24 - 33.5 \]
\[ B = -9.5 \]

The correct setup should be:
\[ B = 24 - 33.5 \]
\[ B = -9.5 \]

The correct sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is:
\[ D + B = 33.5 + 9.5 = 43 \]

The sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is:
\[ \boxed{43} \]"
"First, let's determine how many beads Adrianne received from her sister. Her sister gave her ten more beads than her mother, so:

\[ \text{Beads from sister} = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Next, let's determine how many beads Adrianne received from her friend. Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, so:

\[ \text{Beads from friend} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Now, we can find the total number of beads Adrianne has by adding the beads from her mother, her sister, and her friend:

\[ \text{Total beads} = 20 + 30 + 40 = 90 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 90 \]"
"First, let's calculate the amount of crawfish Joe caught each day:

- On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
- On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.
- On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, which is \(\frac{12}{2} = 6\) pounds.

Now, let's add up the total amount of crawfish caught over the three days:

- Total crawfish = Thursday's catch + Friday's catch + Saturday's catch
- Total crawfish = 3 pounds + 12 pounds + 6 pounds = 21 pounds

If 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, then the number of servings Joe has is:

- Number of servings = Total crawfish / Crawfish per serving
- Number of servings = 21 pounds / 3 pounds per serving = 7 servings

So, the final numerical answer is 7 servings."
"First, let's find out how many students are football players. Since 20% of the class are football players, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 30 = \frac{20}{100} \times 30 = 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are football players. This means the remaining number of students is:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining 24 students are either cheerleaders or part of the band. Since 25% of the remaining students are cheerleaders or part of the band, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 24 = \frac{25}{100} \times 24 = 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are either cheerleaders or part of the band. Adding the football players to these students, we get the total number of students leaving early:

\[ 6 \text{ (football players)} + 6 \text{ (cheerleaders or band members)} = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students leaving early is:

\[ 12 \]"
"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we first need to determine the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size five boots, Charlie wears size \(5 \times 5 = 25\) boots.

Next, we calculate the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie. The average is found by adding the sizes of their boots and then dividing by 2.

So, the average size is \(\frac{5 + 25}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15\).

The final numerical answer is 15."
"First, let's convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches to match the units of the plant width. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

\[ 111 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 1332 \text{ inches} \]

Each plant is 12 inches wide, and there needs to be 1.5 feet (which is 18 inches) between every plant. Therefore, the total space taken by one plant and the space between it and the next plant is:

\[ 12 \text{ inches} + 18 \text{ inches} = 30 \text{ inches} \]

To find out how many plants can fit in the flower bed, we divide the total length of the flower bed by the space taken by one plant and the space between it and the next plant:

\[ \frac{1332 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/plant}} = 44.4 \text{ plants} \]

Since Pat can't plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number, which means Pat can plant 44 plants.

Pat already owns 17 plants, so the number of additional plants she needs to buy is:

\[ 44 \text{ plants} - 17 \text{ plants} = 27 \text{ plants} \]

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional plants is:

\[ 27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed."
"First, we need to determine how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day. Since Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, we calculate:

\[ \text{Pretzels Edgar's brother eats per day} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

Next, to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we multiply the number of pretzels he eats in a day by the number of days in a week:

\[ \text{Pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week} = 9 \times 7 = 63 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 63."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the cost for one basket and then multiply by the number of baskets.

For one basket:
- Petunias: 3 petunias * $3.00/petunia = $9.00
- Sweet potato vines: 2 vines * $2.50/vine = $5.00

Total cost for one basket: $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00

Now, for 5 baskets:
- Total cost: $14.00/basket * 5 baskets = $70.00

Katherine will spend $70.00 filling all 5 hanging baskets."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, and they are planting 4 sunflowers:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they are planting 10 carnations:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

They have a 30-pound bag of soil. Subtract the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations from the total soil:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. Therefore, the number of roses they can plant with the remaining 3 pounds of soil is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Jessica sets aside each month for fancy shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly paycheck.

\[ \text{Monthly savings for shoes} = 25\% \times \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times \$2,000.00 = \$500.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how much she can save in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year:

\[ \text{Annual savings for shoes} = \$500.00 \times 12 = \$6,000.00 \]

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. To find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year, we divide her annual savings by the cost of one pair of shoes:

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes} = \frac{\$6,000.00}{\$1,000.00} = 6 \]

So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, the time required to peel 90 shrimp is:

\[ \text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to saute 30 shrimp. Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, the time required to saute 90 shrimp is:

\[ \text{Time to saute 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/10 minutes}} = 3 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Since the tasks of peeling and sauteing are independent, the total time required to peel and saute 90 shrimp is the sum of the two times:

\[ \text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 45 minutes."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net temperature change over the given time periods.

1. **Low setting for 3 hours:**
   - Rate: 2 degrees per hour
   - Time: 3 hours
   - Temperature change: \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ degrees}\)

2. **High setting for 4 hours:**
   - Rate: 3 degrees per hour
   - Time: 4 hours
   - Temperature change: \(3 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ degrees}\)

3. **No air conditioner for 2 hours:**
   - Rate: 2 degrees per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Temperature change: \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ degrees}\)

Now, we sum up the temperature changes:
- Total temperature change: \(6 \text{ degrees} + 12 \text{ degrees} - 4 \text{ degrees} = 14 \text{ degrees}\)

The room was 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature after the air conditioner was turned off.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time:**
   - Bill's father saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw it.
   - Therefore, Bill saw the comet for the second time at age \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old.

2. **Determine the time interval between the first and second sightings:**
   - The comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
   - The time interval between the first and second sightings is 75 years.

3. **Determine Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.
   - The time interval between the first and second sightings is 75 years.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to break down the information given and calculate each category of checks separately.

1. **Electric Bill**: Once per month, so 12 checks per year.
2. **Gas Bill**: Once per month, so 12 checks per year.
3. **Church**: Twice per month, so 24 checks per year.
4. **Pest and Lawn Service**: Quarterly, which means 4 times per year, so 4 checks per year.

Now, we sum these up:

\[ 12 \text{ (electric)} + 12 \text{ (gas)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn)} = 52 \text{ checks per year} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 52."
"Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as \( F \). According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4}F \).

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. Therefore, the number of flights to France is \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the remaining flights. The remaining flights are \( F - \frac{3}{4}F = \frac{1}{4}F \). Since these are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{4}F = \frac{1}{8}F \).

The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day is \( 2 \times 44 = 88 \). So, \( F = 88 \).

Now, we can find the number of flights to France by substituting \( F = 88 \) into the expression for the number of flights to France, which is \( \frac{1}{8}F \):
\[ \frac{1}{8} \times 88 = 11. \]

Thus, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is \( 11 \)."
"First, let's determine the duration of each wolf's howl.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so:
\[ \text{Chikote's howl duration} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Igneous howls for as long as Tobias and Chikote combined, so:
\[ \text{Igneous's howl duration} = 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, let's find the combined duration of all three wolves' howls in seconds:
\[ \text{Combined duration} = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 \text{ seconds} \]

To convert the combined duration from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):
\[ \text{Combined duration in minutes} = \frac{120}{60} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much money Adam's father gave him. Since his father gave him twice as much as his mother, and his mother gave him $6, his father gave him \(2 \times 6 = 12\) dollars.

Now, let's add up all the money Adam received:
- Money from his mother: $6
- Money from his father: $12
- Total money received: $6 + $12 = $18

Adam originally needed $30 for the trousers. To find out how much he had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total money he received from the total cost of the trousers:
- Total cost of trousers: $30
- Total money received: $18
- Money Adam had to contribute: $30 - $18 = $12

So, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the age of Wilfred. Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \(A\), \(B\), \(H\), and \(W\) respectively. We know the following:

1. The total age of the children is 20.
2. Akbar is 3 years old, so \(A = 3\).
3. Alessandro is 4 years old, so \(B = 4\).
4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.

First, we can express the total age of the children as:
\[ A + B + H + W = 20 \]

Substituting the known values of \(A\) and \(B\):
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we need to find the average age of the group. The average age is given by:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{A + B + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

According to the problem, Helene's age is twice the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now we substitute \(H = 10\) into the equation \(H + W = 13\):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Therefore, the age of Wilfred is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Walter has collected from his neighbors and the online fund:

- From neighbors: $500
- From online fund: $1500

Total collected so far: $500 + $1500 = $2000

Next, we need to determine how much Walter's lawyer will contribute. The lawyer will donate three times as much as everyone else donates. To find out how much everyone else has donated, we need to add the $200 given by Walter's friend to the total collected so far:

- Total collected so far: $2000
- Amount given by friend: $200

Total amount donated by everyone else: $2000 + $200 = $2200

Now, we calculate the lawyer's contribution, which is three times the amount donated by everyone else:

- Amount donated by everyone else: $2200
- Lawyer's contribution: 3 * $2200 = $6600

So, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6600."
"First, we need to calculate the total number of cookies. Since there were 100 guests and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies/guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies} \]

The bride decided to give half of the cookies to the church next door. Therefore, the number of cookies given to the church next door is:

\[ \frac{1500 \text{ cookies}}{2} = 750 \text{ cookies} \]

Each person in the church next door got 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church next door, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people} \]

So, the number of people in the church next door is:

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the distribution of the watermelon slices among the family members. Let's denote the total volume of the watermelon as 1 (representing 100%).

Given that there are 2 adults and 4 kids, and each adult's slice is twice as big as each kid's slice, we can set up the following equation to represent the total volume of the watermelon:

Let \( x \) be the volume of each kid's slice. Then each adult's slice is \( 2x \).

The total volume of the watermelon can be expressed as the sum of the volumes of all slices:
\[ 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

Since the total volume of the watermelon is 1, we have:
\[ 8x = 1 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{1}{8} \]

Each adult's slice is \( 2x \):
\[ 2x = 2 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \]

Therefore, each adult gets \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the watermelon. To convert this fraction to a percentage:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100\% = 25\% \]

So, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon."
"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones will spend on the clinic rounds. He has 9 inpatients, and each round takes 20 minutes. Therefore, the total time for rounds is:
\[ 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes per inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time he will spend on appointments. He has 10 appointments, and each appointment takes 30 minutes. Therefore, the total time for appointments is:
\[ 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes per appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's add the time spent on rounds and appointments to find the total time spent on these tasks:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 480 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Doctor Jones is spending 9 hours at the clinic, we need to convert this time into minutes to compare:
\[ 9 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 540 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the total time spent on rounds and appointments from the total time spent at the clinic to find out how many minutes Doctor Jones will have left to update his records:
\[ 540 \text{ minutes} - 480 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we convert the remaining minutes back into hours:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as \( x \).

Lisa sold \( 3.5 \) boxes, so she sold \( 3.5x \) chocolate bars.
Peter sold \( 4.5 \) boxes, so he sold \( 4.5x \) chocolate bars.

Together, they sold \( 64 \) chocolate bars, so we can write the equation:
\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 8x = 64 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by \( 8 \):
\[ x = \frac{64}{8} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, there are \( 8 \) chocolate bars in a box.

The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider the fixed costs and the variable costs.

1. **Fixed Cost**: The cost to rent the studio per session is $25.
2. **Variable Cost**: The cost per student per session is $1.50, and there are 10 students. So, the variable cost per session is $1.50 * 10 = $15.
3. **Total Cost per Session**: The total cost per session is the sum of the fixed and variable costs, which is $25 + $15 = $40.
4. **Sessions per Week**: The studio is rented 3 days a week.
5. **Sessions per Month**: Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks, the studio is rented for 3 * 4 = 12 sessions in a month.
6. **Total Earnings per Month**: The total earnings per month is the total cost per session multiplied by the number of sessions per month, which is $40 * 12 = $480.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes.

First, let's find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's boxes. Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars. Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes is:
\[ \text{Chocolate bars per box (Peter)} = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]

Next, let's find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Martha's boxes. Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars. Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes is:
\[ \text{Chocolate bars per box (Martha)} = \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha. This can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Chocolate bars per box (Peter)} - \text{Chocolate bars per box (Martha)} = 16 - 8 = 8 \]

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find the number of female porcupines. Given that the number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the number of babies born each month is:

\[ \text{Number of babies per month} = 30 \times 4 = 120 \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[ \text{Total number of babies in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440 \]

The total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be the original population plus the total number of babies born in a year:

\[ \text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this, we first need to calculate the volume of the swimming pool. The formula for the volume \(V\) of a rectangular prism is given by:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:

\[ V = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

Next, we multiply the volume by 5.9 to find the number of gallons needed:

\[ \text{Gallons needed} = V \times 5.9 \]

Finally, we calculate the cost by multiplying the number of gallons needed by the cost per gallon, which is $0.10 per gallon:

\[ \text{Cost} = \text{Gallons needed} \times 0.10 \]

Let's perform the calculations.
```python
# Given dimensions
length = 25  # in feet
width = 14   # in feet
depth = 4    # in feet

# Calculate volume
volume = length * width * depth

# Calculate gallons needed
gallons_needed = volume * 5.9

# Calculate cost
cost_per_gallon = 0.10
total_cost = gallons_needed * cost_per_gallon

"First, let's determine the number of blue sticks. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, and there are 9 red sticks, we can calculate the number of blue sticks as follows:

Number of blue sticks = Number of red sticks + 5
Number of blue sticks = 9 + 5
Number of blue sticks = 14

Next, we need to find the number of yellow sticks. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks:

Number of yellow sticks = Number of blue sticks - 3
Number of yellow sticks = 14 - 3
Number of yellow sticks = 11

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks:

Total number of sticks = Number of red sticks + Number of blue sticks + Number of yellow sticks
Total number of sticks = 9 + 14 + 11
Total number of sticks = 34

So, the total number of sticks they have is 34."
"First, we calculate the distance Matteo traveled. Distance is calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Matteo:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 55 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance Shandy traveled:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} = 45 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the distance Matteo traveled from the distance Shandy traveled:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."
"To find the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

"First, let's determine how many laps each person can run:

- Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
- Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps.
- Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) laps.
- Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps.

Now, to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run:

- Bethany can run 10 laps, and Quinn can run 5 laps.
- Therefore, Bethany can run \(10 - 5 = 5\) more laps than Quinn.

The final numerical answer is 5."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days and then subtract this from the tank's total capacity.

First, let's calculate the amount of water Wanda pumped on the first day:
- Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity on the first day.
- The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons.
- Therefore, Wanda pumped \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons on the first day.

Next, we calculate the amount of water Ms. B pumped on the first day:
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda.
- Therefore, Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons on the first day.

Now, let's calculate the amount of water Wanda pumped on the second day:
- Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
- Therefore, Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons on the second day.

Next, we calculate the amount of water Ms. B pumped on the second day:
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
- Therefore, Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons on the second day.

Now, we sum up the total amount of water pumped into the tank over the two days:
- Total water pumped by Wanda: \( 4500 + 3000 = 7500 \) gallons.
- Total water pumped by Ms. B: \( 3375 + 1125 = 4500 \) gallons.
- Total water pumped into the tank: \( 7500 + 4500 = 12000 \) gallons.

Finally, we calculate the remaining gallons of water needed to fill the tank:
- The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons.
- Therefore, the remaining gallons are \( 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \) gallons.

The final numerical answer is 6000 gallons."
"Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as \( C \).

First, we know that for the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour. This means that after each hour, the power bank retains 91% of its charge from the previous hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge can be calculated as:
\[ C \times (0.91)^5 \]

Next, for the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour, meaning it retains 93% of its charge from the previous hour. So, after these 3 hours, the charge can be calculated as:
\[ C \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 \]

We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ C \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \times C \]

We can cancel \( C \) from both sides of the equation (assuming \( C \neq 0 \)):
\[ (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \]

Now, we need to calculate the left side of the equation:
\[ (0.91)^5 \approx 0.658 \]
\[ (0.93)^3 \approx 0.817 \]
\[ 0.658 \times 0.817 \approx 0.536 \]

So, we have:
\[ 0.536 = 0.28 \]

This indicates that the initial charge \( C \) must be scaled to match the final charge of 28%. Since the equation holds true with the given percentages, we can conclude that the initial charge \( C \) is correctly scaled to 100% of the final charge of 28%.

Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was:
\[ C = 100\% \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 100 \]"
"First, let's calculate Janet's total hourly earnings. She earns $10 from her job and $15 from tips, so her total hourly earnings are:

\[ 10 + 15 = 25 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we calculate her weekly earnings by multiplying her total hourly earnings by the number of hours she works in a week:

\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ dollars per week} \]

Janet wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10000 car for a downpayment. So, we calculate 20% of $10000:

\[ 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to determine how many weeks it will take for Janet to save $2000. We do this by dividing the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:

\[ \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

So, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment for the car."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased:

- Peaches: 3 peaches * $0.50/peach = $1.50
- Pears: 4 pears * $0.50/pear = $2.00
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00/kiwi = $2.00
- Apples: 5 apples * $0.75/apple = $3.75

Now, let's add up these costs to find out how much money Jamaar has spent so far:

Total spent = $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so the remaining amount of money he has is:

Remaining money = $10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Now, we need to find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75. Since plums cost $0.25 each, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:

Number of plums = $0.75 / $0.25/plum = 3 plums

So, Jamaar can buy 3 plums."
"First, we need to determine the total number of pieces of sweets Anne purchased. Since she bought a box containing 15 packs and each pack has 60 pieces, we calculate the total number of pieces as follows:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs Anne gave to her friends. Since she kept 2 packs, the number of packs given to her friends is:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} - 2 \text{ packs} = 13 \text{ packs} \]

These 13 packs are to be given equally to her 10 friends. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide the number of packs given to friends by the number of friends:

\[ \frac{13 \text{ packs}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 1.3 \text{ packs/friend} \]

Since each pack contains 60 pieces, we calculate the number of pieces each friend received:

\[ 1.3 \text{ packs/friend} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 78 \text{ pieces/friend} \]

Thus, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 78 \]"
"To calculate the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating compounded price increases:

\[ \text{Future Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (1 + \text{Rate})^{\text{Time}} \]

Given:
- Initial Price = $120
- Rate = 5% = 0.05
- Time = 3 years

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Future Price} = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ \text{Future Price} = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]
\[ \text{Future Price} = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ \text{Future Price} = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ \text{Future Price} = 139 \]

So, the price of carrots after three years would be $139."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many selfies and portraits Olivia uploaded to her albums. We know that she uploaded a total of 72 pictures into 8 albums, with 3 albums dedicated to selfies and 2 albums to portraits. Let's denote the number of selfies as \( S \) and the number of portraits as \( P \).

Since the total number of pictures is 72 and the total number of albums is 8, we can set up the following equation:

\[ S + P = 72 \]

We also know that the number of selfies and portraits are distributed among the albums. Since 3 albums are for selfies and 2 albums are for portraits, the remaining albums (8 - 3 - 2 = 3) must contain other types of pictures. However, the problem does not specify the distribution of the remaining pictures, so we can assume that the remaining 3 albums are for other types of pictures or are not specified in the problem.

Given that the problem only asks for the number of selfies and portraits, we can use the total number of albums to find the number of selfies and portraits. Since the problem does not provide additional information about the distribution of the remaining albums, we can assume that the remaining albums are not relevant to the specific question of selfies and portraits.

Thus, we can solve for \( S \) and \( P \) by recognizing that the total number of selfies and portraits is 72, and the number of selfies and portraits are the only pictures in the albums dedicated to them. Therefore, the number of selfies and portraits is simply the total number of pictures in the albums dedicated to them.

Since 3 albums are for selfies and 2 albums are for portraits, the number of selfies \( S \) and portraits \( P \) can be calculated as follows:

\[ S = 3x \]
\[ P = 2x \]

Where \( x \) is the number of pictures per album. Since the total number of pictures is 72, we can write:

\[ 3x + 2x = 72 \]
\[ 5x = 72 \]
\[ x = \frac{72}{5} = 14.4 \]

However, since the number of pictures per album must be a whole number, we need to re-evaluate the problem. Given the problem constraints and the need for whole numbers, we can assume the problem is designed such that the number of pictures per album is a whole number. Therefore, we can directly use the total number of pictures in the albums dedicated to selfies and portraits.

Thus, the number of selfies is 3 albums * \( x \) pictures per album and the number of portraits is 2 albums * \( x \) pictures per album. Since the total number of pictures is 72, we can directly state:

\[ S = 3x \]
\[ P = 2x \]

Given the total number of pictures is 72, we can solve for \( x \):

\[ 3x + 2x = 72 \]
\[ 5x = 72 \]
\[ x = 14.4 \]

Since \( x \) must be a whole number, we can assume the problem is designed such that the number of pictures per album is a whole number. Therefore, we can directly state the number of selfies and portraits as:

\[ S = 3 \times 12 = 36 \]
\[ P = 2 \times 12 = 24 \]

Thus, the number of selfies and portraits is:

\[ S + P = 36 + 24 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of selfies and portraits is:

\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"To determine how long James spends reading, we first need to find out how many minutes it takes him to read one page. Since it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can calculate the time per page as follows:

\[ \text{Time per page} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages. We can do this by multiplying the time per page by 18:

\[ \text{Time to read 18 pages} = 18 \text{ pages} \times \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} \]

Let's calculate this step by step.
```python
# Calculation
time_per_page = 10 / 3  # time to read one page in minutes
pages_read = 18  # number of pages read

# Total time spent reading
total_time_spent_reading = time_per_page * pages_read

"Initially, the hotel had 100 guests. 

24 guests checked out early, so the number of guests decreased by 24:
\[ 100 - 24 = 76 \]

15 guests checked out late, so the number of guests decreased by 15:
\[ 76 - 15 = 61 \]

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, twice that number is:
\[ 2 \times 15 = 30 \]

So, 30 new guests checked in:
\[ 61 + 30 = 91 \]

After dinner, 7 more people checked in:
\[ 91 + 7 = 98 \]

Therefore, the hotel now has 98 guests."

"First, let's determine the number of easy, average, and difficult questions in the quiz.

- Total questions: 60
- Easy questions: 40% of 60 = 0.40 * 60 = 24 questions
- Average and difficult questions combined: 60 - 24 = 36 questions
- Since the average and difficult questions are equally divided, each category has: 36 / 2 = 18 questions

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct. Therefore, the number of easy questions she is sure to get is:
- Easy questions she is sure to get: 75% of 24 = 0.75 * 24 = 18 questions

She is sure to get half of the average and difficult questions correct. Therefore, the number of average and difficult questions she is sure to get is:
- Average and difficult questions she is sure to get: 50% of 18 = 0.50 * 18 = 9 questions

Adding these up, the total number of questions Aries is sure to get correct is:
- Total sure questions: 18 (easy) + 9 (average and difficult) = 27 questions

"First, let's determine the price of a large stuffed animal. Since each small stuffed animal costs $4 and large stuffed animals cost three times as much, the price of a large stuffed animal is:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( L \). According to the problem, the number of small stuffed animals sold is twice the number of large stuffed animals sold, so the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2L \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as the sum of the earnings from the large stuffed animals and the small stuffed animals. The earnings from the large stuffed animals are \( 12L \) dollars, and the earnings from the small stuffed animals are \( 4 \times 2L = 8L \) dollars. The total earnings are given as $120, so we can set up the following equation:
\[ 12L + 8L = 120 \]
\[ 20L = 120 \]
\[ L = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ L = 6 \]

Since the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2L \), we have:
\[ 2L = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is:

"To solve this, we need to find the unit price for each package and then use that to determine the price for the package with 8 sandwiches.

First, let's find the unit price for the first package:
- The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3.
- The unit price for the first package is $3 / 2 sandwiches = $1.50 per sandwich.

Next, let's find the unit price for the second package:
- The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6.
- The unit price for the second package is $6 / 4 sandwiches = $1.50 per sandwich.

Since the prices are proportional, the unit price for the third package (8 sandwiches) should also be $1.50 per sandwich.

Now, let's calculate the cost for the third package:
- The third package has 8 sandwiches.
- The cost for the third package is 8 sandwiches * $1.50 per sandwich = $12.

Therefore, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12.

"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of the different scenarios and their outcomes.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of the substitute teacher collecting the homework: 50% or 0.50
   - Therefore, the probability of the substitute teacher collecting the homework: \(0.50 \times 0.50 = 0.25\) or 25%

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having the normal teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension: 40% or 0.40
   - Therefore, the probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension: \(0.50 \times (1 - 0.40) = 0.50 \times 0.60 = 0.30\) or 30%

3. **Extension Requests:**
   - If the normal teacher does not give an extension, there's a 20% or 0.20 chance Marcus can convince the teacher to accept his assignment.
   - Therefore, the probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension and Marcus not getting an extension: \(0.30 \times (1 - 0.20) = 0.30 \times 0.80 = 0.24\) or 24%

4. **Total Probability of Not Having to Turn in Homework:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher and the homework being collected: 25%
   - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension and Marcus not getting an extension: 24%
   - Total probability of not having to turn in homework: \(0.25 + 0.24 = 0.49\) or 49%

5. **Probability of Having to Turn in Homework:**
   - The probability of having to turn in homework is the complement of the probability of not having to turn in homework: \(1 - 0.49 = 0.51\) or 51%

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 51%."
"First, we need to determine the total number of seats that are not occupied for the graduates and faculty. This is calculated by subtracting the number of seats reserved for graduates and faculty from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center.

Total capacity = 6000 seats
Seats for graduates = 950 seats
Seats for faculty = 300 seats

Occupied seats = Seats for graduates + Seats for faculty
Occupied seats = 950 + 300 = 1250 seats

Now, we subtract the occupied seats from the total capacity to find the number of seats available for distribution to friends and family.

Available seats = Total capacity - Occupied seats
Available seats = 6000 - 1250 = 4750 seats

To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to divide the available seats by the number of graduates.

Number of graduates = 950

Tickets per graduate = Available seats / Number of graduates
Tickets per graduate = 4750 / 950 = 5

Therefore, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

The final numerical answer is: 5"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat based on the information given about the sizes and quantities of the other types of jelly beans.

1. **Large Jelly Beans:**
   - It takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up.

2. **Medium Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans.
   - Therefore, the number of medium-sized beans he can eat is \( 2 \times 75 = 150 \).

3. **Small Jelly Beans:**
   - Eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean.
   - To find out how many small beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans, we multiply the number of medium-sized beans by 3:
     \[
     150 \times 3 = 450
     \]

Thus, Grandpa can eat 450 small jelly beans.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
450

"First, let's calculate the total number of hours Melissa spends on jury duty:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's calculate her total earnings from the jury duty:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate her total expenses for parking:
\[ 3 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the total expenses from the total earnings to find the net earnings:
\[ 45 \text{ dollars} - 9 \text{ dollars} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find out how much she makes per hour after expenses, we divide her net earnings by the total number of hours:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{18 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

\[ 3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the books and the cost of the pencils to find the total amount Ted spent:
\[ 48 + 18 = 66 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Ted spent is:
\[ 66 \text{ dollars} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of soda bottles Richard will place along his driveway and then calculate the total time it will take him to place the candy in each bottle.

1. **Calculate the number of soda bottles:**
   - The driveway is 24 feet wide.
   - Richard places a bottle every 3 feet.
   - Number of bottles = Total width / Distance between bottles = 24 / 3 = 8 bottles.

2. **Calculate the total time:**
   - It takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next and place the candy.
   - Since he needs to go between each of the 8 bottles, he will need to go 7 intervals (from the first to the second, second to the third, and so on, until the seventh to the eighth).
   - Total time = Number of intervals * Time per interval = 7 * 5 = 35 seconds.

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is 35 seconds."

"First, let's calculate the cost of the Parmesan cheese:
- The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound.
- Moises buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese.
- Therefore, the cost for Parmesan cheese is \( 11 \times 2 = 22 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mozzarella cheese:
- The price of mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound.
- Moises buys 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese.
- Therefore, the cost for mozzarella cheese is \( 6 \times 3 = 18 \) dollars.

Now, let's find the total cost of the cheese:
- The total cost is the sum of the cost of Parmesan cheese and the cost of mozzarella cheese.
- Total cost = \( 22 + 18 = 40 \) dollars.

Finally, let's determine how much money Moises will have left after the purchase:

"First, let's calculate the total amount Jim borrowed during his college years. He borrowed $50,000 per year for 4 years, so the total amount borrowed is:

\[ 50,000 \times 4 = 200,000 \]

Next, let's determine his income after college. His income tripled, so his new income is:

\[ 25,000 \times 3 = 75,000 \]

Now, let's calculate the total income Jim would have earned if he had not gone to college. He would have earned $25,000 per year for 4 years:

\[ 25,000 \times 4 = 100,000 \]

The total income he would have earned if he had not gone to college is $100,000. The total income he earned during his college years is the sum of his income before college and the income he earned during college:

\[ 25,000 + 200,000 = 225,000 \]

The money lost from not working while in school is the difference between the income he would have earned if he had not gone to college and the income he earned during his college years:

\[ 225,000 - 100,000 = 125,000 \]

Now, we need to determine how long it would take for Jim to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school. The total amount he needs to earn is the sum of the amount he borrowed and the money lost from not working while in school:

\[ 200,000 + 125,000 = 325,000 \]

If Jim earns $75,000 per year after college, the number of years it would take him to earn $325,000 is:

\[ \frac{325,000}{75,000} = \frac{325}{75} = \frac{65}{15} = \frac{13}{3} \approx 4.33 \]

Therefore, it would take Jim approximately 4.33 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4.33 \]"
"To determine the total square feet of fabric Jim needs, we first calculate the dimensions of each piece of fabric he requires. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each piece of fabric is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

First, calculate the dimensions of one piece of fabric:
- Length: \( 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \)
- Width: \( 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \)

Next, calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
\[ \text{Area of one piece} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[ \text{Total area} = 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Thus, Jim needs to buy \(\boxed{160}\) square feet of fabric."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered on each day and then sum them up.

First, let's determine the number of letters delivered on Tuesday. According to the problem, Tuesday's delivery was 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery.

Monday's delivery = 425 letters

One-fifth of Monday's delivery = \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \) letters

So, Tuesday's delivery = \( 85 + 17 = 102 \) letters

Next, we calculate the number of letters delivered on Wednesday. The problem states that Wednesday's delivery was 5 more than twice Tuesday's delivery.

Twice Tuesday's delivery = \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \) letters

So, Wednesday's delivery = \( 204 + 5 = 209 \) letters

Now, we sum up the deliveries from Monday to Wednesday:

Total letters delivered = Monday's delivery + Tuesday's delivery + Wednesday's delivery
Total letters delivered = 425 + 102 + 209

Let's calculate the total:
Total letters delivered = 425 + 102 + 209 = 736

Therefore, the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is 736."

"To find out how much Johnny's dad lost on average that day, we need to calculate the total amount lost and then divide it by the number of races.

1. **First Race:**
   - Johnny's dad lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost.
   - Amount lost in the first race = $5.
   - Twice the amount lost = 2 * $5 = $10.
   - Amount won in the second race = $10 + $1 = $11.
   - Since he won, this is a positive amount, but for the purpose of calculating loss, we consider it as a negative amount.
   - Amount lost in the second race = -$11.

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Amount won in the second race = $11.
   - 1.5 times the amount won = 1.5 * $11 = $16.5.
   - Amount lost in the third race = $16.5.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost:
- Total amount lost = Amount lost in the first race + Amount lost in the second race + Amount lost in the third race.
- Total amount lost = $5 + (-$11) + $16.5 = $5 - $11 + $16.5 = $10.5.

Finally, to find the average amount lost per race:
- Average amount lost per race = Total amount lost / Number of races.
- Number of races = 3.
- Average amount lost per race = $10.5 / 3 = $3.5.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( 420 \).

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps:

1. **Determine the total number of days the painters worked:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - The painters worked for 3 weeks.
   - Therefore, the total number of days worked is \( 7 \times 3 = 21 \) days.

2. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by the team:**
   - Each day, the team worked \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day.
   - Therefore, the total number of hours worked by the team is \( 21 \times \frac{3}{8} \).

3. **Perform the multiplication:**
   \[
   21 \times \frac{3}{8} = \frac{21 \times 3}{8} = \frac{63}{8} = 7.875 \text{ hours}

Thus, each painter put in approximately 1.96875 hours of work."
"Let's denote the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, Rory retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x + 4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now that we have \( x = 6 \), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

So, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

\[ \text{Emails not requiring response per day} = 80 \times \frac{20}{100} = 80 \times 0.2 = 16 \]

Next, we calculate the number of emails James does respond to in a day:

\[ \text{Emails requiring response per day} = 80 - 16 = 64 \]

Now, to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of emails he responds to in a day by 5:

\[ \text{Emails requiring response in a 5-day work week} = 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 320."
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to calculate the number of classes for each day and then sum them up.

- Monday: 32 classes
- Tuesday: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 32 = 64\) classes
- Wednesday: Three times as many as Monday, so \(3 \times 32 = 96\) classes
- Thursday: 30 classes
- Friday: 25 classes

Now, we sum these numbers:

\[ 32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 \]

Let's add them step by step:

\[ 32 + 64 = 96 \]
\[ 96 + 96 = 192 \]
\[ 192 + 30 = 222 \]
\[ 222 + 25 = 247 \]

So, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is 247."
"To find John's average score across the 4 tests, we first need to add up all his scores and then divide by the number of tests.

John's scores are: 100, 100, 100, and 80.

Sum of the scores = 100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380

Number of tests = 4

Average score = Sum of the scores / Number of tests = 380 / 4 = 95

The final numerical answer is 95."
"First, let's calculate how many pizzas the glee club ate. They ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them:

\[ \text{Pizzas eaten by glee club} = 20 \times \frac{70}{100} = 14 \]

So, the glee club has:

\[ \text{Pizzas left by glee club} = 20 - 14 = 6 \]

Next, let's calculate how many pizzas the football team ordered. They ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club:

\[ \text{Pizzas ordered by football team} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

The football team ate 80% of their pizzas:

\[ \text{Pizzas eaten by football team} = 40 \times \frac{80}{100} = 32 \]

So, the football team has:

\[ \text{Pizzas left by football team} = 40 - 32 = 8 \]

Now, let's add the pizzas left by both groups:

\[ \text{Total pizzas left} = 6 + 8 = 14 \]

The final numerical answer is 14."
"First, let's determine the number of big coupons Anthony wants to send out. Since he wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, and he plans to send out 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is:

\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost for the small coupons is:

\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for the big coupons is:

\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of mailing all the coupons, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the cost of mailing the big coupons:

\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:

\[ 24500 \text{ cents} = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:

\[ \boxed{245} \]"
"First, let's determine how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney ordered. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which means she ordered:
\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ meatball sub sandwiches} \]

Next, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. So, the number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney had left after Mark ate some is:
\[ 7 - 4 = 3 \text{ meatball sub sandwiches} \]

Then, Sidney ordered another three meatball sub sandwiches. The total number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney had after ordering the additional ones is:
\[ 3 + 3 = 6 \text{ meatball sub sandwiches} \]

Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. Therefore, the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is:
\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 24 \]"
"Initially, Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks, each carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. Therefore, the total amount of fertiliser dispatched was:

\[ 20 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 400 \text{ tons} \]

Two hours after departure, a quarter of the trucks experienced mechanical failures. The number of trucks that failed is:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks} \]

This means that the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks} \]

The total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:

\[ 15 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 300 \text{ tons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 300 \]"
"To determine the cost for Dennis to purchase the butter, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of butter needed.
2. Determine the cost based on the promotion.

First, Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. He needs to make 6 dozen croissants, so he needs:
\[ 6 \text{ dozen croissants} \times 1 \text{ pound of butter per dozen} = 6 \text{ pounds of butter} \]

Next, we need to consider the promotion: ""buy one pound of butter get one half off."" This means for every two pounds of butter, Dennis only pays for one pound.

Since Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter, we can break it down as follows:
- For the first pound, he pays the full price.
- For the second pound, he pays half the price.
- For the third pound, he pays the full price.
- For the fourth pound, he pays half the price.
- For the fifth pound, he pays the full price.
- For the sixth pound, he pays half the price.

So, the total cost is:
\[ 1 \text{ pound} \times \$4.00 + 0.5 \text{ pound} \times \$4.00 + 1 \text{ pound} \times \$4.00 + 0.5 \text{ pound} \times \$4.00 + 1 \text{ pound} \times \$4.00 + 0.5 \text{ pound} \times \$4.00 \]
\[ = \$4.00 + \$2.00 + \$4.00 + \$2.00 + \$4.00 + \$2.00 \]
\[ = \$20.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter is:
\[ \$20.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of guests:

Kayla invited:
- 25 classmates
- 7 girls in her dance class
- 13 family members

Total guests invited = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 guests

4 people could not come, so the number of guests who will attend is:
45 - 4 = 41 guests

The base fee for renting the theater is $125 for a party of 20 guests. Since 41 guests are attending, we need to calculate the additional cost for the extra guests.

The additional cost is $6 per guest beyond the initial 20 guests:
(41 - 20) * $6 = 21 * $6 = $126

Now, we add the base fee to the additional cost:
$125 + $126 = $251

The final cost of the party is $251."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she spent \(\frac{1}{4}\) of $60. Therefore, the amount Maggie spent is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \]

So, the amount of money Maggie has left is:
\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \]

Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she spent \(\frac{1}{3}\) of $60. Therefore, the amount Riza spent is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \]

So, the amount of money Riza has left is:
\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \]

Now, to find out how much money Maggie and Riza have left together, we add the amounts they each have left:
\[ 45 + 40 = 85 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 85 \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats:
\[ 10 + 4 = 14 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of bananas eaten by both monkeys in one day:
\[ 10 + 14 = 24 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Mr. Robles has 315 bananas in total, which is enough to feed the monkeys for a week. Therefore, the total number of bananas eaten by the three monkeys in one day is:
\[ \frac{315}{7} = 45 \text{ bananas each day} \]

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we subtract the number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in one day:
\[ 45 - 24 = 21 \text{ bananas each day} \]

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 21 \]"
"Teddy finished half of the first 500-piece puzzle, which means he placed 500 / 2 = 250 pieces. He also finished the second 500-piece puzzle, which means he placed another 500 pieces. Therefore, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is 250 + 500 = 750 pieces."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the roses Jenny bought. She bought 15 roses, and since roses cost $2 each, the total cost for the roses is:

\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2/\text{rose} = \$30 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of the dozen roses. Since a dozen roses cost $15, and she bought 15 roses, she bought 1.25 dozen roses (since 15 roses is 1.25 times a dozen). However, since the florist only sells roses by the dozen, we need to consider the cost of 1.25 dozen roses. The cost for 1.25 dozen roses is:

\[ 1.25 \times \$15 = \$18.75 \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the dozen roses from the total cost of the roses to find out how much more she needs to pay:

\[ \$30 - \$18.75 = \$11.25 \]

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which is:

\[ 5 \times \$5 = \$25 \]

Since she only needs to pay $11.25, the change she should receive is:

\[ \$25 - \$11.25 = \$13.75 \]

The florist only gives change in quarters. To find out how many quarters she receives, we need to convert $13.75 into quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the number of quarters is:

\[ \frac{13.75}{0.25} = 55 \]

So, Jenny leaves with 55 quarters. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 55 \]"
"To calculate the total money Terry makes, we need to calculate the earnings from each item separately and then sum them up.

For the milkshakes:
\[ 6 \text{ milkshakes} \times \$5.50 \text{ per milkshake} = \$33.00 \]

For the burger platters:
\[ 9 \text{ burger platters} \times \$11 \text{ per burger platter} = \$99.00 \]

For the sodas:
\[ 20 \text{ sodas} \times \$1.50 \text{ per soda} = \$30.00 \]

Now, we sum up the earnings from all items:
\[ \$33.00 + \$99.00 + \$30.00 = \$162.00 \]

So, the total money Terry makes is:
\[ \$162.00 \]"
"To calculate the total time Paul will wait for his train, we need to determine the arrival and departure times of each train and then find the duration of Paul's wait.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays in the station for 20 minutes.
   - Departure time: 10 minutes + 20 minutes = 30 minutes.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves (30 minutes + 30 minutes = 60 minutes).
   - Stays in the station for a quarter of the first train's stay time (20 minutes / 4 = 5 minutes).
   - Departure time: 60 minutes + 5 minutes = 65 minutes.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives 60 minutes after the second train leaves (65 minutes + 60 minutes = 125 minutes).
   - Leaves the station immediately after it arrives (125 minutes).

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves (125 minutes + 20 minutes = 145 minutes).
   - This is the train Paul needs to board.

Now, we calculate the time Paul waits:
- Paul arrives at the station at 145 minutes.
- The fourth train arrives at 145 minutes and leaves at 145 minutes (since it stays for 0 minutes).

Since the fourth train arrives and leaves at the same time, Paul does not wait for it. Therefore, the total time Paul waits is 0 minutes.

**Final numerical answer:**
0"
"First, let's calculate how many toothpicks Melanie has already saved. She saves 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks:

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie needs a total of 200 toothpicks. She has already saved 120 toothpicks, so the number of toothpicks she still needs is:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks, we divide the number of toothpicks she still needs by the number of toothpicks she saves each week:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks."
"First, let's calculate the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch. The watch was sold at 75% of its original price, so:

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers paid} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for:

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers sold it for} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage discount Mr. Rogers's friend obtained from the original price. The original price was $2000, and the friend paid $1800 for it. The discount amount is:

\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

The percentage discount is calculated as:

\[ \text{Percentage Discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers's friend from the original price is 10%."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller, manageable steps.

1. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation per second for one spring:**
   - One spring creates one jellyfish per second.

2. **Calculate the rate of jellyfish creation per second for five springs:**
   - Since each spring creates one jellyfish per second, five springs would create \(5 \times 1 = 5\) jellyfish per second.

3. **Convert 4 hours into seconds:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute, so there are \(60 \times 60 = 3600\) seconds in an hour.
   - Therefore, in 4 hours, there are \(4 \times 3600 = 14400\) seconds.

4. **Calculate the total number of jellyfish created in 4 hours by five springs:**
   - If five springs create 5 jellyfish per second, in 14400 seconds, they would create \(5 \times 14400 = 72000\) jellyfish.

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish created by five springs in 4 hours is 72000."
"To find Frankie's score, we can use the information given in the question. According to the problem, Frankie's score is 15 more than twice Binkie's score. Binkie's score is given as 90.

First, we calculate twice Binkie's score:
\[ 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Next, we add 15 to this result to find Frankie's score:
\[ 180 + 15 = 195 \]

So, Frankie's score is 195.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the total distance James walked. He walked halfway to the store, which is 2 miles, and then walked back home, which is another 2 miles. So, the total distance he walked is 2 miles + 2 miles = 4 miles.

James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour. To find out how long it took him to walk 4 miles, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, it took James 1 hour to reach the store."
"First, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually.

Jenny buys 10 bunches, and each bunch has an average of 4 bananas. Therefore, the total number of bananas is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Since each banana costs $0.80, the total cost for 40 bananas would be:
\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches.

Jenny buys 10 bunches, and each bunch costs $3.00, so the total cost for 10 bunches is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

Now, we can find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually:
\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

So, Jenny saved $2.00."
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) and the amount Harry gets as \( H \). According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. The total amount of fence they have is 100 feet.
2. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam.

We can express these as the following equations:
\[ S + H = 100 \]
\[ H = S + 60 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]
\[ 2S = 40 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the growth rate of the crocodile per year. The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, so the growth rate is:

\[ \text{Growth rate} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \]

Now, to find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we multiply the growth rate by the number of years:

\[ \text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 26 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the earnings from each type of bike sold and then sum them up.

First, let's determine the number of each type of bike sold:
- Total bikes sold = 300
- Number of Trekking bikes sold = 50% of 300 = 0.5 * 300 = 150
- Number of BMX bikes sold = 15% of 300 = 0.15 * 300 = 45
- Number of MTB bikes sold = Total bikes sold - Trekking bikes sold - BMX bikes sold = 300 - 150 - 45 = 65

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike:
- Earnings from Trekking bikes = Number of Trekking bikes sold * Price of a Trekking bike = 150 * $450 = $67,500
- Earnings from BMX bikes = Number of BMX bikes sold * Price of a BMX bike = 45 * ($500 / 2) = 45 * $250 = $11,250
- Earnings from MTB bikes = Number of MTB bikes sold * Price of an MTB bike = 65 * $500 = $32,500

Finally, we sum up the earnings from all types of bikes to get the total earnings:
- Total earnings = Earnings from Trekking bikes + Earnings from BMX bikes + Earnings from MTB bikes = $67,500 + $11,250 + $32,500 = $111,250

The final numerical answer is $111,250."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net number of bales of hay that are being added to and removed from the field each hour, and then multiply by the number of hours they work.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, and the truck picks up 3 bales per hour. So, the net number of bales added to the field each hour is:
\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \text{ bales per hour} \]

Since they work for 6 hours, the total number of bales added to the field is:
\[ 2 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ bales} \]

Therefore, the number of bales of hay left in the field after 6 hours is:
\[ 12 \text{ bales} \]

"To solve this, let's break down the time John spends on classes and learning each week.

1. **Number of classes John takes each day:**
   - Normal number of classes: 6
   - Extra classes: 2
   - Total classes per day: 6 + 2 = 8 classes

2. **Time spent on classes each day:**
   - Each class is 40 minutes long
   - Time spent on classes each day: 8 classes * 40 minutes/class = 320 minutes

3. **Time spent on classes each week:**
   - John goes to class 5 days a week
   - Time spent on classes each week: 320 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 1600 minutes

4. **Time spent on learning on weekends:**
   - He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on weekends
   - Total weekly minutes: 1600 minutes
   - Time spent on weekends: 1600 minutes * 1/16 = 100 minutes

5. **Total time spent learning each week:**
   - Time spent on classes: 1600 minutes
   - Time spent on weekends: 100 minutes
   - Total time spent learning: 1600 minutes + 100 minutes = 1700 minutes

6. **Convert total time spent learning to hours:**
   - 1 minute = 1/60 hours

"First, we need to determine the initial height from which the ball is dropped. Since the ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony and each story is 24 feet high, the height from which the ball is dropped is:

\[ 3 \text{ stories} \times 24 \text{ feet/story} = 72 \text{ feet} \]

Given that the ball bounces to 2/3 of its starting height with each bounce, the height after the first bounce is:

\[ 72 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height the ball goes on its second bounce is:

\[ 48 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's convert the height of the first child from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child who is 6 feet tall is:

\[ 6 \times 12 = 72 \text{ inches} \]

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so:

\[ 72 + 2 = 74 \text{ inches} \]

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so:

\[ 74 - 5 = 69 \text{ inches} \]

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so:

\[ 69 + 3 = 72 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the fourth child is 72 inches tall."
"To determine the earnings, we first need to find out how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we divide the total number of apples sold by the number of apples per bag:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total number of apples}}{\text{Number of apples per bag}} = \frac{2000}{10} = 200 \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags by the price per bag:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of bags} \times \text{Price per bag} = 200 \times 5 = 1000 \]

So, the orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the meat, so the remaining meat was \( \frac{x}{2} \).
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so the remaining meat was \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \).
3. The Allosaurus then ate the remaining 270 kilograms, which means \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \).

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]
\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

So, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 kilograms.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1080 \]"
"First, let's calculate the area of each type of wall:

- North and South walls: Each is 10 feet by 8 feet, so the area of one wall is \(10 \times 8 = 80\) square feet. Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is \(80 \times 2 = 160\) square feet.
- East and West walls: Each is 5 feet by 8 feet, so the area of one wall is \(5 \times 8 = 40\) square feet. Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is \(40 \times 2 = 80\) square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all the walls to find the total area to be painted:
\[160 + 80 = 240\] square feet.

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[\frac{240}{20} = 12\] gallons.

Finally, we calculate the total cost of the paint. Since each gallon costs $12, the total cost is:
\[12 \times 12 = 144\] dollars.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda after the sequence of events.

Initially, there are 12 sodas:
- 3 are shaken.
- 9 are unshaken.

Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving:
- 2 shaken sodas.
- 8 unshaken sodas.

Then, Ellen's brother takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving:
- 1 shaken soda.
- 6 unshaken sodas.

Now, Ellen's friend comes along. There are 2 sodas left:
- 1 shaken soda.
- 1 unshaken soda.

The probability that Ellen's friend gets the shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas left divided by the total number of sodas left. 

So, the probability is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours and then sum these distances since the trains are traveling in opposite directions.

The speed of the first train is 60 miles per hour. Therefore, the distance it travels in 3 hours is:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

The speed of the second train is half the speed of the first train, which is:
\[ \text{Speed}_2 = \frac{60 \, \text{miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \]
Therefore, the distance it travels in 3 hours is:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{miles} \]

The total distance between the two trains after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each train has traveled:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 180 \, \text{miles} + 90 \, \text{miles} = 270 \, \text{miles} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 270 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.
2. Determine the number of days Billy works.
3. Calculate the total number of hours Billy works.
4. Determine the total number of people he helps.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.**

- March has 31 days.
- April 19th is included in the count.

Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days

**Step 2: Determine the number of days Billy works.**

Billy takes 20% off, so he works 80% of the days.

Days Billy works = 50 days * 80% = 50 * 0.8 = 40 days

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of hours Billy works.**

Billy works 3 hours a day for 40 days.

Total hours = 40 days * 3 hours/day = 120 hours

**Step 4: Determine the total number of people he helps.**

Billy can help 2 people per hour.

Total people helped = 120 hours * 2 people/hour = 240 people

The final numerical answer is 240."
"First, we need to calculate the number of people in the buses. Each bus carried 35 people, and there were 12 buses, so the total number of people in the buses is:
\[ 35 \times 12 = 420 \]

Next, we calculate the number of people in the cars. Each car carried 3 people, and there were 20 cars, so the total number of people in the cars is:
\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

To find the total number of people inside the church, we add the number of people in the buses and the number of people in the cars:
\[ 420 + 60 = 480 \]

So, the total number of people inside the church is:
\[ 480 \]"
"First, let's determine Martha's age. Since Mike is 24 years old and Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, we can calculate Martha's age as follows:

\[ \text{Martha's age} = \text{Mike's age} - 4 = 24 - 4 = 20 \]

Next, we know that Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. Therefore, we can calculate Jeff's age as follows:

\[ \text{Jeff's age} = \text{Martha's age} + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 30."
"To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes for each slide and then find the difference.

For the biggest slide:
- Length: 300 feet
- Speed: 60 feet/minute

Time to slide down the biggest slide = Length / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
- Length: 240 feet
- Speed: 80 feet/minute

Time to slide down the second biggest slide = Length / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

Now, we find the difference in time:
Time difference = Time for biggest slide - Time for second biggest slide = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

The final numerical answer is 2 minutes."
"To calculate the total time Bobby spends on his lunches and breaks over 5 days, we first need to determine the daily total and then multiply by the number of days.

Bobby's daily break time is 30 minutes (lunch) + 2 * 15 minutes (breaks) = 30 + 30 = 60 minutes.

Over 5 days, the total time spent on breaks and lunch is 60 minutes/day * 5 days = 300 minutes.

To convert this total time into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

300 minutes / 60 = 5 hours.

So, the final numerical answer is 5 hours."
"First, let's calculate how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's miles as follows:

\[ \text{Micah's miles} = 3.5 \times 8 \]

Now, let's calculate that:

\[ \text{Micah's miles} = 28 \]

Next, we know the total miles run by all three is 52 miles. We can find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total miles:

\[ \text{Ahito's miles} = 52 - (\text{Amber's miles} + \text{Micah's miles}) \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ \text{Ahito's miles} = 52 - (8 + 28) \]

Now, let's calculate Ahito's miles:

\[ \text{Ahito's miles} = 52 - 36 = 16 \]

So, Ahito ran 16 miles."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the items after the return and the discounts.

1. Sheila returned an item that cost $15.00, so the charge on her credit card is reduced by $15.00.
2. The frying pan was on sale for 20% off $20.00. The discount amount is 20% of $20.00, which is \(0.20 \times 20 = 4.00\). So, the frying pan cost Sheila $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.
3. The set of towels was 10% off $30.00. The discount amount is 10% of $30.00, which is \(0.10 \times 30 = 3.00\). So, the set of towels cost Sheila $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

Now, let's calculate the new balance on her credit card:

1. Initial charge: $85.00
2. After returning the item: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00
3. Adding the frying pan: $70.00 + $16.00 = $86.00
4. Adding the set of towels: $86.00 + $27.00 = $113.00

The new balance on her credit card is $113.00."
"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

Given:
- A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{1}{5}J \).
- A third of the large jellyfish change color under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{5}J = \frac{1}{15}J \).
- When the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color.

We know that the number of jellyfish that change color is 6, which is equal to \( \frac{1}{15}J \).

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{15}J = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 15:
\[ J = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ J = 90 \]

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

Final numerical answer:

Next, we need to find Caroline's age. Caroline is three times older than Ben, so we can calculate Caroline's age as follows:

\[ \text{Caroline's age} = 3 \times \text{Ben's age} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Therefore, Caroline is 24 years old."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Lauren will save each year, how much she will need for retirement, and then calculate how many more years she needs to work based on her current salary and savings rate.

1. **Calculate Lauren's annual savings:**
   - Lauren saves 20% of her annual salary.
   - Her current salary is $100,000.
   - Annual savings = 20% of $100,000 = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000.

2. **Determine the total amount needed for retirement:**
   - Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary in retirement.
   - Her current annual salary is $100,000.
   - Annual retirement income = 40% of $100,000 = 0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000.
   - Since she plans to save for 20 years, the total amount needed for retirement is $40,000 * 20 = $800,000.

3. **Calculate the number of years Lauren needs to work to save $800,000:**
   - Lauren saves $20,000 per year.
   - Total amount needed for retirement is $800,000.
   - Number of years needed to save $800,000 = $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.

Since Lauren plans to save for 20 years, we need to find out how many more years she needs to work to reach the retirement goal of 40 years.

4. **Calculate the additional years Lauren needs to work:**
   - Total retirement period = 20 years.
   - Years already planned to save = 20 years.
   - Additional years needed = 40 years (total retirement period) - 20 years (planned period) = 20 years.

Therefore, Lauren needs to work an additional 20 years to save enough for her retirement. The final numerical answer is:

"To find out the length of each final cut, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, Marty cuts the 100 centimeters of ribbon into 4 equal parts. To find the length of each part, we divide 100 by 4:
   \[
   \frac{100}{4} = 25 \text{ cm}
   \]
   So, each of the 4 parts is 25 centimeters long.

2. Next, each of these 25 centimeter parts is divided into 5 equal parts. To find the length of each of these smaller parts, we divide 25 by 5:
   \[
   \frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ cm}
   \]
   Therefore, each of the final cuts will be 5 centimeters long.

The final numerical answer is:

Given:
\[ 0.40 \times T = 240 \]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 600 \]

Now, we know the total number of students in the school is 600. Since 40% of the students are boys, the remaining 60% are girls. To find the number of girls, we calculate 60% of 600:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times 600 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

So, the number of girls in the school is 360."

"First, let's determine how many kilograms of apples each person wants.

Pierre wants a quarter of the total 12 kg of apples:
\[ \text{Pierre's share} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg} \]

Paul wants a third of the total 12 kg of apples:
\[ \text{Paul's share} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg} \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount of apples that Pierre and Paul want:
\[ \text{Total wanted by Pierre and Paul} = 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg} \]

Finally, to find out how many kilograms James will have left, we subtract the total amount wanted by Pierre and Paul from the original 12 kg:

So, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times."
"First, let's calculate the total number of male and female guppies and goldfishes Tate has after the purchase.

Initially, Tate has:
- 4 male guppies
- 7 female guppies
- 3 male goldfishes
- 5 female goldfishes

After buying more fish:
- He buys 2 more male guppies, so he now has 4 + 2 = 6 male guppies.
- He buys 1 more female guppy, so he now has 7 + 1 = 8 female guppies.
- He buys 2 more male goldfishes, so he now has 3 + 2 = 5 male goldfishes.
- He buys 3 more female goldfishes, so he now has 5 + 3 = 8 female goldfishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of male and female fishes:
- Total male fishes = 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfishes) = 11 male fishes.
- Total female fishes = 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfishes) = 16 female fishes.

Finally, to find out how many more female fishes than male fishes Tate has, we subtract the total number of male fishes from the total number of female fishes:
- Difference = 16 (female fishes) - 11 (male fishes) = 5.

So, Tate has 5 more female fishes than male fishes."
"First, let's determine the time each person took to complete their chores:

- Amalia mowed the lawn, which took her 4 hours.
- Megan walked the dog, which took her 2 hours longer than Amalia. Therefore, Megan's chore took her \(4 + 2 = 6\) hours.
- Dior did the laundry, which took her well over 4 hours longer than Amalia. Since Amalia's chore took 4 hours, Dior's chore took her \(4 + 10 = 14\) hours (assuming ""well over 4 hours longer"" means more than 4 hours but not specified exactly, we can use 10 hours as a reasonable assumption).

Now, we sum up the time each person took to complete their chores:
- Amalia: 4 hours
- Megan: 6 hours
- Dior: 14 hours

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is:
\[ 4 + 6 + 14 = 24 \text{ hours} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers and then determine how many toys the fifth worker needs to produce per hour to meet the order requirements.

First, let's calculate the production rate of the first two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 6 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(2 \times 6 = 12\) toys per hour.

Next, let's calculate the production rate of the next two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 4 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(2 \times 4 = 8\) toys per hour.

Now, let's find the total production rate of the first four workers:
- The total production rate is \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

The four workers work for a 10-hour shift:
- In 10 hours, the first four workers produce \(20 \times 10 = 200\) toys.

The toy manufacturer received an order for 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, they still need 20 toys to ship the order:
- Therefore, the total number of toys produced by the first four workers is \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys.

Since the first four workers produced 200 toys in 10 hours, the fifth worker must have produced:
- \(380 - 200 = 180\) toys in 10 hours.

To find the production rate of the fifth worker, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours worked:
- The production rate of the fifth worker is \(\frac{180}{10} = 18\) toys per hour.

Thus, the fifth worker produces \(\boxed{18}\) toys per hour."
"First, let's determine the weight of Elijah's dogs based on the information given.

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:

\[ \frac{20,000 \text{ kilometers}}{400 \text{ kilometers/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth."
"To find the speed of the faster car, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car.
2. Use the speed of the 2nd fastest car to find the speed of the faster car.

First, we know the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. Therefore, the speed of the 2nd fastest car is:
\[ 120 \text{ mph} \times 5 = 600 \text{ mph} \]

Next, the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. Therefore, the speed of the faster car is:
\[ 600 \text{ mph} \times 1.25 = 750 \text{ mph} \]

So, the speed of the faster car is 750 miles per hour."
"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equation based on the information given.

Let \( V \) represent Vince's age two years ago.

According to the problem, two years ago Liam's age was 14 (since he is 16 now). At that time, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. So we can write the equation:

\[ 14 = 2V \]

Now, solve for \( V \):

\[ V = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]

So, two years ago Vince was 7 years old. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:

\[ V_{\text{current}} = V + 2 = 7 + 2 = 9 \]

Therefore, Vince is currently 9 years old.

The final numerical answer is 9."
"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline as \( A \). Since they painted the same number of eggs, we have:
\[ A = A \]

Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Sarah as \( S \). Then the number of eggs painted by Camden is \( S + 12 \). Therefore, we have:
\[ S + (S + 12) = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs. Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56, we can write:
\[ A + A + 9 + 21 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

So, Arnold and Madeline each painted 13 eggs. Now, we need to find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Therefore, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"First, we need to determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons. This can be calculated as:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups} \]

Each group of 8 crayons will be placed in a box. Since each box contains 8 crayons and each crayon weighs 1 ounce, each box will weigh:

\[ \text{Weight of each box} = 8 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 8 \text{ ounces} \]

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the weight of each box in pounds is:

\[ \text{Weight of each box in pounds} = \frac{8 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Since there are 25 boxes, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 0.5 \text{ pounds/box} = 12.5 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 12.5 \text{ pounds} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many 4-foot logs John can make from the 80-foot tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we calculate:

\[ \text{Length of logs} = 80 \text{ feet} \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 4-foot logs can be cut from 64 feet of wood:

\[ \text{Number of logs} = \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

Now, we need to determine how many planks John can get from these 16 logs. Since he cuts 5 planks from each log:

\[ \text{Number of planks} = 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

Finally, we calculate the total revenue from selling these planks at $1.2 per plank:

\[ \text{Total revenue} = 80 \text{ planks} \times 1.2 \text{ dollars/plank} = 96 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns half of what her brother earns, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Valerie's salary} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

Given that Valerie earns $5000 per month, we can solve for her brother's salary:

\[ 5000 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

\[ \text{Brother's salary} = 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Now, we know Valerie earns $5000 and her brother earns $10000. Their combined salary is:

\[ \text{Combined salary} = 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so:

\[ \text{Mother's salary} = 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \]

To find the total amount of money they all have together, we add up their individual salaries:

\[ \text{Total amount} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} + \text{Mother's salary} \]

\[ \text{Total amount} = 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

So, the total amount of money they all have together is $45000."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time spent on the sidewalk and then add it to the time spent on the beach to find the total time for the 3-mile walk.

First, let's denote the speed on the beach as \( v \) miles per minute. Since Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes, we can write the equation for her speed on the beach as:
\[ v = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} \]

On the sidewalk, Grandma walks at twice the speed, so her speed on the sidewalk is:
\[ 2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Since the distance on the sidewalk is 1 mile, the time spent on the sidewalk can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk to find the total time for the 3-mile walk:
\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate how much Jane has saved so far. She has been saving $4 per week for 8 weeks.

\[ \text{Total saved so far} = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Jane's goal is to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she has already saved from her goal.

\[ \text{Amount still needed} = 60 - 32 = 28 \]

Now, we need to determine how many more weeks it will take for her to save the remaining $28, given that she saves $4 each week.

\[ \text{Number of weeks needed} = \frac{28}{4} = 7 \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

The final numerical answer is 7."
"To find the total number of blue birds, we need to add up the birds in each tree.

First, we have 3 trees with 7 blue birds each:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Next, we have 2 trees with 4 blue birds each:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

Finally, we have 1 tree with 3 blue birds:
\[ 1 \times 3 = 3 \]

Now, we add these amounts together to get the total number of blue birds:
\[ 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 \]

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"First, let's determine how many marbles Bob currently has. If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen is equal to 24 marbles, we can set up the following equation to find out how many marbles Bob currently has:

\[ \text{Current marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

Solving for the current number of marbles:

\[ \text{Current marbles} = 60 - 24 \]
\[ \text{Current marbles} = 36 \]

Now, if Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, the number of marbles he will have is:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 26."
"Let's denote the temperature of the second mug as \( T \) degrees. Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle. After pouring, the temperature of the water in his water bottle is at least 40 degrees.

The initial amount of water from the 33-degree mug is 4 ounces, and the initial amount of water from the second mug is 1 ounce. After pouring, the total amount of water in the water bottle is 5 ounces, and the temperature of this water is at least 40 degrees.

The average temperature of the water in the water bottle can be calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Average temperature} = \frac{\text{Total temperature of water poured}}{\text{Total volume of water poured}}
\]
The total temperature of the water poured is \( 4 \times 33 + 1 \times T = 132 + T \). The total volume of water poured is 5 ounces. Therefore, the average temperature is:
\[
\text{Average temperature} = \frac{132 + T}{5}
\]
Since the average temperature is at least 40 degrees, we can set up the inequality:
\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]
To solve for \( T \), we first multiply both sides of the inequality by 5:
\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]
Next, we subtract 132 from both sides:
\[
T \geq 68
\]
Therefore, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water. The final numerical answer is:
\[
68
\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of animals added to the farm over the course of three weeks and then add this to the initial number of animals.

First, let's calculate the number of animals added by Milkie Cows Limited:
- Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day.
- There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, they bring \(20 \times 7 = 140\) cows.
- For three weeks, they bring \(140 \times 3 = 420\) cows.

Next, let's calculate the number of animals added by Broilers Limited:
- Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day.
- There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, they bring \(10 \times 7 = 70\) chickens.
- For three weeks, they bring \(70 \times 3 = 210\) chickens.

Now, let's add the initial number of animals to the total number of animals added:
- Initial number of cows: 50
- Initial number of chickens: 20
- Total cows after three weeks: \(50 + 420 = 470\)
- Total chickens after three weeks: \(20 + 210 = 230\)

Finally, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is:
\[470 + 230 = 700\]

The final numerical answer is:
700"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount:

Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs cost:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost of $40.00:

The discount amount is:
\[ 40 \times 0.10 = 4 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell gets with 4 packs. Since each pack contains 9 bagels:
\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \]

Finally, to find the cost per bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels:
\[ \frac{36}{36} = 1 \]

So, the cost per bagel is $1.00.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1 \]"
"First, let's determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. According to the question, Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, we calculate:

\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 1 less than 3 is 2 scoops, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. The question states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, 1 less than 3 scoops is 2 scoops, and 3 less than 6 potatoes is 3 potatoes. Therefore, 2 scoops of mashed potatoes require 3 potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes are required for 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 2 scoops require 3 potatoes, 18 scoops would require:

\[ \frac{18}{2} \times 3 = 9 \times 3 = 27 \]

So, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 27 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days:
- Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days.
- Total eggs in the first 30 days = 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs.

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the next 30 days:
- Chester eats 5 eggs a day for 30 days.
- Total eggs in the next 30 days = 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.

Now, let's add the total number of eggs from both periods:
- Total eggs for 60 days = 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.

Finally, we need to convert the total number of eggs into dozens. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs:
- Total dozens of eggs = 240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens.

The final numerical answer is 20 dozens."
"First, let's determine the number of red jelly beans. Since there are twice as many red jelly beans as green jelly beans, and there are 17 green jelly beans, the number of red jelly beans is:

\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \]

Next, we know the total number of jelly beans is 60. We can find the number of blue jelly beans by subtracting the number of green and red jelly beans from the total number of jelly beans:

\[ 60 - (17 + 34) = 60 - 51 = 9 \]

So, the number of blue jelly beans is:

\[ 9 \]

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's determine the number of men and women on the bus before any alight.

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can represent the number of men as \(5x\) and the number of women as \(9x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of passengers is given as 84, so we can write the equation:
\[5x + 9x = 84\]
\[14x = 84\]
\[x = 6\]

Now we can find the number of men and women:
- Number of men = \(5x = 5 \times 6 = 30\)
- Number of women = \(9x = 9 \times 6 = 54\)

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of sunflowers sold per day and then calculate the total number of sunflowers sold over 3 days.

First, let's find out how many sunflowers were sold to earn $26 from selling sunflowers alone. Since each sunflower costs $2, the number of sunflowers sold per day is:
\[ \text{Number of sunflowers sold per day} = \frac{\$26}{\$2} = 13 \]

Next, we need to find out how many bouquets were sold to earn $56 from selling bouquets. Since each bouquet costs $8, the number of bouquets sold per day is:
\[ \text{Number of bouquets sold per day} = \frac{\$56}{\$8} = 7 \]

Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, so the number of sunflowers sold per day from selling bouquets is:
\[ \text{Number of sunflowers sold per day from bouquets} = 7 \times 12 = 84 \]

Now, we can find the total number of sunflowers sold per day by adding the sunflowers sold from selling sunflowers and the sunflowers sold from selling bouquets:
\[ \text{Total number of sunflowers sold per day} = 13 + 84 = 97 \]

Finally, to find the total number of sunflowers sold over 3 days, we multiply the number of sunflowers sold per day by 3:
\[ \text{Total number of sunflowers sold over 3 days} = 97 \times 3 = 291 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 291 \]"
"First, let's determine how many rocks Adam can buy with his $100. Each rock costs $5.

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the probability of winning for the second lottery ticket. Since the second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first, and the first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, the second ticket has a 60% chance of winning (since 20% * 3 = 60%).

Next, we need to find the probability that both tickets are winners. Since the events are independent, we multiply the probabilities of each event occurring.

The probability that both tickets are winners is:
\[ 20\% \times 60\% = 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

"Let's denote the number of seashells collected by Carlos as \( C \), by Jim as \( J \), and by Carrey as \( R \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Jim collected 27 seashells, so \( J = 27 \).
2. Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so \( J = C + 5 \). Substituting \( J = 27 \) into this equation, we get \( 27 = C + 5 \). Solving for \( C \), we find \( C = 22 \).
3. Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, so \( C = 2R \). Substituting \( C = 22 \) into this equation, we get \( 22 = 2R \). Solving for \( R \), we find \( R = 11 \).

Now, we know the total number of seashells collected by Carlos, Jim, and Carrey is:
\[ J + C + R = 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 \]

They divided the seashells equally among themselves, so each person got:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \]

Therefore, each person got 20 seashells."
"To calculate the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to consider the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the number he eats on weekends.

Mason eats 4 carrots each weekday. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is:
\[ 4 \text{ carrots/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ carrots} \]

On weekends, Mason eats 5 carrots each day. There are 2 days in the weekend, so the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is:
\[ 5 \text{ carrots/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ carrots} \]

Adding the carrots eaten on weekdays and the weekend gives us the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week:

"To determine how many more bottles of juices Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bottles needed to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs for 2300 people.
2. Subtract the current daily production from the total number of bottles needed.

First, calculate the total number of bottles needed:
- Each person's daily energy demand is covered by 20% of a bottle.
- Therefore, to cover 100% of a person's daily energy demand, we need 5 bottles (since 100% / 20% = 5).

For 2300 people:
\[ 2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, calculate how many more bottles are needed:
- Current daily production is 4200 bottles.
- Bottles needed = 11500 bottles.
- Bottles to be produced more = 11500 bottles - 4200 bottles = 7300 bottles.

Therefore, the number of additional bottles Hortex needs to produce is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. Let's break it down step by step.

First, calculate the number of babies dressed in purple and blue:
- Total babies = 8
- Babies dressed in purple = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- Babies dressed in blue = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, determine how many of the purple-wearers and blue-wearers also wear bows:
- Purple-wearers wearing bows = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)
- Blue-wearers wearing bows = 1 (since all blue-wearers wear bows)

Now, calculate the total number of babies wearing bows:
- Total babies wearing bows = Purple-wearers wearing bows + Blue-wearers wearing bows = 2 + 1 = 3

We need to find the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. This is given by the ratio of the number of purple-wearers wearing bows to the total number of babies wearing bows:
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of purple-wearers wearing bows}}{\text{Total number of babies wearing bows}} = \frac{2}{3} \]

To convert this probability to a percentage:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 100\% = \frac{200}{3}\% \approx 66.67\% \]

So, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is:

"First, let's determine how much land Abraham sold in each transaction.

1. Abraham initially owned 80 square meters of land.
2. He sold half of his land for $50. Half of 80 square meters is 40 square meters. So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.
3. After a month, he sold another 1/4 of his land. A quarter of 80 square meters is 20 square meters. So, he sold 20 square meters for $30.
4. The remaining land is the total land minus the land sold in the first and second transactions. The land sold in the first transaction was 40 square meters, and in the second transaction, it was 20 square meters. So, the total land sold is 40 + 20 = 60 square meters. Therefore, the remaining land is 80 - 60 = 20 square meters. He sold this remaining land for $3 per square meter.

Now, let's calculate the total money Abraham earned from each transaction:

- From the first transaction: $50
- From the second transaction: $30
- From the remaining land: 20 square meters * $3/square meter = $60

Adding these amounts together gives the total money Abraham earned:

$50 + $30 + $60 = $140

So, the final numerical answer is 140."
"To find Geb's age, we first calculate half of Haley's age and then subtract 10 from that value.

Haley's age = 26 years

Half of Haley's age = 26 / 2 = 13 years

Geb is 10 less than this value, so:

Geb's age = 13 - 10 = 3 years

The final numerical answer is 3."
"Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out. If he goes out three times a day, then in one day he uses \(2 \times 3 = 6\) face masks.

To find out how many face masks he uses every 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks he uses in one day by 2:

\[6 \times 2 = 12\]

So, the final numerical answer is 12."
"First, let's determine the total number of eggs Cole hid in the yard. Since a dozen equals 12, 3 dozen eggs equal 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Next, we'll calculate how many eggs each person found:
- Lamar found 5 eggs.
- Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy found 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.
- Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie found 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
- Mei found half as many as Charlie, so Mei found 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's sum up the total number of eggs found by all four individuals:
- Eggs found by Lamar: 5
- Eggs found by Stacy: 10
- Eggs found by Charlie: 8
- Eggs found by Mei: 4

Total eggs found = 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

Finally, to find out how many eggs are still hidden in the yard, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden:
- Eggs still hidden = 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

The final numerical answer is 9."
"First, let's calculate the number of apartments in the third apartment complex. The first two complexes each have 200 apartments, so together they have:

\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments} \]

The third complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, so it has:

\[ 400 \times 1.60 = 640 \text{ apartments} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from in a week. He collects garbage 3 times a week from each of the 3 complexes:

\[ 3 \times (400 + 640) = 3 \times 1040 = 3120 \text{ collections} \]

John gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are:

\[ 3120 \times 0.40 = 1248 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1248 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced by an avocado tree each year from age 5 to 10 and then sum these amounts.

1. **5-year-old tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old tree**: Produces \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
3. **7-year-old tree**: Produces \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
4. **8-year-old tree**: Produces \(10 \times 50 - 200 = 500 - 200 = 300\) fruits.
5. **9-year-old tree**: Produces 0 fruits.
6. **10-year-old tree**: Produces \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, we sum the fruits produced each year:

\[ 50 + 150 + 350 + 300 + 0 + 1000 = 2250 \]

The total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life is:

\[ \boxed{2250} \]"
"Sophia gave Jack \( \frac{1}{5} \) of her $100, which is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 100 = 20 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is 120."
"Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters, the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters, and the red rope as \( R \) centimeters.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, substitute \( B \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ R = 4(Y - 7) \]

Now, substitute \( B \) and \( R \) into the third equation:
\[ 4(Y - 7) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]

Add 35 to both sides:
\[ 6Y = 72 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now, find \( B \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \]

Finally, find \( R \):
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

The length of the red rope is \(\boxed{20}\) centimeters."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine how much money Rissa received:**
   - Ronnie received $5.
   - Rissa received thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa received \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

2. **Let \(x\) be the amount of money each of them gave to their sister:**
   - After giving \(x\) dollars to their sister, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original amount.
   - Therefore, \(15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15\).

3. **Solve for \(x\):**
   - Simplify the right side of the equation: \(\frac{4}{5} \times 15 = 12\).
   - So, \(15 - x = 12\).
   - Solving for \(x\), we get \(x = 15 - 12 = 3\).

4. **Determine how much money Rissa has left:**
   - Rissa originally had 15 dollars and gave 3 dollars to her sister, so she is left with \(15 - 3 = 12\) dollars.

5. **Determine how much money Ronnie has left:**
   - Ronnie originally had 5 dollars and did not give any money to his sister, so he still has 5 dollars.

The amount left in Ronnie's money is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Paint Used**: The mural uses 12 pints of paint in total.

2. **Distribution of Paint**:
   - Let the amount of red paint be \( R \) pints.
   - Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, the amount of white paint is also \( R \) pints, and the amount of purple paint is also \( R \) pints.
   - The amount of yellow paint is half the mural, which is \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) pints.

3. **Equation for Total Paint**:
   - The total amount of paint is the sum of the red, white, purple, and yellow paint.
   - Therefore, \( R + R + R + 6 = 12 \).

4. **Solve for \( R \)**:
   - Combine like terms: \( 3R + 6 = 12 \).
   - Subtract 6 from both sides: \( 3R = 6 \).
   - Divide by 3: \( R = 2 \).

So, the number of pints of red paint used is \( 2 \) pints.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. The area of one bedroom is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Area of one bedroom} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

Given that each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet, the area of one bedroom is:

\[ \text{Area of one bedroom} = 20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

\[ \text{Total area of bedrooms} = 4 \times 240 = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so the area of the living room is:

\[ \text{Area of living room} = 5 \times 240 = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

\[ \text{Total area of the house} = \text{Total area of bedrooms} + \text{Area of living room} + \text{Area of the rest of the house} \]

\[ \text{Total area of the house} = 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

So, the total area of the house is 3160 square feet."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cloud puffs Alice counts each day from Monday to Friday, given that each day she sees double the number of clouds as the previous day.

- Monday: 3 puffs
- Tuesday: 3 * 2 = 6 puffs
- Wednesday: 6 * 2 = 12 puffs
- Thursday: 12 * 2 = 24 puffs
- Friday: 24 * 2 = 48 puffs

Now, we sum up the puffs from all five days:

3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93

So, at the end of the week, Alice will have counted 93 clouds in the sky at lunch across all five days."
"To solve this, first, we need to determine the number of pods in the new box. The new box has 20% more pods than the original 100 pods.

20% of 100 pods is \(100 \times 0.20 = 20\) pods.

So, the new box has \(100 + 20 = 120\) pods.

The cost of the new box is the same as the original, which is $12. We need to find out how many cycles we can run with $1 if we use 1 pod per cycle.

The cost per pod is \(\frac{12}{100} = 0.12\) dollars per pod.

For $1, the number of pods we can buy is \(\frac{1}{0.12} = \frac{100}{12} = \frac{25}{3} \approx 8.33\) pods.

Since we can only run full cycles with 1 pod per cycle, with $1, we can run 8 cycles.

So, the final numerical answer is 8."
"First, let's determine how many 20 dollar bills Thomas initially withdraws from the bank. Since he withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills} \]

Next, Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home. So, the number of bills he has left is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills} \]

Thomas then uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 bills is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills} \]

So, the number of bills he has left after paying for the bill is:

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills} \]

After that, Thomas triples his money. Since each bill is worth $20, the total amount of money he has is:

\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

After tripling his money, he has:

\[ 400 \times 3 = 1200 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, Thomas converts all his money to 5 dollar bills. The number of 5 dollar bills he has is:

\[ \frac{1200}{5} = 240 \text{ bills} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 240 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Half Goals:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half Goals:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals in the second half.
   - Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, so Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals in the second half.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Team A's total goals: \(4 \text{ (first half)} + 2 \text{ (second half)} = 6\).
   - Team B's total goals: \(2 \text{ (first half)} + 8 \text{ (second half)} = 10\).

4. **Total Goals Scored in the Match:**
   - The total number of goals scored in the match is the sum of the goals scored by both teams: \(6 + 10 = 16\).

The total number of goals scored in the match is 16."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chalk the teacher has left and then calculate how many days he can continue using only 20% of the chalk each day before he has to recycle it.

1. **Determine the amount of chalk used on Monday:**
   - The teacher used 45% of the chalk by the end of Monday.
   - The total length of the chalk is 5 inches.
   - Therefore, the amount of chalk used on Monday is \( 5 \times 0.45 = 2.25 \) inches.

2. **Determine the remaining chalk after Monday:**
   - The remaining chalk is \( 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \) inches.

3. **Determine how much chalk the teacher will use each day if he uses only 20% of the chalk:**
   - If the teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, he will use \( 5 \times 0.20 = 1 \) inch of chalk each day.

4. **Calculate how many days the remaining chalk will last:**
   - The remaining chalk is 2.75 inches.
   - If he uses 1 inch of chalk each day, the number of days he can continue is \( \frac{2.75}{1} = 2.75 \) days.
   - Since the teacher cannot use a fraction of a day, he can use the chalk for 2 full days and will have some chalk left over after the second day.

Therefore, the teacher has 2 days before he has to recycle this piece of chalk."
"First, let's calculate the number of girls on varsity. One-third of the girls are on varsity, so:

\[
\text{Girls on varsity} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4

"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, we'll solve the first equation for \( W \):
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, we'll substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Now, isolate \( C \) by subtracting \( 3C \) and 35 from both sides:
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices} \]

Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, we need to determine how many cheese pizzas are required to provide 36 slices:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed by Kate's friends. Each of the 6 friends eats 4 slices of pepperoni pizza:

\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Since the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we need to determine how many pepperoni pizzas are required to provide 24 slices:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Day:**
   - They used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - After using 38 bandages, they had \(50 - 38 = 12\) bandages left.
   - They ordered 50 more bandages, so they had \(12 + 50 = 62\) bandages at the end of the first day.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
   - They had \(62 - 28 = 34\) bandages left at the end of the second day.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered \(2 \times 50 = 100\) bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.
   - They had \(34 + 100 - 25 = 109\) bandages at the end of the third day.

However, the problem states they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This discrepancy suggests a need to recheck the problem statement or the interpretation. Given the problem constraints, let's assume the final inventory is 78 bandages and adjust accordingly.

So, at the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages. This means the calculation for the third day should be adjusted to fit this condition.

Let's recheck the third day calculation:
- They ordered 100 bandages and used 25, so they had \(78 - 25 = 53\) bandages left after ordering.
- This means they had \(53 - 100 = -47\) bandages before ordering, which is not possible. Therefore, we need to adjust the initial inventory.

Let's denote the initial inventory at the start of the first day as \(x\).

From the first day:
- They used 38 bandages and ordered 50, so they had \(x - 38 + 50 = x + 12\) bandages at the end of the first day.

From the second day:
- They used 28 bandages, so they had \(x + 12 - 28 = x - 16\) bandages at the end of the second day.

From the third day:
- They ordered 100 bandages and used 25, so they had \(x - 16 + 100 - 25 = x + 69\) bandages at the end of the third day.
- This should be equal to 78 bandages, so \(x + 69 = 78\).

Solving for \(x\):
\[ x = 78 - 69 = 9 \]

Therefore, they started with 9 bandages on the first day.

The final numerical answer is:
9"
"First, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut. May's hair was initially 10 inches and ended at 8 inches, so the haircut involved cutting 2 inches.

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to consider her daily earnings, the number of days she works in April, and the additional bonus for complete attendance.

First, let's calculate her daily earnings:
- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

Daily earnings = 7.5 hours/day * $1.5/hour = $11.25/day

Next, we calculate her total earnings for the 4 weeks in April:
- There are 4 weeks in April.
- She works 6 days a week.

Total days worked in April = 4 weeks * 6 days/week = 24 days

Total earnings from hourly work = 24 days * $11.25/day = $270

Since Jen did not incur any absences and received the $10 bonus for complete attendance, we add the bonus to her total earnings:

Total earnings for April = $270 + $10 = $280

Therefore, Jen will receive $280 in April."

1 time * $3.00 per time = $3.00

For taking the trash out:
2 times * $0.75 per time = $1.50

For cleaning his room:
1 time * $1.50 per time = $1.50

Now, we sum these amounts:
$3.00 + $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 = $9.00

So, Jason earned a total of $9.00 in the two week period."
"First, we need to determine the amount of blood in one shark. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and each whale has 40 gallons of blood, we can calculate the blood volume in one shark as follows:

\[ \text{Blood volume in one shark} = 3 \times 40 \text{ gallons} = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have together. Since each shark has 120 gallons of blood, ten sharks will have:

\[ \text{Total blood volume for ten sharks} = 10 \times 120 \text{ gallons} = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:

\[ 1200 \]"
"To calculate the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day, we need to add the number of people who entered at different times.

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which means \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. The number that came in first is 50, so \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people.

Now, we sum these numbers to find the total number of people who entered the restaurant:

\[
50 \text{ (morning)} + 40 \text{ (10:00)} + 80 \text{ (twice the 10:00)} + 150 \text{ (evening)}
\]

\[
50 + 40 + 80 + 150 = 320
\]

The total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day is 320."
"Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, which means she bought 5 * 5 = 25 red pens. She bought twice the amount of black pens, which means she bought 5 * 2 = 10 packs of black pens. Therefore, she bought 10 * 5 = 50 black pens. In total, Alain has 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens. 

The final numerical answer is 75."
"First, let's find out the cost per bottle of scotch:
\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{\$600}{10 \text{ bottles}} = \$60 \text{ per bottle} \]

Next, we calculate the cost per bottle of cognac, which is 50% more than the cost of scotch:
\[ \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = \$60 \times 1.5 = \$90 \text{ per bottle} \]

Now, we find out how many bottles of cognac John buys:
\[ \text{Number of bottles of cognac} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles} \]

Then, we calculate the total cost for the cognac:
\[ \text{Total cost of cognac} = 20 \text{ bottles} \times \$90 \text{ per bottle} = \$1800 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the scotch and the cost of the cognac to find the total amount spent:
\[ \text{Total amount spent} = \$600 + \$1800 = \$2400 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$2400 \]"
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Day Planting:**
   - Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
   - He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees. Therefore, the number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted is:
     \[
     2 \times 20 = 40
     \]

2. **Second Day Planting:**
   - On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day. Therefore, the number of White Oak trees planted on the second day is:
     \[
     20 + 10 = 30
     \]
   - On the second day, he planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day. First, we need to find out how many more trees he planted on the second day compared to the first day:
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10
     \]
   - Therefore, the number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is:
     \[
     40 + 10 = 50
     \]

3. **Total Trees Planted:**
   - Summing up the trees planted on both days:
     \[
     \text{Total White Oak trees} = 20 \text{ (first day)} + 30 \text{ (second day)} = 50
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Lodgepole Pine trees} = 40 \text{ (first day)} + 50 \text{ (second day)} = 90
     \]
   - The total number of trees planted is:
     \[
     50 \text{ (White Oak)} + 90 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 140
     \]

Thus, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is:
\[
\boxed{140}
\]"
"To find out how much root beer was available for each person to drink during the party, we need to follow the sequence of events and perform the necessary calculations step by step.

1. **Initial amount of root beer**: Fred made 24 gallons on the first day.
2. **After the children drank 4 gallons**: 
   \[
   24 - 4 = 20 \text{ gallons}
   \]
3. **After Barbie spilled 7 gallons**:
   \[
   20 - 7 = 13 \text{ gallons}
   \]
4. **After Ronnie drank 5 gallons**:
   \[
   13 - 5 = 8 \text{ gallons}
   \]
5. **On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party**. If the remaining root beer was shared equally among the 3 people, we need to divide the 8 gallons by 3:
   \[
   \frac{8}{3} \approx 2.67 \text{ gallons per person}
   \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\frac{8}{3} \text{ gallons}

"Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as \( x \).

According to the problem, ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is 40."" This can be translated into the following equation:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4x = 32 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is \( 8 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"First, let's find out how many fish have red stripes. Since one-third of the fish have red stripes, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of fish with red stripes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

Next, we need to find out how many fish are left after accounting for the fish with red stripes. This is:

\[
\text{Remaining fish} = 66 - 22 = 44
\]

Now, we need to find out how many of these remaining fish have blue stripes. Since 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of fish with blue stripes} = \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
\]

Finally, to find the total number of fish that have either red or blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes to the number of fish with blue stripes:

\[
\text{Total number of fish with red or blue stripes} = 22 + 20 = 42
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
42

"First, let's calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had:

- Two eyeshadow palettes, each with 4 colors: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors
- Three makeup sets, each with 6 colors: \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors

So, the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had is \(8 + 18 = 26\) colors.

Her sister steals one of the palettes, which means Amy loses 4 colors. So, the number of colors left after the theft is \(26 - 4 = 22\) colors.

Amy then uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since one makeup set originally had 6 colors, using up half means she uses up \(6 / 2 = 3\) colors. Therefore, the number of colors left after using up half of one makeup set is \(22 - 3 = 19\) colors.

The final number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is 19."
"First, let's determine the height of Mattison's house. Since Mattison is 60 inches tall and his house is 7 times as high as he is, the height of the house is:

\[ 60 \times 7 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to find the height of the first floor. The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison is, so:

\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Since the house is two stories, the height of the second floor is the total height of the house minus the height of the first floor:

\[ 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height from the floor of the second floor to the roof is the height of the second floor, which is:

\[ 240 \text{ inches} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 240 \]"
"First, let's calculate how many shells team Alphas found. They found 40% of the 700 shells.

\[ \text{Shells found by Alphas} = 700 \times \frac{40}{100} = 280 \]

Next, we calculate the remaining shells after team Alphas found theirs.

\[ \text{Remaining shells} = 700 - 280 = 420 \]

Team The finders then found 60% of the remaining 420 shells.

\[ \text{Shells found by The finders} = 420 \times \frac{60}{100} = 252 \]

Finally, to find out how many shells team Gogetters found, we subtract the shells found by Alphas and The finders from the total number of shells.

\[ \text{Shells found by Gogetters} = 700 - 280 - 252 = 168 \]

So, team Gogetters found 168 shells."
"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information given to calculate the total miles walked by all dogs and then subtract the known miles from this total.

We know that the average distance walked by all 4 dogs is 3 miles per day. Therefore, the total distance walked by all dogs in one day is:
\[ 3 \text{ miles/dog} \times 4 \text{ dogs} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

The distances walked by the first three dogs are:
- First dog: 1 mile
- Second dog: 4 miles
- Third dog: 3 miles

Adding these distances together gives:
\[ 1 \text{ mile} + 4 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

To find the distance walked by the last dog, we subtract the total distance walked by the first three dogs from the total distance walked by all four dogs:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

So, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \]"
"First, we need to calculate the loan amount John gets. The loan is 40% of the value of his house, which is $250,000.

\[ \text{Loan Amount} = 250,000 \times \frac{40}{100} = 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much John uses to pay off his debts. He uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts.

\[ \text{Amount Used to Pay Off Debts} = 100,000 \times \frac{60}{100} = 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

To find out how much money John has leftover after paying off his debts, we subtract the amount used to pay off his debts from the loan amount.

\[ \text{Money Leftover} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 40,000 \]"
"To determine how much Deandre will earn, we first need to calculate the total weight of the tunas he caught and then multiply that by the price per kilogram.

The weights of the tunas are:
- First tuna: 56 kilograms
- Second tuna: 46 kilograms
- Third tuna: 26 kilograms

First, we calculate the total weight:
\[ 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 \text{ kilograms} \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the total weight by the price per kilogram:
\[ 128 \text{ kilograms} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/kilogram} = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine Trinity's profit, we first need to calculate the selling price of the magazines and then subtract the cost price from it.

The cost price of the magazines is $72. The selling price is 11/8 of the cost price.

First, calculate the selling price:
\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72 \]

Now, let's perform the multiplication:
\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11 \times 72}{8} \]
\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{792}{8} \]
\[ \text{Selling Price} = 99 \]

Now, to find the profit, subtract the cost price from the selling price:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price} \]
\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 \]
\[ \text{Profit} = 27 \]

So, Trinity's profit is $27."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier over the specified periods.

1. **Low setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day on the low setting.
   - Brian ran the dehumidifier for 3 days on the low setting.
   - Total water removed on the low setting = 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters.

2. **Medium setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes twice as much water per day on the medium setting as on the low setting.
   - Therefore, the medium setting removes 2 liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran the dehumidifier for 3 days on the medium setting.
   - Total water removed on the medium setting = 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters.

3. **High setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes twice as much water per day on the high setting as on the medium setting.
   - Therefore, the high setting removes 4 liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran the dehumidifier for 5 days on the high setting.
   - Total water removed on the high setting = 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters.

Finally, we sum up the total water removed over all settings:
- Total water removed = 3 liters (low setting) + 6 liters (medium setting) + 20 liters (high setting) = 29 liters.

The total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in his basement is **29 liters**."

\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 30 \text{ balloons per pack} = 300 \text{ balloons} \]

By the end of the afternoon, 12 balloons were left. To find out how many balloons were thrown, we subtract the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons:

\[ 300 \text{ balloons} - 12 \text{ balloons} = 288 \text{ balloons} \]

So, the number of balloons thrown is:

\[ 288 \]"
"First, let's determine the amount of the second medicine Saanvi had to combine with the first medicine for one dose. Since she combined 14 mL of the first medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine, the amount of the second medicine for one dose is:

\[ 3 \times 14 \, \text{mL} = 42 \, \text{mL} \]

Now, we can calculate the total amount of medicine in one dose by adding the amounts of the first and second medicines:

\[ 14 \, \text{mL} + 42 \, \text{mL} = 56 \, \text{mL} \]

To find out how many mL of medicine would be in 8 doses, we multiply the amount of medicine in one dose by 8:

\[ 56 \, \text{mL} \times 8 = 448 \, \text{mL} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 448 \]"
"First, let's find the capacity of Ali's class, which is given as 120 students.

Next, we need to find the capacity of John's classes. Since each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, we calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:
\[ \text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{120}{8} = 15 \text{ students} \]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of John's school is:
\[ \text{Total capacity of John's school} = 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ students} \]

Now, to find the combined capacity of both schools, we add the capacity of Ali's school to the capacity of John's school:
\[ \text{Combined capacity} = 120 + 30 = 150 \]

The combined capacity of both schools is 150 students."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen promised to return to his sister. He borrowed $300 and promised to return it with an additional 2% interest. 

The interest amount is calculated as:
\[ \text{Interest} = 300 \times \frac{2}{100} = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen promised to return is:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Stephen will pay over the 11 months. He will pay $25 per month for 11 months:
\[ \text{Total Payment for 11 months} = 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

The remaining amount, which includes the interest, will be paid in the twelfth month. This remaining amount is the total amount Stephen promised to return minus the total payment for 11 months:
\[ \text{Remaining Amount} = 306 - 275 = 31 \]

Therefore, Stephen will pay $31 in the twelfth month.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of diaper changes per day for both children.
2. Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, the total number of diaper changes per day for both children is:
   \[
   5 \text{ changes/child} \times 2 \text{ children} = 10 \text{ changes/day}
   \]
3. Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers. Therefore, the number of diapers changed by Jordan's wife is:
   \[
   \frac{10 \text{ changes/day}}{2} = 5 \text{ changes/day}
   \]
4. Consequently, the number of diapers changed by Jordan is the other half:
   \[
   10 \text{ changes/day} - 5 \text{ changes/day} = 5 \text{ changes/day}
   \]

So, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the volume of the jar, the number of jelly beans that fit in the jar based on packing efficiency, and then determine how many of those are red.

1. **Volume of the jar:**
   The jar has a square base of 6 inches by 6 inches and a height of 15 inches.
   \[
   \text{Volume of the jar} = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Number of jelly beans that fit in the jar:**
   Given the packing efficiency is 80%, the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans is:
   \[
   \text{Effective volume} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]
   Given that each jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches:
   \[

"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, so the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is given as 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find the value of \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece:

\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 32 \]"
"To determine how much of his secret seasoning Aiden will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many pounds of meat are needed to make 80 meatballs.
2. Calculate the amount of seasoning needed based on the amount of meat.

First, we know that Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat. To find out how many pounds of meat are needed for 80 meatballs, we divide the number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound:

\[
\text{Pounds of meat needed} = \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds of meat}
\]

Next, we know that Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat. To find out how much seasoning is needed for 5 pounds of meat, we multiply the number of pounds of meat by the amount of seasoning per pound:

\[
\text{Seasoning needed} = 5 \text{ pounds of meat} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons of seasoning}
\]

Therefore, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning."

\[ \text{Total width} = 5 \times 35 \text{ inches} \]

\[ \text{Total width} = 175 \text{ inches} \]

Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows. Therefore, we multiply the total width by 2:

\[ \text{Fabric needed} = 175 \text{ inches} \times 2 \]

\[ \text{Fabric needed} = 350 \text{ inches} \]

So, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."

"To solve this, we first need to calculate twice the amount of rain that fell on Monday. Since it rained 2 inches on Monday, twice that amount is 2 * 2 = 4 inches. 

On Tuesday, it is expected to rain 1 more inch than twice of Monday's total. Therefore, we add 1 inch to the 4 inches calculated earlier, which gives us 4 + 1 = 5 inches.

So, the total amount of rain expected on Tuesday is 5 inches."
"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly made as \( C \) and the number of brownies as \( B \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, which can be written as:
\[ B = 3C - 2 \]

Carly's class has 5 people, and each person gets 2 treats. Therefore, the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

The total number of treats is the sum of the cupcakes and brownies:
\[ C + B = 10 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]

Adding 2 to both sides:
\[ 4C = 12 \]

Dividing both sides by 4:
\[ C = 3 \]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure before the discount:

Cost of manicure = $35
Cost of pedicure = $40

Total cost before discount = Cost of manicure + Cost of pedicure
Total cost before discount = $35 + $40 = $75

Now, the salon offers a 20% discount for getting both services:

Discount amount = 20% of $75
Discount amount = 0.20 * $75 = $15

So, the total cost after the discount is:

Total cost after discount = Total cost before discount - Discount amount
Total cost after discount = $75 - $15 = $60

Karen also wants to add nail art on each of her fingers. There are 10 fingers in total (2 fingers per hand), and each nail art costs $3:

Cost of nail art = 10 fingers * $3 per finger
Cost of nail art = $30

Finally, the total cost Karen would pay is:

Total cost = Total cost after discount + Cost of nail art
Total cost = $60 + $30 = $90

So, Karen would pay $90 in all."
"First, let's calculate the total number of issues Susan gets from the three magazines that send 12 issues a year:

3 magazines * 12 issues/magazine = 36 issues

Next, let's calculate the number of issues she gets from the magazine that sends 6 issues a year:

1 magazine * 6 issues/magazine = 6 issues

Now, let's calculate the number of issues she gets from the last magazine, which sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine:

4 * 6 issues/magazine = 24 issues

Finally, let's add up all the issues:

36 issues + 6 issues + 24 issues = 66 issues

Therefore, the total number of magazines Susan gets every year is 66."
"Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as \( K \).

According to the problem, Shelley has 8 paintings more than Kim, so Shelley has \( K + 8 \) paintings.

Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, and we know Samantha has 27 paintings. Therefore, we can write the equation for the number of paintings Samantha has as:
\[ K + 8 - 12 = 27 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ K - 4 = 27 \]

To find \( K \), we add 4 to both sides of the equation:
\[ K = 27 + 4 \]
\[ K = 31 \]

So, Kim has 31 paintings. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 31 \]"
"To find the final price of the toy after the price changes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price of the toy in December after an 80% increase.
2. Calculate the price of the toy in January after a 50% decrease from the December price.

**Step 1: Calculate the price in December.**

The price in November was $40. An 80% increase means the price increased by 80% of $40.

\[ \text{Increase in December} = 40 \times \frac{80}{100} = 40 \times 0.8 = 32 \]

So, the price in December is:

\[ \text{Price in December} = 40 + 32 = 72 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the price in January.**

The price in December was $72. A 50% decrease means the price decreased by 50% of $72.

\[ \text{Decrease in January} = 72 \times \frac{50}{100} = 72 \times 0.5 = 36 \]

So, the price in January is:

\[ \text{Price in January} = 72 - 36 = 36 \]

The final numerical answer is 36."
"First, let's calculate the standard fee for a lesson:
- Standard fee per hour = $80

Next, let's calculate the reduced fee for a lesson to a veteran:
- Reduced fee = Standard fee * (1 - 25%)
- Reduced fee = $80 * (1 - 0.25)
- Reduced fee = $80 * 0.75
- Reduced fee = $60

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for the day:
- Earnings from standard lessons = 4 lessons * $80/lesson
- Earnings from veteran lessons = 2 lessons * $60/lesson
- Total earnings = Earnings from standard lessons + Earnings from veteran lessons
- Total earnings = (4 * $80) + (2 * $60)
- Total earnings = $320 + $120
- Total earnings = $440

The total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is $440."

"Eve originally had 20 pomelos. After giving some away, she was left with 1/4 of the original amount. 

To find out how many pomelos Eve has left, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \]

This means Eve has 5 pomelos left. To find out how many she gave away, we subtract the number of pomelos she has left from the original number:
\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

So, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

The final numerical answer is 15."
"First, let's calculate how many apples Walter ate. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 apples:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ apples}
\]

So, the number of apples remaining after Walter ate some is:

\[
60 - 24 = 36 \text{ apples}
\]

Next, Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. The number of apples given to his sister is:

\[
0.25 \times 36 = 9 \text{ apples}
\]

So, the number of apples remaining after giving some to his sister is:

\[
36 - 9 = 27 \text{ apples}
\]

Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. The total money he received is:

"To find out how many novels Regina has written this year, we need to determine the total number of novels she has written, given that the 9 novels she wrote last year represent 3 quarters of this total.

Let's denote the total number of novels she has written this year as \( x \).

According to the problem, 9 novels is 3 quarters of \( x \). This can be written as:
\[ 9 = \frac{3}{4} x \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{3}{4} \), which is \( \frac{4}{3} \):
\[ x = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} \]

Now, we perform the multiplication:
\[ x = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 9 \times 1.3333 = 12 \]

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"To calculate the percentage of the distance Michael has covered, we first need to determine the total distance he has traveled in 3 days.

Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr. There are 24 hours in a day, so in 3 days, the total number of hours is:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 72 \text{ hours} \]

The total distance Michael has traveled in 72 hours at an average speed of 50 km/hr is:
\[ 72 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ km/hr} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

The distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. To find the percentage of the total distance that Michael has covered, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{\text{Distance covered}}{\text{Total distance}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 0.6 \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the distance that Michael has covered is:

"First, let's determine how many grapes Madeline's brother used to make the grape juice. Since he used up 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, and Madeline ate 6 grapes, we calculate:

\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ grapes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many grapes were used in total by Madeline and her brother. Adding the grapes used by Madeline and her brother gives:

\[ 6 + 30 = 36 \text{ grapes} \]

Their mother then used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. Since each pie recipe calls for 12 grapes, the total number of grapes used to make the pies is:

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ grapes} \]

To find the total number of grapes at the beginning, we add the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and their mother:

\[ 36 + 48 = 84 \text{ grapes} \]

So, the total number of grapes at the beginning is:

"First, let's calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms. Since it takes 15 minutes per classroom, the total time required is:

\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert the total time into hours because the workday is given in hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 1200 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

The custodian works 8 hours per day. To find out how much of their day is spent cleaning, we divide the total cleaning time by the number of hours they work in a day:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours/day}} = 2.5 \text{ days} \]

However, the custodian only has 5 days to complete the cleaning. This means they will spend:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{5 \text{ days}} = 4 \text{ hours/day} \]

To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Cleaning hours per day}}{\text{Total hours in a day}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{4 \text{ hours/day}}{24 \text{ hours/day}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{6} \right) \times 100 \approx 16.67\% \]

So, the custodian spends approximately 16.67% of their day, on average, cleaning classrooms."
"First, let's determine the capacity of each shelf:

- Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase:

- The total capacity of one bookcase is the sum of the capacities of all the shelves: \(10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books.

Given that Elly has 110 books, we need to determine how many bookcases are required to hold all 110 books:

- The number of bookcases needed is the total number of books divided by the capacity of one bookcase: \(110 \div 55 = 2\).

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs Rose bought. Since she bought five dozens of eggs and each dozen costs $2.40, the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 5 \times 2.40 = 12.00 \]

Next, let's determine the total number of eggs Rose bought. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:

\[ \text{Total eggs} = 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Now, let's find out how much Rose will sell the eggs for. She sells them at $1 for 3 eggs. Therefore, the total revenue from selling 60 eggs is:

\[ \text{Total revenue} = \frac{60}{3} = 20 \]

Finally, to find Rose's profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = 20 - 12 = 8 \]

So, Rose's profit is:

\[ 8 \]"

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many questions Audrey needs to answer correctly on the second test to meet the 70% passing threshold for both tests combined.

First, let's calculate how many questions Audrey answered correctly on the first test:
- The first test has 70 questions.
- She got 60% of them correct.

\[
\text{Correct answers on the first test} = 70 \times \frac{60}{100} = 70 \times 0.6 = 42
\]

Next, we need to find out how many questions she needs to get correct on the second test to reach the 70% passing threshold for both tests combined.

The total number of questions on both tests is:
\[
70 + 40 = 110
\]

To pass, Audrey needs to answer 70% of these questions correctly:
\[
\text{Total correct answers needed} = 110 \times \frac{70}{100} = 110 \times 0.7 = 77

- There are 8 rooms in the house, and they have 2 flashlights per room.
- Therefore, the number of flashlights for the rooms is \(8 \times 2 = 16\).
- Adding the flashlights for the people, the total number of flashlights is \(4 + 16 = 20\).

Next, let's determine the number of candles:
- There are 8 rooms in the house, so half of the rooms is \(8 / 2 = 4\) rooms.
- For the 4 rooms, there are 4 small candles each, so the total number of small candles is \(4 \times 4 = 16\).
- For the other 4 rooms, there are 5 medium candles each, so the total number of medium candles is \(4 \times 5 = 20\).
- Adding the small and medium candles, the total number of candles is \(16 + 20 = 36\).

Finally, to find the total number of candles and flashlights used, we add the total number of flashlights and the total number of candles:

"First, we need to determine how many boxes of popsicle sticks Bob needs. Since each box contains 8 popsicle sticks and he needs 56 popsicle sticks, we divide 56 by 8:

\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

So, Bob needs 7 boxes of popsicle sticks. Each box costs $2.00, so we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box to find the total cost:

\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Bob to build his project is $14.00."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the cost of the main phone:**
   - The main phone costs $20.

2. **Determine the cost of each additional phone:**
   - Each additional phone costs half as much as the main phone.
   - Therefore, each additional phone costs \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total cost of the additional phones:**
   - There are 4 additional phones (since there are 5 phones in total and 1 is the main phone).
   - The total cost for the additional phones is \( 4 \times 10 = 40 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total cost of the whole phone plan:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the cost of the main phone and the cost of the additional phones.
   - Therefore, the total cost is \( 20 + 40 = 60 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is 60."
"To determine how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.
2. Convert the total number of doughnuts into a total number of units (since doughnuts are sold in dozens, we'll first convert dozens to individual units).
3. Calculate the total revenue by multiplying the total number of units by the price per unit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.**

June has 30 days. Since Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day, we first convert dozens to individual units:
\[ 10 \text{ dozen} = 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ doughnuts} \]

So, in June:
\[ 120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total revenue.**

Each doughnut is sold for $2. Therefore, the total revenue is:
\[ 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \times 2 \text{ dollars/doughnut} = 7200 \text{ dollars} \]

**Final numerical answer:**
\[ 7200 \]"

- Cost for 2 pairs of pants: \(2 \times 8.00 = 16.00\)
- Cost for 1 skirt: \(1 \times 6.00 = 6.00\)

Adding these together gives the weekly cost:
\[25.00 + 16.00 + 6.00 = 47.00\]

Now, to find the cost over 5 weeks:
\[47.00 \times 5 = 235.00\]

So, Alicia spends $235.00 on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks."
"First, let's calculate John's new speaking speed after training. His normal speaking speed is 150 WPM (words per minute). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster, so:

\[ \text{New Speed} = 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of words in 10 pages. Each page has 450 words, so:

\[ \text{Total Words} = 10 \, \text{pages} \times 450 \, \text{words/page} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

Now, to find out how long it would take him to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total Words}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} \]

\[ \text{Time} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of people Conor saw each day and then find the total for the week.

1. **First Day**: Conor saw 50 people.
2. **Second Day**: Conor saw 20 more people than on the first day, which is \(50 + 20 = 70\) people.
3. **Third Day**: The total number of people was twice the number on the second day, which is \(2 \times 70 = 140\) people.

Now, we need to find out how many people Conor saw on the remaining days of the week (fourth and fifth days) to ensure the average is 60 people per day.

Let's denote the number of people seen on the fourth and fifth days as \(x\).

The total number of people seen over the week is the sum of the people seen each day:
\[ 50 + 70 + 140 + x + x = 260 + 2x \]

The average number of people seen per day over the week is given as 60. Since there are 5 days in the week, the total number of people seen over the week can also be expressed as:
\[ 60 \times 5 = 300 \]

So, we set up the equation:
\[ 260 + 2x = 300 \]

Solving for \(x\):
\[ 2x = 300 - 260 \]
\[ 2x = 40 \]
\[ x = 20 \]

Thus, Conor saw 20 people on the fourth day and 20 people on the fifth day.

Now, we calculate the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week:
\[ 50 + 70 + 140 + 20 + 20 = 280 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 280 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial 30 seconds**: 20 kernels pop.
2. **Next 30 seconds**: Three times the initial amount, which is \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. **Next 30 seconds**: Four times the initial amount, which is \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. **Final 30 seconds**: Half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, which is \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) kernels pop.

Now, let's sum up the total number of kernels that popped in the first 120 seconds:
\[ 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 \]

After the pan is taken off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds pop from the residual heat:
\[ \frac{40}{4} = 10 \]

Adding these to the initial count:
\[ 200 + 10 = 210 \]

Therefore, the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat is:
\[ \boxed{210} \]"
"First, let's determine the total amount of lemon juice Tim needs. He wants to make 4 gallons of lemonade, and his recipe calls for 1 cup of fresh lemon juice per gallon. Therefore, he needs:

\[ 4 \text{ gallons} \times 1 \text{ cup/gallon} = 4 \text{ cups of lemon juice} \]

For the extra gallon that is twice as tart, he will need:

\[ 1 \text{ cup} \]

So, the total amount of lemon juice needed is:

\[ 4 \text{ cups} + 1 \text{ cup} = 5 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to determine how many lemons are required to get 5 cups of lemon juice. Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, the number of lemons needed for 5 cups of juice is:

\[ 5 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 30 \text{ lemons} \]

Therefore, the total number of lemons Tim will need is:

\[ 30 \text{ lemons} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of red blocks as \( R \).

Given:
- The number of blue blocks is 4.
- The number of yellow blocks is twice the number of blue blocks, which is \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \).
- The total number of blocks is 32.

The equation representing the total number of blocks is:
\[ 4 \text{ (blue)} + 8 \text{ (yellow)} + R \text{ (red)} = 32 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 4 + 8 + R = 32 \]
\[ 12 + R = 32 \]

To find \( R \), we subtract 12 from both sides of the equation:
\[ R = 32 - 12 \]
\[ R = 20 \]

So, the number of red blocks is 20.

\[
\boxed{20}

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance Elvis traveled in each part of his journey and then determine his final position relative to his starting point.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled west:
- Elvis drives west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance west = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled east:
- Elvis drives east for 8 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance east = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles

Now, we need to determine the net distance from Elvis's starting point:
- The distance traveled west is 90 miles.
- The distance traveled east is 144 miles.
- Since he traveled west first and then east, the net distance from his starting point is the difference between the distance traveled east and the distance traveled west.
- Net distance = Distance east - Distance west
- Net distance = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

Therefore, Elvis is 54 miles from his house now."
"To calculate the value of the boat after three years of depreciation, we need to apply the depreciation rates year by year.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   - Initial value: $9000

"First, let's determine the number of orange and yellow candies based on the given information:

- The number of red candies is 54.
- The number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies, so:
  \[
  \text{Number of orange candies} = 2 \times 54 = 108
  \]
- The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies, so:
  \[
  \text{Number of yellow candies} = \frac{54}{2} = 27
  \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies:
\[
\text{Total of red, orange, and yellow candies} = 54 + 108 + 27 = 189
\]

Given that the total number of individually wrapped candies in the bag is 232, we can find the number of pink candies by subtracting the total of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36 seeds, we calculate:

\[ 0.50 \times 36 = 18 \text{ seeds} \]

Adding this to the original 36 seeds gives the number of seeds in a large sunflower:

\[ 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds} \]

Now, to find the total number of seeds in both a small and a large sunflower, we add the seeds from both:

\[ 36 + 54 = 90 \text{ seeds} \]

So, the total number of sunflower seeds altogether is:

\[ 90 \]"
"First, we need to determine how many pens Timothy has. Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, and George has 18 pens, we can calculate the number of pens Timothy has as follows:

\[ \text{Timothy's pens} = 3 \times \text{George's pens} = 3 \times 18 = 54 \]

Next, we need to find out how many pens Sarah has. Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, so we can calculate the number of pens Sarah has as follows:

\[ \text{Sarah's pens} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Timothy's pens} = \frac{1}{2} \times 54 = 27 \]

Therefore, the number of pens Sarah has is 27."
"First, let's determine Anne's height. Since Albert is 36"" tall and Anne is twice as tall as Albert, we can calculate Anne's height as follows:

\[ \text{Anne's height} = 2 \times \text{Albert's height} = 2 \times 36 = 72 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we know that Jackie is now 2 inches shorter than Anne. Therefore, Jackie's current height is:

\[ \text{Jackie's current height} = \text{Anne's height} - 2 = 72 - 2 = 70 \text{ inches} \]

Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer to reach her current height. To find her height before summer, we subtract the growth from her current height:

\[ \text{Jackie's height before summer} = \text{Jackie's current height} - \text{growth} = 70 - 3 = 67 \text{ inches} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 67 \]"
"To determine how much money the company will receive for selling the chocolate bars during two weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of bars produced in two weeks.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling these bars.

First, let's find out how many bars are produced in two weeks. Since the company produces 5000 bars per day, in two weeks (which is 14 days), the number of bars produced is:
\[ 5000 \text{ bars/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 70000 \text{ bars} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling these bars. If each bar is sold for $2, the total revenue is:
\[ 70000 \text{ bars} \times 2 \text{ dollars/bar} = 140000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the company will receive $140000 for selling the produced chocolate bars during two weeks."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts with the buy one get one 50% off deal.

The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, he gets the second T-shirt at 50% off.

The cost of the first T-shirt is $8.
The cost of the second T-shirt at 50% off is $8 * 0.5 = $4.

So, the total cost for the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes after the 40% discount.

The original price of the shoes is $40. A 40% discount means Jake pays 60% of the original price.

The discounted price of the shoes is $40 * 0.6 = $24.

Finally, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends.

Total amount spent = Cost of T-shirts + Cost of shoes = $12 + $24 = $36.

The final numerical answer is:
36"
"First, let's calculate Ryan's total allowance for the 3 weeks he completed his chores:
\[ \text{Ryan's allowance} = 6 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 3 \, \text{weeks} = 18 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the ice cream cones. Ryan bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends, so a total of 4 ice cream cones:
\[ \text{Cost of ice cream cones} = 4 \times 1.25 \, \text{dollars} = 5 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, let's subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from Ryan's total allowance to find out how much money he has left:
\[ \text{Money left} = 18 \, \text{dollars} - 5 \, \text{dollars} = 13 \, \text{dollars} \]

Finally, let's determine how many movie tickets Ryan can buy with the remaining money. Each movie ticket costs $6.50:
\[ \text{Number of movie tickets} = \left\lfloor \frac{13 \, \text{dollars}}{6.50 \, \text{dollars/ticket}} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 2 \right\rfloor = 2 \]

So, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets."
"First, let's calculate how much Ellen spent:
- Leggings: $100
- Photo frame: $5
Total amount Ellen spent = $100 + $5 = $105

Next, let's calculate how much Lani spent:
- Sunglasses: $30
- Two bathrobes: $100 * 2 = $200
Total amount Lani spent = $30 + $200 = $230

Now, let's add the amounts spent by Ellen and Lani to find the total amount spent:
Total amount spent = $105 + $230 = $335

The final numerical answer is $335."
"To calculate Tim's profit from selling 10 jars of the honey and jam mix, we need to first determine the cost of ingredients for one jar and then calculate the total cost for 10 jars. After that, we'll subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

1. **Cost of ingredients for one jar:**
   - Passion fruit: 2 pounds at $6 per pound = 2 * $6 = $12
   - Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds at $8 per pound = 1.5 * $8 = $12
   - Honey: 2 pounds at $10 per pound = 2 * $10 = $20

2. **Total cost for one jar:**
   - Total cost = Cost of passion fruit + Cost of jackfruit + Cost of honey
   - Total cost = $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

3. **Total cost for 10 jars:**
   - Total cost for 10 jars = 10 * $44 = $440

4. **Revenue from selling 10 jars:**
   - Revenue = 10 jars * $50 per jar = $500

5. **Profit:**
   - Profit = Revenue - Total cost
   - Profit = $500 - $440 = $60

Therefore, Tim's profit from selling 10 jars is $60."
"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin separately and then sum these values.

- Quarters: 32 quarters * $0.25/quarter = $8.00
- Dimes: 95 dimes * $0.10/dime = $9.50
- Nickels: 120 nickels * $0.05/nickel = $6.00
- Pennies: 750 pennies * $0.01/penny = $7.50

Now, we sum these values to get the total dollar amount:

Total = $8.00 + $9.50 + $6.00 + $7.50 = $31.00

The total dollar amount in the jar is $31.00."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janet spent:

- Ice cream: $3.50
- Movie tickets: $7.50 each, so for two tickets: $7.50 * 2 = $15.00
- Bracelet: $8.50

Now, let's add these amounts together:

Total spent = $3.50 + $15.00 + $8.50 = $27.00

Janet's parents gave her $40.00. To find out how much she has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the amount given by her parents:

Amount left = $40.00 - $27.00 = $13.00

So, the final numerical answer is $13.00."
"To calculate Josh's earnings in 2 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of days Josh works in a week.
2. Calculate the number of cars he services in a week.
3. Calculate his weekly earnings.
4. Calculate his earnings for 2 weeks.

Josh works from Monday to Saturday, excluding Sunday and Wednesday. This means he works 5 days a week.

He services 3 cars a day, so in a week, he services:
\[ 3 \text{ cars/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 15 \text{ cars/week} \]

He gets paid $4 per car, so his weekly earnings are:
\[ 15 \text{ cars/week} \times 4 \text{ dollars/car} = 60 \text{ dollars/week} \]

For 2 weeks, his earnings would be:
\[ 60 \text{ dollars/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"Randy initially has:
- 9 oatmeal cookies
- 4 chocolate chip cookies
- 5 sugar cookies

He ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor:
- 1 oatmeal cookie
- 1 chocolate chip cookie
- 1 sugar cookie

After eating 3 cookies, he has:
- 9 - 1 = 8 oatmeal cookies
- 4 - 1 = 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 5 - 1 = 4 sugar cookies

For lunch, he ate 2 oatmeal cookies:
- 8 - 2 = 6 oatmeal cookies

He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends:
- 4 - 2 = 2 sugar cookies

After these actions, he has:
- 6 oatmeal cookies
- 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 2 sugar cookies

Then, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner:
- 6 + 4 = 10 oatmeal cookies
- 3 + 4 = 7 chocolate chip cookies
- 2 + 4 = 6 sugar cookies

In total, after all these actions, Randy has:
- 10 oatmeal cookies
- 7 chocolate chip cookies
- 6 sugar cookies

Adding these together, the total number of cookies he has now is:

"To calculate the total money Matthew would earn, we need to break down the collection into two halves and calculate the earnings from each half separately.

Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers, so each half would consist of 6 toy soldiers.

For the first half (6 toy soldiers) at $5 each:
\[ 6 \text{ soldiers} \times \$5/\text{soldier} = \$30 \]

For the second half (6 toy soldiers) at $7 each:
\[ 6 \text{ soldiers} \times \$7/\text{soldier} = \$42 \]

Now, we add the earnings from both halves to find the total amount Matthew would earn:
\[ \$30 + \$42 = \$72 \]

So, Matthew would earn $72 if he agrees to the offer."
"First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate returns, the dog continues to dig 6 holes a day, but Nate starts filling in 9 holes a day. The net effect is that 3 holes are filled each day (since 9 holes are filled minus 6 holes are dug):

\[ 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/day} = 3 \text{ holes/day filled} \]

Now, we need to determine how many days it will take to fill in all 84 holes. Since 3 holes are filled each day, the number of days required to fill in all the holes is:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

To find out how many weeks it takes, we divide the number of days by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes."
"First, we need to find the average enrollment at Butler High School. Since Butler High School enrolls an average of \( \frac{3}{4} \) as many students as Norman High School, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Butler High School enrollment} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 \]

Let's calculate this value.
```python
# Calculation for Butler High School enrollment
butler_enrollment = (3/4) * 4000
butler_enrollment
```
```output
3000.0
```
The average enrollment at Butler High School is 3000 students.

Next, we need to find how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School. We do this by subtracting the Butler High School enrollment from the Norman High School enrollment:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Norman High School enrollment} - \text{Butler High School enrollment} \]

Let's calculate this difference.
```python
# Calculation for the difference in enrollment
difference = 4000 - butler_enrollment
difference
```
```output
NameError: name 'butler_enrollment' is not defined
```
It seems there was an issue with the variable reference. Let me re-calculate the difference directly using the previously determined values.

The average enrollment at Norman High School is 4000 students, and the average enrollment at Butler High School is 3000 students. Therefore, the difference is:

\[ \text{Difference} = 4000 - 3000 \]

Let's calculate this.
```python
# Recalculating the difference directly
difference = 4000 - 3000
difference
```
```output
NameError: name 'difference' is not defined

Total cookies made = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies - (Rainbow cookies + Oatmeal cookies)

Let's calculate:
Chocolate chip cookies = 7995 - (2595 + 3075)
Chocolate chip cookies = 7995 - 5670
Chocolate chip cookies = 2325

So, the number of chocolate chip cookies made is 2325."
"First, let's determine the number of each item Igor gathered by accident:

- Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many:
  \[
  \frac{16}{2} = 8 \text{ test tubes}

- Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes, but Igor gathered two more than requested:
  \[
  14 + 2 = 16 \text{ Petri dishes}
  \]

- Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, and Igor gathered the correct number:
  \[
  7 \text{ beakers}
  \]

Next, we calculate the total number of items Igor gathered:
\[
8 \text{ test tubes} + 16 \text{ Petri dishes} + 7 \text{ beakers} = 31 \text{ items}
\]

We know that Igor placed a total of 29 items on the lab bench. Therefore, the number of beakers Igor lost is:

"First, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for all the tables.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. Therefore, each table requires:
\[ 4 \text{ legs/table} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 8 \text{ screws/table} \]

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws/table} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the number of screws he has:

So, the number of screws James will have left over is:
\[ 8 \]"
"To solve this problem, we start by identifying the number of eggs in each basket. We know there are 10 eggs in the first basket. The second basket has twice as many eggs as the first basket, so we calculate the number of eggs in the second basket as follows:

\[ \text{Number of eggs in the second basket} = 2 \times \text{Number of eggs in the first basket} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \]

Next, we add the number of eggs in both baskets to find the total number of eggs:

\[ \text{Total number of eggs} = \text{Number of eggs in the first basket} + \text{Number of eggs in the second basket} = 10 + 20 = 30 \]

Therefore, the total number of eggs in both baskets put together is 30."
"First, let's determine how much money each person raised individually.

Alexandra raised $430.

Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so:
\[ \text{Kim's amount} = 430 + 320 = 750 \]

Next, we need to find out how much Sarah raised. We know that Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, and Sarah raised $300, so:
\[ \text{Maryam's amount} = 300 + 400 = 700 \]

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money raised by adding the amounts raised by each person:
\[ \text{Total amount} = \text{Alexandra's amount} + \text{Kim's amount} + \text{Sarah's amount} + \text{Maryam's amount} \]
\[ \text{Total amount} = 430 + 750 + 300 + 700 \]

Adding these amounts together:
\[ 430 + 750 = 1180 \]
\[ 1180 + 300 = 1480 \]
\[ 1480 + 700 = 2180 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money raised by the girls is:
\[ 2180 \]

"Let's denote the speed of Aaron as \( A \) miles per minute and the speed of Vanessa as \( V \) miles per minute. According to the problem, Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, so we have:

\[ A = 2V \]

Vanessa ran 4 miles, and Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since Aaron's speed is \( A \) miles per minute, the distance he ran can be calculated as:

\[ \text{Distance Aaron ran} = \frac{\text{Time Aaron took}}{\text{Aaron's speed}} = \frac{16 \text{ minutes}}{A} \]

Given that Aaron's speed \( A = 2V \), we can substitute \( A \) in the equation:

\[ \text{Distance Aaron ran} = \frac{16}{2V} = \frac{8}{V} \]

According to the problem, the distance Aaron ran is the same as the distance Vanessa ran, which is 4 miles. Therefore:

\[ \frac{8}{V} = 4 \]

Solving for \( V \):

\[ 8 = 4V \]
\[ V = 2 \text{ miles per minute} \]

Now, we need to find out how long Vanessa took to run 4 miles. Since her speed is 2 miles per minute, the time \( T \) she took to run 4 miles is:

\[ T = \frac{\text{Distance Vanessa ran}}{\text{Vanessa's speed}} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per minute}} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Vanessa took 2 minutes to complete her part of the race. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Next, we need to determine how much more line he needs to buy. He currently has 6 feet of new line, so the additional line required is:

\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

2. **Calculate the total cost per night:**
   - They get 6 reservations per night.
   - Total cost per night = 6 reservations * $15/reservation = $90.

3. **Calculate the total cost per week:**
   - They are open 2 days a week.
   - Total cost per week = 2 days * $90/day = $180.

Therefore, the total amount they make in a week is $180."
"First, we need to calculate the total selling price of the watermelons. The vendor made a 25% profit on the cost price. The cost price for 50 watermelons is $80.

To find the total selling price, we calculate the profit and add it to the cost price. The profit is 25% of $80.

\[ \text{Profit} = 0.25 \times 80 = 20 \]

So, the total selling price is:

\[ \text{Total Selling Price} = \text{Cost Price} + \text{Profit} = 80 + 20 = 100 \]

The vendor sold all 50 watermelons for a total of $100. To find the selling price per watermelon, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons.

\[ \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{100}{50} = 2 \]

So, each watermelon was sold for $2."
"First, let's determine James's current age. We know that James is now twice as old as his sister Dora, and Dora will turn 12 in 3 years. Therefore, Dora is currently 9 years old. Since James is twice as old as Dora, James is currently 18 years old.

Next, we need to find out how old John is now. We know that when John had James, he was 19 years old, and James is currently 18 years old. Therefore, John is currently 19 + 18 = 37 years old.

Now, we need to determine the age of John's youngest son. The youngest son was born when John was 32 years old. Since John is currently 37 years old, the youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, the youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

The final numerical answer is 8."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many oranges each person can peel in one hour and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate how many oranges Ana can peel in one hour:
- Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in one hour.
- Number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour = 60 minutes / 3 minutes/orange = 20 oranges.

Next, let's calculate how many oranges Jane can peel in one hour:
- Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in one hour.
- Number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour = 60 minutes / 4 minutes/orange = 15 oranges.

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane in one hour:
- Difference = Number of oranges peeled by Ana - Number of oranges peeled by Jane = 20 oranges - 15 oranges = 5 oranges.

So, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400, and he gets it at 80% off.

\[ \text{Discounted cost of radiator} = 400 \times (1 - 0.80) = 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of hiring the mechanic. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.

\[ \text{Cost of hiring the mechanic} = 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator after the discount to the cost of hiring the mechanic.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, the total amount Mark paid is:

\[ \boxed{230} \]"
"Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( K \).

We know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

From the first piece of information, we can write the equation:
\[ C + K = 20 \]

From the second piece of information, we know that chickens have 2 legs each and cows have 4 legs each, so we can write the equation:
\[ 2C + 4K = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

To solve this system, we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ C + 2K - C - K = 15 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 20 - 15 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is 5.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to divide the total number of slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends, which makes a total of 4 people. We can find out how many slices each person gets by dividing the total number of slices by the number of people:

\[ \frac{56 \text{ slices}}{4 \text{ people}} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

So, each of them can have 14 slices. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 14 \]"
